2,Mr ALBANESE,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I move: That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent order of the day No. 6, private members' business, relating to the Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2005, being called on forthwith to provide the House with an immediate chance to debate and vote on the bill in the light of the following rea- Bishop, J.I. sons: (1) the fact that the Kyoto Protocol comes into effect today after being ratified by 140 coun- Draper, P. tries and the European Union; (2) climate change is the number one environmental challenge facing the global community; (3) Australia is restricted from the economic opportunities arising from the global carbon trading market; (4) Australia will not be able to benefit from clean development mechanism provisions contained in the Protocol which are designed to encourage renewable energy projects in developing countries; (5) as Australia is on track to meet our Kyoto target of 108% of 1990 emissions by 2012, there is no reason for Australia to remain outside the international framework; (6) Australia's ability to influence post Kyoto agreements will be undermined by our isolationist position; (7) international security is advanced through agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol which promote a common purpose; and (8) climate change is the ultimate intergenerational issue. Our response will be central in determining the quality of life of our children Wakelin, B.H. and grandchildren.

Second Reading",18
4,Mr TRUSS,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005 will give effect to amendments that aim to improve the effectiveness and administration of the Australian government's Farm Help program and to further ensure that it reaches low-income farmers most in need of assistance. The purpose of the bill is to reinforce the structural adjustment focus of the Farm Help Supporting Families Through Change program. It seeks to clarify the qualification provisions for entry to the Farm Help program, and to enable ongoing communication with Farm Help Re-establishment Grant recipients to confirm that recipients meet their undertakings not to re-enter farming and to notify of a change of address. Program achievements to date The assistance provided through Farm Help is flexible and can be tailored to meet the needs of each farm family. The program provides up to 12 months income support at the newstart allowance rate; a grant of up to $5,500 for professional advice and training; the development of an activity plan customised to each farm family's situation; establishment grant of up to $50,000 for people who decide to leave farming and sell the farm. Applications for the Farm Help program close on 30 June 2007. Farm Help has a long record of achievement. Since the program commenced on 1 December 1997, over 9,000 farmers have received Farm Help income support, almost 8,000 farmers have taken up advice and training sessions and over 1,000 farmers have received re-establishment assistance. To date, the Australian government has expended an estimated $178 million on the Farm Help program, with an estimated $8.7 million in the current financial year-a positive commitment to strengthening the resilience of rural and regional Australia. The following changes will be reflected in the Farm Household Support Act 1992 and in the act's disallowable instruments, the Farm Help Advice and Training Scheme 1997 and the Farm Help Re-establishment Grant Scheme 1997: - Amending the definition of farmer To ensure that the Farm Help program and the exceptional circumstances relief payment are consistent in their definition of farmer, the definition will be amended to ‘a person who has a right or interest in the land used for the purposes of a farm enterprise'. The distinction between the target groups for the two programs is then made in the specific qualification provisions for each program. This amendment will not affect the eligibility criteria for a person applying for the exceptional circumstances relief payment. To avoid any impact of the changed definition on the exceptional circumstances relief payment, the elements of the definition of farmer will be moved from the general definition in the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to the more specific qualification provisions for the exceptional circumstances and a rerelief payment. - Clarifying the qualification requirements for Farm Help For the purposes of Farm Help, a farmer is currently defined under the act as a person who has a right or interest in the land used for the purposes of the farm enterprise; contributes a significant part of his or her labour and capital to the farm enterprise; and derives a significant part of his or her income from the farm enterprise. However, this does not clearly state what ‘significant' is, which is necessary to provide clarity to all parties, including applicants, decision makers, courts and tribunals. A new qualification provision for the Farm Help program will define ‘significant' for the purposes of Farm Help-that is, for a continuous period of at least two years immediately before they apply for entry to the Farm Help program, the applicant has been a farmer; and has derived more than 50 per cent of his or her gross income from the farm enterprise; and has contributed more than 50 per cent of his or her capital on the farm enterprise; and has spent more than 50 per cent of his or her working hours in work on the farm enterprise. I want to ensure that the revised income test does not prevent a low-income farmer from accessing the program if they experience a serious event outside their control. For example, a person may be unable to satisfy the income test because during the twoyear period the person has experienced a flood, drought, bushfire or some other natural disaster; an unforseen extreme variation in seasonal norms; a market collapse; or serious illness or disability. Accordingly, a person will be considered a ‘full-time farmer' if they can demonstrate that they meet these circumstances and satisfy other qualification criteria. - Review of re-establishment grant recipients The other amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 will enable reviews to be conducted of re-establishment grant recipients, to confirm they are complying with their undertakings not to re-enter farming within five years of receiving the re-establishment grant and to notify of a change in address. Provisions have been developed which enable the Australian government to apply a penalty to a person who fails to advise that they have re-entered farming, and to apply a penalty to those who fail to advise of their change of address, all within five years of receiving the grant. These provisions will not be retrospective. - Conclusion The government remains committed to the development of self-reliant, competitive and sustainable rural industries. Passage of this bill will clarify the qualification of farmers for the Farm Help program, ensuring that assistance goes to low-income farmers most in need. It will also ensure that re-establishment grants are being used for the purposes intended-to provide assistance to persons in severe financial difficulty to leave farming should they choose to do so. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA",20
5,Mr HUNT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (9.27 a.m.)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2005). The tariff proposal that I have just tabled contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the tariff). This proposal amends the rates of customs duty applicable to alcohol and tobacco products that are US originating goods, as specified in new schedule 5 to the tariff. Rates of duty for alcohol and tobacco products are subject to adjustment, in February and August of each year, in line with the consumer price index or CPI. Since the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004 was introduced into the parliament before the August 2004 CPI increase and schedule 5 to the tariff commenced after that increase-that is, on 1 January 2005-the rates of duty for those US originating goods were not increased in line with the August 2004 CPI. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2004) was tabled in the House of Representatives on 1 December 2004 to impose the August 2004 CPI increase to the alcohol and tobacco products in schedule 5 of the tariff. This posal took effect on 1 January 2005 immediately after the commencement of the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Act 2004 and ensured that the rates of duty for alcohol and tobacco products in schedule 5 of the tariff were consistent with duty rates for the same goods that are not US originating goods. On 25 January 2005 the CPI figures for the December 2004 quarter were announced, requiring a further increase in duty rates for alcohol and tobacco products with effect from 1 February 2005. Customs Tariff Notice No. 1 (2005) was published in Special Commonwealth Gazette S21 on 31 January 2005 giving notice that a customs tariff alteration would be proposed in the parliament which would increase, from 1 February, the rates for alcohol and tobacco products that are US originating goods in accordance with the new CPI. The alterations contained in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2005) ensure that rates of duty on those alcohol and tobacco products are consistent with duty rates for the same goods that are not US originating goods, and accord with the terms of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. A summary of the alterations contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. DEFENCE AMENDMENT BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 February, on motion by Mrs De-Anne Kelly: That the bill be now read a second time.",21
6,Mr BEVIS,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The Defence Amendment Bill 2005 deals with the regime for testing for drugs and other proprohibited substances in the Australian Defence Force. At the outset I would like to acknowledge and thank the minister for arranging a briefing for me and my staff concerning some of the detail of this bill. I also extend the thanks of the shadow minister for defence, Robert MCClelland, and his staff who participated in that briefing. We appreciated that opportunity to receive details of the provisions of the bill. Labor has long held the view that the Defence Force should be free of substance abuse. I made that point not that long ago, following the last election, when there was an incident at Duntroon. I issued a press statement at the time, headed ‘ALP supports tough drugs stand at Duntroon', saying: There is no place for drug-taking in the military. I also noted: ... the Army has shown that only the highest standards are acceptable. It is clearly a matter of concern for those in the military that they participate in activities alongside other military personnel who are free of substance abuse. I should also say at the outset that this should not be exaggerated into a belief that there is widespread problem of abuse within the military-that is not the case. Indeed, the statistics demonstrate that, in the same age cohort, use in the military is much lower than in the wider civilian community. Nonetheless, I am sure it is apparent to all that substance abuse is potentially dangerous in any walk of life; in the military it is not only potentially dangerous to the individual but also to those around them, both in uniform and in the broader community. In her second reading speech introducing the bill, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs gave some background to the reasons for the appearance of this bill. I want to briefly quote from the minister's speech. She said: ... limitations under the legislative drug-testing program were a major reason why a command initiated program of drug testing was implemented. This program was used for drug testing until September last year, when a Defence Force magistrate's finding was made that there is no scope for such testing outside part VIIIA of the Defence Act. The command initiated program has therefore been temporarily suspended whilst changes to part VIIIA have been pursued to ensure that the legislation better reflects Defence Force policy regarding drug use. I would have to say that is accurate but somewhat incomplete. The actual background to this goes back some time prior to that. In fact, on 17 September 2002 the then assistant defence minister, Danna Vale, promised to introduce regulations for random drug testing of defence personnel. That did not occur. Indeed, more than two years later nothing had appeared from the government to honour that commitment that the then assistant defence minister gave in September 2002. It was because of that inaction on the part of the government that the government was confronted with a magistrate's decision that dismissed a drugs charge against an officer after a ruling that the Army's urinalysis testing was unlawful. Defence Minister Robert Hill confirmed in the Senate on 7 December last year that the government's failure to introduce the new regulations had resulted in the magistrate dismissing the charges against the officer. However, it is worth noting the way Senator Hill did that. In answer to a question in the Senate, he said: The magistrate found that the method adopted to require the taking of these tests was, and I am paraphrasing, ‘inconsistent with part 8A', I think, ‘of the Defence Act'. He went on to say: It is true that Defence decided to bring in this system through command rather than through legislative prescription. Advice has been sought on the consequence of the ruling of that particular Defence Force magistrate, and the government is considering advice on this issue at the moment. In typical Howard government fashion, having failed to do what it said in 2002 it would do and then being confronted with the problems of its own inaction, Senator Hill decided last year in the Senate to blame the Defence Force. There was no responsibility on the part of the government; no responsibility in his office as Minister for Defence; no responsibility on the part of the former assistant minister-who I am pleased to see is in the chamber-who in September 2002 said regulations would be introduced, though they never were. There was no accountability by anybody with ministerial responsibility. In the Senate, Senator Hill blamed the defence department and the men and women in uniform because of this government's bungling. That is so typical of the approach this government has displayed whenever it gets caught with its fingers in the cookie jar. It is always someone else's responsibility. Plausible deniability: ministers get insulated from knowledge that they either have or should have but which cannot be proved. Well, on this occasion it can be proved-because the assistant defence minister, on 17 September 2002, gave that commitment of behalf of the government to introduce the regulations, and it did not occur. Rather than acknowledge that error, the big man that he is, Senator Hill decided he would blame someone else, so he blamed our defence personnel. I think that was a reprehensible action on the part of the minister who, at the end of the day, is indeed responsible for what happens in the defence department. But on this occasion it was not even the defence department's responsibility; it was the government's and the minister's, and he ducked for cover and tried to shift the blame. I think that is reprehensible. Let me move to the provisions of this bill which now address those concerns that were identified in 2002 but unfortunately were not acted on legislatively. The bill is designed clarify and strengthen the drug testing procedures within the defence forces. The objective, which we clearly support on this side of the House, is a drug-free Defence Force. The bill is intended to provide benefits to the health and safety of the individuals and the safety of other service personnel, and improved performance and greater operational efficiency. In particular, the bill will expand the range of drugs that may be tested, beyond those narcotic substances currently included, to include other prohibited substances. The bill will authorise the Chief of the Defence Force, by legislative instrument, to determine that a substance is a prohibited substance. I understand that that will be a disallowable instrument, and I think that is an appropriate mechanism. It affords the Chief of the Defence Force the scope to take into account substances that may not necessarily be prohibited substances but whose use may be inappropriate for defence personnel. The bill will also broaden testing, beyond ADF members undertaking combat duties or combat related duties, to include all defence members and defence civilians. Defence civilians constitute a small group, accompanying a part of the ADF on deployment, who have consented to subject themselves to Defence Force discipline. My past experience in this portfolio leads me to think that many of those defence civilians have previously been in uniform. In any event, they knowingly agree to these arrangements in advance. It also allows the Chief of the Defence Force, or an officer delegated by him, to make provisions for testing by means other than urinalysis. That is an appropriate thing as new tests become available and as some drugs are not easily identified by urinalysis. Indeed, some drugs have a very short time-frame in which they will show up in urinalysis, whereas other tests will provide a more comprehensive assessment of whether or not to drugs have been used or are present in the body. It also clarifies the power to terminate employment after the return of a confirmed positive test and clarifies the power to take other administrative actions. The bill enables the details of the drug testing regime to be set out in Defence instructions, thereby, I suspect, overcoming one of the core concerns of the Defence Force magistrate, to which I earlier referred. In line with the bill and current practices, a prohibited substance test must be conducted in circumstances affording reasonable privacy to the person being tested. In dealing with these matters, it is important not just for the broader community but in this case specifically for those in uniform to recognise the rights of the individuals concerned. When we place these added responsibilities on those in uniform we should also ensure that they are afforded appropriate individual rights and respected. I am satisfied that the processes provide privacy. They also provide an opportunity for a number of other safeguards. Before a sample is provided, a person required to undergo a prohibited substance test must be given written notice explaining such matters relating to the dealing of the sample as are specified in the defence instructions. I anticipate and expect that that would include an explanation of what is to follow-what that individual's rights are during the course of the processes and what the consequences may be, depending on the outcome of the test. A person found with a positive test result is to be given 28 days to provide a written statement of why his or her employment should not be terminated. Importantly, a person so accused can have the second sample-which is collected at the same time as the first sample-sent for analysis, and those results can form part of the statement of reasons. I understand from advice given at the briefing that the person against whom the allegation is made will have the opportunity to choose where that second test is analysed from among a number of accredited testing authorities. I think that affords an appropriate level of rights to the individual. It also accords with my understanding of the broader practices of drug testing regimes in a number of major sports. I think it is particularly important to also ensure that the privacy of these matters is respected. That is important for all personnel; it has a particular ramification, though, for reserves. Reserves usually have a civilian employer as well as the Defence Force. It would be an unacceptable case of double jeopardy if a compulsory test in the military were not only to result in action relating to their engagement as an ADF officer but also cause problems for their civilian employment. I am satisfied with the responses I have received from the minister's office and the department that those issues have been addressed, but I want to record them here in this debate. The information collected under the legislation is protected from disclosure to third parties under the Privacy Act 1988. With particular reference to disclosing the results of a test to a civilian employer of a Reserve member of the Defence Force, it is noted that disclosure of such information would be very unlikely to come within any of the exemption provisions in the Privacy Act. The bill proposes no changes to the current privacy requirements, noting that there has been no criticism of and no identified problems with the current situation in relation to the protection of personal information. Those assurances I have received are reasonable in the circumstances, but I do want to place my concerns on record in this debate to ensure that those practices continue into the future. As I said, I would not want to see a situation of double jeopardy unfold for a reservist whereby, if they return a positive test, they may find themselves disciplined within the military and, were that information to be more widely distributed, they may find their civilian employment jeopardised as well. So I am pleased that those assurances have been provided. There is one other related issue that I also want to mention in this debate. Australia has a comparatively small number of people in uniform who are on exchange with different forces around the world. This is not a large issue in terms of numbers, but nonetheless I think it is worth mentioning. Not all defence forces share Australia's view about the use of what would otherwise be unlawful substances. I have previously raised in this parliament my concern about the practice of the United States Air Force of providing its pilots with amphetamines-speed pills. I asked questions in the last parliament of the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence about this on 27 November 2003. In the answers I was assured that ADF pilots overseas are aware that amphetamines are not listed on the approved list of drugs, but I am not quite sure whether anything is done to ensure that Australians who serve on exchange with the United States Air Force have this information clearly put before them or whether there is any process or protocols with the United States Air Force to make sure that United States Air Force management know that this is a requirement that we have and that therefore Australian pilots on exchange with the US Air Force are not obliged, encouraged or pressured to take the same amphetamines that USAF pilots take. I was also concerned at the time to raise the question of United States Air Force, Navy or Marine Corps pilots operating US military aircraft in Australia. We have a number of joint exercises on a pretty regular basis, and aircraft transit our airspace and often use our bases for refuelling and other purposes. I asked the minister at that time what action he had taken to ensure that these pilots were not using amphetamines. The minister's answer to my question No. 2800 was: none. That is, the government has taken no action whatsoever to even communicate with the United States Air Force about whether their pilots here are using amphetamines, even though we know that it is standard practice for the United States Air Force to supply them. I regard that answer as completely unsatisfactory, and frankly it is inconsistent with the government's stated policy in this bill. We quite rightly expect a high standard from those in uniform and when it comes to issues of substance abuse we impose on people in the Australian Defence Force a higher standard than is applicable to the general community. But when it comes to overseas pilots-in this case, United States Air Force pilots-we make no inquiry. We do nothing to prevent their pilots using these amphetamines. This is not just a passing triviality. The of amphetamines by USAF pilots has been the subject of some legal cases in the United States. We all know of incidents of friendly fire, where US pilots have inadvertently killed their own troops or allied troops. One notable case has arisen from an incident in Afghanistan. In that case two US pilots are in the process of being court-martialled because they mistakenly bombed a Canadian military group and killed four Canadian soldiers. As part of the court case the pilots have, in their defence, said, ‘We were pumped up with amphetamines; we were on the edge of our nerves and we ended up doing the wrong thing.' That worries me. What the American pilots want to do with their policies is a matter for the Americans, but what any country wants to do when it flies combat aircraft around Australia is our business. And the government's official answer to me in 2003 was: we do nothing about that. Well, I think it is time the government took that issue on board. I think it is time, in the many dialogues we have with our close friends in the United States, to say, ‘This is the requirement we have on our troops with respect to substance abuse, and we require undertakings of the same standard for troops from anywhere who are exercising here in Australia.' I think that is a simple and fair proposition and for the life of me I do not understand why the government's official position is: we do not want to do a thing about it. It is of more than passing interest within the debates around the United States Defence Force. For example, the United States Navy's official guides for flight surgeons, Performance Maintenance During Continuous Flight Operations, says an intermittent low dose of amphetamines or ‘go pills': ... has the capability of maintaining aviator performance yet avoiding undesired medication effects. use The problem with that is that the drug manufacturers who supply the very drugs that the USAF hand out say something else. The people who make the drug say: Amphetamines may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or vehicles; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. The manufacturers of these drugs say, ‘Beware of driving a car if you take these pills.' The United States Air Force gives these pills to people and then puts them in the cockpits of combat aircraft. You have to wonder about this when you see some of the friendly fire incidents that have occurred in theatres of war in the last few years. Schools have been bombed, their own troops have been bombed and allied troops have been bombed. I recall that in Iraq a group of US special forces who were protecting a senior Iraqi Kurd leader ended up being bombed as they called in an attack on a Saddam Hussein Iraqi tank that was within range. The pilot mistook their Humvee for the tank. That would be a matter of some concern to anybody. When the manufacturers of these drugs say, ‘Do not drive a car,' but the USAF thinks it is all right to give these pills to people and then put them into a combat aircraft, that bewilders me. But as I said, the United States Air Force and the marines are entitled to whatever policy they wish to adopt. But when we have those people here in Australia surely the Australian standard should be applied. I have raised this issue for, roughly, the last two years in this parliament and hope that the government will take some notice of it. Let me conclude by returning to the specifics of the bill. The bill is supported by the Labor Party. It addresses a problem with the administration of drug testing within the Australian Defence Force. That problem would not have existed had the government acted on its undertaking in 2002 to take action then. Better late than never, and this bill does address that concern while ensuring the proper protection of the individual rights of serving men and women. Therefore, we will support the bill in this place and in the Senate.",22
7,Mrs VALE,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Defence Amendment Bill 2005, which I believe demonstrates the Howard government's commitment to developing a more combatfocused, better-equipped, more mobile and operationally ready Australian Defence Force. The purpose of this bill is to amend part VIIIA of the Defence Act to provide a comprehensive prohibited substance testing regime. I acknowledge the support of the opposition in the progress of this bill. The Australian Defence Force has zero tolerance to the abuse or misuse of drugs. Such use can affect morale, discipline and public confidence, and it poses a risk to the operational effectiveness of the Australian Defence Force through the potential to reduce performance, impair health and increase security risks. The creation of an effective prohibited substance testing regime is intended to act as a strong deterrent to prohibited substance abuse, including the misuse of prescription or over-the-counter drugs. Problematic substance use, whether alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs, is an issue for the entire community, and the Australian Defence Force is not immune from this. In fact, given the nature of the Australian Defence Force populationmostly young people who are living away from home-you might be mistaken in thinking that the organisation could be considered more likely to experience these problems than the general community. As a result, the Australian Defence Force has been very active in addressing these issues through the establishment of the Australian Defence Force Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs Service. This service was introduced in May 2002 and it is a major initiative within the mental health strategy that provides the Australian Defence Force with a multilevel response to problematic substance use. It is evidence based, consistent with the National Drug Strategy and informs and supports the Australian Defence Force's administrative response to problematic substance abuse. The Australian Defence Force Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs Service provides education, training, resources and advice to Australian Defence Force members and commanders regarding issues relating to alcohol, tobacco and prohibited substance use. This includes annual information sessions regarding both alcohol and drug policy and testing programs. Therefore, despite its population, the tralian Defence Force has relatively low usage of prohibited drugs in comparison with the use of prohibited drugs in the general population. From February to September last year, 7,637 members were tested. Only 110 of those tested returned confirmed positive test results, representing only 1.44 per cent of those members tested. In comparison, a Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing survey in 2000 reported that 23 per cent of Australians over 14 years of age had used prohibited drugs in the preceding 12 months. On 13 September 2004, a Defence Force magistrate acquitted an officer on the basis that a command given to submit to a drug test was not a lawful command. The Defence Force magistrate held that part VIIIA of the Defence Act 1903 is an exclusive code for urinalysis testing. As a consequence, in the view of the Defence Force magistrate there was no scope for command-initiated urinalysis drug testing and this type of drug testing was suspended. To clarify any uncertainty and to provide for changes in drug-testing methods, drug-use patterns and Australian Defence Force structures over the past 10 years, Defence is seeking an amendment to part VIIIA of the Defence Act. Once part VIIIA of the Defence Act is amended, drug testing can recommence, with Australian Defence Force personnel able to be tested anywhere, at any time, for any prohibited substance. However, let it be clear that Defence does not believe that the Defence Force magistrate's finding invalidates any discharge action already taken as a result of the command-initiated testing. So a summary of the problems with the current legislation that need to be rectified includes: (1) testing is limited to members in combat or combatrelated activities; (2) testing is limited to narAuscotic substances as defined in the Customs Act; (3) testing is confined to urinalysis testing only; and (4) in some circumstances there is some doubt as to the ability of the Australian Defence Force to terminate the services of a member testing positive. Therefore, the principal purpose of the amendments to part VIIIA of the Defence Act will be to broaden the circumstances where testing of Defence Force members could be required. This would allow all members of the Australian Defence Force, members of the Reserve on duty and defence civilians-that is, contractors accompanying the Australian Defence Force on operations who agree to be subject to Defence Force discipline-to be tested at any time. The amendment will clarify the power to take action to discharge or terminate the service of any member or to take other administrative action after return of a confirmed positive result. The amendment also makes provision for testing by any means. This allows the Chief of the Defence Force to make a determination allowing new and accredited testing regimes to be used as they are developed. This will provide flexibility in the testing regimes administration and enable it to keep pace with modern developments in drug testing. The bill expands the range of drugs tested. ‘Prohibited substances' is now the term used instead of ‘drugs'. This will allow a wider scope to test beyond narcotic substances and to include steroids, party drugs and other substances as determined by the Chief of the Defence Force. And, finally, this bill makes provisions that allows functions under part VIIIA relating to the testing for prohibited substances to be delegated to senior offices of the Australian Defence Force. Privacy protection for persons being drug tested is also a priority. Under the proposed new section 95 of the Defence Act, testing must be conducted in circumstances affording the persons being tested reasonable privacy. Dealings with the test results are covered by the privacy principles under the Privacy Act 1988. Breaches of the privacy principles could result in disciplinary or administrative action being taken against individual Australian Defence Force or Australian Public Service members. The privacy principles require Defence to ensure that the collection of personal information does not unreasonably intrude upon the person being tested. These principles also include a requirement for Defence to disclose to persons from whom personal information is being collected any intention to pass that information to third persons, before collecting the information. With regard to Reserve personnel-and I note that this was raised by the opposition-Defence has no intention of providing the results of drug tests to the civilian employers of the Reserve members. Defence instructions will be issued in relation to drug-testing procedures, including the protection of personal information. Proposed section 109(1)(h) of the Defence Act provides for Defence instructions to be made in relation to ‘the confidentiality of prohibited substance test results'. Noncompliance with Defence instructions may result in disciplinary action or other sanctions being taken against persons who breach the confidentiality requirements. Defence members serving overseas or with other forces on exchange or similar duties will be liable for testing. While it is yet to be determined how members will be tested, there are several options available. These include that authorised drug testers from any service may test any Australian Defence Force member, including those deployed on operation. If no authorised person is available, a testing team could be sent from Australia. Another alternative would be that a local testing contactor be engaged, provided that the testing is conducted in accordance with Australian standards, or arrangements could be made for the host service to conduct testing on behalf of the Australian Defence Force. Testing would need to be in accordance with Australian standards and testing results would need to be passed directly from the contractor, or the host service, to an Australian Defence Force authority. In cases where a suitable testing laboratory is not available, samples will be returned to Australia for analysis. Also, necessary arrangements will be made to ensure that any member who tests positive is dealt with in accordance with Australian Defence Force policy and not local law. This will require strict confidentiality of test results. If required, arrangements may be put in place to test members from other countries serving in the Australian Defence Force. In such instances, testing results would be processed in accordance with the wishes of the member's parent service. Drug use and testing are sensitive and topical issues. The main aim of the amendments for the Defence Act that I have discussed is to deter illegal use of prohibited substances within the Australian Defence Force. The amendments are also an indication of this government's commitment to ensuring that Australia has a defence force that is efficient and effective in its capacity to defend Australia and its national interests. An important part in all this, though, is that there is a clear public and government expectation that the Australian Defence Force should be drug free. Misuse of drugs poses a significant risk to the operational effectiveness of the Australian Defence Force and has the potential for dire consequences. I will conclude by saying Australia's 52,000 permanent Defence Force personnel and 20,000 Reserve personnel serve around the world with great professionalism, distinction and courage. They serve and protect Australia's national interests while also representing the greatest democracy in the world. Indeed, they are the pride of the nation, and we celebrate their commitment, their integrity and their dedication on behalf of the rest of us.",27
8,Mrs MAY,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"MCPherson) (10.04 a.m.)The Defence Amendment Bill 2005 before the House today will amend part VIIIA of the Defence Act 1903 to provide a more comprehensive regime for the drug testing of members of the Australian Defence Force. It will overcome current limitations in part VIIIA and is considered essential to the operational effectiveness of the Australian Defence Force. The principal purpose of the bill will be to expand the range of drugs that may be tested for beyond those narcotic substances currently provided for under part VIIIA; broaden the circumstances when testing could be required beyond those related to combat and combat related duties; make provision for testing by means other than urinalysis, as new tests and new drugs are developed; clarify the power to terminate after return of a confirmed positive test and the power to take other administration action; and enable details of the drug testing regime to be set out in Defence instructions, issued under section IXA of the act, to allow for flexibility in the regime's administration and enable it to keep pace with modern developments in drugs and drug testing. I fully support this bill and its overall aim to enhance the operational effectiveness of the ADF. There is no doubt in my mind that our ADF is one of the best in the world. They have clearly demonstrated their operational readiness in recent times with their activities in East Timor, in Iraq and, of course, most recently, in those countries affected by natural disasters, such as Indonesia. The stories we have heard of how our Defence personnel have assisted in the aftermath of the tsunami have been nothing short of inspirational. Many personnel gave up time with their families over the Christmas period to assist with the enormous task of helping to clean up, stabilise and rebuild places like Banda Aceh. They are to be highly commended for this work. Of course, our troops in Iraq will never be forgotten for the role they are playing to ensure democracy in that country. Many of the roles we ask our defence forces to undertake are dangerous and not without risk, but I think all Australians can be assured that our troops are combat focused, well equipped and trained, and ready to meet any operational need that may eventuate. The ADF are respected by the international community and, indeed, our own Australian community, and we can all be very proud of the record of the ADF through numerous conflicts and peacekeeping operations over many years. It is because of this great record that the bill before the House today is important. It is essential that the image of the Australian result Defence Force be maintained and not tarnished by any acts of individuals. Members of the ADF must maintain personal standards above that of the general community-they are scrutinised more closely-and those standards must include not using a prohibited substance. There is no doubt that use of a prohibited substance has adverse consequences for morale, discipline and public confidence in the Australian Defence Force and poses a significant risk to the operational effectiveness of the ADF through the potential to reduce performance, impair health and increase security risks. The development of an effective testing regime of ADF members for prohibited substances will, I believe, act as a strong deterrent to prohibited substance abuse, including the misuse of prescription drugs. But this will be a challenge. In order to meet this challenge, this bill extends the scope of the current drug-testing regime of the ADF. Overall, the ADF has a relatively low usage of prohibited drugs. From February to September last year, 7,637 ADF personnel were tested and only 110 returned confirmed positive test results, representing only 1.44 per cent of those tested. These figures certainly attest to the low incidence of prohibited substance abuse in the ADF. It means the Australian community can be assured that the majority of our service personnel are in top physical condition and are combat ready. Some on the other side might raise issues about privacy, or indeed wrongful or unfair dismissal, if an ADF person is found to return a positive test for a banned substance. However, the policy committee on defence and veterans' affairs has been assured that the legislation does not abrogate the right for a member of the ADF to pursue an action for wrongful or unfair dismissal if there is merit to do so. This is an important piece of legislation. is important for all ADF personnel and it is important for the wider community. The legislation is an insurance policy that strengthens the ability of our Defence Force to meet any operational need in the future; it sends a clear message to anyone involved in taking prohibited drugs in the Australian Defence Force that their actions will not be tolerated. I commend the bill to the House.",30
9,Mrs GASH,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Gilmore) (10.09 a.m.)Drug abuse is a cultural problem that confronts many societies of many nations across the world. It is a scourge that costs billions of dollars through law enforcement, rehabilitation, health treatment and social dysfunction. It also costs industry a lot of money in lost production. There is no doubt that this is a social disease of astronomical proportions and, despite all the best intentions, drug abuse is one of Western society's biggest health issues. Being a part of the culture of this society, the military cannot be isolated. It is naive to think that somehow our soldiers, sailors and airmen are immune to social influences. When I saw the Defence Amendment Bill 2005 come before the House, my mind was cast back to the debate surrounding the drug testing of athletes. Drug abuse has been reported since the Greeks started the Olympics in 776 BC. It was then reported that certain substances were ingested by competitors in attempts to gain some ground against fellow competitors. Olympic athletes in ancient Greece were believed to have used herbs and mushrooms in an attempt to improve their athletic performance. However, it was not until the early 19th century that the problem of drug abuse became a great menace to the sport. There were incidents where death ensued following drug abuse. In the late 19th century it was reported that French athletes drank a concoction of cocoa leaves and wine in order to reduce the sensation of fatigue It and hunger. As a result, they were able to withstand strenuous forms of exercise and physical activity. Drug taking has corrupted the ideal of sports. The pressure to win will make athletes do almost anything to find the extra bit that could make the difference. Many techniques are introduced to and employed by athletes in order to gain that extra mileage in their respective fields. These methods are used to increase the effects of drugs and to avoid detection during drug tests. There are parallels between how we perceive our elite athletes and how we perceive our Defence personnel. We feel proud of them and believe they are something special. We want them to succeed on their own merit and we do not want to believe that they too are fallible like the rest of society. Discovering a representative sportsman is using drugs reflects on us-and we do not like it. Discovering a soldier is using drugs is an entirely different emotion. With our proud military history, the thought that our ANZAC heritage has come to this makes us feel repulsed. In practical terms, we have a Defence Force to defend us when the nation is under threat. We would like to believe we can rely on a professional and loyal military to protect us, so when we hear reports of soldiers or servicemen being caught using drugs we feel decidedly uncomfortable, as well we should. But the real impact has to be felt amongst the servicemen themselves. In a tight situation, how can you trust and rely on a known drug user? When it comes to the crunch will they be there for you? I think at this point it is necessary to reinforce the fact that it is not just hard drugs we are talking about; we are also talking about alcohol abuse, abuse of prescription drugs and use of so-called ‘recreational drugs'. In the last category lies the problem. The very term ‘recreational' makes it sound like it is all right. Aldous Huxley wrote: If we could sniff or swallow something that would, for five or six hours each day, solitude as individuals, atone us with our fellows in a glowing exaltation of affection and make life in all its aspects seem not only worth living, but divinely beautiful and significant, and if this heavenly, world-transfiguring drug were of such a kind that we could wake up next morning with a clear head and an undamaged constitution-then, it seems to me, all our problems (and not merely the one small problem of discovering a novel pleasure) would be wholly solved and earth would become paradise. Our servicemen and servicewomen are not immune to the lure of escape or fantasy-or whatever it is that drug use brings. But they also have a responsibility to us and, more importantly, to themselves. Many can exercise that responsibility and not have drug use impact on what they do. But some cannot, and that is why I believe this legislation is so important. In historical terms, our experiences of drug abuse mirror America's, so looking at their experience can be a worthwhile exercise. The Americans have wrestled with the problem of drug abuse since the 1960s, when drugs became fashionable amongst the young. The young were, in fact, the recruiting base for the military, and the leakage of the mores of that society into military culture was obvious. In 1971, a report was released to the United States congress describing a heroin epidemic in the United States military. In June 1971, the United States military announced that they would begin urinalysis of all returning servicemen. The program went into effect in September of that year and the results were favourable: only 4.5 per cent of the soldiers tested positive for heroin. Unlike the civilian population, the military environment is under far greater scrutiny and control. If a serviceman is found using drugs, he can be booted out, thus preserving as much military integrity as possible. Civilians stay civilians, and the response there is to punish, when apprehended, by imposing jail, abolish our fines or other sanctions. At least in the military, we can appeal to the individual's sense of pride and belonging to effect behavioural changes. But, confronted with an entertainment industry that has the capacity to enter people's lives and shape their opinions, mounting a case against drug abuse is difficult. That the American media glamorised the use of hard drugs there is no doubt. A 30 May 1977 Newsweek story on cocaine was later accused of having glamorised the drugs' effects and underestimated their dangers. The story reports: Among hostesses in the smart sets of Los Angeles and New York, a little cocaine, like Dom Perignon and ... caviar, is nowa requirement ... at dinners. Some party givers pass it around along with thehors d'oeuvres... on silver trays ... the user experiences a feeling of potency, of confidence, of energy. To impressionable young minds, drugs were a ticket to that lifestyle, if only as a means of seeking wish fulfilment. The perception was that using these drugs was ‘cool' and trendy. That perception remains today. It is the reason that adolescents begin to smoke: it elevates the perception of their standing in their peer hierarchy. I read recently that the brains of young people are not physiologically developed enough to fully appreciate the concept of risk and responsibility. Apparently, nature addresses this by the early 20s and females come out of it quicker than males. But it remains that this developmental retardation coincides with the recruiting age. I suppose that, in terms of risk perception, physically and psychologically, young people make ideal military recruits. But the downside is that this risk perception also draws them to fast living and the need for stimulation. Drug taking fits that prescription. So I see the only real alternative at this time, in the absence of any other effective intervention, as being to test our servicemen and servicewomen for drug use. It is a step I reluctantly concede because I too would like to believe that our young people are capable of upholding their obligations. But reluctantly I have to concede that this is not the case. This bill seeks to enhance the existing testing regimen and enable provisions for future developments. Like drugs in sport, we have seen ways and means created of subverting the process. Perhaps as a means of deterrence, increasing the possibility of being caught using drugs might stimulate second thoughts before the person reaches for the drug of choice. I hasten to add that this is just one form of intervention we have to rely upon. We will still need to continue to educate young people generally over the dangers of drug use and the downside of that culture-except in the military, where the need is more immediate. Our operational forces are very small and we have a lot of commitments. I would like to think that the team we put on the ground is the best we have and I do not want each private, seaman or airman looking over their shoulder in a war zone wondering whether Fred is going to be there backing them up. It is a fact of military strategy that a wounded soldier uses more resources than a dead one. We need to ensure that if there are any wounded that is not by self-inducement. The enemy are more than willing to accommodate this, so let us not help them harm us. I know this issue is unpalatable, but I applaud the government for being proactive on this. There are some who will argue that it is intrusive, oppressive and undemocratic to put our military under the microscope. But I say that when push comes to shove we will not have the luxury of debating the niceties of civil convention, especially when the bullets start flying. It is important that those who sign a contract with the military are fully aware of their obligations and the expectations we have of them. They have to be set out clearly and precisely, and this bill seeks to do just that. My only concern is that establishing such a testing regime may prove a deterrent to some potential recruits. You might well say that those that are put off by this are better off of the service. But I think there needs to be some focus on selling the benefits of zero tolerance to recruits or at least tempering the sanctions for having a positive result. I would like to reiterate the fact that recruits are drawn from a culture where drug use is common. It may be that we would equally have to consider measures to assist those tempted to simply say no. But, for the most part, I believe the legislation is warranted and I fully support it.",31
10,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"in reply-The Defence Amendment Bill 2005 is an important part of the coalition government's commitment to a more operationally ready Australian Defence Force and to ensuring that the ADF is drug free. That is what the Australian people expect, and that is what the government is certainly seeking to deliver with this legislation. I would like to thank very briefly the members for Brisbane, Hughes, MCPherson and Gilmore for adding to the debate on this important amendment. I will touch on the points that they have made later. I would like to reiterate the purpose of these amendments: to ensure that all members of the ADF, members of the Reserve on duty and defence civilians who are contractors accompanying the ADF on operations and who have agreed to be subject to Defence Force discipline can be tested at any time; to clearly detail the powers for discharge or to terminate the commission of any member testing positive; to allow for testing by any means-this power enables the Chief of the Defence Force to make a disallowable determination allowing new and accredited testing regimes to be used as they are developed; and to expand the range of drugs tested for. ‘Prohibited substances' instead of the term ‘drugs' is now used to facilitate testing beyond the range of narcotic substances and out includes steroids, party drugs and other substances as determined by the Chief of the Defence Force. I am pleased the member for Brisbane touched on the issue of privacy. The privacy principles place appropriate limits on the ability to disclose and on the use of test results. The general rule set out in information privacy principles 10.1 and 11.1 states that ‘an agency may only use personal information', such as the samples from or the results of a drug test, ‘for the particular purpose for which it obtains that information'. It may only disclose such information to the person tested and not to any other person or organisation. We certainly agree that double jeopardy should not occur and believe that the privacy principles in place will ensure that is the case. I would like to touch on other matters that were raised in the debate. The member for Brisbane asked why the previous minister had indicated in 2002 that regulations were to be made. That is certainly the case. At the time, the government believed that that would in fact be the most effective way to proceed. However, as that was being progressed, it became evident that the service chiefs would be more constrained. It was decided to continue a command initiated process. Of course, regrettably, as we found in September last year, a magistrate indicated that that was not allowable under part A. As a result of that, the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, moved very swiftly to ensure that these amendments were made. We have great regard for our defence forces. There is no attempt in any way to blame the Defence Force. It was believed that commandinitiated was the best way to proceed and that the regulations would simply have been tinkering around with something that needed to be substantially changed. We have recognised that and done that now, so I thank the member for Brisbane for raising that issue. The member for Brisbane raised the question of members serving overseas with other forces on exchange or similar duties and asked whether they would be liable for testing. While it has yet to be determined how members will be tested, there are several options being considered. Authorised drug testers from any service may test any ADF member, including those deployed on operations. If no authorised person is available, a testing team might be sent from Australia. A local testing contractor could be engaged, provided that the testing is conducted in accordance with Australian standards. Furthermore, arrangements could be made for the host services to conduct testing on behalf of the ADF. Again, testing would need to be in accordance with Australian standards, and testing results would need to be passed directly from the contractor to ADF. In cases where a suitable testing laboratory was not available, samples would be returned to Australia for analysis. Necessary arrangements would be made to ensure that any member who tested positive was dealt with in accordance with ADF policy and not local law. This would require strict confidentiality of test results. The member for Brisbane also raised the question of other services in Australia, most specifically the United States Air Force. In regard to the US Air Force, we have always found that there have been no difficulties with their performance. The United States are very sensitive to the rules and regulations of the country in which they operate. The member for Brisbane would also be aware that, for joint exercises in Australia, there is a status of forces agreement, SOFA, that generally covers the range of issues which facilitate joint exercises with any ally. In closing, I again thank all of those who have contributed to this very useful debate on urinalysis testing in the Australian defence forces. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",34
11,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"by leave-I move: That the bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA (TRANSITION CARE AND ASSETS TESTING) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 February, on motion by Ms Julie Bishop: That the bill be now read a second time.",35
12,Ms GILLARD,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"Lalor) (10.26 a.m.)Today is a good day to be debating in the House matters related to health and aged care because today, of course, is the day on which the Howard government's political spin about health has finally caught it out. In the last 24 hours, we have had three significant events happen in the area of health. The first, of course, has been the focus on dental care and Minister Abbott's frank admission that there is a major problem with dental care and that the Keating government's Commonwealth dental program was effective and did make a difference to reduce waiting lists-a thing that Minister Abbott admitted yesterday. Of course, it was the Howard government, when coming to office, that abolished the Commonwealth dental program. Since that time, the Howard government has tried to maintain the fiction that this was a program due to expire in the natural effluxion of time. That fiction, of course, is wrong. The savings that the Howard government got from the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program are clearly shown across the forward estimates over the four years, so it is a program that ought to have been ongoing. Minister Abbott as of yesterday admitted that this has lengthened waiting lists for Australians. I think it is good to see the member Throsby in the House when this matter is coming to the attention of the House because, on behalf of her constituents-many of whom are older Australians-she has been raising this issue consistently for people who now face five-, six-, sevenand eight-year waits for dental care. Minister Abbott's solution yesterday, proposed for a 13-year-old boy with a disfiguring dental condition who was probably going to have to wait until he was 18, 19 or 20 for treatment, was to appeal on Sydney radio for a private dentist to come forward and volunteer to do it for free. Ms George-Charity.",35
13,Ms GILLARD,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"That is right: the solution that is being proposed is not government intervention but charity. This washing of hands by the Howard government, and particularly Minister Abbott, on the question of dental care is a disgrace. I think we should take the opportunity today to mark it in this House as a disgrace. It is time that Minister Abbott actually listened to himself and managed to start negotiations with the states about a Commonwealth dental program that would make a difference. One of the things that most perplexes me about the Howard government's attitude to dental care is that across so many areas of policy we see huge interventions from the Howard government in things that historically have been considered the province of states-for example, the technical colleges promised at the last election. The government are always willing to do that if they see a political advantage. But in this area where Commonwealth responsibility is clearly specified in the Constitution the Howard government have done nothing. Even if Minister Abbott's spin about washing his hands and averting his eyes as Australians stay on waiting lists is accepted, there is one area of dental care that this govfor ernment cannot get away from no matter how much it squirms, and that is its responsibility for providing funds to train the appropriate number of dentists, dental therapists and dental hygienists. We know that there is a work force crisis in dentistry across Australia which is affecting our ability to provide public dental care as well as dental care in the private sector. For example, the OECD average for dentists is 56 dentists per 100,000 people. However, in the crisis area of the central west of New South Wales, the number of dentists is only 17.3 per 100,000. That ratio would be identified more with the Third World or developing world than with a First World nation like Australia. It is an incredible shortage. At places like Sydney University we know that the numbers being trained have halved and that the foreign students who are taking places in Australian dental programs under the full-fee paying arrangements are very likely to leave Australia at the end of their studies. This is a work force crisis centrally caused by the Howard government and unaddressed by the Howard government. Before moving to the details of the bill before the House, I take the opportunity to record that I have been contacted about this dental crisis by a dentist in Bega. She has written to me to say that she is currently trying to fill a vacancy in her practice and is having great difficulty finding a dentist to fill the position. She blames this on the lack of dentists being trained. She can say from her experience that, when more dentists were trained, she could not find a government position because there were dentists around to take those positions, so she went to a rural area. She has been more than happy with her life in that rural area. But now, because there are not enough dentists being trained, there nothing to cause someone who completes training to think about the option of going rural, because they will clearly get a job in the city. She questions why it has become so restrictive and so difficult to study and train as a dentist. I think they are very wise words and ones that the Howard government needs to respond to. The issues surrounding the debate today are not just those that have been raised in last 24 hours about dental care. We have had the Minister for Health and Ageing make the quite extraordinary admission that mental health services in this country are ‘an absolute disaster'-his words, not mine. That is one thing that Minister Abbott managed to get right. But what he has not managed to get right is to say that the Howard government bear some responsibility for this absolute disaster. And Minister Abbott bears more responsibility than most because during his time as health minister he has palmed off mental health to the parliamentary secretary for health as if it were a second-class and uninteresting area. Indeed, the only policy innovation in mental health that the Howard government have made in the time that Minister Abbott has been the minister for health was when they endorsed Labor's mental health policy during the last election campaign. That is another issue affecting the health and aged care sector that surrounds this debate today. The third and final issue that surrounds this debate today is the news that people who have Medibank Private health insurance face restricted choices when they come to use that private health insurance. The one thing the Howard government could say for itself in the area of health is that it has been a good supporter of private health insurance. That is undoubtedly true. But it has not used that support in a way which ensures that people who hold private health insurance get value is for money. Consumers of private health insurance are now increasingly being squeezed in a vice where their premiums go up every year without fail. Last year they went up by 7.9 per cent on average, and I will warrant that this year the average increase will be larger than that. Some people have paid for private health insurance for years and have maintained those premium payments in circumstances where it has been very difficult the for them to do so in tight family budgets. When they turn around to use it, they are faced with out-of-pocket costs. The House processed a bill this week which we fear might lead to increased outof-pocket costs for medical devices. Today we see the news on the front page of the newspapers that Medibank Private is going to adopt a system where, if you want to go to your local private hospital and Medibank Private does not have a deal with that local private hospital, you will only be able to go there if you pay substantial out-of-pocket costs, perhaps in the order of $100 a day. So much for the rhetoric of choice. Even the Howard government's preferred policy area in health is one that they cannot manage effectively in the interests of Australian patients and consumers of private health insurance. It is in that setting of crisis and unanswered questions that we come to debate the Aged Care Amendment (Transition Care and Assets Testing) Bill 2005 today. It is with some amusement, I must note, that this bill finally offers some incremental change in the crisis area of the interface between acute care and aged care, which figured in so much debate during the recent election campaign. We know that, because of the Commonwealthstate divide, the Howard government is in a position to go on underfunding aged care until the cows come home, knowing that older Australians who cannot find a residential aged care place will end up being picked up by state administered public hospitals. Under our current Commonwealth-state arrangements, why does the Commonwealth care if state public hospitals are under increased stress and strain? The truth is it does not. It absolutely does not care that state lic hospitals are under increased stress and strain. We have been in a cycle where aged care has been underfunded and state administered public hospitals have been picking up the load. Labor for a long time now has been pointing to the need to resolve this discontinuity in the Commonwealth-state divide and to get a better package of care for older Australians. In the election campaign that has passed we had a substantial and innovative policy to do that in the form of Medicare Gold. There remains a challenge for the Howard government, who of course have been critical of Medicare Gold. They criticise Labor's policy solutions, but they are actually not the opposition or an academic think tank churning out pot shots at other people's public policy; they are the government and it is incumbent upon them to come up with a solution of their own that deals with the fact that $500 million to $600 million is wasted every year because frail aged people end up being accommodated in public hospital beds when they do not need to be there. They are still there because they cannot make the transition from the public hospital bed to a residential aged care bed because one is not available, or they got there because they were not receiving an appropriate package of care and they developed conditions which justified them being in a state-run public hospital-conditions they need not ever have developed if they had received an appropriate package of community or residential aged care earlier. So there is $500 million to $600 million wasted every year and, of course, there is human tragedy. Why should any person, let alone an older Australian potentially in the last few years of their life, end up being stuck in an acute public hospital bed, which is not a fun place to be if you do not need to be there, or, even worse, end up suffering pubfrom medical conditions that were preventable and avoidable-and which need hospital care-if it could have been prevented through a better suite of government arrangements? The challenge for the Howard government is to resolve ultimately the problems with the acute and aged care interface that drive that waste of public money on the one hand and the human tragedy besetting older Australians stuck in the system on the other. To that primary challenge for health care policy in this country the Howard government has absolutely no answers of any substance and it contents itself with taking pot shots at others who might be trying to find those answers. That is simply not a good enough standard for the government to set for itself. This bill actually represents the tiniest incremental change on this big public policy question. Of course, we never expect major steps forward from the Minister for Health and Ageing, because he wanders around the country indicating to all and sundry that he is opposed to health reform. His world view is that no matter how bad the system is he does not want to be reforming it. He just wants to sit and, presumably, wait for another portfolio to be allocated to him in due course during this parliamentary term. But, with a perspective of no health reform, which is the minister's stated view when it comes to health, it is pretty hard to come up with big solutions to big problems. Fortunately, despite the minister's attitude, in some way the system drives tiny changes itself, and today we are seeing one of those tiny but worthy changes. It is not going to go any way to fixing most of the major problems, but it is a tiny and worthy change and, given that, Labor is prepared to support it. The bill amends divisions 42 and 44 of the Aged Care Act and is about improving the nature of the arrangements in place when someone is in residential aged care and then needs to receive transition care following a hospital stay. Despite the Howard government's, and particularly Minister Abbott's, complete lack of interest in fixing the acute aged care divide-and despite the minister's complete opposition to health reformfortunately Labor states have been pushing and prodding the government to engage in the development of some transitional care for older Australians. So people who may be in residential aged care and develop a condition that needs hospital treatment are then able to go to a transition care facility-a nonhospital facility, though it is true to say some transition care facilities are located within hospitals-to enable their condition to be stabilised and for them to adjust to a new set of circumstances, if they have had a hip replacement or the like, before they go back to their residential aged care place. Whilst that is a worthy pattern of care for an older Australian, the financial arrangements that the Commonwealth provides to residential aged care needed some adapting to that pattern of care, and this bill is part of that adaptation. What we find in this bill is a set of leave arrangements which ensure that, if someone is effectively on leave from their residential day care facility because they are receiving transition care following a hospital stay, the recipient's normal care arrangements remain and can be accessed by them following the period of transition care. Of course, this requires the provision of subsidies to the approved providers of their residential aged care. It stands to reason that, if someone is absent from their residential aged care place for a period of time whilst they are in transition care, the operator of the residential aged care facility, without any further subsidies, is not able to hold a completely nonremunerative place available. So they are likely to fill that place with another frail aged person, which then creates a problem when the frail aged person in transition care is ready to go back to their residential aged care facility. This pattern of payments that the bill deals with will enable residential aged care providers to maintain the open residential aged care place for the older person to come back to following their period of transitional care. This policy response follows the government's response to the review of pricing arrangements in residential aged care, which of course was better known as the Hogan review. Out of that, a range of initiatives were funded, including the establishment of a national transition care program to address the needs of some older Australians who had been hospitalised. This bill amends the aged care principles to establish transition care as a specific form of flexible care for which an approved provider will be eligible for a flexible care subsidy. The bill establishes a new category of leave from residential care for the purposes of receiving flexible care. We understand that a subsequent amendment to the residential care subsidy principles will specify transition care as a form of flexible care for which leave from residential care is available and establish the maximum period of such leave available following a hospital episode. The bill also extends provisions of the act that deal with the reduction of the residential aged care subsidy when a care recipient is on extended hospital leave. This will now also apply to a flexible care arrangement. As such, the subsidy will reduce once a care recipient has been in hospital and transition care for at least 30 days. Because the reduction in subsidy is achieved by reducing the classification level of the residential care recipient, this would make a transition care recipient normally in receipt of the concessional resident supplement ineligible under provisions of the act if they were reduced to the lowest applicable classification level. An exemption to this which currently exists for care recipients on long periods of hospital leave will be extended to include care recipients in transition care. Apart from the necessary legislative amendments to achieve that purpose-a more streamlined interface between residential care and transition care-this bill also deals with the question of assets testing. As think most members of this House would be aware, possibly from having received complaints from individuals about the system, under the current system assets assessments are undertaken by an approved residential care provider at the time a person is ready to enter residential aged care. Approved residential care providers may claim a concessional resident supplement or an assisted resident supplement from the Commonwealth based on assets information provided by a resident at the time they entered the approved facility. Approved providers may request a resident to pay an accommodation bond or an accommodation charge based on this information. This bill changes current arrangements by introducing a number of measures to enable the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing to conduct asset assessments for new residents entering aged care homes and to delegate this power. Once again this follows recommendations flowing out of the Hogan review that the assessment of residents' or prospective residents' assets should be the responsibility of the Australian government rather than an aged care service provider and that this set of assets testing should be undertaken prior to entry into residential aged care. To achieve this result, whilst the formal power is vested in the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing, through a set of delegations the assets testing will actually occur through Centrelink and, in the case of veterans, through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. That set of delegation is contained in this bill. Obviously these amendments are not ones to which Labor would object. Clearly there is merit in having the Commonwealth government through its agencies-which already generally, and particularly for older Australians, have such information relating to people's assets and income positionI undertaking the relevant testing of the assets position rather than the residential aged care provider. So we will be allowing the quick passage of this bill through this House and it is our intention to support this bill in the Senate. Having said that, I would once again say that, whilst these are worthy amendments, these are small amendments which only go a tiny part of the way to resolving the substantial dilemmas flowing from the Commonwealth and state divide in aged care and the provision of acute care. All modern clinical practice indicates that transition care is very important in maintaining the health of older Australians. This bill recognises that, but currently the set of arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states really only recognise that in a very small way. We need a much more thoroughgoing examination and solution to the problems between acute care and residential aged care, and this bill only forms the tiniest part of the answer to that very substantial set of problems.",36
14,Mr BAIRD,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"It is my pleasure to support the Aged Care Amendment (Transition Care and Assets Testing) Bill 2005 today. Despite the fact that the member for Lalor was fairly grudging in her support for this bill, nevertheless we are pleased to see that the opposition do provide support for the transition of this mend the minister in bringing forward this bill. It was part of the promises made by the Treasurer at the time of the budget and obviously is a significant step forward. I notice that the member for Lalor, the author of Medicare Gold, which was roundly rejected by the electorate, is now criticising the government for what our failures might be in aged care. One has only got to compare the regime under this government with what it was some 8½ years ago to recognise that significant incremental steps have been made, particularly under this Minister for Ageing, Julie Bishop, who has done an outstanding job. In the last budget the Australian government provided an extra $2.2 billion in funding for aged care facilities. This will provide 27,900 new aged care places, an extra $877.8 million over four years, increased funding for aged care providers to construct new homes et cetera. So it was an incredible package that was put forward. This is the largest amount put into aged care provisions-some $2.2 billion-and it really shows the commitment of this government to aged care. In my own electorate of Cook, some 18½ per cent of my constituents are aged 65 and over. That makes my electorate significantly older than the average for torates across Australia, which I understand is about 12½ per cent aged over 65. This is the Australia that we will be looking at in the future with the ageing of the population and that is why it is so important to get some of these transitional measures in place and to look at where some of the problems are. I am very pleased at the extent of funding that has occurred under this government in my area, where we have some 19 aged care facilities. There are 12 villages in my electorate and they have received the one-off $3,500 payments to some 1,970 residents-a total of $17.4 million of recurrent funding in the bill. I com2002-03 budget year. So in my own electorate there is a recognition of the needs of the ageing population. Certainly it has been well received. We have new facilities being built at Taren Point which will include residential care as well as frail aged care facilities. That is going to be a significant addition at Taren Point. We also have the Donald Robinson Village, which has just been completed, and work has started on the new Greek Orthodox church at Miranda. These are some initiatives in my electorate alone which indicate the extent to which the government has been active in this area. The particular bill before us assists in terms of the transition for those who are admitted to hospital who have been in residential care and who, obviously, are eligible for residential care. Having experienced some serious medical problems in hospital, they then have the opportunity, as they undergo some significant therapy and support, to assess their own situation. They can assess whether they should go into an aged care facility for the frail aged or whether they should return to their residential care facility. It allows older people and their families time to assess their options while receiving rehabilitation services and support to increase elec- their confidence and independence. The care services are targeted at clients needing further assistance and support before finalising their long-term care arrangements. Some 2,000 transition care places are going to be created over the period 2006-07 to help older people make the transition from hospital to longer term care arrangements. With an average period of transition care of around eight weeks, when fully established these 2,000 places will assist up to 13,000 older people every year. Each state and territory will receive a proportion of the 2,000 places broadly in line with the proportion in each state of their population aged 70 and over and also Indigenous people aged 50 and over. States and territories will develop a three-year implementation plan. These places are going to be gradually increased over the years 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07. They will include 1,600 new flexible aged care places. We expect the first places to be allocated in June 2005. A total of $70 million has been allocated overall for the government contribution for the 2,000 places, and that is at the cost of $102.77 per place per day for transition. One could ask whether the transition care program will fix the problem of older people waiting too long in hospital before they get into residential care. This transition care is available for those who have completed their hospital episode and would otherwise have entered residential aged care. It will be predominantly of benefit to older people, but it will also assist the hospital system residential aged care system. This program is in parallel with and complements the growth in the number of residential aged care places available for older Australians. It is in addition the $253 million that the Australian government has provided through the Pathways Home program. This program recognises the problems of people when they have finished their treatment in hospital who still need recuperation, who are undergoing therapy and who are deciding whether they are going to go into frail aged facilities, which is never an easy decision to make. I am sure none of us are looking forward to making that choice. This will enable the families to assess the options with the patient, but it will also provide fundtransfers ing to the residential care facilities to burse them rather than have long periods where the place is vacant and, of course, it will enable the states to develop this facility. It is a very worthwhile program and it recognises the difficulties in aged care. Sometimes there may be delays in finding a place in the aged care facility and it provides transitional treatment during that time. It is a very worthwhile activity. Part of it is the transfer of functions for the assessment of individual patients. Assets testing for residents and soon to be residents of aged care facilities will be transferred from the approved providers to Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The assessment in the past has taken too much time, paperwork and bureaucracy for the providers. Their job should predominantly be providing effective aged care services and facilities to the frail aged and to those who are in residential care rather than going through this bureaucratic process. Centrelink are well set up to make the assessments, as is the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It is an administrative requirement, so this will add to the smoothness of the way in which the assessment is administered. I am sure there will still be debates as to the assessment of assets in terms of whether residential bonds will be provided. That, of course, has to be cleared to by the department. It is a sensible transition; it smoothes the bureaucratic hurdles and it takes away responsibility from the providers and enables them to put their predominant focus onto aged care servicing. Despite the complaints by the member for Lalor, she grudgingly supported the bill as the glow of Medicare Gold has faded into the sunset and we are faced with the real requirements of aged care services in this country. This transitional arrangement is very welcome. It will provide 2,000 places, it will cost $70 million and, of course, it sensibly the assets assessment to Centrelink reim- and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Overall, it is a worthwhile addition. It is an incremental step and Minister for Ageing needs to be complimented on bringing this legislation forward.",40
15,Ms HALL,AGED CARE AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker MCMullan, this is the first time. I have spoken since you have been in the chair, and it is a great pleasure to do Unfortunately, the previous speaker is deluding himself if he believes that all aged care issues have been dealt with by this government and that no issues exist for older people who need assistance to access residential care or community packages. If he is not aware that those problems exist, I think he needs to go and talk to people in his electorate, because in my electorate we are constantly being contacted by people who are very concerned about aged care issues. The Aged Care Amendment (Transition Care and Assets Testing) Bill 2005 has been introduced in response to the Hogan review of pricing arrangements in residential aged care. The Hogan report is a very lengthy document that came out of a review that cost a considerable amount of money and came up with some recommendations I agree with and some which I feel are misplaced. It was a review that the aged care industry was waiting for over a considerable period of time and there were great expectations of it. find it most concerning that the government has been slow to implement the recommendations of the report. I will touch on some of those recommendations as I proceed through my speech and I will also highlight areas where I believe the government has failed older Australians. This legislation amends the act to support the implementation of transition care programs and it transfers the assessment of asset testing to Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs from aged care providers. It is interesting that recommendations relating to resident classification scales have not been implemented. It is interesting that the recommendation on planning arrangements, which was recommendation No. 1 of the Hogan report, has not been implemented as yet. I see that as quite a big issue and one that will go a long way to addressing the fact so. that there are many phantom beds-beds that have been approved on paper but never built. Within my own electorate I know that if those phantom beds had been built they would have gone a long way towards dealing with the shortage of aged care beds, both low care and high care. Currently we have people waiting for a considerable amount of time to access an aged care bed. One of the causes of that is that planning is not responsive to the needs of various areas. The government has not looked at issues surrounding development. These are some of the things the government should have turned its mind to sooner rather than later. While Labor are supporting this legislation, I do not think it attacks the real issues or core problems, the key recommendations that the Hogan report made, and I do not think these are key issues for older Australians. There were 2,000 places announced in the 2004-05 budget for the transition care program. The government says that will alI low older people who have been in hospital more time to recover in an environment that gives them access to rehab, and I think that is a very positive step. It allows a person to have appropriate care in an appropriate setting and it is a more person focused approach to aged care. It allows for better integration between aged care facilities and services and hospital services. It is a position that I think anyone who has any understanding of aged care would agree with and support. The amendments in the legislation relating to transition care have been introduced to ensure that residents of residential care facilities are able to receive transition care following hospitalisation. They ensure that residents' current care arrangements remain in place following a period of transition care. This is a positive change that allows residents to maximise their rehabilitation in an appropriate environment. If a person has a stroke, they can get the treatment and care they need to maximise their functionality. The legislation amends the act to establish transition care programs once a person has been in hospital. It establishes flexible care for approved providers with flexible care subsidies, and there is a new category of leave for residents for the purpose of receiving flexible care. It sets the maximum period of leave for this care and puts in place mechanisms to reduce residential subsidies when a person is receiving transition care. That will allow an optimal outcome for an older person who is receiving that care. It is really about the person. Unfortunately, in many areas of aged care this government has moved away from keeping the person as the key focus of its programs. It has put in place systems within residential care facilities that are absolutely overwhelming those facilities with red tape and bureaucracy. The resident classification system, RCS, has created enormous problems for staff working in facilities. I note that recommendation 5 of the Hogan report is that the residential classification scale, which currently has eight categories, be reduced to three categories, including: low care, consolidating the current RCS levels 5 to 7-and there is currently a level 8, but it does not attract any government subsidy; medium care, replacing RCS levels 3 and 4; and high care, replacing RCS levels 1 and 2. That will streamline it, reduce the paperwork and make it easier for people administering the system. But we are not discussing that today-and it is interesting to note the priorities of this government. There is also a question mark over whether, under the medium-care category, residents moving into medium-care facilities will be require to pay a bond. Currently, residents in low-care facilities pay residential bonds and people in high-care facilities do not pay residential bonds. Knowing the way this government works, I have great concern that people entering a facility at the mediumcare level will be forced to pay a residential bond. I am sure we will find out very soon. I do not think too many people will be surprised if the government starts forcing people entering residential facilities at the medium-care level to pay a residential care bond. Whilst the government has to some extent turned its mind to people living in a residential care facility, I think it needs to expend a little more effort on, or increase, its community aged care packages for people living within the community. In my electorate of Shortland, there are areas where a lot of elderly people live where those packages are unavailable or there are insufficient packages. The government has raised the expectations of older people that they will be able to access those packages, but unfortunately those packages are not available to them. It is very similar with veterans' home care packages, which have been reduced. The hours of assistance which people get with their daily living needs and around their homes have been reduced. The government has been backing away from a commitment it made to the Australian people. I have spoken about the planning process and how inadequate it is. Hunter New England Health covers part of my electorate. It was previously the Hunter area, but there has recently been a change and it now includes the New England area. I will be interested to see how that works in relation to people who live in the Shortland electorate. I have problems with planning being determined just on the Hunter area. You can have a high concentration of nursing home beds-residential care beds-in one area, yet people living some 200 kilometres away are still being assessed in that area but may have only very limited access to residential care beds. The planning process needs to look more at meeting the needs of people in their local area rather than encompassing a very big area. It concerns me that the government comes to this House and tells us what a wonderful job it is doing in aged care, when there are large number of people waiting for access to residential care facilities and community aged care packages. My way of looking at it is that, if people are waiting-if you do not have enough beds-you are failing the community. Based on what I have seen and what other members have said to me, this government has failed older people. We have an ageing population, and the need for government to be responsive to the needs of older people is greater than it has ever been. When it comes to implementing aged care changes, the government is always driven by the philosophy that people need to contribute to their own well-being. The government wants to shift the blame for the problem to someone else. The situation with phantom beds is that the government has approved the beds but they exist on paper only, so there are inadequate beds in all the communities that we represent in this parliament, and older Australians are being forced to stay in hospitals. The government is forcing the costs of aged care onto the states. In the process, they are ignoring the needs of older people. Hospital is not the optimal place for people to be. They should be in an aged care facility that can be their home and where they can get appropriate treatment. I really believe something needs to be done about that. That brings me to the issue of the work force-an issue that was identified in the Hogan report. In the aged care sector there is a real problem getting sufficient numbers of well trained staff. Hogan made some recommendations in relation to staffing. I think that is one area the government should have acted on very early in the piece. The Hogan report suggested that the government refocus and expand support for education and training of aged care nurses and aged care worka ers. The report goes through and identifies the shortage and the fact that the work force is largely an older work force, particularly in relation to registered nurses. Unless something is done to address the issues relating to the work force within the aged care industry the crisis that we have now will be exacerbated. Unless something is done we will not be able to get suitably trained staff to work in residential care facilities and to deliver the community care packages. I know how difficult it is for the organisations that have those community care packages to implement them because they cannot get the staff to do it. I know how difficult it is for residential care facilities to keep their facilities operational because of the lack of suitably trained staff. If the government does not pick up that recommendation of Hogan and work on it very quickly, the crisis we have now will only get worse. Moving away from the transitional care, the other aspect of this legislation is the transfer of asset testing to Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. That was recommendation 10 in the Hogan report. The cost of this change will be $19.7 million over four years and the implementation date is 1 July this year. Under the current system asset assessment is made by an approved provider at the time that a person enters a residential care facility. This increases the amount of paperwork for the residential care facilities. Only last night I was speaking to a person who works in a residential care facility and he advised me that he thought that that was a very good move and that it would help the residential care facilities, so that change should be embraced. It seems that the expertise in relation to assessing assets of people rests with Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs so it only seems appropriate that they do it rather than taking up the time of providers of residential care and involving them in paperwork that they do not need to be involved in. At the moment the residential care facilities can provide the assessment and then claim the concessional residential supplement or the assisted residential supplement from the Commonwealth. This will take away the need for them to make all those assessments and it put it in the hands of the experts in Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. As well, this legislation provides an extension of seven days, which commences from the date a person enters a residential care facility. That changes the period from seven to 21 days during which residents need to sign their accommodation bonds or accommodation care agreements. Issues relating to aged care in Australia are numerous and there are a significant number of recommendations in the Hogan report. I believe it is time for the government to get serious about aged care. I believe it is time for the government to look very carefully at the Hogan report and implement those recommendations that will be of great benefit to older Australians. It is time that government put the needs of older people first and implemented proper policies that meet their needs.",43
16,Mrs HULL,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"I have great pleasure in rising this morning to support the Minister for Ageing on the Aged Care Amendment (Transition Care and Assets Testing) Bill 2005. The bill plans to continue with the government's goals to further improve aged care in this country and it builds on our achievements to date. Included in this amendment are the implementation of the transition care program and the transfer of asset testing to Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The establishment of a national transition care program will assist our older people after a hospital stay. This government will make available 2,000 flexible care places over three years to assist our older Australians. Many older people in our communities want to remain in their own homes longer, often with the support of family and friends. By remaining in their own homes with some level of support they retain a sense of independence. However, there are times when, in the event of an illness, a fall or an accident of some description, elderly people require hospital care. Many, when they are recovering, are placed either in a residential facility, because they are not able to be self supporting in their own home, or at worse they are sent home where there are no adequate or sufficient support services available to them. These are the situations where there are some major problems. For example, an elderly person may have had a hip broken or had an episode of cancer and been hospitalised. They have been able, and will in the future be able, to look after themselves but their surgery or their illness has rendered them very ill, weak and in need of care for longer periods than is available in the hospithe tal system. Therefore, they are faced with an enormous dilemma. Not only are they faced with the dilemma, the families of ageing people are faced with the dilemma too. Nobody knows the heartache and pain of deciding what to do for an ageing family member until they have actually experienced it. There is nothing more draining or significantly challenging in the life of a daughter or son of an elderly parent. They have a full workload, both partners are working and they have children, and all of a sudden mum or dad has a fall or contracts an illness that sees them needing serious surgery or serious hospitalisation and treatment and, when they come out of hospital, their children recognise that their parent cannot go home. If there are no available support services, particularly in rural and regional communities, they are faced with: ‘What are we going to do? We're all working, we don't have time, we don't have holidays left and we don't know how long this rehab process is going to take.' Mum or dad cannot go back to their own home because there is simply nobody there to provide the necessary support. It is not the elderly people who are in a dilemma then; it is everybody. It is absolutely heart breaking. It is the source of much stress in many of our families today. With our ageing population, many of our working families are feeling the enormous stress of not knowing where they can access care. As I said, it is particularly difficult in rural and regional areas because of distance. What the government is putting in place with this transition care bill is so overdue so very welcome, and I congratulate the minister for embracing this process. There is so much difficulty out there associated with parents being in significant difficulty and how they will be cared for. As I said, it is always the best option to send elderly people home or to place them in a continued residence facility, because many of them know that they will recover from their illness and that they just need time to get back on their feet, so to speak, and they grieve. They are given limited opportunities and support to enable them to recognise that they may have another 10, 12 or 20 years in their home, but because they have had this unfortunate incident they are causing stress and grief to their children and other family members. That is when elderly people feel that they have become a burden to their families, when in fact they are not a burden. Our lifestyles are such now that marriages and relationships have both partners working and people are battling to deal with everyday life, and there is nothing worse than your parent feeling they are a burden. On many occasions care has to change on a daily basis, such as for an elderly person who may have had bowel cancer. They have been hospitalised, and when they come home they have difficulty with the changes in their body that the bowel cancer operation has created. They are not able to deal with the fundamental everyday nursing needs of their bodies; they just are not comfortable with those areas. So, of course, they start to lose confidence and think, ‘Maybe I do need full-time care,' when in fact, given time to learn and understand how their lives will be after bowel cancer, they would be able to adequately deal with that in the future. We have seen many times in the past when our parents have been put into care facilities long before that was really required, when they could still have been living indebut pendently long before requiring accommodation in aged care facilities. So I am very pleased to see this government recognise the needs not only of the aged people in our community but also of their children and not their families. This transition care bill is a godsend to the many families out there who are taking long service leave to care for parents, who have put their employment prospects on hold to ensure that their parents are being looked after. It is not just a support network, a support structure, for aged people. I see this as being critical for families who are struggling. I have been in the position where I struggled to see my parents have a quality of life to the end of their days, to try to balance my commitments to work and responsibilities at home while still wanting to ensure that I remain a faithful daughter committed to my parents. I am very pleased to see that this government has looked at not only what this can deliver for aged people but what it can deliver for their families. In addition to this new program, the government has provided $253 million through the Pathways Home program to assist older people in the move from hospital to their homes and the aged care innovative pool that deals with the relationships between hospitals and aged care. With the introduction of this program, we can also be confident that residential care is being provided for those most in need. Other support options are being made available to elderly people and their families-as I said, we must not forget families and carers-with a need for lowlevel care and assistance. We must be very cautious to ensure that people can stay at home longer. We must be cautious to ensure that support services are available in the communities where these people live. Far too often people are living their homes with few support services available in the communities. The packages are out there, being delivered by the government, but there are no providers in many regional communities. So people are unable to access those support structures in both large communities and small communities. It is incumbent upon us, as a government and as an opposition, to recognise that we need to ensure support services are available in all communities for people to access and take advantage of them-because there is nothing worse than knowing your elderly parent, relation or friend is at home 24 hours a day and that for only one hour of that day, if they are lucky, is somebody coming into assist them. What are we doing for the other 23 hours in the day? Maybe it is down to two to three visits a week, not because the government is not making these packages available but because the providers are just not in these communities. We have to do something to provide incentives for the people who offer these services and outreach programs to literally move from larger communities into these smaller communities. It is no good just sending somebody out once or twice a week. They need to be encouraged and incentivised to put outreach programs into smaller communities to ensure that these programs are working in the spirit that the minister intended. The Transition Care Program is also ensuring that the government is targeting the correct resources to the correct groups of people. Transition Care provides short-term support for older people and targets older people who, at the conclusion of a hospital episode, require more time and support in a non-hospital environment. The program not only provides those people with the opportunity to recover but also gives them time to consider their options. It gives them time to in discuss issues with their families-because their families may have moved away. This is particularly the case in smaller communities where job opportunities have been limited in the past. Many of us have moved away from the smaller communities we were born in and have had to take employment paths elsewhere, leaving our parents in those communities on their own with no family support structures to give them assistance. I know-I was born in Guyra, a wonderful little town in the New England. I loved that little town but, unfortunately, had to move from that community in order to secure employment, which left my mother and father in that community with no family support. Then, when my father passed away, my mother was left alone and without the confidence to move to another community to live with me. But, having finally convinced her to move, she was basically able to enjoy life once again. With transition care, it is really important that we give time for people who are living in communities away from their families to discuss what is required and what their future options might be. Then they will have real choices-whether to enter a residential facility, to remain living independently with some level of support made available through the government's packages or to move from that community and relocate with family members somewhere else. All of that takes time and planning for everybody. So this program is just amazing. If it had been available to me when I had problems associated with both parents contracting cancer and needing extreme care and support, I would have had easier options and it would have been far better for us as a family and far better for my parents to have been able to access something like this. The aims of the program will be to reduce the number of inappropriately long hospital stays and to prevent premature admissions to residential care. Also, as I have reiterated, it will provide the families of elderly people with choices rather than panic and guilt. The states and territories have agreed with the Commonwealth that, based on the results of pilot projects, care recipients should be able to receive up to 12 weeks of transition care, with the possibility of extending that by six weeks. Elderly people already living in residential care can also access transition care. This is what I see as the best benefit of all, and I only hope that the government will look at this issue as a windfall. By extending transition care to people who already live in residential care, we can hopefully open up those beds for respite care. While the people who are currently in residential care are having a hospital episode and are in transitional care, it would be sensational if we could utilise those beds for urgently required respite, particularly in rural and regional areas. By extending it to residential care, the government has, I believe, opened up extremely good opportunities for us to take advantage of that. The government will continue to pay the aged care provider a subsidy for the period the resident is receiving transitional care, so it should follow that the government could and should expect that the bed be made available to address the urgent shortage of respite care. It makes perfect sense to be able to do something like that, because we have such a shortage of respite for elderly people who are currently being cared for by family members who never, ever get a break. It would be an amazing relief for them to be able to access this available respite. I see this as a win-win situation. It is a windfall bonanza. If a residential care resident has to undertake transitional care, then the residential care provider should ensure the vacant bed, for which it is receiving a subsidy from the government, is open for respite care. That bed would then be available for the resident to come back to, and no longer would the resident have to worry that they might lose their bed. I see this government as extremely proactive in dealing with aged care services. The transfer will enable aged care providers to concentrate on their primary objectives. The transfer of responsibility for the asset testing of new residents entering aged care homes from the approved providers of residential care to Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs is a great move. You need to have all the available time and to have all hands on deck to be able to offer quality care to our elderly people. Removing the cumbersome administrative burden of bureaucratic paperwork to some other source will create a fairer and more equitable playing field in the way these assets are assessed, and I think that is an excellent idea. There is more to be achieved in aged care, but this government has delivered a huge increase in relevant care. I think the operative word here is ‘relevant' care. That is what it is looking for: to establish a need. It is just about plonking some person, some mother or father, into a facility and forgetting that they are there. It is about providing vant care. That is what this government has been so great at doing. Far from failing ageing Australians, as the member for Shortland asserted, this government has embraced quality, relevant aged care and has increased the availability of beds. This has been a significantly difficult task, considering that the previous Labor government left aged care with a fairly significant deficit of around 10,000 beds. I think that the member for Shortland really needs to look at the relevance of aged care and the needs that aged people have. Staff are an essential part of quality aged care, and additional remuneration is critical. Aged care nursing and caring is a lifestyle choice. It is not a job; it is a total commitment for the many nurses in aged care facilities. The love and devotion that is required to deliver good quality outcomes in good quality aged care cannot be bought. There needs to be more money paid to those people who have chosen to offer quality care and enormous support. (Time expired)",46
17,Mr WINDSOR,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"I am privileged to follow the member for Riverina in this debate on the Aged Care Amendment (Transition Care and Assets Testing) Bill 2005, because I know that she has a very compassionate approach to the aged in her electorate and to the issue in general, and I think that was reflected in her speech. I know that the member for Riverina was born in Guyra. The Guyra community has in recent days announced a tender for a multipurpose service, which is a combination of aged care and health care. The aged care component is funded at a federal level and the health care component is funded at a state level. I think it epitomises the progress not that has been made on this issue. Both the Commonwealth government and the state government are due congratulations. I think rele- this is a good example of where both governments have worked together for a better outcome for a smaller community. The Guyra community will have something that it did not think it would have in the future: an aged care facility combined with a health care facility, with some administrative and operational synergies of the two coordinated arms. This model has to be looked at, particularly for other services within country communities. I support this legislation, and particularly the transitional care arrangements and the asset-testing arrangements with Centrelink. I think that is an arrangement that embraces common sense more than anything else, because a lot of aged people have a relationship and deal with Centrelink in connection with their assets and affairs. This will enable that ongoing connection and will not introduce a fear complex in some older people. In a lot of cases it will make it much easier for accommodation bonds to be assessed by Centrelink and it will expedite the process of entering residential aged care. I think all people in this chamber will be supporting this legislation, but I take this opportunity to make a few comments on aged care generally. I am pleased to see the Minister for Ageing is here. I congratulate her and the former minister because I think there have been some significant moves forward in the provision of aged care. That is not to suggest-and I am sure the minister would not suggest-that all the work has been done and everything is rosy for every individual in Australia; obviously not. But I do not think anybody can genuinely stand up in this chamber and say that the aged care debate has slipped. There is no doubt that there have been improvements. There need to be greater improvements built over time, but there are more care packages out there now. As the member for Riverina highlighted, there are facilities being developed as we speak. The Guyra initiative is one of the initiatives currently taking place. A few issues that I will raise have come out of the Hogan review and other reviews. I highlight that an inquiry into aged care is taking place at the moment. Submissions have been put to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into aged care. There was something like 214 submissions. That highlights the significance of this issue to a lot of groups-and they are not all aged care groups. There are mental health groups and a whole range of groups and individuals who have made submissions. I think we as members should keep a very close eye on this inquiry, because it could be very important. One issue that has been raised in my electorate, and I am sure in other electorates, about which constituents from my electorate have put in a submission to this inquiry, is accommodation for young people with disabilities. It is a very real where the system, even though it is attempting to provide, is not providing the ancillary requirements of young people-requirements specific to their being young and their having additional disabilities-in aged care facilities. I am pleased to say that there is a group within my electorate of New England that, rather than whingeing about this problem and berating the government about it, is sitting down and trying to develop a model which, hopefully, the government may consider as part of future arrangements where, in a cost-effective sense, younger people who need constant care can be accommodated but not accommodated in aged care facilities as if they were older people. I am sure all of us would like to see some progress being made on that. Obviously, it has to be done within the costing arrangements that the department and others can afford at the time. I bring that particular issue to the chamber because it is something that really does need to be wrestled with and brought to a conclusion. I am very pleased that constituents within my electorate have taken the time to put a submission to that inquiry. Another issue that has become fairly well known-and the member for Riverina hinted at it in her address-is the people who work within aged care facilities. There has been a lot of talk in recent years about the viability of aged care nursing homes and residential care homes-whether a lot of these organisations will stay viable due to their size and the number of beds. A significant issue coming to the fore and a real pressure now being applied within economic parameters is to do with staffing. There are very real pressures on staff. In my view, a lot of the staff are not paid adequately for the work that they do, and we have to look very seriously at that in the future. If we want to attract people with the technical skills, the know-how and that issue caring, compassionate attitude that we are relying on in aged care facilities-and hospital facilities for that matter-at some stage we cross the line where remuneration does become a determining factor as to their career path. I am sure the minister is aware of that particular issue and appreciates the work that staff in residential care facilities put in. Another issue that I would like to raise concerns the multipurpose service model. I think there has been very real progress made on this across Australia. The electorate of New England has been a major recipient of that progress, and I might spend a brief moment talking about that if I can. I remember raising this issue when I first came into this parliament. I know there were others prior to and since my election who also raised the issue of aged care and health care facilities, particularly in small to medium sized communities, where the viability of funding was actually sending a message to those smaller communities that if you were small you would be disadvantaged as you would not be of a sufficient size to be able to house your aged care people in the community in which they lived. Obviously, from a regional development perspective, that was sending messages much earlier to people in country communities than when they were older. In fact, those people were making decisions earlier in life to relocate to larger areas where there would be adequate health and aged care facilities so that they could live out their lives with some degree of care around them. I am pleased to say that the multipurpose service model-dreadful name that it is, and I wish someone would change itMs Julie Bishop-Come up with another name!",50
18,Mr WINDSOR,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"In fact, the name was one of the things that concerned people some years ago. I am pleased to say the multipurpose service model was developed between the Commonwealth and the states under the chairmanship of a committee headed by a former member for New England, Ian Sinclair. Ian Sinclair and, at that stage, the Minister for Health, Craig Knowles, worked very well to deal with aged care and health facilities in smaller communities. Rather than do as the bureaucrats had been recommending for some years that these smaller communities should be rationalised out of existence-and one of the ways of achieving that goal is to put the facilities somewhere else so that some of the people within those communities make decisions and vote with their feet and leave their communities earlier and, in doing so, the communities lose a lot of valuable infrastructure-the multipurpose service model has given a significant benefit to those communities and in fact reversed the process. I give the example of Emmaville. Emmaville, which is located north-west of Glen Innes and west of Tenterfield, is a small old mining community. Prior to becoming the federal member, I was in an adjoining state seat covering that area. There were a number of women within that community, which had a very old weatherboard hospital facility in decline that needed replacing for obvious reasons, who were afraid that it would never be replaced, that their community would be rationalised into another community and that the capacity to attract a doctor to that town would be damaged. It is a fairly common story. A number of the women and others in the community decided to stand up on this issue at the time when the Sinclair committee was holding inquiries into what could be done for these smaller communities, so Emmaville was one of the first to gain an MPS. I hold periodical meetings throughout the year with my communities. I have 70 communities within the electorate. I happened to be having one at Emmaville on a particular day when about eight people turned up, including a lady called Ellie Seagrave, one of the initiators of the MPS. The MPS had then been open about 12 months. She is a woman Labor whom I am sure most of us would obey, and she said to me, ‘We need more beds.' I said, ‘Ellie, it hasn't been open all that long. Is it full?' She said, ‘Yes, it is full and we want you to go and get some more beds.' So I will just tell the minister that now if I may. If she could deliver some more beds to Emmaville for Ellie, it would be most appreciated. Ellie then said one of the most amazing things to me. It has really stuck with me, and I think these sorts of comments make political life very worthwhile. I asked, ‘Why do you need more beds, Ellie?', and she said, ‘What's happening is that we're getting people who left Emmaville years ago wanting to come back.' There is a very serious message in that. People were leaving our small communities-not because they wanted to but in a sense because they had to-because they were making judgments on what would be available in terms of health and aged care as they got older. Now we are getting-and not only in Emmaville but in some of the other communities where people grew up where MPSs have been established-people who went to the coast wanting to return to where they came from. That sends a very important message. Aged care is not just about caring for the elderly. It is also about caring for assets our community: the assets of the elderly, the experience of those who have lived in those communities over those years, and keeping that capital and all the extended family benefits that accrue in those communities. We spend hours in this place talking about the breakdown of the family and how we are going to overcome this, the welfare issues, the signals we are trying to send in terms of budgetary and other processes, Aboriginal issues-all of those issues-and a lot of it has been drawn to a head in the disintegration of the family. There are a number of areas that can help to overcome that-and I am not saying that everybody should stay where they were born-and health and aged care is one of them. Telecommunications is another. Telecommunications can remove the disadvantage of distance and remoteness from being a rural Australian. You can do business anywhere if you have equity of access to those particular facilities. The relavery tionship that telecommunications has to modern medicine and aged care and health is another initiative that we really do need to look at. The MPSs in my electorate have been or are being established at Emmaville, Barraba, Bingara, Tingha and Walcha. They are going to be of significant advantage to people there. I know there are some people within the commercial aged care sector that do have some difficulties with the formula of aged care in MPSs, and I am sure the minister has had those discussions at different times. In some ways, they are another way to achieve aged care beds which operate outside the formula of the number of people per thousand over 70, which is the existing formula. But I think they go some way to recognising the needs within those smaller communities and the acceptance of the fact that a lot of those communities have not got the numbers into be viable under the current arrangements. An MPS model does give us a very good opportunity to provide not only aged care but health services within those communities. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the aged care professionals in the electorate of New England. I would like to name two people-and I am sure the minister has come  Barry. They are well worth talking to in relation to country communities, the provision of aged care and the potential to develop models that can embrace, within obvious cost constraints, the provision of services to country communities in the future. They have been very much involved and are working with other aged care facilities within the region to try to achieve better outcomes in the provision of aged care. The final issue I raise-and it is obviously not directly related to this legislation-is one that has been raised a number of times. It is much in the press at the moment and it relates to the health of all of us, but particularly our aged. It is the dental care issue. I would ask all those within this chamber to try to look past some of the political disagreements that have occurred in the past as to who pays for dental care. The Commonwealth government is responsible for Medicare. I know the Minister for Health and Ageing moved slightly in terms of dental care becoming an issue of Commonwealth significance during the election campaign, when severe health threats were being posed. Given the publicity of the last few days and the obvious need that is there, I think it is time that the Commonwealth government started working more closely with the states-as it has done with the multipurpose service model-to establish a much better formula for the delivery of dental health care. Obviously, if you cannot eat properly, whether you are young or old-but particularly if you are old-it is going to have a significant cost impact on the provision of health care to you as an individual. We cannot divide the portfolio cake on these issues. If we are serious about making savings in health care, the provision of dental care within adequate time periods is something that we really do need to consider at a Commonwealth level.",52
19,Ms JULIE BISHOP,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"in reply-The Aged Care Amendment (Transition Care and Assets Testing) Bill 2005 will make two amendments to the Aged Care Act 1997. The effect of these amendments will be of benefit to older Australians, particularly those living in residential aged care or considering entering residential aged care. The legislation supports, first, the implementation of our Transition Care Program and, second, the transfer of assets testing to Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. As part of the $2.2 billion Investing in Australia's Aged Care: More Places, Better Care package released in the 2004-05 federal budget, the coalition government announced the establishment of a national Transition Care Program. This program, comprising 2,000 transition care places, will assist older people who, after a hospital stay, require more time and support in a non-hospital environment to complete their restorative process, optimise their functional capacity and consider their longer term care arrangements. The Transition Care Program will ease pressures on health services for older Australians by providing greater access to a full range of aged care services in hospital, residential and community care. Through this program the Australian government is ensuring that older Australians leaving hospital receive additional rehabilitation support by building on existing services. During this debate the opposition spokeswoman for health repeated the unsubstantiated and completely unsustainable proposition that the Australian government is underfunding aged care and that that is placing an undue burden on the public hospital system. The government's massive investment in aged care ought to be acknowledged, given that between 1996 and 2008 it will have invested $67 billion in aged care, that between 1996 and 2004 it has more than doubled funding from $3 billion when Labor was in office to $6.7 billion today-that is about a 125 per cent increase; and that the population cohort over the age of 70 has increased by just over 20 per cent during that period. It is timely, given Labor's years of neglect; it is appropriate, given that we have an ageing population; and it is necessary to ensure a sustainable aged care sector to meet expected demands. The opposition spokeswoman also trotted out the old line that older Australians who have no need for hospital care are increasingly occupying hospital beds because there are no residential care places available for them. This classic blame shifting for public hospital waiting lists, which has now been turned into an art form by state and territory Labor governments, is just not true. A study published in the Medical Journal of Australia contradicts the line peddled by Labor. As the opposition spokeswoman ought to know-I am surprised she is seemingly ignorant of this study-Professor Len Gray, Stephen Duckett and others, in a study entitled Trends in the use of hospital beds by older people in Australia: 1993–2002, published in November 2004, found that, although the age population increased by 18 per cent compared to general population growth of 10 per cent during that period, the proportion of hospital beds occupied by older people remained stable over that 10year period. The conclusion of the study states: Important trends in use of inpatient services were identified in this study. These trends are contrary to common perception. We know who is peddling the perceptionAgeing of the Australian population was not associated with an increase in the proportion of hospital beds used by older patients. When you consider the massive increase in places in community care and residential care made available by this government27,900 new places over the next three years at a time when state and territory Labor governments are closing acute care hospital beds-the lie is exposed. Data published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare between 1997 and 2003 shows that state and territory governments have been cutting acute hospital bed numbers by 3,570-that is, 6.7 per cent. Since 1996 the Australian government has overseen the fastest rate of growth of aged care places ever achieved in Australia. A total of 68,600 places, including 13,030 new aged care places announced through the 2004 aged care approvals round, have been released since 1996. An additional 14,845 new aged care places will be allocated over the following two years. I note that the member for New England is still in the chamber. I am pleased to see him taking part in this debate, and I know that he will be pleased to know that almost 40 per cent of the 5,889 residential aged care places allocated in the 2003 aged care approval round were allocated to regional, rural and remote Australia. The proportion of older people in hospital has remained stable. State and territory governments have been cutting hospital bed numbers and the Australian government has been increasing significantly the number of aged care places. Since 1996 there has been a 31.5 per cent increase in total operational aged care places compared with the 20 or 23 per cent increase in population over the age of 70 during the same period. Approved providers advise us that more than 70 per cent of delays in making places operational are due to issues concerning land approvals and availability. These are state and local government areas of responsibility. Last year the Australian government increased the aged care provision ratio from the existing level of 100 operational places to 108 operational places for every 1,000 people in the population aged 70 or over to reflect ageing population needs. The government committed some time ago to 200,000 operational aged care places by June 2006, and we are on track to meet that commitment. There was much hand wringing by the member for Shortland about aged care funding, but not a hint of embarrassment over Labor's failure to develop any cohesive aged care policy over the past nine years or a hint of acknowledgment that in her own electorate of Shortland funding for aged care has increased by 89 per cent since Labor left office. Under this government, the 20 residential aged care facilities in the electorate of the member for Shortland have received almost $184 million in recurrent funding, including $26.8 million in annual recurrent funding for 2003-04 and an expected $29 million in recurrent funding for 2004-05. Aged care homes in the electorate of the member for Shortland also received a one-off capital payment of nearly $3 million that was paid before 30 June last year. There has been an increase in places in her electorate-over 15 per growth. We have allocated 40 community aged care packages in the electorate of Shortland. When Labor left office there was not one community aged care package available for the good people of Shortland. We also announced the new national Transition Care Program to help older people return home after a hospital stay. The additional 2,000 places will help older Australians have time after their hospital stay to improve their functioning and independence and consider options for care in their home or an aged care facility. With an estimated average period of care of eight weeks this means that, when fully established, the program will assist up to 13,000 older Australians each year. Through this legislation we have ensured that, if any of these older Australians are living in a residential care service before they access the Transition Care Program, they will have the peace of mind of knowing that they will be able to return to their aged care home after receiving the transition care. We have done this by creating a new category of leave from residential care for the purpose of receiving flexible care. The Australian government is also working through the Pathways Home Program and projects under the aged care innovation pool to improve transitions between the hospital sector and the aged care sector. These programs have informed the development of the Transition Care Program. It was somewhat disturbing to hear the member for Lalor say that hospitals had to pick up the load for the lack of aged care places. I understand why she is criticising the government's reform agenda: she has to justify her ill-fated, ill-conceived, underfunded and undeliverable Medicare Gold election initiative. I do not know whether the blame should be laid at her door, but, fairly or unfairly, it is. It was not only derided by older Australians, who saw through the cheap grab for votes, but no right-thinking members of the community believe that it is appropriate to allocate hospital places on the basis of age and not health care needs-an extraordinary proposition and rightly derided by members of her own party and described by the incoming ALP president as a ‘turkey' of a policy. Ouch. Dr Stone-And the public voted it down.",54
20,Ms JULIE BISHOP,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"And the public voted it down. Thank you, Parliamentary Secretary. Then, in the specific policy area of aged care, Labor's true colours were exposed during the last election campaign. At the last minute, almost as an afterthought, they made a couple of promises that did not provide a single dollar for extra aged care places in the community or at home. In the 2004-05 federal budget the coalition government announced another initiative: the transfer of assets testing for residents and potential residents of aged care facilities from approved providers to Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. By removing the necessity for approved providers to undertake assets assessments, approved providers will be relieved of the administrative burden of conducting assessments and will be able to spend more time caring for residents. In addition, approved providers will have greater certainty as to their income, due to the experience of Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs in conducting accurate and consistent assessments. This initiative is one of a number included in the government's Investing in Australia's Aged Care: More Places, Better Care package aimed at streamlining the administration of aged care to free up staff to focus on delivering high-quality care and providing greater income security to providers. Already, for example, we have removed the requirement for providers to obtain approval from aged care assessment teams before existing residents can move from lowto highlevel within the same aged care home. From 2006 the new funding model currently being developed will streamline the resident classification scale from the current eight categories down to three. This will provide greater income security to providers and, importantly again, free up nurses and staff to give an even greater focus to the care of residents. We are also working across a number of measures to ensure that paperwork and processes serve a clear purpose or benefit for proved providers, staff or people living in residential aged care. For example, under the new conditional adjustment payment, approved providers will be required to produce audited financial reports-a process that will help providers improve management and make the best use of resources. I thank all members who took part in this debate. Particularly useful were the thoughtful contributions of the member for Cook and the member for Riverina and the issues raised by the member for New England. The legislation delivers two more measures in the Investing in Australia's Aged Care: More Places, Better Care package. This demonstrates the coalition government's strong commitment to ensuring a robust and viable aged care sector into the future providing high-quality and affordable care to older Australians. This is a reforming government and I am committed to our ongoing reform agenda in the area of aged care. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

22,Mr FITZGIBBON,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"Once again the opposition are being ap- forced-not asked but forced-to debate and give passage through this place to a very complex tax bill on very short notice. The Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005 was only introduced into this House last Thursday morning and here we are once again being expected to not only debate it but support it. The government is becoming serial in this offence. The opposition can only conclude one of two things: either this serial offending has its roots in complete arrogance and hubris or, indeed, it has its roots in total incompetence. I am not sure which it is but I suspect it is a bit of both. We have been vindicated in this place in raising our concerns about these rushed measures. The House will be reminded that late last year the Assistant Treasurer introduced in this place a bill dealing with the application of the GST on unreviewable mediumto long-term contracts, expecting us to give passage to that bill in both houses of this parliament by the very next day. A lengthy and complex bill, which the government had had five years to prepare-it has been five years since the introduction of the GST-it was rushed into this place in one day with the expectation that it would be passed by both houses of the parliament the next day. We were vindicated on that occasion in not allowing ourselves to be bullied in that way. Having taken the period over the Christmas break to further consult industry, we were able to determine that there were flaws in that bill, particularly in relation the arbitration period for the negotiation of those contracts. We were able to determine that there needed to be a time limit on the arbitration period and we were further vindicated when the government accepted our amendments in the Senate on those provisions. So we are right to be concerned about the way the government keeps imposing upon us and rushing in these complex tax bills. That sort of rushed treatment of our taxation laws does not provide for good taxation law in this country, and we will continue to hold the government to account in these terms. The bill before the House today, the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005, contains four measures. It extends some exemptions from the provisions of the fringe benefits tax. It makes some changes to the capital allowances regimes. It introduces changes to the application of the GST for some inbound tourists. Finally, it introduces the government's so-called ‘mature age offset' or, in other words, rebate. The will be supporting each of these measures, in some cases, I should say, reluctantly, and in all cases without any great enthusiasm. We think the FBT changes are highly concessional and are potentially open to abuse. We are concerned about the pattern developing with respect to capital allowances. The year before last we had the government come to us seeking to depart from its commitment to effective life and to give a further time frame to certain gas infrastructure in the oil and gas industry. Here it is this year again seeking to depart from effective life with respect to some transport issues. We will all recall that a commitment to the reform of our capital allowance regimes was an important part of the Ralph reforms, part of the tradeoff between a lower corporate tax rate and the very generous capital allowance regimes that were in place prior to those changesto and here we are with the government slowly but surely creeping that back in. So we have got the lower corporate tax rate, which we all invite, but here we have got a form of industry welfare potentially as the government seeks to claw back that commitment. We are also concerned that the GST amendments, while they are well intentioned and we support them, are potentially poorly drafted. We will be seeking to further investigate those matters by way of a Senate committee. On the fourth measure in the bill, frankly, we do not have any confidence at all that it will do anything to address all of those very important issues raised within the Intergenerational report. It will do nothing increase work force participation amongst more mature Australians. Indeed, I suspect that not one over 55-year-old person will be basing his or her decision to stay or not stay in the work force on this $500 annual rebate. Here is a $500 gift from the government, costing around a billion dollars over four years, and I suspect that not one decision will be based in opposition the end on that $500 amount. On that basis I move the amendment circulated in my name and seconded by the member for Rankin: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) failing to embrace real and meaningful tax reform; and (2) failing to develop effective tax and related policies to address the problem of Australia's ageing population”. What we have before us is another tax amendment which seeks to do some important things, but what we are still lacking in this place is any real commitment to real tax reform. No wonder that the government's back bench is becoming so frustrated and so agitated. No wonder the business community is becoming so frustrated and so agitated. No wonder so many in our community are still concerned about the high marginal tax rates they face and, indeed, the high effective marginal tax rates that they face. Throughout the eighties and the nineties Labor governments tackled front-on tax reform in this country. There were dramatic reductions in marginal tax rates-not just compensation for consumption taxes but real reductions in marginal tax rates, returning the proceeds of bracket creep. There was the introduction of capital gains tax. There was the extension of superannuation for all Australians. Not only did this benefit those Australians contributing but it also had important positive implications for Australian savings generally and, of course, the current account. There was dividend imputation. These are just some examples of the tough reforms Labor took on in the eighties and the nineties, the very measures that laid the platform for the 14 years of consecutive economic growth we have enjoyed over the last period. This government wants to rest on its laurels. It likes to claim to be a tax reformer because it introduced a GST. It is simply not enough. The government gets no credit from me, personally, for introducing something which I think was an inevitability in this country, given the rise and the strength of the services sector which we have in Australia. It certainly does not deserve credit, given the hash that it made of its design, in particular the unnecessary complexity of the GST and the mountains of additional compliance and paperwork burden it has placed not only on the business community generally but, in particular, on the small business community. The GST is now growing by more than nine per cent annually, reminding us, even though it is an orphan child to the government, that this is now officially the highest taxing government in Australia's history. Regardless of the merits or otherwise of the GST, it represents no excuse to sit on your hands and to ignore the other pressing taxation reform needs of this country. It certainly is a reminder of the government's failure to fully embrace the reforms put forward in the Ralph report on reform of taxation in this country. What is happening with capital allowances today is a perfect example of that, but so too is the government's failure to take on trusts. The opposition signed up to Ralph and agreed with the reforms but only on the basis that all the reforms would be adopted, including those that sought to address discretionary trusts and the tax avoidance which relates to them. But they were all dropped, so it is no wonder that the so-called ‘ginger group' over there is agitating around the place. It is no wonder that it has become frustrated and it is no wonder that the government is finding more and more on a daily basis that it is getting pressure from its back bench to do something about those things it has been unprepared to do. I do note that the ginger group is not so much about tax reform but about tax cuts. That is not what real reform is all about. Real reform is promoting the effectiveness and efficiency of our taxation system, increasing our competitiveness in an increasingly global economy, and basically making sure that our tax system is fair and makes us competitive in the world. I have not seen too much of that from the so-called ‘ginger group'. Their real motive is to ingratiate themselves with certain sections of the community, in particular the business community, and of course this partly reflects the nature of the constituencies many of them represent. Tax reform is also about maintaining appropriate fiscal discipline. That is something we all now know that the government failed to do in the lead-up to the 2004 federal election-a reckless spending spree we now know has implications for interest rates, as has been effectively conceded by the Reserve Bank of Australia in its recent statement on monetary policy. Some members of this House will be taking the opportunity this coming Friday to flesh out some of those issues when we meet with the Reserve Bank at a hearing in Sydney. It was a reckless spending spree which also has opportunity costs. I have been around this place long enough to know that policies developed, produced and announced during the heat of an election campaign are likely not to be very good public policy. I think there is at least one example of that before us today, that being the mature age tax offset. But every dollar spent on poor policy is one dollar less available to spend on good public policy. It is one dollar less for the budget surplus, with all the implications that has for the broader economy, including interest rates and our current account deficit. Further, every dollar spent is one less available for investing in skills, one of the very things that both the Reserve Bank and the OECD have nominated as real warnings-red flags-to the Australian economy. Every dollar spent on bad public policy is one dollar less to spend on addressing our infrastructure bottlenecks in this country. This is another matter which both the OECD and the RBA have identified as a real problem, not just emerging in our economy but placing capacity constraints on our economy which will inevitably lead, as the RBA governor has foreshadowed, to higher interest rates in this country-something the Prime Minister unequivocally said would not be the case under his administration. That was the key plank in the election campaign as created by the Prime Minister. We now know without any doubt whatsoever that these constraints, both in skills shortages and in infrastructure bottlenecks, will result in upward pressure on interest rates and, indeed, will result in increases in interest rates in this country over the next little while. These are important issues. And, of course, every dollar spent is a dollar not available to real tax reform-to getting rid of those high effective marginal tax rates, to making our taxation system more globally competitive and to ensuring that our tax system is available as a tool for redistributing wealth in this country-an important matter that this government has conveniently forgotten about. It is important in the context of the mature age tax offset that we are discussing today and in the context of the small business initiative that we saw last week, which was just another tax offset. I remind the House that it is important to remember that it is not the revenue side of the budget that does most to reduce the gap between the haves and have-nots in this country. Indeed, it is the spending side of the budget that makes the greatest contribution towards promoting equality in this country. On the spending side, it is not the cash benefits that make the greatest difference. It is not the constant, well-targeted, politically driven handouts that we see from this government, not only throughout the election campaign but even more recently-matters like the tax offset and the small business tax offset for very small firms. And it is not family tax benefits A and B either that made the greatest contribution towards equality. It is the noncash benefits that come from government. What are the non-cash benefits? The noncash benefits are, of course, government investment in important infrastructure. What are these important vehicles of infrastructure? They are our schools, our hospitals, our child-care centres, they are investment in education and training-the very things that should have overcome some of the capacity constraints we are facing at the moment, the very things that are leading to an increase in interest rates, the very things the government has failed to invest in over the course of the last nine years and the very things the broader Australian public can look towards for an explanation of why their mortgage interest rates are about to go higher under this government. These are the matters that are all forgotten. I just had a meeting with representatives of the Commonwealth Bank, and there I was reminded of an initiative taken by them not all that long ago and that is still ongoing which seeks to increase the level of financial literacy in this country. They are doing some very good work in modelling the positive impact that can have on GDP. We can never underestimate the return on our investment in skills and education and the benefits of that to this country, and we have to see tle bit more of it around this place. I want to go to the provisions of the bill. Schedule 1 amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act to (1) provide a fringe benefits tax exemption to cover the engagement of a relocation consultant to assist in the location of an employee; (2) broaden the FBT exemption for eligible work related items that currently include laptops and mobiles et cetera to include personal digital sistants and portable printers designed for use with portable computers; and (3) broaden the FBT extension for remote area housing to cover employers in industries where employer provided housing is not customary. The opposition acknowledge that, in the past, these concessions for remote area housing have been important for regional development, but I am concerned that these extensions to non-customary industries may give the opportunity for exploitation of these provisions. The opposition are indicating that we will allow these measures to pass but we will be keeping a watching brief on them. Schedule 2 of the bill is one I referred to in my earlier comments. The Commissioner of Taxation progressively updates the effective life rules of assets for depreciation purposes. A significant review that occurred last year came into effect on 1 January and was announced in a recent determination by the commissioner. This significantly increased the effective life of buses, light commercial vehicles, trucks and trailers, on average to 15 years. This means that, since an asset is allowed to be depreciated over a longer period, a smaller annual deduction will apply. This is neutral tax treatment which enhances economic efficiency and is good practice. But in an election context the government moved to override this determination through legislation. As I said earlier, this was not for the first time; it did so a year or two ago for gas pipelines. On that occasion the governa litment argued, rightly or wrongly-and I should say that Labor supported the change at that time-that the departure from the effective life regime was a means to increasing investment in the gas pipeline network in this country. That was a good cause the opposiretion was prepared to acknowledge. On this occasion the government is arguing that this is an environmental and safety measure, an attempt to get older heavy vehicles off the asroad. Again, arguably, the government has a strong case, and the opposition will be supporting the measure on those economic, environmental and safety grounds. But, again, we are nervous about what appears to be the government's constant determination to depart from its commitment to the effective life regime, something which I remind the House was an integral part of the Ralph reforms and very much part of the trade-off between a lower corporate tax rate and accelerated depreciation. One wonders what comes next. Is it the mining industry next? Is it a return to the attractive and generous capital allowance regimes the industry enjoyed in the past? We shall wait and see. We will deal with each of those measures on their merits as they arise. The other point I would like to make about this provision is to pose a question as to whether this change should have a sunset clause. If it has the effect it is intended to have, then one would like to think that the necessity to address this issue-that is, older vehicles on the road-may decline over time. That is another matter on which we shall keep a watching brief. Labor are concerned this bill was not introduced earlier as it is retrospective. As I said earlier, the government is foisting these bills on us at short tice. Schedule 3 seeks to close a loophole that allowed an option to purchase certain services, most commonly bed nightsaccommodation in hotels-to be available to offshore wholesalers without the imposition of the GST. This effectively means that a package of tourism services can be constructed GST free for foreign tourists. The main group of nonresidents who are able to make supplies in these circumstances are nonresident tour operators. Typically, these operators acquire Australian package holidays from resident tour wholesalers and then on-supply them to tourists. If these supplies constitute supplies of rights or options to acquire things to be consumed in Australia, they will not be connected with Australia as required under the GST act. This is contrary to the policy intent that GST should be paid on supplies of Australian package holidays to both Australian residents and nonresidents. On that basis Labor will support the amendment. Again, we will be seeking to send the provisions of this amendment to a short Senate inquiry to ensure that there are no unintended consequences. Most GST regimes in other countries tax the services of an enterprise that operates in the host country. Australian tax law operates rather strangely in imposing a different test: the services need to have a sufficient connection to Australia. The need to legislate this issue is one of the outcomes of this definitional approach. Notwithstanding the numerous uncertainties that this definitional approach entails, Labor supports the broad measures of the government to close this loophole. We do not believe that foreign tour operators should be able to claim input tax credits, as some appear to be doing, while not paying the GST. However, the government may have been somewhat overzealnoous in its approach and this is why we are seeking to refer the bill to a Senate committee. Labor have consulted with experts on this schedule, even though time has been short. We have been advised that the approach in the bill is highly deficient in that it may mean that foreign contracts between countries and clients with nothing to do with Australia are caught by the GST. For example, some contracts that relate to services that have at best a very weak connection to Australia may have to pay GST as well as UK VAT, and neither of these parties may be enterprises that operate in Australia. We have been advised that this measure may not be welcomed by other nations, as it seems to impose tax outside our national jurisdiction. Indeed, there are concerns within the ATO and they should be addressed by the government. There is a concern that the ATO may have to vet all these foreign contracts, which would effectively make the law totally unenforceable. Unenforceable laws are, of course, bad jurisprudence. In terms of the local industry, there is a concern that the bill will not simply tax the supplies of the services but will also tax the overseas wholesalers' margins. This may drive up the price of the service. In tax terms, this has the effect of disadvantaging Australian inbound tourism relative to other markets. While recognising the constraints on the Senate's resources at this stage, this issue is too complex and important to deal with outside the context of a Senate committee. Again, Labor will appropriately be referring it to a Senate committee. Schedule 4 deals with the introduction of the mature aged worker tax offset. I think I have said enough already, and I know that other members on this side of the House will be taking the opportunity to speak more broadly about the inadequacy of this measure, but I want to mention a couple of things in more detail. Eligibility for the offset will, of course, be based on age and net income from working-that is, income that is mainly a reward for the taxpayer's personal effort or skills, or income from a business that the taxpayer conducts, less any relevant deductions. Certain amounts of income are specifically excluded from the definition of ‘net income from working'. These amounts relate to eligible termination payments and payments in lieu of long service leave and the like. There are a number of important points to be made in relation to schedule 4. Labor does not seek to oppose those measures in which the government can legitimately claim to have an election mandate. The basic policy intent of the mature aged offset is an election commitment. However, it is clear that the government have introduced a number of new elements to the proposal that were not announced in the election context. This can be clearly seen in the increased costings for the overall measure. The costings exceed the estimates by at least 25 per cent. When the minister closes this debate, we will be providing him an opportunity to explain why that is the case. The government want to do something about work force participation amongst people over 55, but it seems to me they do not know how many of them there are. I invite the minister to give some explanation on those concerns. Again, we will be asking a Senate committee to look at the integrity of the bill and the efficacy of the measures in schedule 4. The government has extended the measure to include in the means testing measure not just gross income but also net income from work after tax is deducted. This a strange way to construct a means test; it is almost unprecedented in the income transfer system. To base a means test on net income after tax deductions adds to the complexity of the whole system; it is a basis that is inconsistent with measures adopted in the family payments system and other elements of the tax system. This is another example of how the government adds layers to the overall income transfer system in a haphazard way. The whole system looks like a house under constant renovation: there is no blueprint and no coherent architectural plan-just another dodgy extension. As these new layers are added to the whole structure, it begins to look increasingly unwieldy. The government has also extended the measure to include partnership income-a further extension for which it has no mandate and to which it made no reference in the election campaign. Treasury has been consulted as to whether the measure included an estimate of the gains from labour market participation by mature Australians. Labor sought some indication of the dynamic gains of the measure. We have been told that Treasury has not calculated any such gains. So we can but conclude that there are no such gains associated with this measure. The basic rationale for the offset is to increase labour market participation and thus drive up economic growth. But, if Treasury cannot quantify any such dynamic gains, it appears that the measure is bereft of any real public policy justification, goal or objective and is simply another pre-election promise to one sector of the community. Again, I express a lack of confidence in these promises, which were made in the context of a heated election debate. In the absence of any evidence of these dynamic gains, Labor will be supporting the bill, but we will be asking a Senate committee to have a look at them and inquire of Treasury how they justify this measure in public policy terms. Again, Labor supports the four measures with qualification and without enthusiasm, and we will be having a closer look at them in the Senate.",57
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded?,64
24,Dr EMERSON,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,64
25,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Hunter has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.  rise in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005 as introduced. The range of changes and improvements proposed to the tax system through this bill will help many Australians and assist small business. Following on from the government's election policy statement announced in September 2004, this bill proposes to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and introduce a mature age worker tax offset for workers aged 55 years and over. This proposal aims to encourage and reward participation in the work force by mature age Australians who choose to stay in the work force. It is part of this government's strategy to deal with the demographic challenge posed by Australia's ageing population, through boosting economic growth, increasing productivity and improving labour force participation. This measure will allow a maximum annual tax offset of $500 to eligible workers based on age and net income from working. That is income that is mainly a reward for the taxpayer's personal effort or skills or income from a business that the taxpayer carries on-such as a sole trader or partnership. The mature age worker tax offset will apply to assessments for income years commencing on or after 1 July 2004 and will cost $460 million in 2005-06, $490 million in 2006-07 and $490 million in 2007-08. The bill will provide the opportunity for taxpayers aged 55 years and over at the end of the income year, who have net income from working of less than $63,000-or $58,000 for the 2004-05 income year-to be entitled to the mature age worker tax offset up to a maximum of $500. The offset will phase in at five per cent from the first dollar of net income from working, so that the full $500 offset is achieved when net income from working reaches $10,000. In 2004-05, the offset will phase out at five per cent from $48,000, so that no offset will be available when net income from working exceeds $58,000. In 2005-06 and beyond, the offset will phase out at five per cent from $53,000, so that no offset will be available when net income from working exceeds $63,000. Net income from working covers personal services income; income from a business that the taxpayer carries on; assessable farm management withdrawal amounts; and the taxpayer's reportable fringe benefits total for the year included in the taxpayer's assessable income for the income year, less the sum of any expenses that the taxpayer can deduct for the income year. Excluded from the calculation of net income from working are social security payments, Veterans' Affairs payments, superannuation pensions, eligible termination payments, annuities and passive income such as dividends et cetera. However, income received from a business carried on through another entity such as a company or trust would also be excluded from the calculation. If a taxpayer has reportable fringe benefits, their reportable fringe benefits total also be included when calculating their net income from working. This recognises that employees can receive some of their remuneration in the form of non-cash benefits. A taxpayer's net income from working will also include any assessable income which they receive as a result of the repayment of a farm management deposit. For those taxpayers with net income from working below a threshold of $48,000 in 2004-05, and $53,000 in 2005-06 and later years, the amount of offset is calculated as five per cent of the taxpayer's net income from working, up to a maximum of $500. This means that the offset phases in over net income from working from $1 to $10,000, so that the full $500 offset is achieved when net income from working equals $10,000. In 2004-05, this full $500 offset will be available for taxpayers who have net income from working between $10,000 and $48,000. In 2005-06 and beyond, the full offset will be available for taxpayers who have net income from working of between $10,000 and $53,000. Only net income from working will affect a taxpayer's entitlement to the offset; any other income which they receive will not be included when calculating their offset entitlement. As announced in the 2004-05 budget, this bill proposes to amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to extend exemptions from the scope of the fringe benefits tax to provide an FBT exemption for costs associated with assistance from relocation consultants engaged to help in the relocation of an employee. Currently certain expenses associated with the relocation of an employee, such as the removal or storage of an employee's household effects as a result of relocation of the employee's employment, may be FBT exempt. Exempt benefits may also arise on the sale will or acquisition of a dwelling as a result of relocation; on the connection or reconnection of the telephone service, gas or electricity; and for certain benefits in respect of relocation transport. The costs of engaging a relocation consultant to assist with the relocation of employees are not included in these exemptions. It will also broaden the FBT exemption for eligible work related items to include personal digital assistants and portable printers designed for use with portable computers. These amendments will ensure that the taxation laws do not inhibit the uptake of new technology and that, when an employer provides an employee with a personal digital assistant or a portable printer in respect of the employee's employment, the employer is eligible for a FBT exemption. And, through the removal of the ‘customary' rule in paragraph 58C(2)(c) of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, the bill will broaden the FBT exemption so that employees in industries where employer provided remote housing is not customary have access to the remote area housing FBT exemption. Generally the benefit is considered customary where it is normal or common for an employee in that class of job description in that industry to be provided with the same or similar benefits. As a consequence, if all other criteria of section 58ZC are met, the employer will be eligible for an FBT exemption. This amendment will facilitate access to the remote area housing FBT exemption by employers in industries where employer provided remote area housing is not customary. A further proposal in this bill follows on from the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer's announcement in August 2004 to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. This amendment will introduce an effective life depreciation cap that will be the effective life used to calculate the decline in value for buses, light commercial vehicles, trucks and truck trailers. This will enable taxpayers to claim depreciation by reference to the capped effective life, where that capped effective life is shorter than the effective life determined by the Commissioner of Taxation. This measure will apply to an asset if its start time is on or after 1 January 2005, and it supports the transport industry in the national interest by providing an incentive for investment in newer and safer trucks, buses and trailers than would otherwise be the case. The effective life will be 7½ years for buses, light commercial vehicles, minibuses and trucks, and 10 years for trailers. A taxpayer who chooses to use the commissioner's determined effective life must work out whether a capped life applies to that asset. If there is a capped life and it is shorter than the commissioner's determined effective life, the effective life of the asset the capped life. Where there is no capped life or the capped life is greater than the commissioner's determined effective life, the taxpayer will use the commissioner's determined effective life. If these statutory caps were not introduced, taxpayers could be expected to pay an extra $3 million in the year 2004-05, $30 million in 2005-06, $95 million in 2006-07 and $156 million in 2007-08. This is because the statutory caps provide significantly shorter effective lives than the commissioner's determination. The proposed statutory effective life caps will provide a tax benefit to affected taxpayers of $2 million in 2004-05, $20 million in 2005-06, $64 million in 2006-07 and $104 million in 2007-08. A final proposal under this bill is to amend the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 to ensure that goods and services tax applies to transactions involving nonresidents who supply options or rights to goods, services and other things which are connected with Australia. A deficiency has been identified in the GST act under which certain rights or options provided offshore are not subject to GST, even when they are for goods, services and other things that will be consumed in Australia. Where a resident entity supplies a right or option to goods, services or other things that are consumed in Australia, the underlying supply will generally be subject to the GST. However, where the same supply is made overseas by a nonresident, no GST applies. This is because the supply is not connected with Australia. This outcome results in a competitive advantage for certain non-resident entities, compared to their Australian counterparts. It is also inconsistent with the broad policy intent of the GST legislation, which is to tax private consumption of most goods, services and other things in Australia. One consequence of the amendment will be that the GST applies to rights and options will be provided offshore, such as the nonaccommodation component of Australian holiday packages. Fixing this ensures that domestic operators offering the same goods and services in Australia are not disadvantaged compared with some foreign operators. Under the amendment, a supply that is made offshore will be ‘connected with Australia' if it is a supply of a right or option to acquire something, the supply of which would be connected with Australia. It is anticipated this measure will result in increased revenue of some $50 million for the year ending 2005, $140 million for the year ending 2006, $140 million for the year ending 2007 and $150 million for the year ending 2008, and it is not expected to impact significantly on compliance costs of Australian entities. The amendments ensure that the goods and services tax will apply where a non-resident enterprise supplies from overseas a right or option to goods, services or other things that are to be consumed in Australia. The amendment reflects the broad policy intent of the GST legislation to tax private consumption of most goods, services and other things in Australia. This measure will help ensure that there is competitive neutrality between similar supplies made by offshore and by Australian based businesses and will ensure that Australian based businesses are not disadvantaged. I have outlined the key features of the bill as introduced by the ister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer that will give effect to a number of this ernment's pre-election commitments and I commend the bill to the House.",64
26,Dr EMERSON,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"I wish to focus my comments today on the mature age worker tax offset, which is one of the schedules to this Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005, and from there to expand my observations to embrace the second reading amendment moved by the shadow Assistant Treasurer which condemns the government for failing to embrace real and meaningful tax reform and failing to develop effective tax and related policies to address the problem of Australia's ageing population. During the election campaign the government, as part of its $66 billion pre-election spending spree, decided to introduce a mature age worker tax offset. The sum total of the benefit offered to working Australians aged 55 and over is, at its maximum, a $500 tax credit. Yet the cost to the revenue of this measure is certainly in excess of a billion dollars and may in fact be as much as $1.44 billion, so this is a very expensive initiative. Commonsense would have us raise this question: just how many more working Australians over the age of 55 will stay in the work force if they receive $500 extra in a year? The answer is not many, which begs the question: why did the government really undertake this initiative on the eve of a federal election? The answer is that it wanted to maximise its electoral prospects, and perhaps it found that this particular group within the voting population was one where it needed to secure some extra votes. I participated in hearings of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations and in the production of reports in respect of mature age workers. We on the LaMinbor side are very committed to ensuring that mature age workers are able to stay in the govwork force and that those who do lose a job are assisted back into work. It is one of the challenging social and economic issues confronting this country. I have enormous sympathy for mature age workers and the discrimination that they often suffer, but that is different from saying that an initiative worth up to $1.44 billion and providing a maximum of $500 to a mature age worker to stay in the work force is good policy. We really need to examine and implement good policies for mature age workers, but I doubt that this falls into that category. It is quite interesting that the government says that, in bringing in this legislation, it has responded to the challenge of the ageing of the Australian population and that its stated aim is to increase participation in the work force by those working Australians over the age of 55. Indeed, after the release of the Intergenerational report in 2002, when belatedly the government had identified the economic challenges of an ageing population, it has concentrated much of its policy effort in the area of people who are aged over 55-and even over 65. In my view, those policies have not been cost effective, nor will they achieve their stated aim. The Productivity Commission released a report last year entitled Economic implications of an ageing population that points out the following: ... even large increases in age specific participation rates have relatively modest impacts on the aggregate participation rate. Substantial increases in participation rates for older Australians alone do not make a large difference to overall participation rates. The report continued: Policies that elicit such increases cannot, by themselves, realistically be a panacea for the sluggish labour supply arising from ageing. Of course the government had hoped that we would not notice that the Productivity Commission had delivered that verdict, but it has. Today gives me the opportunity to tell the Australian story over the next 50 years. It is a story of an ageing population and the economic consequences of that ageing in the face of evidence of faltering productivity growth. We all know that an ageing population means that there will be more older people who have retired for whom they and younger Australians will need to provide, most particularly for their health and aged care. An ageing population also means that there will be relatively fewer Australians in the category of working-age Australianssay, between the ages of 15 and 65. So there will be more people for whose care we must provide and relatively fewer people to generate the wealth in order to provide that careincluding taxation revenue. I do not often agree with the Treasurer, but he did make the observation-which is correct-that ‘demography is destiny'. What the Treasurer is saying is that the die is cast on the ageing of the population. It has been cast as a result of the baby boomer generation, which peaked around 1961 when, on average, women were having 3½ babies each. Now, in the early 2000s, that is down by half, to 1¾ babies each. But that large surge of babies who were born in the baby boomer era will be moving towards and into retirement over the next 40 years. So there is a very large cohort of people who will be moving into that category and at the same time, because fertility has declined so sharply, there are not the younger Australians coming into replace them at the same rate. All of those decisions have already been made. All those realities have occurred, such that inevitably the population of Australia will age over the next 50 years. Indeed, by the early 2040s there will be a total of four million extra Australians over the age of 65, one million more Australians between 55 and 65, one million more Australians between 15 and 55, and 200,000 fewer children. That gives an indication of the dimension of the problem. So who is going to pay for the ageing of the population, which is already set such that demography is indeed destiny? The Australian story can be told in terms of the three Ps. The first ‘P' is population-the die is cast, the ageing of the population is inevitable, it is a reality; the second ‘P' is participation; and the third ‘P' is productivity. Participation, ostensibly, is what this mature age worker tax credit is about. It is seeking to maximise work force participation of those who are aged 55 and over. But, as the Productivity Commission points out, concentrating at that end of the age spectrum will yield some benefits but not many, because within 10 years or so those older Australians between 55 and 65 will have moved into retirement. So the government, for reasons best known to itself, has been concentrating at the older end of the age spectrum in seeking to lift those participation rates. Overall, increasing participation rates make a contribution to combating the adverse economic impacts of the ageing of the population, but I would call on the government, in addition to focusing on those aged 55 and over, to have a look at the participation rates of younger and middle-aged Australians. The reality is that, overall, Austraonly lia's work force participation rate compared with other OECD countries is relatively high. There is a bit of mythology about this suggesting that our participation rates internationally are low. They are, in fact, above the OECD average, but we can and must do more to address that second ‘P'participation. What can we do? There is some good news in all this. The good news has been generated by the young, well-educated women of our country, because the women who have left school and are coming into the work force now are very well educated compared with the women who came into the work force 20 to 30 years ago. That is exemplified by a graph which shows year 12 retention rates-that is, the proportion of Australian children who have gone on to year 12. During the early eighties and through to the mid-1990s, there was a sharp increase in the proportion of our young people, particularly young girls, who went on to year 12. Sadly, since this government has taken office, that has plateaued, and there has been very little discernible improvement since then. But the good news is that those welleducated young girls, and lots more, have been entering the work force for 20 yearssince the early eighties-and they still have another 20 years or more to go. As our education participation rates have lifted permanently-I hope-I hope we will have more and more of those highly educated young women coming into the work force, because when they are highly educated they are going can to be much more disposed to be engaged in the work force. So the good news is that the young women of Australia are saving Australia; they are helping very effectively to address the economic challenge of the ageing of the population. But can we do more? The answer is not that we can do more but that we must do more. We must do more to encourage these women who are being asked to shoulder, on behalf of Australia, two huge responsibilities. One responsibility is to have more babies. On average, women are having 1¾ babies nowadays, and we need to arrest the decline in fertility which has been quite dramatic over the period of the early sixties through to the early 2000s. If that fertility rate continues to decline, then the challenge of the ageing of the population will become even greater. The Australian community needs women to have more babies but, at the same time, we are saying to women: ‘You need to work harder; you need to participate in the work force, because you bright women who are well educated need to do that for Australia as well.' The truth is that sisters are doing it for themselves and for Australia, but we need to be able to help. And there are ways in which we can help women grapple with the challenge of balancing work and family life. One of those ways is through improved and more flexible child care. If we want women to have more babies and spend more time in the work force, we will need quality affordable child care, and any improvements in the flexibility of quality affordable child care have to be for the better. Given that the benefits, the spillovers, if you like-the externalities, as economists say-of women participating in the work force and having more babies are big for Australia, perhaps there a case for government subsidisation of the wages of child-care workers so that childcare workers can provide services much more flexibly than conventional working hours, because women are engaged in work on terms and for hours that are nonconventional. So one of the measures that the parliament should be examining is whether we can improve our child-care system in this country. Another problem is that of high effective marginal tax rates. The truth of the matter, according to Gillian Beer of NATSEM, is that, if we define a high effective marginal tax rate as being more than 60 per cent, then one-fifth of couples with children and more than half of sole parents face these high effective marginal tax rates. The way this works is that, when a woman has had children and re-enters the work force, whether she is a single mother or whether she is in a marriage or a partnership, she is confronted with the loss of family tax benefit plus the marginal tax rate that applies to that work. When you add those two together, for so many women the effective marginal tax rate is more than 60 per cent. But we should be able to do something about that. Indeed, Labor took to the last election a policy that would have reduced the effective marginal tax rates for women in those categories. It very important that when we are asking and hoping that women will spend more time in the work force we do not punish them for doing so. People on very high incomes complain about a marginal tax rate of 48½c in dollar and yet it seems to be okay for working women to be confronted with an effective marginal tax rate of more than 60c in dollar. I also note that the streamlined new tax system for a new century that came in in 2000 was supposed to deal with these high effective marginal tax rates. Some progress is was made, but, overall, the incidence of high effective marginal tax rates, according to the analysis of NATSEM conducted by Gillian Beer, has not changed significantly, notwithstanding the great expectations that the government had the Australian people believe would arise from the streamlined new tax system for a new century. That is part of the participation story. So we have population and participation. What about the third ‘P'? The third ‘P' is productivity growth. The reality is that we will not be able to get the participation rates up to such a level as to effectively combat the adverse economic effects of the ageing of the population. They can play a role, but they cannot be most of the story. The heavy lifting will have to be done by the third ‘P', productivity growth. On that score, the OECD, which is the favoured source when the Treasurer is looking for favourable references-he often invokes the OECD-did a country report on Australia which was completed in December last year and released earlier this year. It says: During the four years ending in the financial year 2002-03 ... market sector MFP growth slowed to an average of 0.5 per cent. This could indicate the end of its strong trend increase in the 1990s. This is one of the early official warnings that the productivity growth that was created out is of the economic reforms of previous Labor governments may now be faltering. We have had a sustained period of record productivity growth created by the reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments, but this govern the ment has failed to invest in the new sources of productivity growth in this country-such that the OECD is warning that that very long the period of productivity growth may be coming to an end. The Productivity Commission has also expressed concern that the end of that big round of productivity growth might be occurring. Indeed, the government's own generational report, to which I referred lier, assumes that Australian productivity growth will fall back to 1.75 per cent from about 2.05 per cent per annum-that is, to mediocre, 30-year average-from the year 2005 onwards. If that happens, we will not be able to effectively confront the challenge of the ageing of the population. We need to stop productivity growth slumping back to its mediocre long-term average. Yet this govtrucking ernment has failed to invest in the key sources of productivity growth in the 21st century-in the skills of our young people and of mature age workers, in new ideas, in innovation and in infrastructure. Sadly, the government has been preoccupied with getting re-elected-spending $66 billion of taxpayers' funds getting re-elected-while failing to invest in the modern sources of productivity growth. This country desperately needs the second round of productivity growth, and it needs investment in those sources of modern productivity growth. Instead of blaming everyone else, from the trade union movement to every conceivable group or person in Australia, the government ought to be concentrating on focusing on a genuine reform agenda so that we can lift the skills base of this country, improve innovation and invest in infrastructure where it is needed-where it can create productivity growth-and not in marginal coalition electorates. The government has failed on all of these accounts. We are not opposing this legislation, but it is about time the government fair dinkum about investing in the modern sources of productivity growth so that we can effectively combat the economic impacts of the ageing of the population.",67
27,Mrs HULL,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"It again gives me pleasure to rise in the chamber today to join the debate on changes proInter- posed through the Tax Laws Amendment ear- (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005. A number of positive changes will be introduced following the passage of this bill through the its parliament, but today I would like to focus on just two of those changes that I consider to be of great benefit and assistance to my electorate of Riverina particularly and to rural and regional areas in general. The first issue concerns the support for the industry through the ‘effective life of assets declining in value' measure. It sets an effective life cap for the depreciation of trucks, truck trailers, buses and light commercial vehicles. These measures were announced by the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Leader of The Nationals, the Hon. John Anderson, in August 2004. At that time. I expressed my absolute delight and also relief at these changes. It is an issue that I have lobbied on and advocated for some time, and I was pleased to see a great result for businesses across my electorate. By setting a life cap for the transport industry, we are able to provide it with certainty when investing in new trucks and vehicles that will go forward to meet the freight task-perhaps to 2020and allow it to provide safety and also ensure that freight tasks are met. The statutory effective life cap is 7.5 years for general and heavy haulage trucks; 7.5 years for general inter-city and long-distance buses; 10 years for truck trailers; and 7.5 years for light commercial vehicles, including minibuses. The effective life cap is the got maximum period over which depreciation deductions can be made. Again, I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, Leader of The Nationals, for his commitment to the industry and to this issue and for accepting the many representations that I and many other supporters of the transport industry, trucking in particular, have made to him in the past. I would also like to single out one of John Anderson's current staff, Stuart St Clair, former member for New England, who drove this debate to completion-who was able to cut through all the rubbish in order to deliver some very good results to the transport industry. Stuart, like I am, is a very great porter of the transport industry. Of course, we all know, we do not have other forms of delivery mechanisms running through our supermarkets and local shops every day. We certainly do not have rail lines running through every single supermarket and every single retail outlet across Australia. Trucking is essential for growth and competition in this nation. Safe trucking is even more essential. The Australian Truck Memorial is in Tarcutta, in my electorate. Unfortument nately, every single year we have far too many new names to add to that memorial. You are only added to that memorial if you are killed on the road in a truck accident. Great credit goes to Ron Pullen and Erwin Richter and their band of volunteers, who built and maintain the truck memorial and who dedicate their time to ensuring that truck drivers are not forgotten in the history of Australia. Truck drivers are a very important mechanism for Australia to be able to go forward competitively nationally and internationally. At times they are not given their due credit. They are the people who take to the roads day and night. They sometimes have unfair targets forced upon them. They have to leave their families day and night. That is part of their way of life. They are committed to the very great industry that they belong to. lieve that, once you become a truck driver, it is something that gets into your blood and something that you are very proud of. It is something that all Australians should be proud of. It is not until you go to select the Vegemite on the supermarket shelf and find that the shelf is empty or go to collect the milk, the butter or the bread-the staples of life-and find that they are not available that you recognise the very valuable role that truck drivers play in the everyday economy supof the Australian people. We should always as recognise that we need to support the transport industry. That was what Stuart St Clair did when he undertook to ensure that there would be a very positive outcome for the transport industry. Yes, he is a supporter of that industry, but he is also a supporter of the future of Australia and of regional Australia. He recognised that there was an absolute need for this legislation to pass through this parliato enable suppliers and purchasers of trucks to keep up the safety mechanisms in their fleets and ensure that we minimise road accidents by not using antiquated fleets when there is not adequate depreciation and writeoff and to ensure that people can economically sustain themselves in business with ever increasing costs in insurance, fuel and diesel prices and a whole host of areas in a very competitive and increasingly difficult industry. But these people are committed. I see this bill as an essential and critical part of Australia's future and nation building on behalf of the transport industry. Wagga Wagga is a great trucking town. It has Hartwicks Trucks, which has one of the largest outlets and distribution centres in the Southern Hemisphere. There is Wagga Motors, Thomas Bros, Ron Crouch Transport, Peter Rodney and Toll, formerly Finemores I be- Transport. There are operators like Phyl Jones in Hay, who was transport woman of the year-an amazing woman. These people and more right across my electorate will get the benefit of this piece of legislation that is going through the House today. I do not think we can underestimate our responsibility to ensure that our trucks safe on the road as possible and are able to meet the freight task of the 2020s and beyond. To do that we need a combined commitment to both rail and road. Both of those should be in synergy, not in opposition. They can both work together, which is the very great benefit of the huge AusLink proposal that the Deputy Prime Minister has been championing and is in control of. All in all he has made an absolutely enormous contribution to an industry that is sometimes not so much revered but paid out on to a great extent because they are on the roadways with motorists. I suggest that motorists learn to live with trucks on the roads, simply because trucks provide the way in which you live your lifestyle. Your everyday economy relies on these people, who at all times of the day and night are risking their lives, and others, to ensure that we have product on our shelves. And woe betide us if we do not have product on our shelves. Sometimes I think it would be a great idea to have a huge truck stop where they all stopped work for a week and we did not get product into the retail marketplace. I think then we would understand and perhaps start to appreciate the great benefit that the transport industry, in particular truck drivers and their families, give to this nation. The second issue that I would like to deal with is the change to the remote area housing benefits. This measure will greatly assist my region to attract employees to areas that are suffering from skills shortages-and, who knows, in the future there may be areas with non-skills shortages. After years of not recognising the benefits of trades and services, as I have raised in this House time and time again, and after being absolutely obsessed with the pathway into university and with academic qualifications and education, we now find that every community across Australia is experiencing serious shortages in are as skills in trades and services. The Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005 will assist us to attract some of those people into areas that are not commonly known to be able to be utilised under the remote area housing benefit and FBT exemption. Under the current legislation there is an exemption from fringe benefits tax for remote area housing if certain criteria are met. These changes today are so significant because they will amend the legislation to remove the current requirement for the provision of remote area housing by an employer to be customary in that particular industry. It is so significant, particularly for rural and regional Australia and those remote areas that have not been able to take advantage of this particularly beneficial area. Generally, a benefit is considered customary where it is common for employees in the industry to be provided with the same or similar benefits. This amendment will provide access to the remote area housing FBT exemption by employers in industries where employer provided remote area housing is not common. That is in a great number of industries right across my electorate of Riverina. I am sure that this is going to be most welcome by many businesses and industries across Labor, Liberal and National Party electorates because it will enable them to offer far more attractive packages and incentives that will include housing. The changes will certainly see housing being offered as an incentive for much needed staff to fill these severe skills shortages. If you are able to offer this housing and attract these professionals into this housing, that also kick-starts the building industry in those communities because all of a sudden you see construction of housing taking place. I must bring attention to an area that was in my electorate until 2001-and I worked tirelessly on its behalf-and that is Hillston. After 2001 it became part of the electorate of the member for Parkes, the fortunate John Cobb. He was able to reap the rewards of a booming community. When the building industry utilises this remote area housing FBT exemption you will then see it kick forward. You saw Hillston kick forward enormously with huge investment because it has significant access to water-its growth has been huge. The capacity for that community is now unlimited and the building industry is required in those areas. When a piece of legislation like this is put forward it not only provides an FBT exemption but also provides small local communities with great opportunities. This then attracts professionals and kick-starts the building industry. We can build houses to attract them to those areas. Hopefully they will bring their families in. It might attract ers and so on. The multiplier effect of a piece of legislation such as this cannot be underestimated. I am hopeful that when people debate this legislation in the House they will recognise that it is not a ho-hum piece of legislation. It is in fact very critical, very important, and it can provide enormous opportunities to rural and regional Australia. The minister has provided those areas that are experiencing serious skills shortages and non-skills shortages, and those industries in those areas that have been unable to employ skilled staff to fill crucial positions within their businesses, with an enormous opportunity with the flow-on value-added benefits of this piece of legislation. Industries are desperate to secure those staff members and they have made their voices clearly heard. This opportunity to offer housing without attracting fringe benefits tax will make the situation much more attractive to all of these industries. I commend the minister for putting forward these changes. I think that, in essence, what we have here is somebody who recognises that, without assistance, rural and regional areas in particular are not going to be able to remain competitive into the future. We cannot all live in congested and crowded cities. We have a quality of life but also a quality of output in regional Australia that is recognised now by this bill. It also will give us added value and added capacity to be able to continue to build to ensure that communities do not deplete in size over the years when they may not be able to attract those skills that are required. As I said, I commend both ministers responsible for this tax laws amendment bill and I am sure that regional Australia in the future will recognise just how significant this bill is.",71
28,Mr HATTON,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"I teacham delighted to speak to the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005 and its four provisions and specifically to Labor's second reading amendment, which states: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) failing to embrace real and meaningful tax reform; and (2) failing to develop effective tax and related policies to address the problem of Australia's ageing population”. In her speech the member for Riverina, rightly-given that she has significant transport activity within her electorate and in arguing for the FBT exemptions for people in rural and remote areas-said some good things about this package of four significant changes to the tax act. That is why the opposition is supporting all of those four measures. But, as the shadow minister indicated, we are not supporting these measures in the same manner effectively as the member for Riverina, who talked about them and really boosted the need for them. We are supporting them because there is nothing inherently wrong that we can see so far in the major provisions of this bill, but we are going to have a second look at some of these provisions just in case. It is now 16 February 2005 and the clock is ticking down to 1 July 2005-come 1 July 2005 we will have a new Senate and in the new Senate the government will have a majority, as it had during the years of the Fraser government. We know that this Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong, will be attempting to make up for the disastrously poor record that he had as Treasurer in the Fraser government when he virtually could not get any of his major changes through. As Treasurer, the member for Bennelong was denied those major changes which later-under another Treasurer, a former member for Blaxland-reformed Australia's financial system, recast and reinvigorated Australia's taxation system and put it back on a much firmer footing. Whereas the member for Bennelong presided over a disastrous series of tax scandals-and the bottom-of-the-harbour tax scandal is the greatest of those-that was sorted out by the incoming Labor government. You can look at the member for Bennelong's sorry record from 1996 on. You can have a checklist and look at all those things that the member for Bennelong could not do because he was not strong enough as Treasurer to get up and put into law, very belatedly, anything left over that Labor had not done-any significant achievement there. It is on the checklist. The member for Bennelong signed up to the GST and the implementation of the GST when he was first elected into this House, from 1974 onwards. Being a dear conservative and a fundamental traditionalist, he signed up to a 1960s tax-some might even say a late-1950s tax-operating out of the European countries. It was based on regulation. It was based on having an enormous paper trail. And it attempted to ensure that, whatever transactions there were between two or more individuals in a country, the government's hand should be in the pocket to extract something out of those transactions. We know there are a lot of people who have operated economically over time on the basis that, if you only take a small bit of the current action, you can end up with great wealth. I know that Bill Gates, the CEO of Microsoft-although Steve Ballmer has now taken his place-who is now the chief product development officer in the software area, has attempted in the last 10 years to transform his business, effectively, into a taxing agent to try to get just a little bit out of every small transaction that is done electronically and therefore to build his business into the future. This government has done that with the GST. We have here a backing and filling exercise by the government. They have the broad range of the tax act before them. This is an attempt to put four measures into place which will change what is there. There is some beneficial effect if, for instance, you are someone who works in a remote or regional area in the mining industry. The mining industry has been deleteriously affected: one, by world conditions and, two, by the fact that, in Australia, there was a dramatic decrease in demand for Australia's mining product until about a year ago, as the parliamentary secretary at the table, the member for Eden-Monaro, would well know. That decrease in demand led a number of parliamentary committees-the industry and resources committee and, prior to that, the industry, science and resources committee, and indeed his own science and innovation committee-to look at the question of Australia's research and development programs, both government and business, to try to find an answer to the problems in the mining industry. There is an associated series of problem, in that a vast tranche of Australian geologists-who are very much the world's best, using Australian expertise and Australian developed technologies-no longer work as geologists. They have been displaced, going to countries overseas or entering other professions or trades because they could not work due to the great downturn in mining activity. One aspect of this bill goes to the question of a geologist in a remote area who is looking to relocate from one area of Australia to another. They might need some help with that relocation. There is a specific provision to allow a consultant to be paid, at arm's length, in order to help that person with the relocation. So, if they were moving from one area of Australia to another, they could then seek to claim the cost of that. This provision is driven not only by people in the mining industry but also, indeed, by local members who have seen that there is a particular problem and cost there. This is a relatively minor provision that has been put forward as a change, but it is linked to a number of other fringe benefits tax provisions to try to kickstart this. In the explanatory memorandum, in example 1.1, Jenny-Lee is an employee at Zig and Company Mining at Lightning Ridge. She is required to remove herself from Lightning Ridge to Kalgoorlie-I suppose to go from opals to gold-in order to perform her duties as a geologist. Her employer engages a relocation consultant to assist in that relocation. There are accommodation and transportation quotes. The consultant arranges and pays for six months of furniture rental and provides information about medical facilities in Kalgoorlie. That kind of change probably is needed at the moment because of the general approach that we have had in Australia. Most people in mining over the last decade or so, particularly since this government came into being, have had fly-in, fly-out operations, but geologists in the field were usually on the ground. We note the current environment, where WMC is subject to a hostile takeover from Xstrata. Xstrata's experience in Australia has been different, shall we say, in different states, but one of the aspects of their operations in Queensland is that they have actually reversed the normal mode of operation for most people. Instead of adopting a fly-in, fly-out policy, they have started to build facilities on the ground and relocate people from mainland cities into remote mining areas. So I expect that this provision, which currently casts itself over a relatively small number of geologists and like people, will become more significant, particularly if Xstrata is successful in taking over WMC. So that is one of the provisions, but we do not gainsay it. It is a backfilling exercise, but it will have significant impact not only for the mining companies but for people employed in remote and regional Australia. As I said, there are four areas in this bill. The first example I have discussed refers to the first area, in schedule 1-those FBT exemptions to remote housing, relocation and work related items-and we do not oppose that at all. In the second area, there is a special depreciation concession for commercial vehicles over 3½ tonnes. We do not oppose that either. We are concerned, though, that there is a retrospective element to that. The third area is applying GST to options to purchase elements of tour packages sold outside Australia. We have substantial policy concerns in regard to that. We believe that a short Senate review, given that we only have until July 1 to undertake that, is necessary. Labor will be working to ensure that that happens. Indeed, in his contribution to this debate, the shadow minister underlined the problematic current situation where you have domestic onshore tour operations and overseas operations. It seems that, through a ety of schemes, some overseas operators have been able to wriggle things around so that no GST is paid by their clients on trips to Australia. That is not how the original GST legislation was intended. Labor are concerned about this, and the government seem to be concerned in terms of the direction they are moving. They are generally supportive, but we think this needs to be looked at more closely. The fourth area is the mature age worker tax offset. There is a substantial argument by the shadow minister in regard to this provision. This is an election provision. We know that, over a period of more than six months, a total of $66 billion-that is $66,000 million-was promised by Prime Minister Howard. One thing we can be sure of, and given the situation post the 1998 election when we had core promises, non-core promises and a period of three years in which he was put to the test on that, is that most of those provisions will find their way into law. One of those provisions is this mature age worker tax offset. This provides, for those people who are eligible, a payment of $500 a year, year on year as an annual payment, over a four-year period at a cost to the Commonwealth of $1 billion. What that provides to those employees who take this up is an actual benefit. The fundamental concern that Labor have, which was raised by the shadow minister, is how significant this will be not only in terms of moneys expended but also as a driver for getting people who are 55 years of age and over to stay productively in the work force. My guess, along with that of the shadow minister, is that it will be relatively insignificant because we know that there is a series of associated problems. Indeed, I have spoken before in this House about one of my constituents over the pension age of 65 who rightly took advantage of the government's provision that he could varidelay going onto a full pension-I think he was given a bonus in the order of $1,500 a year before tax with regard to that. He took the government's money for a three-year period. He also took advantage of the provision that he would still be able to bank his super. But on reaching the age of 70 yearshe was about 67 when he initially took this up-he got a letter from the department saying: ‘You are 70 years of age. From this point on your employer is not bound to, and indeed cannot, put nine per cent superannuation contributions into an account for you. You are no longer eligible for it.' So here we have contradictory messages. On the one hand, the government say: ‘Here's $500. If you're over 55, this should be an incentive for you to stay in the work force'. On the other hand, the government still have not done a single thing to address the situation of the people who are over pension age, who have reached 70 years of age and who choose to work longer. We need people to work longer, if they so choose. We have to take into account the fact that we have a doubling of people who are of pensionable age. That doubling will only become more apparent as more of my generation are superannuated. The longer people work, the more balanced and the more structurally sound will be not only our employment work force but also our productivity and the economy. What has the government done about that? Absolutely zero. There has been not one measure, not one sound from them, about a real problem for people who want to continue working. Why should they stay in the work force, be denied the nine per cent superannuation they got throughout their working life and have an employer not pay them a single zack extra? It would be very cheap to take on people who are 70 years plus-the on-costs would be much lower. The government here are providing $1 billion over four years and they have not moved to fix a much greater problem. This goes to the core of what the opposition's second reading amendment is about. I will re-state it. It refers to the government: (1) failing to embrace real and meaningful tax reform; and (2) failing to develop effective tax and related policies to address the problem of Australia's ageing population. Yesterday the member for Hotham quite rightly and properly argued in the first half of his appropriation debate speech that Labor have put forward a significant set of policies attempting to deal with two key problems: firstly, the intersection of tax and social policy areas and, secondly, the related problem that people have very high marginal tax rates-indeed we know it is 68 per cent, 72 per cent or even 82 per cent-if they receive a benefit and work as well. That has gone on for decades. This government so far have done virtually nothing to address that. We know that if that is not fixed properly then a person receiving either a disability allowance or unemployment benefits living next door to someone who is working full time will be advantaged in terms of paying much less for prescription drugs and having a range of other concessions. So the person next door who is working full time can develop a kind of envy over the fact that they are, virtually, not in front of the person who is not working at all-whatever the cause of those circumstances. This government seek to push people back into paid employmentin a period when the participation rate has in fact fallen, and fallen relatively substantially despite the fact that unemployment is at a historic low-but have not got the means with which to do it; unless of course they actually holus-bolus take Labor's proposals and, after a bit of refashioning and changing their outward appearance, market them as their own. I expect that we will see that happen in the short term. Since 1996, this government has crowed about one significant tax change, embodied in changes that are operative here-that is, incorporating a GST and bringing it into Australia. As I said at the outset of my remarks, this is a tax that works extremely well if you want to put your hand in people's pockets in relation to virtually everything that they do in life. It is a terrific way to get money into the Commonwealth coffers. This is a Commonwealth tax: it is imposed by the Commonwealth, collected by the Commonwealth and then disbursed to the states in place of the original grant provisions that they received. In terms of this tax, this is a government not even smart enough to do it in a modern way, or even in a late 20th century way, let alone in an early 21st century way. Why would you adopt a 1960s model paper-driven GST, developed in the European economic community and bureaucratised there, and take it holus-bolus? Why have that kind of imposition when we have significant computing power available, not only in terms of local computer resources but also in terms of network resources, and when you have got auditing capacities available to the tax office and others? Why would you not actually change this into a retail sales tax so that you could dramatically change Australia's taxation system? Why not have it a more efficient and effective system, take the administrative burdens off Australian industry and be able to deliver a better end product to the Australian people? I can answer those questions: it is because we have a coalition government and not a Labor government that would be willing to look more innovatively and more flexibly at the problems that we have in superannuation and ageing. I commend this set of proposals from the opposition to the House. (Time expired)",74
29,Ms CORCORAN,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"Isaacs) (1.54 p.m.)The Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005 has a number of tax measures in it but I want to talk about just onethat is, the measure that will provide a tax offset for older workers. This bill provides a tax offset of up to $500 for those workers over 55 years of age. Eligibility will depend on age, of course, and income from working. In 2004-05, the offset will phase out at five per cent from $48,000 per annum so that no offset is available when net income from working exceeds $58,000 per annum. From 2005-06, that offset will phase out from $53,000 per annum so that no offset is available when net income from working exceeds $63,000 per annum. This is all well and good as far as it goes. am not going to stand in the way of a tax cut for older workers. But, as a policy to address the issue of mature age unemployment, this is woeful. We have heard lots about the ageing of Australia's population. We have heard lots about the growing lack of skilled workers in Australia. The Intergenerational report, released by the Treasurer a couple of years ago, predicted that by 2042 there will be more people in Australia over the age of 55 than under the age of 55. Since its release, the Intergenerational report has been used mainly to paint a doom and gloom picture of the cost of health into the future. It has linked that to our ageing population. This is another matter and one that needs to be discussed, but at another time. The point of the Intergenerational report for this exercise is that we have a population which is ageing and we must consider all the ramifications of this. One of them is that an increasing proportion of our work force will need to be coming from the ranks of older people. At the same time that we are hearing about a growing lack of skilled workers, the Australian House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation's recent inquiry into ways to increase participation in the paid work force was told that by 2020 there will be 500,000 jobs with no-one to do them. We hear from various industry groups about existing skills shortages in most trades, including engineering, the construction industry, vehicle trades, food trades, electrical, printing et cetera. At the same time that we hear about all of these shortages I am hearing from my constituents that older workers are finding it hard to get back into the work force. Mature age unemployed people face a number of difficulties. Often the person has been employed for most of their life but is now sudI denly out of work, often because of redundancy or downsizing, for the first time. The older unemployed person usually experiences the same feelings that other unemployed people do-loss of confidence, immense frustration at being unable to find work, a feeling of the world passing them by and of being invisible. Older unemployed people, particularly men, often find it hard to ask for help. Language barriers can cause problems too. One constituent who rang me for help is a good example. He has two degrees-one in business management and a diploma. He returned to Melbourne two years ago after working overseas for five years and has not been able to find work since. He told me that he attends a number of interviews but is always overlooked for a younger person with more up-to-date qualifications. Another constituent told me about his experience. He has now found a job, but it took him two years. This person is well qualified and held senior positions in Telstra before taking a redundancy package. In a 12-month period he applied for 192 positions. He regards himself as one of the lucky ones, because he was offered a job on the other side of Melbourne involving a return trip of 135 kilometres a day through traffic. He is now working in a satisfying job reasonably close to home. Mission Australia says that older workers are now one of the most susceptible groups to both early exits from the work force through retrenchment and to long-term unemployment. They make up about 22 per cent of the official unemployment figures. Their real level of unemployment is likely to be higher, as many older unemployed people simply give up looking for work and others will have accepted a part-time or casual job when they really wanted a full-time job. Older workers face problems that younger unemployed people usually do not face, including prejudice and discrimination, simply because they are older. They are often overlooked in the workplace for ongoing training or upskilling which, of course, further disadvantages them in looking for work. It is worth noting in passing that 40 per cent of people in this age group do not have formal qualifications beyond compulsory schooling, so developing skills and training is essential for them to stay in the work force. Participation in the work force by older people is not linked to an unwillingness of older people to work but rather to the unwillingness of employers to employ older people. The Howard government has recognised that there is a problem with mature age unemployment and has established the Prime Minister's community business partnerships committee on mature age workers. This committee included Mission Australia CEO Patrick MCClure, CBA Director Fergus Ryan and multicompany director, David Gonski.",79

31,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen the comments of the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources in today's Sydney Morning Herald where, in relation to the link between carbon dioxide emissions and climate change, he said, ‘Whether or not those emissions are causing climate change, I don't know'? Is the Prime Minister aware of comments by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to the same newspaper on 4 January this year, where he said, ‘I think we need to engage the climate sceptics, those people who are pulling the doona up over their heads, and get past the debate over whether or not climate change is real'? Does the Prime Minister agree with his minister for industry or his minister for the environment?",80
32,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think they are both splendid ministers and, of course, I agree with them both. They do their jobs extremely well. I take this opportunity, as the Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question about climate change, to reaffirm, for reasons I am sure will become apparent during question time, that the government does not believe it is in Australia's interest to sign the Kyoto protocol. Kyoto Protocol",80
33,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is on the same subject addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister inform the House of the government's approach to the Kyoto protocol and reducing greenhouse gas emissions? Further, are there any alternative views?",80
34,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The principal reason why Australia will not sign the Kyoto protocol is that it is not in Australia's so. We take decisions not based on ideology or prejudice; we take decisions that are based overwhelmingly on a consideration of the national interest. The reality is that the modalities surrounding the Kyoto protocol at present mean that, if Australia were to do what the Australian Labor Party wants Australia to do, we would create a situation where countries such as China, India and Indonesia would not be subject to the same penalties and restrictions as would Australia, and as a result we would run the risk of losing both industry and jobs to countries in that situation. Any but the most cursory examination of this issue will tell you that, until such time as the major polluters of the world, including the United States and China, are made part of the Kyoto regime, it is next to useless and, indeed, harmful for a country such as Australia to sign up to the Kyoto protocol. It is worth noting that as of now, on my advice, there are only four or five countries in the world that are on track to meet their Kyoto emission targets. One of those countries is Australia; others are New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Sweden-and Germany, I understand, is close. So, when it comes to performance as distinct from rhetoric and Valentine's Day or Christmas cards or anything else, Australia is doing as well as any other country in the world. Australia is on track to meet its emission targets. Australia will not become part of an arrangement that is going to potentially destroy jobs in this country. We are not going to be part of an arrangement that will see the export of industries from this country; but we will be part and we are part of an arrangement whereby, through our own domestic policies, we are able to reduce emissions and, indeed, to be performing as well as any other country in the world in meeting our interest to do targets. Economy: Carbon Trading",81
35,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of the statement in the Australian newspaper of 21 August 2004 that ‘federal cabinet rejected such a scheme'-a carbon-trading scheme-‘last year, even though Environment Minister David Kemp and Treasurer Peter Costello promoted it, after industry lobbied John Howard'? Given the benefits which would flow to the Australian economy from our participation in the global carbon-trading market, does the Treasurer support measures which would allow Australian companies to engage in this market?",81
36,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not aware of that newspaper item from last year, but I can say that, if you are asking me about the economic effects of the Kyoto protocol, I thoroughly agree with what the Prime Minister has just said. For Australia to ratify the Kyoto protocol in the absence of particularly countries from the developing world would just shift production from Australia to the developing world without any commensurate improvement in the environment and certainly with a very large detriment to the Australian economy. Given those considerations, I do not believe that there is an economic benefit in ratifying the current provisions of the Kyoto protocol. In addition to that, Australia has managed to take a completely responsible position in relation to greenhouse gases. As I heard the Prime Minister just say, we are one of the countries that has probably been more successful than others. We will play our part, but we will not be part of a one-sided agreement which would handicap the Australian economy. Rafik al-Hariri",81
37,Mr BAIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of the government's reaction to the assassination of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafik Hariri?",82
38,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. He is one of a number of members who has many friends in Lebanon and a particular interest in Lebanon. As members are aware, a massive car bomb killed Mr Hariri on 14 February. Apparently, 16 others were killed and around 100 people were injured in this incident. We extend our condolences to the families of the victims. Our ambassador in Beirut has expressed these condolences directly to Mr Hariri's family and will visit his family home as part of his funeral ceremony today. Mr Hariri will be remembered for his significant contribution to the reconstruction of Beirut following the civil war that took place in Lebanon. We had been hoping that he would visit Australia during this year, but unfortunately he had some difficulties with his schedule in the early part of the year. He was known to members on both sides of the House. The Attorney-General, when he was the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, met with Mr Hariri in Beirut in 2001. A parliamentary delegation to Lebanon met with him in 1993, and other members from the former Labor government and the present government met with him as well. As a result of this incident, we will be upgrading our travel advisory for Lebanon. Although there will be no change to the overall level of advice for Lebanon, we will be continuing to advise Australians to exercise a high degree of caution. We have added: Such incidentsthat is, political assassinationscan lead to retaliatory attacks or other violence. Bystanders can be caught up in these attacks. We deplore this act of senseless violence and terrorism. At this stage it is too early to be sure who is responsible for it, but the perpetrators-whoever they may be-must be identified and then they must be brought to justice. We strongly support Lebanese sovereignty, independence and national unity. As a matter of principle, we support the withdrawal from Lebanon of foreign troops-that is, of course, Syrian forces. We expect Syria to act in accordance with the United Nations Security Council resolution 1559, which calls for withdrawal of all foreign forces and the disbanding of militias. Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Legislation",82
39,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the member for Grayndler, understanding order 99. I refer the member to his Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2005, which appears on the Notice Paper. Considering that the Kyoto protocol takes effect from today, why is it necessary for this bill to be given priority for debating and passing by the House?",82
40,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,82
41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right!,82
42,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank my leader for the question. The major reason why this bill should be prioritised is the fact that the Kyoto protocol comes into effect today after being ratified by 140 countries, plus the European Union. Of industrialised countries, only Australia and the United States-and, to be accurate, also Lichtenstein and Monacoare outside the agreement. ",82
43,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whilst the rest of the industrialised world can celebrate, Australia can only lament this lost opportunity. The reason why my bill should be prioritised is that climate change is the No. 1 environmental challenge facing the global community. My bill should be prioritised because from today Australia will be restricted from the economic opportunities that arise in the global trading market. The Sydney Futures Exchange, to name just one, developed infrastructure in the financial year 1999-2000. They are in a position to have a trading platform, a registry function and a settlement service, but they have put this all on hold until Australia ratifies the protocol. The reason why my bill should be prioritised is that, until we do, Australia will not be able to benefit from clean development mechanism provisions contained in the protocol. ",83
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sturt is warned.,83
45,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These are designed to encourage renewable energy projects in developing countries, such as the natural gas project that Australia has with China. My bill should be prioritised because until it is, and until it is carried, renewable energy projects will continue to move offshore to countries which have ratified the protocol-such as Pacific Solar, based in Botany in the electorate of the member for Kingsford Smith, which has moved from Sydney to Germany, taking jobs with it. My bill should be prioritised because, as the Prime Minister says, we are on track to meet our Kyoto target of 108 per cent of 1990 emissions by 2012. The Prime Minister is right when he says the then Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Robert Hill, did a good job negotiating on Australia's behalf in Kyoto. He was right when he said in 1997 that the protocol was good for jobs and good for the environment. He was right then, but he is wrong now. My bill should be prioritised because Australia's ability to influence what happens in the postKyoto world, after 2012, is restricted because we will not be at the negotiating table. We are isolating ourselves from this new opportunity. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member is now debating a bill which is on the Notice Paper, and he should be ruled out of order.",83
46,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Grayndler is expected to explain why his bill should be given priority in the process, the timing and the procedures-and I would ask him to restrict himself to those points.",83
47,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is absolutely critical that my bill should be prioritised, because day after day in here we are discussing national security. Agreements such as the Kyoto protocol promote a common purpose. Climate change is the ultimate intergenerational issue. We should prioritise it for the sake not just of ourselves but of our children and grandchildren. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You explained to the member opposite that he has to explain why it needed prioritisation. He is refusing to abide by your ruling and is debating the bill.",83
48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member is in order.,83
49,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I can sum up to the Prime Minister in two words why this bill should be prioritised and why it should be carried by this House: carpe diem-seize the day. Trade: Coal Exports",83
50,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline to the House how supply bottlenecks are interfering with the export of coal to overseas markets? What action should be taken to deal with such bottlenecks?,83
51,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. Mr Albanese-I thought he was going to ask me.,84
52,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And I congratulate the member for Grayndler on giving certainly the most riveting speech to the House since Fidel Castro addressed the Cuban people for five hours in Havana on Independence Day-and if you listen to Fidel Castro too much you will become like him. The coal industry is one of Australia's most important industries. Coal is Australia's No. 1 export, earning the country $13 billion in 2004. The total proportion of Australia's export coal going out of Dalrymple Bay, off Mackay, is 25 per cent and the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal is one of the largest terminals in the world. Last week 42 bulk carriers were queuing off the coast at Dalrymple Bay and, according to the AM program this morning quoting the local hotel owner, 38 vessels are queued off Dalrymple Bay today. Here we have our No. 1 export, here we have our No. 1 port, here we have demand which is growing for Australia's export, here we have prices which are rising and yet we have 42or 38 or some such number of-vessels queuing to get into the port to take those exports off overseas. I was astounded when in the AM program this morning, as they interviewed the Queensland minister for ports on what the problem was at Dalrymple Bay, he said Canberra should come up with some assistance. He said: Not one red cent has been devoted by them to coal or rail or port infrastructure. On the other hand, the Queensland Government is spending a fortune when it comes to both ports and rail ... I would ask the House to bear with me. The relevant minister in Queensland said the Queensland government was ‘spending a fortune' on ports, so one must assume he is referring to Dalrymple Bay, which after all takes 25 per cent of our exports. I want to table in this House the true situation in relation to Dalrymple Bay. In the Queensland parliament on 22 June 2001, the Treasurer, Mr Terry Mackenroth, stood up to announce the terms on which the Queensland government gave out a 50-year lease on the Dalrymple Bay coal loader. The Commonwealth has never owned a port in Australia. The Queensland government up until 2001 owned the Dalrymple coal loader and in that year entered into a 50-year lease. He said in the Queensland parliament: ... the lease will free up government capital in the terminal, ensuring the government can put taxpayers' money where it belongs-in schools, hospitals and roads. Listen to this: It will also relieve the government of the need to meet the terminal's future capital investment requirements of some $600 million over the next 10 to 15 years ... In other words, the Queensland government divested itself of this loader in order to get out of the capital investment that was required and along the way pocketed $630 million from the 50-year lease. Mr Tanner interjecting",84
53,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Melbourne!,84
54,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Now, after pocketing the $630 million, after walking away from the investment that was required, we have Paul Lucas on AM saying it is all Canberra's fault. Mr Tanner interjecting",84
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Melbourne is warned!,84
56,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They must have a button they push up there in the Queensland government: ‘Whatever the problem is, it must be Canberra's fault.' This was a Queensland port. This was leased by the Queensland government. They took $630 million to do it and they did it so that they did not to engage in capital investment. People in this House might well say that investment in schools and roads and hospitals is a good thing. Let me make this point: in 2004-05 the Queensland government will receive in GST revenue $7,314 million, including a windfall of $760 million out of the GST. From the Commonwealth government's point of view, we are not going to allow this important matter of Australia's infrastructure to wallow in incompetence. I have spoken to the minister for transport. We will be inviting the coal producers out of Queensland to come down to Canberra to speak to the Commonwealth government, to give the Commonwealth government advice on what it might do to try and bring the Queensland government to the party to clear that port and help Australia's export industry. Health: Cancer Screening",84
57,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Does the minister recall his election commitment made on the run after Labor had announced its cancer policy to provide funding of $90,000 to support Ovarian Cancer Awareness Week? Can the minister explain to the House and to all Australian women why the government has failed to deliver on this election commitment, a failure which has jeopardised the ability of the National Ovarian Cancer Network to run Ovarian Cancer Awareness Week next week? How does the minister justify the government's priorities: more than $5½ million for the insolvent Beaudesert railway and nothing for an awareness week for a cancer that kills an Australian woman every 10 hours?",85
58,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a government which keeps its commitments, and any commitment that this government has made will be honoured. Any commitment that this have government has made will be honoured. Certainly, this is a government which believes in improving cancer care. During the election campaign, we announced a widely applauded cancer care policy that involved the commitment of $137 million more to cancer care over the next four years. As part of that, there was $2 million over four years to fund the kind of grant that the member opposite refers to. If there was any commitment made, it certainly will be kept. Workplace Relations: Building Industry",85
59,Mr HENRY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister update the House on the government's progress in reforming the building and construction industry?,85
60,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck for his question and his interest in the ongoing reform of the building and construction industry. I know that he has in his electorate WestTrack, which is a major supplier of earthmoving equipment to the building and construction industry in Western Australia. This government remains committed to cleaning up the building industry. Indeed, we will re-introduce this year legislation in response to the Cole royal commission to implement the recommendations of that commission, having already implemented some 170 of the 212 recommendations of Justice Cole. A crucial part of this response has been the implementation of the National Code of Practice for the Construction Industry. I am pleased that both the states of Victoria and South Australia have signed up to this code but disappointed that Western Australia, where the honourable member's electorate is, has still not signed up. I note that just last week the state opposition in Western Australia committed to signing up to the code of practice, should it be elected to government. I once again call on Premier Gallop to sign up on behalf of Western Australia because, by not doing so, the Gallop government is denying valuable Commonwealth funding to AusLink projects in that state. There is no state in more need of a clean-up of its building and construction industry than Western Australia. I quote from the report of the Cole royal commission, which found that the building industry in Western Australia: ... is marred by unlawful and inappropriate duct. Fear, intimidation and coercion are commonplace. Contractors, subcontractors and workers face this culture continuously. At the centre of this culture and much of the unlawful and inappropriate conduct is the CFMEU. The reality is that Western Australia remains the strike capital of Australia. Its building industry is the worse performing industry of all states, and the biggest impediment is the Gallop government's failure and negligence to control the militant building unions. In 2003 in Western Australia the construction industry had a dispute rate of 567 working days lost per 1,000 employees. This compares to a national industry average for the construction industry of 249 days. In Western Australia the rate is almost double that of the whole of Australia. Currently we have a 12-day strike at the $253 million Worsley Alumina refinery in Collie. Last year Western Australians were only too aware of the $1.5 billion Perth to Mandurah railway line, which was hit by a crippling two-week strike. The Gallop government has made Western Australia the strike capital of Australia. Its building and construction industry is notorious for its poor performance. Western Australia can no longer continue to afford the Gallop government's delays and indecision. Iraq",85
61,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister today provide the parliament with an unequivocal guarantee that, apart from Mr Barton, no other Australians were involved in the questioning, interviewing or interrogation of Iraqi detainees?",86
62,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The officials of my department and officials of the defence department, as well as ministers, have been happy to provide information on these issues. If there is ever any more information to provide conthat I am not aware of, we will obviously bring that information forward. But I have nothing to offer today except this observation: what is behind this questioning, what this is essentially about-let us understand what this pedantic debate is aboutMr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 104 is very clear about the minister's answer needing to be relevant to the question. There is nothing the minister has said that is faintly relevant to the specific question asked.",86

71,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What this is about is trying to suggest that Australian officials were somehow involved in the Abu Ghraib allegations or were somehow behaving improperly in Iraq. That is what this is driving at. That is what is behind this campaign by the Labor Party. That is what they are trying to achieve and, if I may say so, it is Groundhog Day. We heard it last year and the publicMr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Not one word of the minister's answer related to the question asked, which was: apart from Mr Barton, were there other Australians involved in the questioning or interrogation of prisoners? Not a word the minister spoke was relevant.",87
72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member will resume his seat. Trade: South-East Asia,87
73,Ms PANOPOULOS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister inform the House of developments in our trading relationship with the countries of South-East Asia?,87
74,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Indi for her question. Obviously, unlike the Australian Labor Party, the member for Indi is interested in what opportunities will flow out of South-East Asia in the future for manufacturers, producers and exporters in her electorate. The House would recall that, at an historic meeting in Vientiane last year, the leaders of Australia, New Zealand and the 10 ASEAN countries agreed to launch a negotiation on a free trade agreement between those 12 countries. I am pleased to inform the House that the first round of those negotiations on an ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade agreement will begin in Melbourne on Monday. Economic modelling undertaken, I think back in 2000, by the Centre for International Economics estimated gains of about $US19.1 billion to Australia from a prospective free trade agreement between Australia, New Zealand and the ASEAN countries. Trade between the nations involved already stands at about $43 billion. Major trading partners of Australia obviously exist within the near region to the north. An ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade agreement will further open the doors for Australian businesses, like those in the electorate of Indi, to take advantage and to realise their full potential in that market of some 500 million consumers in South-East Asia. Yet, we continue to hear the same mantra, the same rhetoric, from the Labor Party, which still will not endorse the government's trade policy agenda, which has a balance between multilateral negotiations and bilateral negotiations. That is our approach to trade liberalisation. The Labor Party are still stuck in the past and continue to put out the same purist mantra about the multilateral system. That is all good and well, but the Labor Party would be well advised to heed the advice that one of their former heroes, Gough Whitlam, once gave on the impotency of purity. NA",87

Did the Prime Minister direct his then acting parliamentary secretary, Mr Slipper, to write to the provisional liquidator of the Beaudesert Rail Association on 11 June 2003? Did the Prime Minister direct his parliamentary secretary to advise the provisional liquidator that the Prime Minister was considering a range of issues relevant to the request from the member for Forde for funds? Did the Prime Minister direct his parliamentary secretary to advise the provisional liquidator that he should delay taking any irreversible actions on Beaudesert Rail?

77,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I have already provided him with a written answer to the question he asked me yesterday. The situation in relation to Beaudesert Rail was that did receive, according to the criteria, a from the Federation Fund. It did get into financial difficulties. It did go into voluntary administration. Representations were made to the federal government and the Queensland government through the local member, the local council and other bodies to make the project financially viable. Issues of this kind, as the Leader of the Opposition I am sure would know, involve on-balance judgments. On the one hand, there was an argument that you should not invest further in the project; on the other hand, there was an argument that, having committed $5 million from the Federation Fund, a further commitment should be made. In the final analysis, the government decided to provide a grant of $600,000 as part of a package of assistance, which also included $200,000 from the shire of Beaudesert and agreement from the Queensland state Labor government's rail authority not to pursue its rights to the value of $675,000. This must go down in history as the only occasion on which the Queensland government has contributed more than the federal government to a project in Queensland. That was the basis on which the decision was made. It was an entirely proper decision and, importantly, it had the support and encouragement of the people of Beaudesert. Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Miss JACKIE KELLY (2.35 p.m.)-My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. What is the minister doing to prevent the abuse of prescription drugs and other abuses of the Pharmaceutical provisional liqBenefits Scheme?",88
78,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I appreciate her concerns to ensure that taxpayers' money is expended wisely. I can inform the House and the member for Lindsay that prescription it shopping, as it is known, is not common but grant it does take place, and the government is taking action to stamp it out. The Health Insurance Commission, for instance, has advised of one person who, in a three-month period, obtained 200 prescriptions from 114 different doctors, and 165 of these prescriptions were for pethidine, which is a potentially addictive drug. The Health Insurance Commission maintains a database of people who in the past three months have had scripts from more than six doctors, who have had more than 25 prescriptions for potentially addictive drugs or who have had more than 50 scripts in total. I can advise the House that, in the past 12 months, 3,874 patients have been counselled about their drug use; 15 doctors have been referred for potential professional misconduct investigation; and 13 people have been referred for potential fraud prosecution. Since last Friday, doctors who suspect that their patients might be abusing prescription drugs have been able to access a new hotline and obtain information about their patients' use of prescription drugs. This was widely welcomed by the medical profession, particularly by the AMA. This measure, along with so many other measures, demonstrates that you can trust the Howard government with the nation's health care system. Regional Services: Program Funding",88
79,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.38 p.m.)My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that financial assistance for the Beaudesert Rail Association from the Queensland government and the Beaudesert Shire Council was properly secured against assets of the association in der to protect the interests of the people of Queensland and the ratepayers of the Beaudesert shire? Is the Prime Minister aware that, after he had determined that funding would be provided to the association, officers of the Department of Transport and Regional Services attempted to negotiate to secure the financial interests of the Commonwealth against association assets? Why did the Prime Minister then convert the loan to a $660,000 grant, ignoring the interests of Australian taxpayers?",89
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reason that the conversion took place was that it was more likely to make a contribution to the viability of the project, which, after all, was the objective. Resources: Natural Resource Management",89
81,Mr WAKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Would the minister advise the House of the contribution Australia's resource sector is making to the nation's economic well-being?",89
82,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Grey for his ongoing support of the resources sector in what is a very big resources electorate. In terms of the performance of the resources sector, it is worth noting in this House just how well our resources sector is going. If we compare the forecast value of the resources sector exports this financial year with last financial year, we see some very good results: iron ore up 35 per cent to $7.1 billion, aluminium up seven per cent to $3.7 billion, alumina up six per cent to $4 billion, metallurgical coal up 52 per cent to $9.9 billion, thermal coal up 43 per cent to $6.2 billion and uranium up 25 per cent to $455 million. What we are seeing is a $65 billion boom for the resources sector, up 20 per cent on the previous year, with almost ora $10 billion potential investment in capital expenditure. This performance has not happened by accident. It has happened as a result of the reforms of the Howard government and the strength in investment in the resources sector in Australia, which ensures that we remain competitive and sustainable. There are threats to that and they come from those who sit opposite. They come in the form of a draconian labour market. They come in the form of a Labor Party that is reluctant to invest in infrastructure as outlined by the Treasurer. Mr Crean interjecting",89
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham is warned! Mr Martin Ferguson-Tell us about the skills shortage!,90
84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Batman is also warned!,90
85,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They come from this blind faith in Kyoto, which would see many of these industries driven offshore. They come from the three-mine policy, although I notice the member for Batman no longer supports that-an interesting decision from the member for Batman, which I think is enlightening for those who sit opposite. In contrast to that, we have a government that committed to ensuring that the resources sector in Australia not only continues to contribute to the economic well-being of this nation but continues to provide jobs for Austraaddressed lians. Regional Services: Program Funding",90
86,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that his government does not enter into a new funding contract with a grant recipient if there are outstanding contractual obligations from a previous contract? Was the Prime Minister aware that, at the time he offered the Beaudesert Rail Association a loan of $400,000, it had still not met its contractual obligations in relation to the $5 million grant through the Centenary of Federation Fund that was re-announced in November 2001? Why did he offer the Beaudesert Rail Association a new loan before it had properly complied with the terms of this $5 million grant?",90
87,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The first part of the question obviously relates to some technical approaches by the government under the financial management legislation. I will take that on notice and get advice.,90
88,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,90
89,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first part of question is asked in the general, and I will get advice from the Minister for Finance and Administration. As to the second part of the question, it was self-evident-as I have indicated in the House and in the letter I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition-that this project got into financial difficulty. A decision had to be made on whether further money would be advanced by the federal government, the Queensland government and the local council to see if it could be rescued or whether it would be allowed to die. They are on-balance judgments, and we made an onbalance judgment to try to bail it out. I think is it was the right decision to take at the time. Employment: Programs",90
90,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Human Services. Would the minister inform the House of initiatives taken by the government to help Australians find paid work?,90
91,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question and understand her compassion when it comes to helping other Australians to get work. This government is about helping people to find and keep jobs. Many people on welfare have no formal obligations to look for work, but they should be offered the chance to work. My department and Centrelink have instituted a new program of voluntary referrals of customers to the Job Network since November last year. As a result, there was a 97 per cent increase in referrals to the Job Network from Centrelink in December last year. That means that nearly 9,000 clients were referred to Job Network-a massive change in attitude.",90
92,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Since you became the minister!,90
93,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It just so happens to coincide with that, Prime Minister. One thousand people on disability support pensions and nearly 8,000 people on parenting payment have now been referred to the Job Network. This is a 230 per cent increase on referrals over the previous December. These are voluntary referrals. I asked that we consult Centrelink customers to see how they appreciate the change in attitude at Centrelink, and I want to take the opportunity to praise the Centrelink employees who have been referring people to Job Network. One client said: I think it is quite fantastic that Centrelink are referring people to the Job Network member. The Job Network member has been really helpful and it has improved my job search skills. I have had an interview for the first time in years. Many of those people referred, especially parents, were seeking part-time work to fit in with their family responsibilities. This program focuses on the significant proportion of welfare recipients who would benefit from part-time and casual work. As my colleague the Minister for Workforce Participation told the House earlier this week, Job Network placements have increased to an all-time high. I am advised that the latest Job Network performance profile shows that a total of 630,000 job placements have been recorded in the last 12 months. That is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. Significantly, nearly 170,000 were long-term jobs. So with this platform, and I emphasise that it is an early start to the program, I appreciate the work of the thousands of Centrelink employees out there who are now referring people who want to work and want the opportunity to work to Job Network, because at the end of the day a job is the best thing that we can do for people. Regional Services: Program Funding",90
94,Ms BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Can the Deputy Prime Minister confirm advice from his department that Beaudesert Rail applied for funds through the Regional Partnerships program on 5 November 2003 and that that application was approved by him on the same day? Can he explain how this application was lodged, assessed and approved by him in a matter of hours? Government member interjecting",91
95,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it is a long way from Chisholm to Beaudesert. Plainly, there had been a lot of consideration of the matter before the dilemma was resolved. I will make a couple of points about this. Part of people what the opposition is trying to do here is paint a picture of some sort of conspiracy carried out in great secrecy. There was no secrecy about it at all. The matter received a great deal of public exposure from around the middle of 2003 as efforts were made by the local community, the Queensland government, the Beaudesert shire, the Australian government and the provisional liquidator to find a way of overcoming the project's problems. It was pointed out in response to an earlier question that initially we thought perhaps a loan might have been the way forward. It proved not to be. As we worked through the issues surrounding this matter we came to a view on the best way forward. Yes, it was a balance of judgments. We made what we believed was an appropriate judgment and then we carried it forward. When it comes to obscurity and changing positions in relation to grants, I have to say that nobody can outdo the Leader of the Opposition. Last Sunday he appeared with Mr Albanese, the member for Grayndler, saying that he of course got behind all grants. Today we had him saying to Laurie Oakes that he, Beazley, was involved in ‘none of the grant applications'. I am sure that that is what the Leader of the Opposition told Mr Oakes, but it is not quite true. Later in the same story Laurie outlined that the Leader of the Opposition lobbied the state government to also grant money for the project. So he was involved and he does believe in getting state governments to help. He said that he was not involved and had nothing to do with it. That is interesting given that on 16 December 2003 he wrote to me in very strong support for a grant. Not only did he write to me supporting it, he actually advertised it very loudly and very significantly in his newsletter for his electorate-and I would be only too happy to table it. It said: Beazley seeks funding for study of Mangles Bay marina proposal. The member for Brand, Kim Beazley, has written to Regional Services Minister John Anderson seeking finality to the federal government's decision to support an environmental study for the proposed Mangles Bay marina. The hypocrisy of this knows no bounds whatsoever. The Leader of the Opposition's position is very clear: all of these grants and proposals are absolutely terrible and ought to be shut down unless they are in Brand. I table the newsletter. Tourism: Domestic Market",91
96,Mrs MAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. Would the minister inform the House how the government is promoting tourism, and the impact that is having on the Australian economy? FRAN BAILEY-I thank the member for MCPherson for her question. I would like to acknowledge the work done by the member for MCPherson and her colleagues on the Gold Coast, the members for Fadden and Moncrieff, because the work that they do is contributing to our $73 billion tourism industry which employs more than 500,000 people, of which approximately 200,000 are employed in our regional areas. The tourism industry has been through some pretty tough times, but this government has a real commitment to it. We are currently investing around $600 million over four years, and this investment is definitely paying off because we have had a 10 per cent increase in the number of overseas visitors coming to this country. That is the largest increase we have ever had. That represents 5.2 million people. And it can get even better than that, because the projections are that there will be almost nine million overseas visitors by the year 2013. This government is investing in the emerging markets of China and India, and the success that this $73 billion industry is having is due in no small measure to the commitment and the investment by this government. Regional Services: Program Funding",92
97,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's letter of 16 February to me in which he states, ‘The project had financial difficulties but, by the same token, a financial contribution via the Centenary of Federation Fund having been made there was a case for securing the project's survival.' Isn't it true that the Department of Transport and Regional Services undertook an investigation and concluded that the project was not financially viable? Prime Minister, was this not a classic case of throwing good taxpayers' money after bad to temporarily save a coalition member from embarrassment?",92
98,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to that question is no. As for the member for Forde, it will take more than an insubstantial attack from the Leader of the Opposition to unsettle the member for Forde. Environment: Green Corps",92
99,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workforce Participation. Would the minister inform the House how young people serving in the Green Corps are promoting environmental projects, including those in the electorate of Corangamite?",92
100,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Thank you very much to the member for Corangamite for his question. He is a great advocate for local projects in his own electorate. It was no surprise when I recently announced 33 new projects helping over 330 young Australians that in his electorate two recipients received support to do work on threatened species management and archaeological sites at Anglesea Heath.,93

104,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I doubt it. Have you ever been there? I doubt it. The second project, which is of considerable benefit to the member for Corangamite, is the coastal catchments revegetation and restoration at Apollo Bay. The Green Corps project is one that this government remains committed to, because not only is it helping the environmental protection of many endangered species around the country but it is helping young people into employment. It is providing fantastic work experience opportunities. If members opposite are serious about helping the environment and helping young Australians, for goodness sake get behind this project.",93

111,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During the course of his rambling answer to one of our members on the subject of the Beaudesert railway the Deputy Prime Minister revealed inter alia that I had written to him on the subject of a regional grant in my constituency and suggested that I wanted to walk both sides of the street on this issue. Here is the answer to my letter: the announcement by the Liberal candidate, followed by announcements by the Liberal candidate on every other regional arrangement in Brand. I seek leave to table this as an example of precisely how the government was using these rorts as opportunities to create bogus local reputations for their candidates in the last election. Leave granted. NA Opening of Parliament: Demonstration",93
112,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have a question to you, Mr Speaker, which relates to correspondence between you and the President and the Refugee Action Committee of the ACT, based in my electorate of Fraser, concerning arrangements relating to the demonstration on the opening of parliament last year. Can you confirm whether, within the guidelines as set down, the practical arrangements to enable that demonstration to take place were in any way changed and whether on previous occasions parliamentary staff had made available access to power sources for loudspeakers et cetera and that that assistance was denied on this occasion? If there were such changes, on what basis were those changes made?",93

114,Mr ABBOTT,DOCUMENTS,Documents are presented as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. NA Kyoto Protocol,94
115,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Brand proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The need for the Australian Government to ratify the Kyoto Protocol which comes into force today. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",94
116,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the House. Today, across the world, parliaments and people are observing the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: the Kyoto protocol. It is a day of great historical significance. The threat of global warming is one of the greatest challenges that the world community now faces. It is complex, demanding and urgent. Just as also are the other great challenges of our time: global terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the crisis of extreme poverty that afflicts one billion people. At the outset of this debate, in the context of what the Prime Minister had to say, I want to say this: it is in Australia's interests to and ratify this protocol. Not a single economic benefit flows from the failure to do so. As the government itself has said, it will meet the Kyoto targets which it negotiated in 1997, so the government cannot argue that the Kyoto targets detract from this country's economic potential. The second thing is this, and it is more vital: if you are a ratifier and a participant in this treaty, you sit at the table that determines the next phase from 2012 onwards; if you do not, you are liable to all sorts of economic action by those countries who are participants in it-and we could potentially have a very great deal to lose were those circumstances to arise. Another thing is that incorporated within this regime is a carbon trading arrangement which, as a major exporter of energy, we have substantial opportunities to participate in, yet we have been taken out of that. The Sydney Futures Exchange anticipated common sense from this government and set up a capacity to trade in those carbon futures, but this government has let this element of the capitalist system monumentally down. No nation can solve these global warming problems alone. They require an immense effort of technology, diplomacy and leadership for our world to tackle them effectively. I am no master of scientific knowledge on climate change-unlike the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources-but, like many in the Australian community, my sense of concern has deepened over several years as the scientific evidence has mounted. The picture is bleak; the evidence is compelling. I do not need to dwell on that-we are reading about it every day in our newspapers. I think, too, that we understand the consequences will be severe. The frequency of droughts and floods will increase. Water resources will become more scarce. Vast tracts of agricultural land will become arid. Many plant and animal species will face extinction. Australia sign will face a hotter and drier climate. The severe bushfires that have menaced us in recent years will intensify. Water shortages will become more frequent. Some of Australia's most spectacular natural heritage, like the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu's wetlands and the alpine regions of south-eastern Australia, will be severely damaged. Already, many of our folk can see these trends. It is an issue that is raised with me constantly as I go out and address groups and meet people in the community. The government are defying the common sense and the observations already of the Australian people who put them where they are. Despite this threat, when the Kyoto protocol comes into effect today with the names of 140 countries on that list, we are not there. Making sense of this government's position on Kyoto, as I said, is not easy. When the Kyoto protocol was negotiated in December 1997, the Prime Minister described the Kyoto outcome as an ‘absolutely stunning diplomatic success', saying that it would: ... make a massive contribution to the world environmental effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions but also to protect Australian jobs ... a win environment and a win for Australian jobs. The Prime Minister, as we all know, is given to hyperbole when it comes to describing his achievements, but I have rarely heard him wax so eloquent in his own praise and I have never heard him before, having waxed so eloquent, spurn the product of his announcement. His position is now different. He says that Australia just cannot afford it, that it would cost us too much, that it is not in our best interests. Meanwhile, his minister for the environment has another message: that Kyoto, with its one per cent reduction in emissions, does not go far enough. As he said on 23 October 2004: ... until the protocol reduced emissions by 60 per cent, Australia would not accept it. “That would be accepting the argument that you sign on to something that is half-hearted and not likely to deliver a good result. In other words, the Prime Minister, if he is honest-according to his environment minister-would be standing up here saying, ‘I'll not sign this until there is a 60 per cent reduction.' I tell you what: there would be a few comments from Australian industry then! His industry minister is not even sure that there is any problem with global warming. He is quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald today saying: Whether or not those emissions are causing climate change, I don't know. If you go back across history, millions of years, carbon dioxide levels go up and down, and global warming comes and goes. I mean, the Earth is a lot warmer than it was when the glaciers formed. But the government's position gets still more confused. The Prime Minister also says that though we oppose Kyoto and will not ratify it, yet we will reach our Kyoto targets anyhow-but, no, we still will not sign it. This is the absurdity, the internal contradiction, the sheer loopiness of this government's position for the on global warming. On the one hand, the government is indignant that Australia cannot bear the cost of signing the Kyoto protocol but, on the other hand, it tells us Australia is on track and will reach its Kyoto targets. It seems the government is saying that Australia will bear the costs but not enjoy the significant economic benefits of ratification. If we ratify Kyoto, we get access to the global carbon market and trading mechanisms built into the protocol. We gain the opportunity of building new emissions trading relationships with both developing and advanced economies. We reduce the cost of achieving the targets to less than half the cost while we remain outside, according to expert modelling prepared for the Kyoto Protocol Ratification Advisory Committee. We generate export income from overseas companies who wish to establish carbon sinks in Australia. Such investments could generate $1 billion of annual export income, according to the Australian Business Council for Sustainable Energy. We could also help to foster new businesses in the booming global market for lowcarbon energy-efficient technologiesbusinesses that can create jobs for Australia and give us a stronger foothold in global markets for environmental goods and services already estimated to be worth $US515 billion in 2005. Business spurns this government on this issue. Instead, because of the government's position, we are being excluded from these benefits and face the risk of being black-listed for trading opportunities by Kyoto signatories. This government has had much to say which is critical of Kyoto. We on this side appreciate that Kyoto is far from perfect: it does not go far enough to stop global warming, it does not yet impose binding commitments on all the developing countries whose use of carbon fuels is growing, it does not achieve significant cuts in carbon emissions and it does not set targets beyond 2012. But we have to be realistic. Regardless of its shortcomings, Kyoto is the only show in town. While it is not perfect, there is no viable alternative. While it is not perfect, it gives us a foundation on which to set targets for emissions beyond 2012 and bring in the developing economies. You will not be able to address the fact that the Chinese and as are excluded from the current arrangements if you are not there to argue that they should be included after 2012-and we will not be. It is naive in the extreme for this government to suggest that we can throw out 15 years of international work on this agreement and think we will get a deal that addresses these weaknesses. It is simply not credible; it is not how international diplomacy works. Time, patience and persistence are required. The Kyoto protocol is the central instrument that will build commitment to the climate change agenda in the next few years whilst also incubating market based solutions such as climate change technologies and emissions trading systems. If this government is serious about addressing the urgent global problem of climate change then it simply cannot reject the Kyoto protocol-because there is no realistic alternative to this agreement. That is why we are left scratching our heads at the bizarre approach this Prime Minister has taken in ignoring the gravity of the scientific evidence and ignoring the international consensus on this issue. There is an image of the Prime Minister that has stuck in my mind this week. It comes from his comments in an interview with Monica Attard which was broadcast last weekend. In it the Prime Minister made the point that he is ‘the sort of person who retains complete touch with reality' and is even ‘at work on the lawns at Kirribilli every weekend'. To test his assertion, Ms Attard asked the Prime Minister to name the movie he saw when he last went to the flicks. He enthusiastically shot back that the movie he had last seen at the flicks was Four Weddings and a Funeral-a movie which, I seem to remember, was released a decade ago. As I thought about why the Prime Minister would identify with that movie, the image of its Indi- final scene came to mind-the famous romantic scene in which Hugh Grant, as Charles, is finally brought together with his true love, Andie MCDowell, as Carrie. Carrie shows up on Charles's doorstep, amidst the thunder, lightning and torrential downpour. As the two embrace and are getting completely soaked in the downpour, and as the lightning flashes and the thunder roars, Hugh suggests that maybe they should get out of the rain. As Carrie gazes into Charles's eyes, she mutters those memorable words which bring to mind the Prime Minister: ‘Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed.' In case the Prime Minister had not noticed, 140 nations have signed the Kyoto protocol-ratified it-but Australia is left outside. We are left on the outside with a Prime Minister whose backward looking vision is of an Australia which bears the black mark of being the nation that belches out more greenhouse gases per head of population than any other but will not sign up to Kyoto, even though they gave us comfort, and is left out of the enormous opportunities available to countries that have ratified Kyoto-the economic opportunities created by carbon trading and the growth of tomorrow's industries based around low-carbon, efficient and renewable energy technologies. Why has the government done this when the evidence is so overwhelming? One answer comes to mind, based on patterns of past behaviour. There is one thing that might yet change the Prime Minister's mind. What has changed between 1997, when the Prime Minister was gushing his enthusiasm for Kyoto, and today, when he derides it? It is not the science; it is more convincing now than it was then. It is not the level of support; it is more overwhelming now. It is not the urgency; it has become more pressing. It is not the emergence of an alternative plan; Kyoto is the only game in town. The only thing that happened is the US changed its position during that period. That is the one thing that has changed since 1997-just one thing. Beyond all doubt, and despite the Prime Minister's blustering words, if the US changed its position back again, supporting Kyoto, the ink would not be dry on the US signature before the Prime Minister would have ratified the protocol. That is the only change. It is an extraordinary position to into, because I honestly do not feel that the United States would think anything of it if the Prime Minister ratified this agreement. has not worried them that Blair has signed. has not worried them that other allies and friends of the United States have signed it. Those countries regard it as their own business; they are not there to be influenced or bullied by the United States. It does the US alliance no good, and it does no good to the reputation of people in this country who are seriously worried about the impacts of global change and the loss of business opportunities that flow from this to have it believed in the community that the only thing that caused the Prime Minister to change his mind was not the economic argument-because we know that he rejected that and signed up to the targets anywaybut the relationship with the US. And it is a criterion in the relationship about which the US makes no demands at all. You will not go further in undermining the alliance and the good regard of young Australians, who are seriously seized with this, than if you let them think for one minute that your position has somehow or other been a product of trying to align yourself with the United States on this position. This is a moment in time which Australia cannot afford to miss. This is world a moment in time when Australian workers cannot afford to see a government exclude them from the employment opportunities. This is a moment in time when Australian business demands a government response, but the government will not make it. (Time expired)",94
117,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Leader of the Opposition is well known for charging into the future without knowing what is going to happen. In terms of the next phase, he and those who sit opposite have absolutely no idea get what Kyoto 2 holds in store-not only for the rest of the world but, more particularly, for Australia. One thing is for sure: the It Leader of the Opposition hopes it will be It bad. Just as he hoped that the introduction of the GST would be bad for Australia, he hopes that our failure to ratify Kyoto will be bad for Australia. I did not think I would ever sit in this House and hear the leader of the Labor Party promote the importance of the Sydney Futures Exchange-men in suits gambling on where futures contracts will go-in front of the hard working men and women of Australia's resource and industry sector, but he The Leader of the Opposition's only suggestion of where jobs might come from under Kyoto is with futures exchange merchants. It is a disgrace. I never thought I would see anyone who aspired to be the leader of this country put the jobs of a few people in futures exchanges ahead of the risk of higher electricity and petrol prices for the families of Australia and lower GDP growth in Australia. That is what will come if we rely on Kyoto. Australia's decision not to ratify Kyoto will see us continue to deal with the important issues of emissions, including global emissions, in a practical way that produces results. Kyoto at its best will only produce one fifth of the result it originally predicted in 1997. That is a result that will have little no impact on global emissions in the years ahead. The Leader of the Opposition speculates that Australia will be hotter and drierand probably wetter and cooler at the same time! We have seen all those meteorological phenomena in the last 12 months. As someone who has been closer to nature and relied more on nature for his income than the Leader of the Opposition ever has, I can tell him that he should go into weather forecasting because there are thousands of farmers who will sign up if he is accurate. If he can predict the future weather of Australia he should get to it; he is wasted opposition-and perhaps that underlies a bigger issue. For every two scientists who argue that there is a connection between global emissions and global warming there is another scientist who will argue the opposite. The Leader of the Opposition says that the Kyoto protocol is the only show in town. He must have had his head under a doona for a very long time because the real gains in reducing has. greenhouse gas emissions are coming from better technology, greater awareness of energy efficiencies and the determination of the industries of this nation to bring about real change. It has been an amazing day. Not only have I seen the workers of Australia abandoned by the Leader of Opposition in favour of futures players but I have seen a party which claims to represent the sons of the Eureka Stockade bow down to a European policy. We have seen the Labor Party accept a protocol designed in Europe for the benefit of Europe and to the detriment of Australia. Mr Albanese-Where is Kyoto?",97
118,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Grayndler displays his absolute ignorance of which countries have signed up to the or Kyoto protocol and, more importantly, which countries are actually committed to greenhouse gas reduction-and, even more importantly than that, which countries will achieve it. Perhaps we should not be surprised at the Labor Party because the only recycling that they can do with any effect is of old policies and old leaders-and they do it pretty regularly. We are probably going to see noodle nation again. That was a policy that lived and died in the space of four or five days. I guess that will be an issue for the Minister for Education, Science and Training to deal with. I am just going to deal with the issue of the here leading the Kyoto protocol. When you have a policy vacuum like the Labor Party's, seeing an off-the-shelf policy like the Kyoto protocol that you can grab and wed to is a godsend. The Labor Party is quite happy to pull a shambles off the shelf, embrace it and say, ‘This is the answer to everything.' I think more than one commentator has said this week that Kyoto was stillborn. We have not seen anything from Kyoto which will, in any significant way, address the issues of climate change and yet climate change under a Kyoto protocol has been elevated by the Leader of the Opposition this week to code red-the highest importance, up there with terrorism. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition gets out and has a look to see what is going on around him. There are a whole range of views on how we should address greenhouse gas emissions but there is one constant thread that I have seen in a number of countries. It was highlighted recently in an article by Rosemary Righter, on the United Kingdom web site Times Online. The article goes through a range of scientific theories about global warming and Rosemary then goes on to point out: It would be the flattest of truisms were it not on global warming, government policy is increasingly driven by alarmist scenarios about the world in 2100 that make long-range weather forecasting look rock solid by comparison. Where have we seen that somewhere locally? We have seen it here in the Labor Party. Rather than embrace real outcomes, rather than get involved in policies that will actually deliver lower greenhouse gas emissions to Australia, the Labor Party engages in policies of alarmism and in scenarios about the world in 2100. There has been some discussion today about global warming, and it is worthwhile seeing a chart that goes back 400,000 years and points out that the sorts of variations in global temperatures that we are seeing now were repeated 150,000 years ago, 250,000 years ago and almost 350,000 years ago. Perhaps some people on the other side were around then; perhaps they were the ones rubbing the sticks together. I table that document. Twice rejected by the people for his policies, which just do not make sense, the Leader of the Opposition has come forward, embracing a policy on Kyoto and claiming to be a climate expert, just as he claimed to be an expert on Collins class submarines. Can the Leader of the Opposition say for sure that human behaviour is behind global warming, and can he indicate how? I very much doubt it. Can the Leader of the Opposition say for certain how much the global temperature will rise and how that will affect our planet? I very much doubt it. Faced with the reality, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Grayndler have been out there headline hunting, employing the language of the catastrophic and pretending that Kyoto is the panacea to that which troubles them so. Never have we seen such a disingenuous policy or such an attempt to mislead the people of Australia by fear; they do not use scithat ence. Let us see what some of the commentary in today's papers puts forward. An article in today's Australian says that Kyoto is a ‘pointless exercise'. The article states: It will do next to nothing to lower the rate of global emissions of greenhouse gas and provides no workable framework for future action. By 2012, when ratifying countries' commitments under Kyoto to cut CO2 emissions expire, we will find key countries have failed to comply and global emissions will be rising steadily as a result of world growth. Never a truer word was spoken. Already we see that Italy, one of the countries in Europe that did ratify, has stated publicly that it will not be part of Kyoto 2. The article goes on: Urging Australians to make the Protocol their Valentine comes close to advocating national necrophilia. Kyoto has been a corpse since December. Truer words were never spoken. The article further states: Attempts to turn every unusual weather event into confirmation of these forecasts by climate change propagandists and politicians, from England's Tony Blair to Australia's Beazley, should be seen for what they are-either misinformed or fraudulent. What we are seeing here is a deliberate attempt, a desperate attempt, to get onto the agenda map and show that they actually have policies by grasping a policy that is completely flawed. I see that the Leader of the Opposition was keen to quote the Sydney Morning Herald today. Let me quote an article from today's Sydney Morning Herald: ... it‘it' being Kyotorelies on short-term emission-reduction targets for just 34 industrialised countries34 countries! I think when I last looked at the UN web site there were about 191 countries in the worldimposing high costs and jeopardising compliance, while generating only trivial climate benefits, failing to provide for the participation of developing countries and eschewing a sustainable long term solution. What we are seeing are continued attempts by the opposition to take the easy path to control climate change, the easy path to address greenhouse gas emissions. The ALP would much rather adopt policies made in Geneva than policies relevant to Australians. The Australian government realised a long time ago that we had to do something about addressing our greenhouse gas emissions, and we have made a $1.8 billion investment to combat greenhouse gases in Australia. As has been said repeatedly, even by the opposition today, greenhouse gas emission targets in Australia will be met. Australia is one of the few countries, perhaps one of only four countries in the world, that will meet its greenhouse gas target. Even though Australia's economy has doubled since 1990, our greenhouse gas emissions will increase by only eight per cent, as per the target we were set. Last year this government announced a policy package that will go a long way towards addressing greenhouse gas emissions. We announced $500 million for a lowemissions technology demonstration fund, which will attract at least a further $1 billion from industry and ensure real pilot plants will be built that can reduce greenhouse gases-not maybe, not could be, not if the Europeans agree but will reduce greenhouse gases and will be built. As well as that, there is $100 million for the renewable energy development initiative, $75 million for the solar cities trial, $20 million for the advanced electricity storage initiative, and $14 million to develop an advanced wind forecasting capacity-I think there might be a job there for the Leader of the Opposition. He seems to think he can forecast Australia's weather better than anyone else. Rather than arcane mandatory measures imposed by Labor, the government has supported policies and investments from companies that have seen some real reductions in greenhouse gases. For the benefit of the House, let me quote a few figures from industries that the Labor Party's endorsement of Kyoto would drive overseas to our competitors, and from where Australian jobs would be lost. Alumina-between 1990 and 2002, greenhouse gas emissions per tonne of alumina decreased by almost 13 per cent; Aluminium-between 1990 and 2002, greenhouse gas emissions per tonne of aluminium decreased by 13 per cent; direct greenhouse gas emission from Australian aluminium smelters fell from 6.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 1990 to 4.8 million tonnes in 2003, a 23 per cent reduction-even though production of aluminium metal in Australia had grown by 50 per cent. So we are seeing quite real results. In the paper industry there was a very significant reduction of nearly 20 per cent between 1990 and 2002. What we see are practical policies, implemented by government and industry working in cooperation to ensure the jobs of Australians are protected. (Time expired)",98
119,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What an extraordinary contribution from the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources to the matter of public importance debate today on the Kyoto protocol, but where is the minister who represents the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in this House? He could not even be bothered to speak on what is the most significant ronmental challenge facing the global community. That says it all, when it comes to government. The contribution of the industry minister was quite extraordinary. He spoke about a program that had been designed in Europe. Minister, there is a reason why it is called the Kyoto protocol: it was formed in Kyoto. The minister said there is a reason why only 34 industrialised countries have signed up to the Kyoto protocol. Guess what: we were one of the countries that originally signed up. The minister confuses industrialised nations with nations overall. It is quite clear why the Kyoto protocol originally had that number of signatories and why developing countries do not have to reduce their emissions in the first stage: because it is apincrease propriate. Industrialised countries, including Australia, thought it was appropriate that we showed leadership on this issue, which is why we were an original signatory. The minister spoke about how Australian corporations are somehow against this. Not a single Australian company has said it will move offshore if we ratify the Kyoto protocol. We know that to be the case. We also know that the first company in the world to engage in the European emissions trading system was a company called BHP Billiton-one that has a bit of history here in Australia! The Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources was put up in this debate on the same day he appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald with his head under the doona, saying: Whether or not those emissions are causing climate change, I don't know ... If you go back across history, millions of years, carbon-dioxide levels go up and down and global warming comes and goes. I mean, the Earth is a lot warmer than it was when the glaciers formed. That is good, that is terrific and that is a great start. But compare those comments with the envi- comments from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage who argues that the this reason why we should not ratify this agreement is that it does not go far enough. He agrees with us-he did not before he was environment minister, but once he became environment minister he got a bit of a departmental briefing, went on Insiders and said global warming was the greatest issue facing the international community. Now he says: I think we need to engage the climate scepticshe has done that internallythose people who are pulling the doona up over their heads, and get past the debate over whether or not climate change is real. There is a dominance of science which does say that the massive in greenhouse gas emissions has contributed to human-induced climate change. The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out the Prime Minister's comments-his emotional excitement, getting carried away with himself and congratulating his government on 19 December 1997 for the Kyoto protocol details. Of course, what the Prime Minister did not say is that, once again, like all good things that happen in this nation, it began under Labor. At the Rio summit in 1992, the Australian Labor government played a critical role in advancing the cause that has led to today's historic agreement. But the Prime Minister was not alone. The Minister for Resources and Energy at the time, former senator Warwick Parer, said: The Kyoto Protocol provides a sound basis for protecting Australia's export competitiveness and employment prospects in our minerals processing and energy export industries ... The Deputy Prime Minister, who was then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, said: ... the Kyoto agreement permitting Australia an 8% increase in emissions of 6 greenhouse gases by 2012 over 1990 levels will preserve the interests of farmers, miners, manufacturing industry and the economy in general. Critical to the point the Leader of the Opposition makes regarding the future are the words of the then Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill. Senator Hill-Hansard, 23 November 1999-said: ... Australia, although accepting a demanding target at Kyoto, nevertheless got a fair target, it is unlikely that any alternative international negotiation that could potentially subsume Kyoto in the future would give to Australia an opportunity that is as fair as we were able to negotiate Kyoto. Game, set and match. This is not just about what happens today but about what happens in 2012. The irony is that it is absolutely in Australia's national interest. It is in our economic interest, the interest of our employment and the interest of our environment that we ratify this protocol. We live in the driest continent on earth and are particularly vulnerable to climate change. We all live around the coast and we saw what happened recently with the tsunami in Asia. That was a tragic event-an event which we could do nothing to avoid. This crisis is looming. It will create environmental refugees and see nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu, literally disappear. It will see one-sixth of Bangladesh disappear and 30 million people in India displaced. Mr Snowdon-As well as the Cocos Islands.",101
120,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As well as the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, which are part of our territory. It will see salt water flood Kakadu. As well, there will be an increase in the impacts we see already-the decrease in rainfall in Western Australia, the increase in the number of droughts in New South Wales and the coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef. We are particularly vulnerable, but we are also in a unique situation to take advantage of economic opportunities. The clean development mechanism projects are how we get the developing countries to be part of this. Yes, they do not have to reduce their targets, but we receive a carbon credit-an economic one-off bonus-if we invest in renewables in developing countries. What is frightening is that China is actuand ally doing a bit better than we are in this area. If you exclude the decisions of the New South Wales and Queensland Labor governments to stem land clearing, then our emisin sions are a disaster, whether in industry or transport. An Australian Greenhouse Office report-the same report that in December last year said we will meet the 108 per cent target-projected that there would be a 23 per cent increase in emissions by Australia up to the year 2020. The irony is that by not being a part of the agreement it is actually twice as expensive to meet our target, because you forsake the economic gain. It is absolutely extraordinary that the government boasts that it will meet the target but does not want the opportunity that comes with it-the carrot and stick approach: it wants the stick but it is not prepared to take the carrot of those economic opportunities. The great tragedy is that this will be a driving force in 21st century economic development. This is not something that is going to grow slowly; this is something that will grow exponentially. I have heard comments from government ministers today, ‘The carbon-trading market hasn't exploded yet; it is not worth billions yet.' It is day The agreement just began. It is quite clear that the smart companies in Australia-the Commonwealth Bank and Bayard Capitaland organisations such as Sydney Futures Exchange are positioning themselves. That is why companies such as Shell and BP are positioning themselves. They have internal emissions trading markets. Saudi Arabia has ratified the agreement. They know what the future is, and so should we. It does not make economic sense for Australia, it does not make sense in terms of Australia's employment opportunities and it certainly does not make sense for Australia's environment. The Prime Minister reversed his position on 5 June 2002. Does anyone think if the US ratified the protocol that we would not? (Time expired)",102
121,Mr ROBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Goldstein) (3.40 p.m.)Despite all the huffing and puffing on the other side of the House, and we just heard more of it from the member for Grayndler, despite the fact that the opposition actually proposed this MPI and despite the fact that they presented a private member's bill earlier this week, in many respects this is a nondebate. There is no debate if there is only one side making a case. Over the past few days, as this greenhouse issue has been discussed, only one side has made a serious attempt to address the issues, only one side has a clearly articulated plan, only one side has made the effort to weigh the costs and benefits for Australia, only one side is working with the facts and only one side is putting forward a substantiated, argued case-the Howard government. I have read all the speeches given in this House by Labor members over the last few days. I have heard more of them today in this House. Without exception, they all boil down to pages and pages and pages of ideology and simplistic rhetoric. All of this is against a background of a constant refrain, a slogan or one. a mantra: ‘Sign the Kyoto protocol'. It is all you hear when you turn on the news. It is all you hear in the House from the oppositiona mantra: ‘Sign the Kyoto protocol'. I have looked for substantive arguments against which I could judge the steps the government has taken over several years to address greenhouse gas emissions. There is nothing. It is as though every Labor speech simply ignores the raft of initiatives that Australia has in place and has undertaken. For instance, the Labor Party makes no substantive comment on Australia's remarkable achievement of meeting its target of no more than eight per cent above 1990 emission levels at a time-you have not heard this mentioned once in this House by the opposition-when the size of Australia's economy has virtually doubled. It has required a massive increase in energy to drive that growth. Labor has not spent one second wondering how it is that Australia has delivered on its greenhouse targets, yet all the major countries making the argument to sign the protocol are falling well short: France, 10 per cent shortfall; the Netherlands, 12 per cent shortfall; Germany, 1.3 per cent shortfall; Italy, 10 per cent shortfall; Spain, 33 per cent shortfall. The opposition has had the opportunity to wonder about these things: ‘What is the motive behind these countries pushing so hard for others to sign when they in fact are falling well short?' The Labor Party makes no comment on the fact that the Kyoto protocol will at best deliver about a one per cent reduction in global greenhouse emissions. Everyone acknowledges that, while the experts agree that what is required is a 50 to 60 per cent reducemissions tion in emissions. Surely this huge gap warrants some consideration and some discussion-especially by the party that is introducing these debates to the House. We know the US, China and India have a long standing resistance to binding targets. there is no global consensus on achieving a one per cent cut, surely the prospect of the Kyoto protocol and all that goes on behind leading to cuts of 50 to 60 per cent, warrants some consideration and some deliberation. But what do we get from the opposition? Just the mantra: ‘Sign the Kyoto protocol'. In a similar vein, the Labor Party makes no comment on how we meet the increasing energy needs of the world yet put less greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Signing the protocol delivers a one per cent reduction, and even that must be in doubt when you consider this morning's press where we read that the Brits are back-pedalling furiously, with Tony Blair proposing that British industry produce about 20 million tonnes more carbon dioxide than the limits they had agreed to. How does the Kyoto protocol sit with the legitimate world expectations about solving world poverty? Again we have heard none of that. The Labor Party make no comment on Australia's existing commitment to renewable energy. It is as though we have done nothing. We have a world-leading renewable energy target, we have a historic $75 million solar cities program and there is a $1.7 billion domestic investment in our climate change strategy. They are part of a comprehensive plan-no mention of it. Even if they disagree with it, we should understand why in their view it makes no contribution. They just walk through it, ignore it and go on with the mantra. The Labor Party are silent on the way an trading scheme would affect electricity prices for Australian families. Given every opportunity today, there is not a mention of it. They are also silent on how that scheme would stop in its tracks energy investment in Australia. No mention is made If by the opposition of the $8 per tonne price of CO2 in the fledgling European emissions trading market and the impact that would it, have on new energy intensive investments in Australia, including new electricity generating capacity, a critical issue for all Australians. Effectively, the carbon-trading scheme is a tax. At the moment it is an $8 a tonne CO2 tax. That is why Hydro Aluminium, a European company, recently signed a heads of agreement to develop one of the world's largest aluminium plants in Qatar at the same time that they were preparing to phase out their aluminium plants in Norway and review their plant in Germany in order to meet the cost of future emission targets. This means that energy intensive projects are already starting to move out of Kyoto countries into non-Kyoto countries. This fledgling market has hardly started, yet serious investment is moving out of Kyoto countries into non-Kyoto countries. We were told this would not happen. We were told that this scheme would not threaten the lives and livelihoods of Australians, would not increase electricity prices and would not see investment leave this country, but we already have evidence in Europe that it is taking place. We have China and India on our doorstep, amongst the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, eager to grab energy intensive investments from Australia. That will mean higher electricity prices for families. That will also mean a loss of jobs and a loss of energy intensive projects like paper, aluminium, electricity generation, coal and other such projects. The Labor Party engages in no way on the scientific debate that underpins the Kyoto protocol, other than to pour scorn over anyone who seeks to be satisfied on the modelling and the science that underpins the Kyoto protocol, a protocol which will cost trillions of dollars to implement. Choking off debate, as it has, only invites community suspicion. The Labor Party makes no comment on the fact that Australia's prosperity has been and continues to be built on an abundance of cheap energy sources. That is our past; that is our future. That is what has given us a competitive edge in this country. That has given us the living standards that we all enjoy. The living standards that we take for granted would be seriously compromised if investment in those traditional energy sources were discouraged. This matter of public importance is little more than a stunt. The Labor Party's contribution to the debate has been largely to peddle fear and chant a slogan. Labor have a slogan; we have a policy. Those on the other side of the House are like one giant yoga class with everyone chanting their mantra: ‘Sign the Kyoto protocol'. It is like a cult following. They are all in another space. They are certainly not in this debate. There is no attempt to argue the substantive issues. There is no attempt to put together a detailed plan. Labor have simply not done the work on this issue and they are trying to play politics, cynically playing on the legitimate community concerns about climate change. It is symptomatic of the Labor approach to so many policy areas. They have not done the hard policy work for nine years, yet they wonder why they are still in opposition. I can remember noodle nation and the gold card. That is about all that they have produced in nine years, and they wonder why they are sitting over there in opposition. Labor's contribution is a lazy stunt. But it is also gerous stunt because it creates a moral hazard for our nation. If they keep banging on with this mantra, more Australians will think that all we have to do is sign the protocol when what we have to do is to continue the hard work-the deliberate work, the exhaustive work-that this government has done to put in place a plan to reduce greenhouse gases in this country and around the world.

122,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The discussion is concluded. NA Privileges Committee Report,105
123,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,COMMITTEES,I present the report of the Committee of Privileges concerning the alleged threats to Mr Latham MP and Mr Murphy MP. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.,105
124,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,COMMITTEES,"by leave-In presenting this report, I want to thank the officers of the committee, David Elder, Claressa Surtees and Laura Gillies. I want to thank the Clerk of the House, Ian Harris, for his advice, which is contained in appendix C to the report. I also particularly want to thank the members of the committee, who cooperated effectively to produce quickly and efficiently a response to the reference we received from the House of Representatives. I would also like to make some remarks. The conclusions we have published help to clarify the implications of section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. In his advice to the committee on this matter, the Clerk, Mr Harris, referred to section 4 and wrote that the closest precedent of which he was aware was the Browne-Fitzpatrick case a danof 1955. The nature of this case-the extremes of behaviour it entailed together with the subsequent jailing of Fitzpatrick and Browne-gave the committee pause to reflect very carefully on the circumstances of this case and to take great care in presenting our conclusions. While the committee agreed unanimously that there was no breach of privilege, we have included remarks that place the circumstances of the case in context with the robust relationship between journalists and members of this House. We have included a cautionary warning to the media to be conscious in their exchanges with MPs not to allow there to be an appearance that they may wish to influence members by any means in the free performance of their duties as members. Public Works Committee Reference",105
125,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (3.52 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Proposed mid-life upgrade of existing Chancery building for the Australian High Commission, Singapore. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes a comprehensive mid-life upgrade and refurbishment of the existing chancery of the Australian High Commission in Singapore to modernise the facility and ensure full compliance with current Australian and Singapore building codes. The Commonwealth leased the site for the chancery for a period of 99 years in April 1974, and the building was completed and first occupied in 1977. Apart from a refurbishment of the building's facade in 1994 and the progressive replacement of some plant, no major architectural or services refurbishment has been undertaken on the building. A key objective of the refurbishment is the consolidation of accommodation requirements. Since the building was first occupied, the numbers of staff-both Australia based and locally engaged-have been reduced, reflecting changes in office practices and efficiencies. The current configuration of offices and services is therefore no longer required. Some areas of the building are currently vacant or inefficiently configured. The refurbishment will provide for a consolidation of current vacant areas into one floor, which will be available for any future requirements. New office fit-outs for tenant agencies will be undertaken concurrently with the mid-life upgrade of the building to create safe, flexible and efficient work spaces. Many of the existing building's services are more than 25 years old and have reached the end of their useful and economic life. Their replacement is required to ensure that major plant breakdowns do not occur. The project also includes, within a fenced compound: full support services-emergency power, potable water and firefighting; staff recreation areas; a controlled access car parking area; and fully landscaped surrounds. The estimated cost of the new proposal is $12.7 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, these works are planned to commence in March 2006 and to be completed in the first half of 2007. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",106
126,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (3.55 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, and by reason of the urgent nature of the work, it is expedient that the following proposed work be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Construction and refurbishment works on a building to serve as a new Chancery for the Australian Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is undertaking urgent construction and refurbishment works on a building to serve as the new chancery. The work involves the conversion of an existing leased building located in the international zone. The base cost for fit-out and ancillary works on the project is approximately $4 million. Reviews of chancery security carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have led to a continuing re-assessment of construction requirements, with consequent increases in cost. Security costs, including costs of providing blast protectionjudged critically important to ensure effective operation of the post and staff and visitor safety-are currently assessed at $9 million. The current cost of the project will therefore exceed the $6 million threshold for reference of the project to the Public Works Committee. The project is being managed in a uniquely dangerous environment. It is not a normal project. Threats to contractors and workers on all such projects in Baghdad are frequent. The site is commonly exposed to indirect rocket and mortar fire. The early completion and occupation of the new chancery will enable the embassy to relocate to the international zone and to carry out its functions in a building constructed to the required security standards. The current construction schedule envisages completion and occupation of the building in July 2005. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has advised that the effective functioning of the embassy and the security and safety of staff and visitors depend on the earliest possible completion of this project. In these circumstances, he has requested that the parliament be asked to agree to an exemption of this project from formal consideration by the Public Works Committee. The committee has advised the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that it concurs in its assessment that these works are a matter of considerable urgency. The committee has indicated that it will accept the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's offer of a private briefing on the details of the project. This briefing will be arranged with the committee as soon as possible. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",106
127,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (3.58 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, and by reason of the urgent nature of the work, it is expedient that the following proposed work be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Repairs to, and urgent security upgrade of, the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to undertake urgent construction work at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta to complete repairs of bomb damage and to meet current urgent security requirements in order to ensure the physical safety of embassy staff and visitors following damage to the building in a car bomb attack on 9 September 2004. The government has decided that, given the urgent need, it is not feasible to refer these works to the Public Works Committee. A proposal to proceed with a construction project without referral to the Public Works Committee is not common, because the government supports and endorses the role of the committee and appreciates the value that it adds to projects. However, there are some instances where referral to the committee is not feasible. The previous motion was also one of these. In the present case, the works have a high degree of urgency. Following the incident on 9 September last year, emergency recommissioning works were completed to restore the building's integrity and enable the provision of normal embassy services. Additional works are now required to complete damage repairs and meet current urgent security requirements as quickly as possible. Design work has been completed and tendered work should begin as a matter of priority. The estimated cost of construction of this project is $11.64 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, these works are planned to commence this month, with completion in November this year. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES No. 1) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed.",107
128,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Hunter has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,108
129,Ms CORCORAN,COMMITTEES,"Isaacs) (4.00 p.m.)Before I was interrupted by question time, I had started to talk about the Howard government's recognition of problems with mature age unemployment and the establishment of a Prime Minister's community business partnerships committee. The committee's draft report, leaked to the Australian Financial Review in October 2004, offered 36 recommendations or matters for consideration. Not one of these recommendations suggested a tax offset for mature age workers. According to the Financial Review, the recommendations included boosting training opportunities for mature age workers and raising awareness of work force implications of the ageing population. At the time of the tax offset announcement, the Prime Minister indicated that there would be further announcements addressing the partnerships committee's approach. To date, no such announcements have been made. What all this boils down to is this: a tax offset is very nice and no-one is going to knock it back, but it is not going to address the problem of getting older workers back into the work force. After all, by definition, a tax offset will be enjoyed by those already in the work force. This tax offset was all about buying votes in the election last year; it was not about helping those out of work to get back into the work force. I will concede that it might encourage some people who are thinking about leaving work to stay a bit longer, but that is questionable. It is worth noting, too, that this vote buying exercise, when promised last year, was costed at $1.04 billion; it is now estimated to cost $1.44 billion. In stark contrast to this flimsy attempt to help older unemployed people is the ALP's policy. Our policy proposed a number of measures that were carefully designed to tackle the underlying reasons behind low work force participation among mature age workers. These included a number of things: establishing mature age career centres to assist mature age Australians get back to work; providing rapid assistance for workers who are displaced or about to be displaced due to large-scale or regional retrenchment; establishing a training partnerships fund to encourage employers to retrain and reskill mature age employees; earmarking 2,500 new TAFE places each year for Australians over 45 years old; developing new procedures for formally recognising the skills and experience of mature age Australians when they attain new qualifications; funding an additional 500 new places in the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme earmarked for mature age job seekers who do not receive income support; providing a $2,000 learning bonus to mature age job seekers who take up an apprenticeship or traineeship in an area of skill shortage; deploying 125 mature age workplace trainers in key industries to develop and implement workplace training plans; implementing community programs to improve adult literacy levels; supporting mature age workers to undertake nationally accredited training in information technology; and establishing Job Network providers that specialise in assisting mature age job seekers. Unlike the government's policy, Labor's policy addresses a range of factors and problems that contribute to mature age unemployment and low mature age work force participation. In summary, this proposal for an expensive tax offset is all about buying votes. After all, last year many older people missed out on the tax breaks given to those on the top tax rates and on the benefits made available to families. The government had to do something to pacify this group of voters. If the government is serious about helping older people back into the work force, it should listen to its own committee and to the policies put forward by the Australian Labor Party, both of which have strategies for tackling the cause of this problem.",108
130,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"I rise this afternoon to speak specifically on schedule 3 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005 and to make some broader comments about the issue of certain members of the legal profession fronting up to their tax responsibilities. At the outset, I would like to deal with the issue of tourism. This bill brings tourism goods and services to be consumed in Australia but purchased from foreign tour operators into the GST net. It is an important industry, as we all appreciate and, therefore, it is essential that we do what is necessary to get tax and regulatory reform right. Tourism creates 8.3 per cent of the nation's GDP, which is about $60 million. It is exceptionally important to a number of significant regions of Australia where it is more than ever the engine room of jobs growth. Tourism is an employer of around 550,000 Australians, many of them in regional Australia, and it generates $17 million in export earnings each year. Tourism is also a robust industry. It has had to tackle a number of challenges in recent years, including the collapse of Ansett, the impact of the unfortunate terrorist event in Bali and, in more recent times, the impact of SARS and a variety of domestic and international challenges. It has survived those challenges; it has proven its robust nature in terms of its export earnings for Australia and as a generator of employment. But that does not take away from the fact that the introduction of the GST also presented a serious challenge to the tourism industry. The record shows that the GST had a detrimental effect on domestic tourism, effectively adding 10 per cent to the cost of taking a holiday in Australia. Unlike other discretionary items such as white goods, tourism did not benefit from the removal of sales tax. The tourism industry has been hard hit on many fronts in the 21st century, as I have touched on, with the GST, the collapse of Ansett, the SARS virus and heightened fears of terrorism and global instability. This afternoon I raise another important issue: the issue of skills. I have said on numerous other occasions that it is imperative that this government recognises and addresses the fact that skills shortages are straining the Australian economy in many areas. Tourism is just one example; it is also the case with the building and construction industry and the resources and energy industry. You name it and we have serious problems in relation to our capacity to service needs of industry at this point because of the shortage of skills not only at the trade level but also at the tertiary education level. I think it is fair to suggest that, whilst parts of the industry excel in long-term career development, in hospitality and tourism the sector continues to rely heavily on workers for whom the job is a temporary or shortterm arrangement while they are studying, raising families or waiting to take up other vocational opportunities. The continual cost of training and retraining in the industry dermines productivity and profitability just as the continual loss of skills undermines service and quality levels. Long-term career development pathways are essential to attract a new work force to the sector-one that is passionate about hospitality and tourism and dedicated to excellence in every respect. The opposition went to the last election promising to create 36,000 new vocational education and training places each year and to pay TAFE fees for secondary students who wanted to get a vocational qualification to address this skills shortage. The opposition also pledged to assist tourism businesses to retain skilled staff by converting the Howard government's one-off baby bonus into a proper system of paid maternity leave to help small tourism businesses keep their highly trained female work force. There is no more pressing area of government neglect than the underinvestment in TAFE and vocational education and training. Getting this sector operating effectively and efficiently-which also goes to the nature of the tax systemproperly funding our already world-class TAFE system and getting the private sector conto play its part in funding and providing training for the work force are crucial to the nation's future prosperity. That takes me back to the provisions of schedule 3 and the need to get this tax measure right for industry so as to ensure that we the do not impede any further growth in the industry's capacity. We must go out of our way to ensure that we do not create further problems for the industry. The opposition therefore acknowledges that, whilst the schedule seeks to close a loophole that effectively allows a package of tourism services to be constructed GST free for foreign tourists, its design raises a number of technical issues which need proper consideration by the government. In particular, the industry advises that there is no transitional period to enable un- affected operators to adjust pricing to account for the imposition of the tax. Further, there is no recognition that operators will be unable to recover the tax in the period between the bill being introduced and its receiving royal assent. The industry has also advised that there are multiple technical complexities arising from the proposed tax law, particularly the complexity of valuation that is facing operators. For example, foreign operators supply mixed goods and services, of which some are taxable, some are GST free, some are subject to input tax and some are out of the scope of tax law. They may be dealing also in multiple currencies, so that the ratio for computing tax on mixed supplies changes every day. It can therefore be suggested that for each tourist on a tour package the actual taxable component could be different because each one will come from different options with different taxable components. These issues are a headache for small business. All of these issues, we believe, could have been addressed had this government consulted with the industry in the first place. Good policy actually comes from widespread consultation. Instead, a very significant provider of Australian tourism services and one which we rely on heavily to market Australian tourism and spread the word about Australia as a first-class tourist destination-that is, foreign tour operators-has been ignored by this government and treated poorly. This is the last thing the industry needs coming off the back of the government's spectacular failure with the Brand Australia campaign. I believe that the Australian tourism industry needs and deserves better from this government. Good international marketing is critical to the continuing success of Australian tourism. It is critical to export growth and it is critical to job growth in Australia, which is exceptionally important not only in our major capital cities but also in key regional areas. So too are our relationships with those in the supply chain who make it all happen. I refer, for example, to foreign tourism operators who sell our wares and package Australia for foreign tourists. While the government has been crowing about international visitor figures, it is very clear that these figures are being held up by New Zealand. In other key markets, alternatively, we are not doing as well as we should be in terms of export growth. That is why the opposition will be seeking to refer this bill to a Senate legislation committee-to allow the industry's voice to be heard. It is not too late to make sure that, in the final consideration of the tax measures before the House and through proper consultation with the other place, we enable the tourism industry to make the points to the government that it should seriously attend to in trying to get these tax measures right. That takes me to other serious tax issues which are causing me and many in this community some concern at the moment. I think it is fair to say that all hard working Australians accept that there is a requirement to pay tax, and they also expect that every Australian pulls his or her weight when it comes to fronting up to their responsibilities with respect to the issue of taxation. I specifically refer to the ongoing concerns with respect to the tax-shy legal community. It is a major problem to the Australian Taxation Office and one that has especially been rearing its head in the media in more recent weeks. I suggest to the House that there is unfortunately a certain degree of arrogance amongst some members of the legal fraternity about their tax obligations which I believe is un-Australian. Worse, it is also now clear from the recent reports that not only does this arrogance exist amongst barristers and solicitors, it has also unfortunately spread to the judicial system. It seems that, for some, the practices that they developed at the bar, be it as barristers or solicitors, have gone with them in their judicial appointments. Obviously this is a major tax problem for the Australian community, and I contend that it is an issue that is capable of being discussed in terms of the bill currently before the House because it goes to tax issues and the need for the Australian community to plug any loopholes in the system. For that reason I refer to the recent Commissioner of Taxation reports of 2002-03 and 2003-04. Firstly, with respect to the Commissioner of Taxation's report of 2002-03, I note that there has now been an endeavour by the commissioner to ensure that solicitors and barristers throughout Australia are held responsible and that they improve compliance so as to ensure that they, like the great majority of Australians, actually pay their way when it comes to meeting their tax obligations. Unfortunately, the report also notes at page 172 that there is still a small group of individuals who will lodge only after they have been served formal lodgement demand notices. It also notes that it is now a requirement of the Commissioner of Taxation in carrying out his responsibilities to make sure that something is done to seriously consider whether in the future we deny some of these individuals the extended lodgement period available when using tax agents to prepare their returns. Worse still-and this is a very serious issue in the context of the bill before the House-the report notes that the current level of debt for barristers nationally is $51.6 million. At least it is down from $57million over the previous four months, so at least some progress is being made in terms of the 2002-03 report. That in turn takes me to the Commissioner of Taxation's report of 2003-04. It notes at page 157 that the commissioner: ... has noted some positive changes in the atti- Hansard. tudes and behaviour of barristers and solicitors towards meeting their tax obligations. It also refers to the fact that the Commissioner of Taxation is now working with the legal fraternity to try to get through to them that, as people responsible for promoting an adherence to the laws of the land, they have to accept that there is a certain code of practice or standard expected of them in terms of meeting their tax obligations. What disturbs me in this report is that the debt for barristers nationally is $65 million, up from the $51.6 million in the previous year. This increase is attributed to a rise in disputed debt, and approximately $48 million, or 74 per cent, relates to debts of more than $100,000. The debt for solicitors nationally is noted at $180.4 million, with $122.4 million or 67.8 per cent related to solicitors with debts of more than $100,000, or 6.7 per cent of cases. I raise these issues because I think it is very important that when we deal with serious tax issues we also use these opportunities to remind those in the community who believe they are above the law about their responsibilities and obligations to the Australian community. Highest amongst those responsibilities, I believe, are the barristers and the solicitors who are given the responsibility of seeking to maintain respect for and adherence to the law, and also the judges who enjoy certain privileges in the Australian community as they are required to adjudicate on the application of law including tax law. I am therefore disturbed to read in recent reports that a number of judges have been unwilling to meet their responsibilities.",109
131,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,I hate to interrupt the member for Batman but the bill is a fairly narrow bill. I do not wish to restrict debate in the House but I think there may be other forms of the House where he could put his views into the,112
132,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, whilst the bill is narrow it also refers to encouraging some people-mature age workers-to work over a longer period. If we strictly apply the law, then some of these judges, barristers and solicitors might have to take up some of these provisions to meet their tax obligations.",112
133,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"I have no doubt that it has to do with taxation but I think it is probably not to do with the bill, and I would ask the member to come back to the bill.",112
134,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am seeking to deal with the intent of the bill, which is clearly about guaranteeing that all of us pull our weight in terms of taxation. Therefore I think it is important that I bring to the attention of the House the failure of some members of the legal fraternity to meet the intent of the legislation currently before the chair and the endeavours of the government, as reflected in the bill, to guarantee that people meet their responsibilities. I am also aware of the provisions of the standing orders not to reflect on any individual judge, nor have I and nor will I, because I am seeking to reflect on the performance of a range of judges without specifically referring to them by name or the nature of their appointment. I think we have to raise these issues in places such as this to send a message to these judges that it is no longer acceptable as reported in the media to avoid their responsibilities. For that reason I bring to the attention of the House that on the basis of recent reports one judge has not lodged a return for seven years, one judge has not lodged a return for five years, one judge has not lodged a return for three years and nine judges have not lodged two returns. It is also interesting to note in terms of the Australian Taxation Office submission to the recent bankruptcy inquiry, which reported last year, that 12 months after the close of the June 2002-03 financial year 66 judges had returns outstanding. I think this is important because these judges occupy a very privileged position in the community. And in relation to the use of hard working taxpayers' money I refer to the fact that the estimated unfunded liability for federal judges' pensions as at 30 June is $359.2 million. Maybe if they paid their taxes they could help us as a community to meet some of those responsibilities. It is also interesting to note, in relation salary adjustments paid for by the taxpayers federally out of the consolidated revenue, that in the financial year 2002-03 judges received a salary increase of seven per cent. In the financial year 2003-04 they received a salary increase of nine per cent. In the financial year 2004-05 they received a salary increase of 8.9 per cent. These are not inconsiderable improvements in the salaries paid to judges in the federal system, especially when you consider that the rise in CPI over that period amounted to 4.2 per cent. So we are talking about increases to the very privileged members of the community way over those paid to ordinary workers. Average weekly earnings, it is interesting to note, over the same period only increased by 7.9 per cent, which is less than the increases granted to judges in two separate years: nine per cent in 2003-04 and 8.9 per cent in 200405. In relation to public support for some of these people who are unwilling to pay their fair share of taxation, the record also shows that the Australian Government Actuary has been doing some assessments of the real cost to the Australian community of adding the cost of the superannuation arrangements, which are non-contributory, to the overall salary package of judges. If a notional Commonwealth contribution to judges' pensions of 55.3 per cent of salaries as at 30 June 2002 is added to judicial salaries then the total for High Court judges would be $517,304 per annum and the total for the Chief Justice of the High Court would be $570,044. Similarly, for the Federal Court we have considerable jumps in the overall cost to the community. So I simply say that the time has been reached in relation to judges for the tax commissioner, having given them some notification, to name them. If they then fail to meet their obligations, we should give serito ous consideration to whether those judges should be removed from the bench. I am sick and tired of these bludgers not pulling their weight when it comes to issues about Australian workers being willing to front up to their responsibilities on the tax front. If it is all right for the Australian government to pursue ordinary blue-collar workers to pay their tax obligations, then it is high time that these judges, who receive very substantial benefits in salaries and pensions, also pulled their weight. I simply say to the Commissioner of Taxation: ‘Go your hardest; front them up; make sure barristers and solicitors and, unfortunately, judges start to meet their responsibilities.' We are sick and tired of them bludging on the Australian community. (Time expired)",112
135,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,I remind the member for Batman that the chair believes that it has been very lenient on his contribution. I would ask him in future to stay within the bill and if he wants to mention other subjects to use the grievance or adjournment debates to do so.,114
136,Mrs IRWIN,COMMITTEES,"In speaking in this debate I will be limiting my remarks to schedule 4 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005 relating to mature age worker tax offset provisions. As the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer said in his second reading speech on this bill: This is part of the government's strategy to deal with the demographic challenge posed by the ageing of our population. It recognises that proving the labour force participation of mature age workers will improve productivity, thereby assisting in securing Australia's future economic strength. It also demonstrates the government's commitment to and appreciation of older workers. There we have, in 50 words, the entire justification for this government spending $490 million next year and nearly $1½ billion over the next four years. That is a huge cost to the revenue with just 50 words of explanation. And it is all because members of the government shudder when they hear just four words. Those are four words that will haunt them over the next few years. Those four words are the government's real strategy to deal with an ageing population-and those four words are: work till you drop. That is the government's strategy. And this measure is the sugar coating that this government thinks will sweeten the deal. We might have thought that, before spending $1½ billion dollars, the government would have looked long and hard at the reasons for people over 55 leaving the work force. We might have seen a study which showed that people over 55 would stay in the work force or re-enter the work force if they were to be given a tax concession of the type proposed in this bill. We might have seen some studies that showed roughly how many people could be expected to continue working over the age of 55 because of this bill. That would be the least we could expect. If the government is asking us to approve the expenditure of $1½ billion, just what are we getting in return? More importantly, if we spend the $1½ billion in other ways, would they produce a better outcome in dealing with the demographic challenge posed by the ageing of our population? I might give the minister a bit of help with his sums so that he can see the extent of the problem and how short-sighted this measure is in addressing the problem. For a start, let im- us look at the real problem. The problem is not just that the population is ageing. The bigger problem is that the proportion of older Australians in the work force has fallen dramatically. Since 1970 the proportion of men aged between 55 and 59 in the work force has fallen from almost 90 per cent to 72 per cent. In the 60 to 64 age group it has fallen from 75 per cent to 45 per cent. And for men over the age of 65 it has fallen from 22 per cent to eight per cent. Those figures show a huge drop in work force participation for males over 55. This is one of the biggest social changes to affect our society in the last half century. Changes to superannuation and pension laws will not have any effect for another 20 years. Faced with this major social change, the Treasurer throws a $500 tax concession at the issue and expects that it will change everything. As the minister said, it is part of the government's strategy to deal with the ageing of the Australian population. But, as we can see from the figures, Australian males are not willing to work until they drop, so where is the rest of the strategy? I do not think for one minute that this government really believes that offering a $500 tax deduction will reverse the trend such that we will see greatly increased numbers of males continuing in the work force well into their 60s. But there is no indication that the government is in any way prepared for the shape and style of work force that the next decades will produce. The government is quite happily going along on the assumption that the work force has not changed and will not change in the years ahead. The government is still living in an era when people worked until an age of retirement, at age 65, and then gracefully passed on a year or two later. The government makes a great fuss about how workers are living long past retirement age and tells us that a smaller number in employment need to provide for the growing numbers of retirees, so we need to keep people in the work force as long as possible. But this approach totally ignores the realiand valued. ties of life for many people-for those with adequate superannuation cover and with the benefit of other savings, not to mention inheritance. More and more people are able to plan a life outside the work force by the time they reach their mid-50s. But this government simply assumes that, with a modest incentive, people will continue in employment in the same way that they would when in their 30s or 40s. What is lacking in this approach is an understanding of the changing nature of work and, more importantly, the changing nature of the work force. The government has failed to hear the alarm bells that have been ringing for the past decade. The British management writer Charles Handy made these observations a decade ago. While we all got carried away with talk about globalisation and the material benefits of free trade, we forgot to ask individuals what they really wanted out of life. We simply assumed that people would continue to work to buy wide-screen TV sets and all the other needs in life. We overlooked the fact that increased wealth not only gave us the ability to buy material things but also gave us the wealth to be independent of the demands of the workplace. Charles Handy looked at it this way: Life lasts longer now. We are as healthy at 70 as our mothers and fathers were at 50. At the same time, whatever the forecasters say, organisational employment will be ending sooner rather than later for all of us. In the organisations of the next century, as they strip down to their barest essentials retirement will come at 55, or sooner. Most of us will have 20 more years of active life. The third age, the French like to call it, maintaining that we go through the first age of learning and the second age of working, until we come to the third age of living.... The third age will include work, preferably work of our choice, work that allows us to feel useful But this government simply ignores insights such as those of Charles Handy. It cannot see a future as anything other than a continuation of the present. It assumes that economic growth will go on forever, that consumers, whatever their age, will keep on consuming and that mature workers will work until they drop. If the government had a better understanding of the preferences of mature workers, it might be in a better position to make policy in this area. The first thing we have to realise is that we are talking about one-third of the adult population. We are talking about a group who hold more than two-thirds of the wealth of this country. When it comes to work participation we are talking about a group that has real choices-but this amendment ignores all that. Instead of looking at initiatives which would assist mature age workers to participate, we have a half-baked incentive which could even have the opposite effectof inducing mature age workers to reduce their hours of work to qualify for the rebate. When you think that the government is sinking $1½ billion into this scheme, you have to wonder how that money could be better spent with a greater chance of achieving higher participation by mature workers. As Charles Handy wrote over 10 years ago: The third age will grow in importance. We cannot ignore it. Individuals need to see it as part and to prepare for it, financially, psychologically and technically. Organisations must help them and encourage them not to leave it to the last two months. It will make the parting easier when people move on, not just out. Government, too, needs to make it easier for people to prepare for independence, not dependence. Education, re-skilling and new training need to be easily accessible. The people of the third age, mature, rich in experience, with independence and energy, could be a huge resource to the community. They could also be a burden. It is in all our interests to do what we can to make it an opportunity for all. When you compare the policies taken to the last election, it is not hard to see the difference in thinking between Labor and the coalition on this issue. Instead of a $1½ billion handout, Labor's modest and affordable policies, costing only $212 million, offered such initiatives as mature age career centres to assist mature age Australians to get back to work. As I have pointed out, mature age workers are a different breed. Specialist career guidance would be much more successful than the one-size-fits-all approach of many Job Network providers. And when it comes to the type of work available that could suit mature age workers there is much to be done to make industry aware of the choices of mature workers. Like many members of the House, I make use of the Comcars when parliament sits, and I often strike up conversations with the drivers about how they like their jobs. As most members would be aware, only a small proportion of Comcar drivers are full-time employees. The great majority are casual drivers, employed only when the parliament is sitting. As you might expect, a large number of casual drivers could be described as mature age, so it is always interesting to discuss of life how they mix their casual employment with other interests in life. So many drivers have a rich mixture of family, sport and leisure activities which they can fit around their hours on the job. I do not want to suggest that all mature age workers can get by on income from casual employment. Many mature age workers require full-time employment to maintain a reasonable lifestyle. But I should point out, and this should be a matter for a Senate committee to investigate, that many of those drivers will miss out on the full value of the tax offset because their annual work income may be below the $10,000 threshold. This leads me to the other side of the story. So far I have only mentioned male mature age workers, but the picture is very different for women. While employment of male mature age workers has declined dramatically, over the same period the percentage of women aged between 55 and 59 has increased from 29 per cent to 38 per cent. For women aged 60 to 64, it has increased slightly from 16 per cent to 17 per cent. There are a number of explanations for these differences. Traditional occupations for women are less physically demanding, allowing mature age workers to continue in those occupations. But it must also be considered that women are less likely than men to have superannuation coverage. So, for single women, either those who have never married or become widowed or those whose family relationships have broken down, working until pension age is often their only option. For both mature age men and women, work options will vary from full-time work in demanding work environments through to employment in less demanding fields and to part-time and casual work in a range of fields. For some mature age workers this can be a natural progression. The examples given in the explanatory memorandum show some of these. Tim, aged 60, remains the director of a consultancy company and Margaret, aged 63, works part-time as a nurse. For many professionals, these options are available to a greater or lesser extent. This bill will provide a rebate for those with a net inthan come from working of less than $63,000. The same can be seen for primary producers. As we know, a large proportion of our primary producers are over the age of 55, and this group will benefit from the mature age tax offset. But it must be asked: what will the benefit to the many thousands of mature age workers who either by choice, by retrenchment or disability find themselves outside the work force and unable to plan for their third age, the age of living? This is where this bill represents a missed opportunity. Over four years it will lead to $1½ billion in revenue being lost to the Commonwealth-money spent on a dubious incentive to encourage mature age participation in the work force. The real need is to look at initiatives which provide workplace opportunities for mature age workers that include some form of paid employment in their third age. Employers will need to offer work patterns which suit the needs of mature age workers. There is no point bemoaning skill shortages when thousands of skilled workers decline to participate in the work force because they are not offered the flexibility they so rightly deserve. We hear a lot about workplace flexibility, but this is almost always on the employer's terms. Employers will need to make a lot of adjustments if they are to attract this new generation of independent mature age workers-workers who look to employment as a useful social and economic activity; workers who have paid off the mortgage, whose kids have left home, whose poor old dog has passed away and whose working income provides fruit for the sideboard but is not needed for survival. This financially independent work force can provide a skilled and experienced labour resource, but it must be managed differently. This is an area that the government will also need to look at, and it will take a lot more a $500 incentive if it is to be successful. Labor's policy taken to the last election contained a number of initiatives that this government should take a close look at. But beyond these approaches, as a nation we should also be looking at assisting all mature age be Australians to get the most from the age of living. We have ministerial responsibilities for children and youth, we have responsibilities for ageing, but we have no ministerial responsibility for the age of living. As Charles Handy warns us: The people of the third age, rich in experience, with independence and energy, could be a huge resource to the community. They could also be a burden. Our task should be to ensure that Australia's path in the next decade leads us to the first of those outcomes and definitely not to the second. The government's ‘work till you drop' direction is definitely not the way to go.",114
137,Ms BURKE,COMMITTEES,"I also want to talk on the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005 but will be focusing my remarks on schedule 4. While I welcome the opportunity to speak on this bill-in particular, on the mature age worker tax offset-and while I do not oppose this measure, I really cannot see any benefit that it is actually going to have for mature age people looking for work. It hardly addresses the most obvious and glaring reason for the high rate of unemployment amongst older workers: it does nothing to assist older workers back into the work force. The Treasurer's wonderful ‘demography is destiny' statement some time ago, when he told us all we were going to work til we dropped, talked about the need to ensure that people remained in the work force. He kept harping on about 50-plus executives that should be encouraged to ease back into the work force. It is all wonderful if you still have a job. One difficulty with this age group is that they get enticed into early retirement. I am not sure how many of you have had the experience of knowing fantastic local public servants or teachers who come and say, ‘I'm 54 and 11 months and if I don't go now the super's not going to be as attractive later.' have had a plethora of them. My returning officer came to me not long before the election and said, ‘I'm out of here, Anna, the super's beckoning.' That was all well and good, and Bernie managed to come back during the election as a consultant-he took his super and came back, like many of them do-but he is one of the lucky ones who can actually make that transition. A constituent of mine who has been unemployed for a very long time took the lure of early redundancy from the Department of Defence. He, like a lot of people in his late 40s, still had children at school and still had a mortgage. He assumed that when he took that package, given his skills, his experience and his qualifications, he would walk into another job. He has not. He has recently purchased a milk bar, which I think is a fairly game move for a man in his middle 50s. His children have, I think, just finished school but are embarking upon university, so he has a whole new raft of expenses. It has taken him at least six years to achieve the realisation that no-one was going to employ him. I have spoken about this in this House on numerous occasions now. I have an ageing electorate, so it is an issue that comes through my door time and time again. I took the opportunity to speak when the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations presented the Age counts report to the House. The government has totally ignored a report that was tabled in this parliament several years ago. There was some great bipartisan work and it was a terrific report of this House, but none of the recommendations were picked up. Nowhere in those recommendations did it talk about a tax offset. The government has also ignored the advice of its own panel of experts. Recently, the Financial Review reported: The report, obtained by The Australian Financial Review, has not been made public but recomI mends the government adopts a range of measures that sources said would not require substantial funding to implement. Those recommendations, drafted under the supervision of Commonwealth Bank director Fergus Ryan, multicompany director David Gonski and chief executive of Mission Australia Patrick MCClure, include boosting training opportunities for mature age workers and raising awareness of the workforce implications of the ageing population. They also did not mention a tax offset in their 36 recommendations. Nowhere did they say that this was the lure or the thing that was going to get people back into work. Besides taking the opportunity to talk on Age counts, I also took the opportunity to talk about another fantastic member of my community-a mature age woman who had been running a hospital and had been ‘Jeffed', as we refer to it in Victoria. When Jeff Kennett came in the hospital was closed and her job went. She is one of the most skilled medical administrators and nurses I have met, but she was 55 and female. She has not been able to get full-time work. Jeff Kennett has been out of office for quite some time, but she has still not been able to get full time, ongoing work and recognition of her skills. Recently she was even contemplating going overseas, because there they might have accepted her as a mature age worker. I talked about this constituent when I was moved so much by this issue to actually move a motion in this House talking about the traps facing people over 45. I also mentioned the issue in my maiden speech in this parliament because, in my previous life with the Finance Sector Union, tragically I had seen time and time again men-and also a whole lot of women-made redundant with the great line: ‘Here's some money; go and have a life.' It is all well and good if you have a life and if you are actually of an age and you get enough money to continue to survive. Again, a lot of these men were in their late 40s and early 50s and they were not ready to retire and they were not financially able to. They still had mortgages. People may understand that, when you leave the banking sector, you probably leave a discount mortgage that suddenly becomes a full rate mortgage. It is a hell of an experience be paying those rates and still financing your children through school. It is a very complicated situation, but nowhere in any of these recommendations or reports from any of these experts does it say that a tax offset is the way to go. Not one person recommends it. One of the members of the Prime Minister's committee, Mission Australia, put forward three reasons for the high rate of unemployment among older workers-and they should know what they are talking about: they have helped nearly 10,000 unemployed older workers who are looking for work. Mission Australia says that the three reasons for high rates of unemployment among older workers are discrimination, lack of training and retrenchment. Again and again the people walking through my door cite those reasons. The first reason of discrimination is backed up by the ACTU, whose recent analysis of job search data concluded that age discrimination had worsened, with about 60 per cent of unemployed 55-year-olds unable to obtain work because employers considered them too old. One of the traps that happens with a lot of these people who are mature age unemployed is that, because they have a redundancy payment or super or because they have a partner in part-time work, they are not counted as unemployed. They are not a statistic-they are not out there. But they are unemployed-they do not have a job-or they are underemployed, because they can only get casual work. The constituent I spoke of earlier who has just purchased the milk bar worked for quite some time delivering pamphlets. This is a man who was a senior public servant in Defence and the only job he could get was putting pamphlets in your letterbox. So he was not unemployed. He could also not access Job Network. He could not actually go into anywhere and say, to ‘Help me find a job.' The only way to go was through private agencies, and time and time again private agencies did not want to know him and turned him away. The one question they all ask is: what is your date of birth? And what do these people not want to put down? Their date of birth. Another constituent came to see me because he had refused to provide to a job placement agency his date of birth. They said they would not be able to put him on their books unless he told them his age. He was 49, almost 50. He was a highly skilled town planner. He was very capable of taking this job, but because he would not put down his date of birth they refused to take his applicabeing tion. He then took the agency to HREOC. He did not want to do that because, by then, he had actually secured another job, but he was so incensed by the principle of the matter that he took the company to HREOC and won. They were told, ‘You can't discriminate on the basis of age and you cannot force someone to provide their date of birth.' It was a pretty brave step for that individual to take. He said: ‘I just wanted a job, Anna. tually, I just needed a job.' The tax offset would not help any of these individuals. They wanted to work. The tax regime was not locking them out of employment; the ability to break down the barriers and discrimination against aged workers was. There was nowhere for these people to go. Yet again the government has not come up with any funding for a resource for people over the age of 45 to assist them back into the work force. There is nothing in the legislation about reskilling. There is nothing about retraining. There is nothing about extending the fantastic NEIS program to assist some of these people into small business. One of the things I noticed at the Finance Sector Union when a lot of people were made redundant was that a plethora of cheesecake shops suddenly opened up. Many bank employees took their redundancy package and opened a cheesecake shop, which was fantastic-except that none of these people had ever owned or run a small business, and they probably had not had a lot to do with cheesecake. They were lured in, and a lot of them went under because none of them were given advice, assistance or skills training. Things like the NEIS program, where you can have 12 months of expert help and training, would have overcome that gap and supported those people. Again, a tax offset-while it sounds all well and good-is not going to assist those people. There is quite a large amount of money spent on this program. It could have been better spent; it could have been better utilised, and it could have made an enormous difference. Those receiving the full benefit will receive a $500 rebate on their earned income. I do not think a $500 rebate is really going to lure executives back into the work force. While this measure may have some positive impact on work force participation-and I doubt that extremely-it is a Ac- very expensive approach. In fact it now appears that, over the forward estimates, it will cost $1.44 billion. It was about the fifthlargest spending promise that the government announced during its wonderful ‘chuck money here, there and everywhere else' election campaign. So it is not a very good bang for your buck; it is a very bad bang for your buck. If you had put that money into supporting some agencies dedicated to servicing the over 45s, you would have had a much better outcome. If you had put some money into getting mature age tradespeople back into the work force-skilling up and reskilling-you would have an enormous amount of bang for your buck. I am not talking about the new apprenticeships that the government keeps going on about; I am talking about traditional trades training, where people actually come out and know how to rewire and re-plumb your house. We need those people. We do not have them. There are a whole lot of people out there who could be reskilled and retrained who would make great tradesmen and do fantastic things for our society and our economy, but they are not being given the chance. There is a terrific organisation just outside my electorate-actually, it is in the electorate of the member for Kooyong, although I am not sure he knows it exists-called 45 Plus Workforce. It was launched back in 2001 without any federal funding. This organisation has, time and again, sought federal funding. It has been to its local member, but it not received any. Indeed, the state government has continually supported this organisation, as has the local Boroondara council. I am not sure that it is Boroondara council's responsibility to be providing employment services, but they saw that this would be a great bonus and asset to their area-an area with an ageing population. The organisation 45 Plus Workforce offers free advertising and membership. It gives training. It educates employers in age discrimination. It gives people their confidence back to go and seek a job. When you have left the work force believing that you are going to get a job fairly easily and do not do so then your confidence is continually bashed, dented and hurt. This is a terrific initiative and it needs to be funded and supported. The government could have funded an initiative like that. It is already up and running. The government could have funded it so it would have been able to provide specific assistance to people on a full-time basis. As I say, many of these people will not go onto Job Network because they are not eligible if they are married to someone in the work force. However, they still need that income. I had one gentleman come and speak to me-and I think it was one of my most poignant moments-who was just about in tears. He was a 50-year-old manager leaving the ANZ Bank. He had worked there since he was 16. He had come up through the ranks. He had started as a messenger and became a teller, a manager and then a regional manager. The thing he wanted from the bank when he left-because he was six months too late-was his gold watch. He wanted to leave with his dignity and his gold watch. He said to me: ‘It's really hard, and I know it sounds petty and it's really silly when there are other people really hurting, but I cannot renew my MCG membership. It's the only has thing I've done with my sons all my life. I'm traumatised. I know that's silly'. He was just devastated, and there was nothing I could do for him. I got him his gold watch. I was determined to get him his gold watch, which I did. They would not give him a presentation though. They sent it in a box to his home. That is the indignation these people suffer. I do not think a tax offset addresses thatbecause he did not have a job and he was never going to get a job. There are no jobs in the finance sector for these people. Thousands and thousands of jobs have gone out of the finance sector, and these people are not going back in. Mission Australia says: Many unemployed older workers, however, have found to their cost that diminishing access to training and up-skilling provided by employers has seriously disadvantaged them in the labour market. It continues: According to the Senate Committee on Superannuation, older workers are poorly placed to adapt to labour market demands because many lack the range of skills employers now require. That is what these managers from the banks were finding: they did not have new skills. They had been in one environment all their working lives. They had a terrific set of skills, but they no longer applied to the new work environment. What we need to give these people is training and dignity. We need to give them access to services to meet their specific needs and information to get them back into the work force. While we are supporting the tax offset, it is not the way to go. The government's own recommendations say that it is not the way to go. They could have used the money far more wisely. Whilst I support this bill, I think there was a lot more we could have done for older unemployed Australians.",117
138,Mr GEORGANAS,COMMITTEES,"I rise today to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005. I too will speak about schedule 4, which relates to the mature age worker tax offset, just as the members for Chisholm and Fowler did before me. We need to increase Australia's work force participation rate and tackle the problem of mature age unemployment. There is considerable debate about increasing participation among major cohorts, such as disability support pension recipients. However, the low participation rate of mature Australians-that is, Australians aged 55 and over-is a key area of concern. Increasing the participation rate of this cohort is economically responsible, given the changing demographics in the Australian community-that is, the ageing population. Longer life expectancy, mature age unemployment and early retirement have a negative impact on productivity. In some cases, these also compound Australia's growing skills shortage. For many mature age Australians, early retirement is imposed as a result of involuntary retrenchment. We have all heard stories of people who, when they hit their late 40s and early 50s, have been retrenched. Many face substantial difficulties re-entering the work force, despite their best efforts to do In response to this problem, the government established the Prime Minister's Community Business Partnership committee on mature age workers, which included Mission Australia CEO, Patrick MCClure, CBA Director, Fergus Ryan, and multicompany director, David Gonski. The committee's draft report, which was leaked to the Australian Financial Review in October 2004, offered 36 recommendations or matters for consideration. Not one of these recommendations suggested a billion dollar tax offset for mature age workers. At the time of the tax offset announcement, the Prime Minister indicated that there would be further announcements addressing the partnership committee's approach. To date, no such announcements have been forthcoming. In 2004-05, the offset will phase out at five per cent from $48,000 so that no offset is available when net income from work exceeds $58,000. In 2005-06 and beyond, the offset will phase out at five per cent from $53,000 so that no offset is available when net income from work exceeds $63,000. Those receiving the full benefit will receive a $500 rebate on their earned income. While this measure may-I stress, may-have some positive effect on work force participation, it is an expensive approach. In fact, it now appears that over the forward estimates it will cost $1.44 billion rather than the $1.04 billion indicated during the election campaign. In addition, it carries disincentive effects associated with an increase in effective marginal tax rates for the income ranges at which the tax offset phases out. The government has effectively ignored its own committee's recommendations and has come up with an expensive and incomplete response to mature age unemployment. As Labor emphasised when the policy was announced on 9 September 2004, this measure simply offers a tax cut to those who are so. already employed and does little for those who are not employed. A number of other measures were recommended by the Prime Minister's Community Business Partnership committee, including measures to convince employers they should hire older workers, thereby overcoming what is frequently cited as a major barrier to increasing mature age worker participation. Labor's comprehensive $212.4 million election policy ‘Greater security, more opportunities for mature age Australians' proposed a number of measures carefully designed to tackle the underlying reasons behind low work force participation among mature age workers. These included: establishing mature age career centres to assist mature age Australians get back to work; providing rapid assistance for workers who are displaced or about to be displaced due to large scale or regional retrenchment; establishing a training partnerships fund to encourage employers to retrain and reskill mature age employees; earmarking 2,500 new TAFE places each year for Australians over 45 years old; developing new procedures for formally recognising the skills and experience of mature age Australians when they attain new qualifications; funding an additional 500 new places in the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, NEIS, to be earmarked for mature age job seekers who do not receive income support; providing a $2,000 learning bonus to mature age job seekers who take up an apprenticeship or traineeship in an area of skill shortage; deploying 125 mature age workplace trainers in key industries to develop and implement workplace training plans; implementing community programs to improve adult literacy levels; supporting mature age workers to undertake nationally accredited training in information technology; and establishing Job Network providers that specialise in assisting mature age job seekers. Unlike the government, Labor with its policy addressed the range of factors and problems that contribute to mature age unemployment and low mature age work force participation. We are not opposing the tax offset as there are some benefits in it for mature age Australians. However, we believe there are more cost-effective ways of increasing mature age participation in the work force, such as those I have just mentioned. A more comprehensive approach is required to tackle mature age unemployment.",122
139,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES,"I thank all of the members who have participated in the debate today on this significant bill. The opposition have had a bit to say on a few of these measures and have been somewhat disparaging of them, and I would like to address that as I go through and wrap up on the four key measures of this bill. The Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005 makes amendments to various tax laws to implement a range of changes to improve Australia's taxation system, including giving effect to budget and election commitments. The government obviously takes its election commitments very seriously and hence we are introducing and putting into law the commitments we made at the last election as quickly as we possibly can to give timely effect to them. The opposition, and in particular the member for Hunter, have on many occasions over the last few sitting days and at the end of last year raised the issue of my own efforts and those of the government in bringing legislation to this place, suggesting we are not giving the opposition sufficient time to deal with issues and that, given more time, they could improve bills. I have been reluctant up until now to go to the heart of this issue, but I think it is time we put it to bed. The member for Hunter-the shadow minister-is often referring to the GST and long-term non-renewable contracts, and how these were sprung upon the opposition at the last possible moment. So I thought it would be worthwhile giving a chronology of eventsMr Fitzgibbon-A rewriting of history.",123
140,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES,I thought it would be worthwhile giving an accurate chronology of factual events and when they occurred. I think the member for Hunter was the shadow minister for small business at one stage. Mr Fitzgibbon-A long time ago.,123
141,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES,"Yes, it was a long time ago. This goes back to the introduction of the GST transitional bills on 2 December 1998 and, in particular, to the release of the government's draft legislation onto its web site on 29 October 2004. The government announced a public consultation round, then we had the draft legislation on 29 October and then we introduced the bill into the House on 8 December, five or six weeks after the release of the draft. On 9 December, we obviously looked at the bill in the House of Representatives. It was then introduced into the Senate and blocked until the next sitting. The Labor Party came back here last week and made a big play of it, saying, ‘We picked up an anomaly and we needed to insert this amendment.' The reason the amendment needed to be inserted into that particular piece of legislation was simply because of the time that had elapsed over Christmas. The simple wish of the Property Council and others who were negotiating on behalf of their members was that the Labor Party would have formed an opinion between 29 October and 9 December, when it was finally debated and put aside in the Senate. So that is why we allowed the amendment-and that goes for many of the amendments that the member opposite refers to. One of the particular measures we have before us today goes to the issue of depreciation for trucks, buses and light commercial vehicles. This was a decision the government made before the last election; it was articulated before the last election, and it was welcomed by the industry. So it has been there the entire time, yet the opposition have the hide to come in here and tell us we have sprung it on them at the last moment. Regarding the mature age tax offset, that was an election commitment. So here we are, only a short time into the life of this government, and we are putting up the legislation in the form we took to the people, which, of course, was roundly accepted and welcomed by the general population. I now turn to the specific measures in this bill. Amendments will be made to the fringe benefits tax law to improve access to certain FBT exemptions for small business. The government has listened to representations about the ‘customary requirement' making it difficult for small business to take advantage of the FBT exemptions for remote area housing. In response, the government is introducing measures to extend the FBT exemption for employer-provided remote area housing by removing the requirement that such housing benefits be customary in a particular industry. The member for Hunter suggested this measure would be open to abuse. I can assure him the measure will not be open to abuse. The amendment will not give rise to abuse by non-customary industries as it removes the customary requirement from just the one element of the law. Employers will still be required to satisfy the other existing criteria to be eligible for the exemption. These criteria include that it could be concluded that it is necessary to provide the accommodation because of the nature of the employer's business or because of the absence of sufficient other suitable accommodation. The FBT exemption is also not available if the benefit is provided under a nonarms-length arrangement or provided for the purpose of obtaining an exemption. Thus the amendment improves small business access to the FBT exemption without opening up the opportunity for abuse-which, of course, is very important. The government is also ensuring that the FBT laws do not inhibit the uptake of new products and services by small business. As such, the amendments will also broaden the FBT exemption for work-related items to include personal digital assistants and portable printers designed for use with portable computers. In addition, the existing FBT exemptions for relocation costs will be extended to include the engagement of a relocation consultant to assist in the relocation of employees. The second part of the bill confirms the government's commitment to provide certainty for the transport industry by introducing effective life caps for the depreciation of buses, light commercial vehicles, trucks and truck trailers. These caps will coincide with the Commissioner of Taxation's safe harbour effective life determination. Listening to the debate earlier, I was absolutely stunned to hear the member for Hunter referred to this measure as ‘industry welfare'. The member for Oxley, who is sitting opposite, has the Ipswich Motorway running through his electorate and probably has more trucks through his electorate than any of us do. I would love to see him on the side of a road with a big sign that says, ‘Seven and a half years depreciation is welfare for you bludgers!' It is ridiculous in the extreme. It flies in the face of comments made by the member for Batman, who in the lead-up to the election assured the industry that the Labor Party would support this measure and would match the government. But he did leave the gate open-which I am sure would surprise you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins-saying, ‘That is the position now, but we may look at it in the future.' Is this what the Labor Party mean when they say they will look at it in the futurethat they are going to support the measure and are not going to prevent it from going through, but they consider safer trucks and a younger fleet to be ‘industry welfare'? That is a pretty extraordinary comment from a former shadow spokesman for small business, a person who lives in the Hunter Valley, which has trucks rumbling up and down the New England Highway-trucks which, if they were older, would be putting at risk the safety of his own constituency and would be putting in jeopardy a lot of private contractors-an absolutely extraordinary comment. Mr Ripoll interjecting",124
142,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES,"The member for Oxley says, ‘They're supporting us.' I say to the member for Oxley: if you are supporting the government and supporting the transport industry, for goodness sake do not come in here and lambast them with inflammatory comments such as ‘industry welfare'. It does you no good, and it certainly does the industry no good, when they are trying to make investments, knowing that one day-God forbid!-the Labor Party may have the treasury bench and they may well remove these measures which are giving certainty to what is an incredibly important industry for the growth of this nation. The third measure in this bill will amend the GST law to correct an anomaly. The amendment will ensure that the GST applies to offshore supply of options or rights to require something the supply of which would be connected with Australia. The amendment reflects the policy intent of the GST law to tax private consumption of most goods, services and other things in Australia. This measure will also help ensure that there is a competitive neutrality between similar supplies made by offshore and Australian based businesses, and will ensure these latter businesses are not disadvantaged. The member for Hunter raised concerns that the bill imposed the GST on the profit margins of non-resident tour operators. The GST is not intended to be a tax ultimately borne by businesses on business profits; rather, it is effectively applied to tax final private consumption of goods and services in Australia. Accordingly, businesses are generally entitled to claim refunds of GST input tax credits on goods and services acquired. In the case of a supply by non-resident tour operators of Australian holiday packages, GST broadly applies to the total price of the supply including any profit made on the supplies by non-residents. Offsetting GST input tax credits are available to ensure the GST effectively applies tax only to the final private consumption. The GST law applies in the same way to domestic transactions involving consumption of goods and services in Australia. This measure is very important. It is an tegrity measure and it ensures that our home based businesses-and by that I mean our domestically based businesses-are not disadvantaged against those which may be selling products not only to overseas visitors but also to Australian residents. And that is the concern that we have. The shadow minister also raised concerns that the amendment will apply to foreign transactions when none of the parties have any connection to Australia, potentially imposing double taxation. It should be recognised that many countries apply consumption taxes to transactions undertaken overseas by non-residents but involving consumption in that country. For example, European Economic Community countries apply their consumption taxes to a range of transactions undertaken by non-residents that relate to consumption in the EEC. Accordingly, Australia does not apply GST to supply by Australian tour operators of overseas holiday packages. The government is not aware of any situations in which the GST amendment will result in the imposition of double taxation. I am advised that, in general, foreign tour operators currently register for GST in Australia and claim GST input tax credits for Australian holiday packages that they acquire. As I have said, this amendment will restore competitive neutrality between resident and non-resident tour operators supplying Australian holiday packages. I am advised that the member for Batman raised the matter that the bill compounds existing valuation issues facing foreign tour operators and therefore increases their compliance cost. The bill will reduce compliance costs faced by foreign tour operators. In part, compliance cost difficulties arise from the fact that the non-accommodation component inof Australian holiday packages is not subject to GST. The amendment will address this by broadly imposing the GST on the whole of the holiday package other than the GST concession portion applying to international airfares and their domestic legs. So it will prevent them from having to work out what is in and what is out. Further, the member went on to suggest that it will adversely impact on foreign tour operators because it applies from the date of introduction of this bill. Integrity measures, by their very nature, must apply from the date of announcement-otherwise you would leave time for people to make other arrangements which may have a detrimental impact on revenue. The government is therefore concerned that significant revenue loss would continue to occur if the date of the effect of this measure were delayed. Therefore we consider the current application date to be appropriate. Finally, the government is delivering on its election commitment to introduce a mature age worker tax offset to reward and encourage mature age workers who choose to stay in the work force. The offset will be available to workers aged 55 and over and will provide a maximum annual tax rebate of $500, with effect from the 2004-05 income year. This measure recognises that improving the labour force participation of mature age workers will improve productivity thereby assisting in securing Australia's future economic strength. It also demonstrates the government's commitment to, and appreciation of, older workers. I think it is widely understood in this chamber that one of the key goals of the government is to increase the participation rate, particularly of males over 55. Whilst we have a 30-year low in the unemployment rate and high rates of participation, that is all good news-but this is still an area of great concern. In fact, too many of our men aged 55 and over are on the disability support pension. We all have a responsibility to try and address this situation and to assist them to get back into the work force. The government is committed to that. This is something that we cannot do on our own. This is an important measure in general but we need to ensure that business understands the significant role that mature age workers can, and do, play in their work forces. If we can do that, people will remove this unreasonable stigma that just because you are a little older, going grey and losing a few hairs, somehow you do not have the energy and enthusiasm to work. I am sure the member for Oxley would agree with me about that. The member for Hunter and others challenged the government's response to the Intergenerational report. I remind them that it was this government that took on the responsibility of looking way beyond the next three years and well out into the future to try to this country up with a range of policy measures aimed at protecting the tax base into the future, and getting greater involvement in the work force today, so that we can look at the problems that arise for this nation from the intergenerational issue and the demographics of this country. I applaud the Treasurer in the way in which he has taken that forward. The member for Hunter apparently also raised the question of the changes in the estimates for this issue. The cost revisions have resulted from the development of the definition of ‘net income from working'. I inform the member for Hunter that the government's decision is to allow taxpayers who are earning income from working in a partnership to be eligible for the offset and to allow wage and salary earners to deduct relevant deductions in order to calculate net income from working. This treatment is consistent with that of personal services income and business income, and there is nothing particularly unusual there. There were some other issues raised. The last one of any significance was: does the lack of any dynamic modelling on this issue mean there are no gains to the number of people in this age group who are working? This is a significant impost on the budget that we are making here. We are doing it for very good reason, which is that we believe it will contribute to better outcomes. Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting",125
143,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES,"As the member for Hunter says. What we are after here are outcomes. This will encourage people to remain in the work force. That does not mean they have to remain permanently connected to the work force, but the days when people stopped work and retired, I think, are getting further and further behind us. People actually want to remain connected to the work force and to use their experience and their producset tivity in a way that allows them to meet also the social aspects of their lives and the quality of life that they want. If this measure goes some way to ensuring that occurs, it will have met our policy objectives. The point is that, not unlike the 25 per cent entrepreneurial tax offset for small business and not unlike the $500 mature age worker offset, these are positive measures introduced in the last election campaign by the government. In stark contrast, the opposition had no policy initiatives worth their salt. Mr Ripoll interjecting",127
144,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES,"The member for Oxley derides again these payments. It is a case in which it does not matter whether it is the family payments, which the member for Lilley claims are not real money, it does not matter whether it is the superannuation cocontribution, which I presume is not real money either, and I suppose this $500 is not real money. I would love to know what real money is, because I know that nearly 5,000 families in my electorate actually received the co-contribution; that is, people earning under $40,000. We have people receiving benefits to assist their families, because Howard government believes in people having choice and in people having independence and being given incentives to do the best they can for themselves. Mr Billson-Encouragement, not compulsion.",128
145,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES,"Yes, ‘encouragement', as the parliamentary secretary states. This an important bill. It is another significant piece of reform that the government has put to the parliament and, most importantly, it goes to our commitments that we made at the last election, and before the last election the transport industry. I would ask the member for Hunter to reflect upon his inflammatory comments to the trucking industry when he called this depreciation schedule ‘industry welfare'. It is nothing of the sort. I commend the bill to the House.",128
146,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Hunter has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Question agreed to. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading,128
147,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES,by leave-I move: That the bill be now read a third time.,128
148,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,"I rise to speak to the third reading motion. I understand that the standing orders provide for only a very narrow debate on the third reading and, of course, as always, I intend to keep faith with the standing orders the and House of Representatives Practice. Obviously I have been viciously provoked by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer during his summation. As quickly as possible, I would like to respond to a couple of points he made. If the main objective of a shadow minister is to get a rise out of his or her minister, I think I have done very well today. It is nice to see the minister come is back into the House and at least attempt to respond to the concerns raised by the opposition. During his summation, the minister again to chose to attempt to rewrite history, particularly with respect to the issue of nonreviewable long-term contracts and the application of the GST to those contracts. I made the point during the second reading debate that the government introduced a bill last year with respect to this matter, with the expectation that the opposition would give passage to that bill through both houses of this parliament in just one day. Of course, we were not prepared to do that, and rightly so. We will not be ridden roughshod over on these complex taxation issues. Over the Christmas holiday break, the opposition were able to identify some flaws in the legislation and, as I said earlier, we moved amendments which were eventually and rightfully accepted by the government. The minister now claims that the amendments were only necessary because the opposition somehow delayed the bill. Not true-the reality is that, without a time limit on the arbitration period for the negotiation between the parties in non-reviewable contracts, the party which stood to gain an advantage from the outcome of non-negotiation could have dragged out those negotiations for one, two or three years. So the problem was not the emerging cut-off date of 1 July 2005 for the transitional period; it was the very ability of one party to drag out the arbitration period, to the disadvantage of the other parties. So the minister attempted to rewrite history. He is absolutely wrong. Either he is not very well informed or he is just prepared again to tell porkies to this House. The minister also said that, because the draft legislation had been around since 1998 or something, we have had more than ample opportunity to closely examine the provisions of that draft legislation. If we sought study very carefully every aspect of every piece of draft legislation that is put out into the community by the government, we would be doing nothing else. It would be a complete waste of time in many circumstances because, of course, the draft legislation (1) never gets to this place for whatever reason or (2) is more than likely to have had amendments made to it before its arrival in this place. So it is untrue to say that the opposition had ample opportunity to study the bill that eventually came to the parliament with no notice whatsoever because the draft legislation had been around for all of that time. On the same point, the minister said we have had ample opportunity to study these things because they were election promises. So, if it is an election promise, when the bill comes in three or four months later, we are expected to be well informed of the details of the bill. That is a ridiculous proposition, particularly given the minister himself just conceded that the costings for the mature aged worker tax offset provided for in the election period were absolutely wrong and totally inconsistent with the costings provided to the House when the bill was introduced only a week ago. He also conceded that there had been changes to the scope of that offset. So it is ridiculous to say that, if something is an election promise, we have ample opportunity to discuss it before it is debated in this place. My last point is about the minister's attack on me with respect to my use of the phrase ‘industry welfare'Mr Brough-Correct the record, mate.",128
149,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,"I will correct the record, since you misled the House. Let me share with the House what I did say during that debate. I made the point that with respect to the Ralph Review of Business Taxation there had been a longwinded debate about the trade-off between the corporate tax to rate and the system of capital allowances. In the end, industry agreed to give up some fairly concessional depreciation regime schemes for a lower company tax rate. That was the deal of the Ralph review. The opposition signed up to and was supportive of that regime, and the government was committed to it. So, as a result, we had a new capital allowance regime based on effective life rate, and we were all happy with that. A year or two ago-I think it was only last year-the government came in here and decided they were not going to use effective life rate anymore for gas pipelines because there was massive underinvestment in the gas network. On that basis, they argued we had to depart from the system of effective life. The opposition supported that; we did not have a particular problem with that, because we acknowledged there was a crisis in investment in that sector. Again, today, the government have come into this place and argued that there needs to be another departure from the effective life test, because there are environmental and safety concerns in the heavy transport industry. What have the opposition done, again, on this occasion? We have accepted that argument and are supporting yet another departure from those Ralph reform commitments and from the effective life regime which, of course, is the most effective regime.",129
150,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! I remind the honourable member for Hunter that the chair has been very charitable.,130
151,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,I am almost winding up. What I said during the debateMr Stephen Smith-He has hardly been in order for a second of that speech.,130
152,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,I thank the honourable member for Perth for his observation.,130
153,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,"Thanks, mate! Who needs enemies when you have friends like the member for Perth! What the opposition has responsibly said is that we will accept these departures from the effective life regime when the government makes out a case, but what we will not do is accept a pattern of serial departure in circumstances that just represent industry welfare. And that was a perfectly responsible and sensible thing for me to have said. The minister has become very provocative. I am not surprised. He has become a serial offender in bringing complex bills into this place without any notice and expecting the opposition to respond. We will continue to respond responsibly and sensibly and to attempt, at least, to improve these bills because they are full of flaws, as I demonstrated during the second reading debate today.",130
154,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Before calling on the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, I say to the honourable member for Hunter that his homework for tonight is page 369 of House of Representatives Practice and standing order 69(e) and that he should be less provoked by the minister.",130
155,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES," Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I hope you are going to hold the member for Hunter to bringing his homework to you some time tomorrow. I have one very brief point for the member for Hunter, if he is listening, about the GST and long-term non-reviewable contracts. The draft legislation was out on 29 October 2004 and remained unamended untilMr Fitzgibbon-We didn't know that at the time; you want us to read every draft?",130
156,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES,"My point is that it was left unamended and it entered into parliament in the form that it was put out on 29 October. So the Labor Party had that piece of legislation before it to consider on 8 December but, in fact, did not listen to the calls from industry to expedite it through both houses of parliament. That was unfortunate for industry, and I think it says a lot about the Leader of the Opposition and where he is taking the ‘new' Labor Party with its supposedly economically rational approach to life. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT (NATIONAL RELAY SERVICE) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 February, on motion by Mr MCGauran: That the bill be now read a second time.",130
157,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The opposition supports the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment (National Relay Service) Bill 2005. As the title suggests, this bill concerns changes to the administration of the National Relay Service. The National Relay Service is a statutory scheme effected under part 3 of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. The National Relay Service provides deaf and hearing and/or speech impaired Australians with access to a standard telephone service. The National Relay Service is an important part of the community service and consumer protection safeguards in the Australian telecommunications regulatory environment. The National Relay Service allows text and voice communications by employing relay officers to translate calls from one medium to the other on a confidential and cost-free basis. National Relay services are provided 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Under the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999, telecommunications carriers fund the operation of the National Relay Service through a quarterly levy on eligible telecommunications carriers. This levy is imposed in proportion to the carrier's share of total telecommunications carrier revenue in much the same way as the universal service obligation. The current provider is Australian Communication Exchange Ltd, a not-forprofit organisation that has been the provider since 1998. The National Relay Service is therefore an important tool for ensuring that deaf and hearing and/or speech impaired Australians have access to the same telecommunications services as other Australians. Labor strongly supports the continuing operation of the service. The bill before the House makes a minor amendment designed to improve the effectiveness of the National Relay Service. Under the current legislative regime, the National Relay Service must be supplied by a single provider under a single contract with the Commonwealth. This bill amends the definitions of ‘National Relay Service contract' and ‘National Relay Service provider' contained in the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 and makes consequential amendments to the act to allow multiple providers to supply the service. The effect of the amendments is to allow separate components of the National Relay Service to be provided by separate providers under separate contracts. The contractual arrangements with the current National Relay Service provider-ACE, Australian Communication Exchange Ltdwill not be affected by this bill. There are a number of benefits that flow from this change. Allowing the Commonwealth to contract out separate components of the National Relay Service to separate providers gives the Commonwealth the flexibility to obtain each component from the provider best placed to provide them. It is by no means necessarily the case that the most effective and efficient provider of the technical core relay service aspect of the National Relay Service would also be the most effective and efficient provider of the community outreach education and support services aspect of the National Relay Service. Enabling the Commonwealth to obtain these services from separate providers-in circumstances in which, through a tender process, it determines that the National Relay Service is best provided by multiple providers-is common sense. Labor hopes that the change might go some way to addressing some of the delivery issues that have been raised in relation to the outreach program in the recent past. A further benefit of the change may be to allow the Commonwealth to obtain national relay services more efficiently. In recent years there have been rapid changes in the information communications and technology market. Many niche operators, only specialising in segments of the information communications and technology market, have emerged. This amendment would allow the Commonwealth to utilise the services of these niche players to obtain components of the National Relay Service. For example, one provider may supply in-network solutions while another may supply software sitting on top of that network. The competitive effect of these niche operators may also reduce the prices charged by comprehensive service providers and might reduce any increases in the levy applied to telecommunications service providers. While it may be possible for such multisupplier solutions to be provided under the current regime so long as one party signs up as the sole provider with the Commonwealth and effectively subcontracts to other providers, it is far more accountable to allow the Commonwealth the option of managing each of these suppliers under separate contractual arrangements. The Commonwealth will be in a better position to ensure compliance with contractual service standards if it has a relationship with all the suppliers. A further benefit of the proposed amendments is that allowing multiple National Relay Service providers also removes a current defect in the National Relay Service scheme that prohibits a staged transition from one service provider to another in circumstances where a new provider has been selected over the incumbent in the tender process. In recent years, many more call centre operators have entered the market than were in business-or, indeed, envisaged-at the time that the National Relay Service was established. This amendment will make it easier for the Commonwealth to employ the services of these new operators without having to risk service levels falling as a result of a changeover. Labor also notes that, in addition to these benefits, nothing in the amendments before the House suggests that service levels under the National Relay Service would fall as a result of the bill. Under the act and National Relay Service contracts, National Relay Service providers must develop a National Relay Service plan which includes service standards. These standards address the number of calls to the National Relay Service that do not get through, the call answer time of the service, the number of complaints about the service, the number of calls to emergency number 106 that did not get through, and call answer time of the 106 text emergency service. Even where there are multiple suppliers of the NRS as permitted under this bill, these National Relay Service suppliers will still be able to be financially penalised for failing to meet non-emergency service standards. It is expected that the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts will ensure that continuity of service obligations are included in National Relay Service contracts in circumstances where multiple direct providers are engaged to provide the National Relay Service. However, as alluded to earlier, Labor expects that allowing more specialised suppliers to provide components of the service would improve the quality of the National Relay Service in the first instance. This bill does not involve a substantial change to the administration of the National Relay Service. Instead, it provides for a fairly common sense amendment that would be hoped to improve the efficiency and quality of services provided through the National Relay Service. Labor supports the National Relay Service and, accordingly, supports this legislation as a measure designed to improve its operation and effectiveness. I commend the bill to the House.",131
158,Mr NEVILLE,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I am pleased to speak on the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment (National Relay Service) Bill 2005 which will amend existing legislation so as to potentially allow more than one service provider to operate the National Relay Service, known to us all as the NRS. Many members would recognise the NRS as an outstanding telephone access service which is tailor-made for people with a hearing or speech impairment. It is operated on an Australia-wide basis and incorporates teletypewriter, or TTY, technologyindividual relay officers who translate typed text to speech, speech into typed text, and voice carry-over system to a wide range of Australians. All in all, it is a remarkably fective way for hearing and speech impaired people to use modern telephony to stay in touch with friends, family, business contacts and other public entities. Since the NRS was implemented in 1995, the Australian Communication Exchange have successfully tendered to be the sole provider of these services and will have relayed their four-millionth call this month. Nobody doubts the efficacy of the Australian Communication Exchange but, in the interests of promoting further efficiency and flexibility, the government intends to allow more than one operator, potentially so anyhow, to provide the National Relay Service into the future. As it stands, the sole service contractor is responsible for providing all aspects of the National Relay Service. These include (1) text based communication, which allows two hearing or speech impaired people to use a teletypewriter or modem for direct text based message communication; (2) the hearing carry-over (HCO) service, which allows callers with a speech impairment to listen directly to the other party and respond by typing on a teletypewriter, with the relay officer reading the conversation out aloud to the other person; (3) the voice carry-over (VCO) service, which allows callers to speak directly to the other party as the relay officer listens to the conversation and types the responses which appear on the teletypewriter; (4) the speech to speech relay (SSR) service, where a person with a speech impairment can use their natural voice or a voice output device to speak directly to the other person and relay officers will respeak parts of the conversation as necessary. They are four very important aspects. The National Relay Service clients can also access an emergency the call system and reverse charge services. The actual telephony equipment for the National efRelay Service activities is provided by telecommunications carriers. Any carrier that provides customer premises equipment, such as handsets et cetera, is obliged to provide disability telecommunications equipment such as modems, volume control phones and voice aid equipment for people with disabilities. In the main this refers to Telstra and Optus, with Telstra supplying the equipment under the terms of its universal service obligation. The Australian Communication Exchange has done an outstanding job in providing these services to clients throughout Australia for the past 10 years and will surely be a leading contender to win the contract once it is open to tender. This amending legislation will allow for more than one service provider to supply different components of the NRS in the future and aims to improve continuity and reliability in the event of the NRS being transferred from one provider to another some time in the future. These amendments also aim to provide greater flexibility and efficiency for both service providers and customers, with the department calling for competitive tenders for the provision of the NRS from 1 July 2006. The financing of the NRS will continue as it has been done, by way of a levy on all telecommunications carriers. This amendment has been put forward because the current arrangements do not allow the government to implement any reforms to achieve greater efficiency or effectiveness in supplying the NRS services. Under existing legislation, services can only be supplied by one provider, hence any move to improve efficiency by way of splitting the NRS is not possible. This amendment will rectify that situation by allowing for more than one operator to provide elements of the National Relay Service whilst still providing worldclass telecommunications services for hearing and speech impaired clients. Having said that, I note this amendment does not compel the government to split the provision of NRS services. It is still possible for a single entity to supply all services if bids and wins the tenders on each component. So, in effect, this amendment does not disadvantage the existing service provider and does not affect its ability to tender for the new contract across a range of internal services. On that note, if the NRS is split between two or more providers, as is provided for in the legislation, I would urge each entity to liaise closely and make a real commitment to effective teamwork. Nothing would be worse than leaving hearing and speech impaired people in an interregnum where they could not communicate properly with their fellow Australians. To date the NRS has only ever operated under one service provider, and I am anxious to see that a separation of the actual service provision and the outreach/support components of the NRS does not lead to a possible weakening of the NRS overall. It is important that we get this right because Australia's ageing population means there will be a growing demand placed on the NRS in the future. On average, 2,200 calls are made using the NRS system every weekday, and over the last financial year more than 627,000 calls were logged. Those calls resulted in more than four million minutes of relay service and, with projections that 25 per cent of our population will be aged 65 and over by 2051, the demand for such services will increase dramatically. I appeal to future NRS providers to consider taking up new communications technologies such as internet relay, which allows users to access the NRS via the internet, and video relay, which allows signing deaf and hearing impaired people to communicate in their first language without the need to have to type all of their input into an intermediary. I would just like to add two notes of caution. One is based on the recent comments of the member for Perth. As there is bipartisan support for this, I understand where he is it coming from. It is very important that, as we potentially transfer these services to other operators, we do not allow the services to be weakened in any way. I do not want my next comment to be interpreted as being driven in any way by any form of xenophobia or criticism of the accents of potential call operators, but I would like to make this very serious point: this is a very sensitive service. It deals with people who are challenged in communicating in even a basic way with their fellow Australians. It is a vital part of social interactivity. To my way of thinking, it is central that the operators who run this service understand and are understood. The nuances of accent will be very important. Most people who use the service will be Australians or migrants who by now would be familiar with the Australian accent and, therefore, to have operators with other accents could be a very difficult and more challenging atmosphere in which people with hearing and speech impairment operate. I have a son who works in a call centrenothing to do with this service, I might add. He tells me that the nuances of speech and accent that go with nationalities are a very important part of marketing. When we are talking about marketing, that is for commercial gain. We understand that, if someone wants to take the risk of using other accents on their service, that is the commercial chance they take. But when we are talking about a vital, integrated service for people who are already challenged in their speech and their hearing, we must not in any way be cavalier. I would appeal that the tender documents issued by the government reflect this requirement. I think it is absolutely portant that that be the case. One of the most important things we can do as a government is provide an expanded, efficient, cost-effective and reliable telecommunications service for people with special hearing and speech needs. This legislation gives us the potential to do just that. I course. commend the bill to the House.",133
159,Mr HUNT,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (5.44 p.m.)-In rising to address the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment (National Relay Service) Bill 2005, I want to extend my thanks to the member for Perth and, in particular, to the member for Hinkler for their support and contribution to this debate. This bill is about three fundamental principles. It is about service, it is about competition and it is about transparency in the provision of assistance to those people who suffer from hearing and speech impediments within our society and who rely upon the National Relay Service program as a means of communicating and maintaining contact with both their loved ones and the outside world. The points made by the member for Hinkler were threefold. I hope I do his speech appropriate justice. Firstly, it was about the role of existing technologies and the need to open up new technologies. He identified the fact that under the current National Relay Service there is text based communications-the TTY system-a speech impairment relay system, a voice carry over system and a speech-to-speech system. But, significantly, he pointed to the fact that under the National Relay Service we need to provide opportunities for new technologies to assist those people who do suffer from hearing or speech defects. I would just make the point imin response that this bill attempts to do that by protecting the services for those who have existing technology whilst opening up the possibility through the competitive tender process for other types of communication in the course of future activities. That is still to be determined through the process, of The second point which the member for Hinkler made was that this bill leaves open the option to contract with one or more providers. It makes no predetermination as to how many providers there are, but what it does do, in line with the principles which the government endorses, is open the tendering process up to competition. Thirdly, the member for Hinkler made the very important point-which is appreciated by the government-that it is critical to maintain the quality and accessibility of the service for ordinary Australians who suffer from speech or hearing defects and their capacity to interact with their providers. It is a simple, important point about the realities of life for everybody. I also thank the member for Perth for pointing out that one of the necessities behind this bill is the fact that technology and competition within industry have evolved, so we have a much greater increase in the role of call centres than was envisaged at the time that the original bill was brought into being. In summary, the National Relay Service is a telephone relay service which provides people who are deaf or who have a hearing or speech impairment with access to a standard telephone service and to a text based emergency service. This service operates 24 hours a day every day of the year. It is funded through a levy on eligible telecommunications carriers. This bill introduces amendments allowing the Commonwealth greater flexibility in the model for delivering a more efficient and effective National Relay Service by providing for the option of contracting with more than one provider, exactly as the member for Hinkler outlined as a possibility, to supply different parts of the tional Relay Service. This option is also important to enable a staged transition between service providers in the event of a new provider winning a tender for provision of the NRS. A staged approach would mitigate risks to the reliability and contingency of services for users of the NRS during the transition from the outgoing to the incoming provider if such an event were to occur. Finally, the objective is to provide a more efficient and effective National Relay Service so that the deaf, the hearing and the speech impaired communities continue to receive a high-quality and reliable service. I commend the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment (National Relay Service) Bill 2005 to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

NA ARRANGEMENTS (MANAGED FUNDS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 November 2005, on motion by Mr Brough: That the bill be now read a second time.",136
161,Mr SWAN,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"The Na- New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Funds and Other Measures) Bill 2004 flows from the initiatives announced in the 2002-03 budget when the government announced a range of reforms to Australia's international tax regime. These reforms had three broad aims: to encourage foreign investment in Australia; to encourage companies to set up regional headquarters in Australia; and to remove impediments to the competitiveness of the Australian multinationals operating overseas. This bill represents the final tranche in legislation implementing these reforms. The bill comprises three schedules. Schedule 1 makes changes to the tax treatment of foreign residents who make a capital gain or loss in respect of an interest in an Australian fixed trust. The measures amend the law to provide comparable tax outcomes for foreign residents in Australian managed funds. Schedule 2 includes amendments to the International Tax Arrangements Act 1953. The amendments will align the tax treatment of foreign residents investing through managed funds that derive some or all of their income from sources outside Australia with a tax treatment that would apply those foreign residents made such investments directly. Schedule 3 implements three distinct amendments that relate to the imposition of interest withholding tax. They seek to ensure that the IWT provisions operate as intended and are consistent with recent developments in tax law. The Labor Party support this bill on the basis that Labor support good tax design and good policy. Labor have a great history of commitment and passion for ideas and reform. As I have said before, the No. 1 goal of Labor and the No. 1 expectation of the Australian people is that policy must be based on what is right for the nation as a whole. When we are developing and assessing alternative policies we will examine all the options, not with an eye to those whose support they might attract but with an eye to their overall impact on our economy and society. Unfortunately, the government have been focused on short-term political fixes-as the minister at the table, the Minister for Human Services, knows; look at his portfolio-rather than on the economic reforms necessary to make Australia more internationally competitive and to sustain economic prosperity into the future. In the early years the Howard government styled itself as a model of fiscal restraint-a reputation blown away by its $66 billion spend since the last budget. It has been lutely blown away. Mr Hockey interjecting",136
162,Mr SWAN,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"Of course the minister opposite is now left with all the headaches. Have a good time, Minister. We will be watching you very closely. That is an average of $13 billion every month from budget to election day. To put this into perspective, let us sider that the Howard government have committed an average of $4 billion in new spending in non-election years. This year the if government have committed 16 times that amount. The government have form when it comes to pre-election spending sprees, as we saw in 2001; it is just that this time the election spending spree was taken to a completely new level. We had ‘crazy John's fire sale' during the election. It is not just the magnitude of such spending; it is also the fact that the money was not invested as productively as it should have been. Access Economics summed up this missed opportunity very well: ... if the official view is that Canberra should be spending on raising productivity and lifting participation, then the $66 billion spent across a five year period starting with the Budget in May does not stack up terribly well against those yardsticks. Not only has this spend been irresponsible; it has also led to a missed opportunity and has now put upward pressure on interest rates. The IMF's report on Australia last year said that the ‘short-term stimulatory effect ... could complicate monetary policy formulation'. That is code from the IMF; it is a rebuke to this government, and we are now living with the results. The price that must be paid by the Australian people for this government's $66 billion spending spree during the election is higher interest rates, which the Reserve Bank said last Monday week are now on the cards, regrettably. It is an inevitable consequence of the $66 billion spendabso- ing spree that the government embarked upon from the budget last year right through to the election campaign. Bear in mind that the report from the IMF had been written before John Howard went on his mad election spending spree during the campaign itself. Even by IMF yardsticks, we are going to have an even bigger stimulatory effect arising from the spending of $100 million a con- minute during the policy speech itself. After running an election campaign on trust and promising to keep interest rates low, the government's lies are now being exposed and paid for. If interest rates are to go up-and that will be regrettable-the responsibility will lie with ministers such as the minister sitting opposite. The minister opposite will bear responsibility for this, as will the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Mr Hockey-Minister for Human Services.",137
163,Mr SWAN,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"Yes, that is right. You will live with the consequences, Minister. And we will hold you accountable on a daily basis for it. Mr Hockey interjecting",138
164,Mr SWAN,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"We certainly will. The Reserve Bank have made it quite clear that the likelihood of interest rate rises has increased substantially since the election. Their report at the end of last year was quite benign, but their report two weeks ago made it very clear that this government is responsible for the upward pressure on interest rates. It can be to the government's policies that the Reserve Bank was pointing. Nothing else has changed between November and two weeks ago. The Treasurer seeks to deflect the blame for rising inflation and interest rates onto workers. As the RBA made it quite clear, there is no hard evidence of widespread wage pressures arising. Instead, what the RBA did point to were capacity constraints linked to inadequate infrastructure and skill shortages-areas within the control of this government but for which it has never been prepared to accept responsibility. We had the Treasurer in the House again today playing the blame game. He came in here seeking to pass responsibility for capacity constraints in the ports solely to the states, as though it nothing to do with the Commonwealth government. During the election campaign the Treasurer claimed there was evidence that additional family payments were being savedand of course the Minister for Human Services sitting opposite would know all about this. However, just last week the Treasurer was boasting that one family payment lump sum was being used to purchase a greyhound, which he seemed to think was a terrific outcome. It was an unusual way to promote the policy that was supposed to give families the opportunity to buy textbooks and uniforms, get work done on the car or start saving. What we do know is that this Treasurer dogged the opportunity to deliver real reform to the tax and family payments systems, and what we are left with is a dog's breakfast. He has dogged the reform our economy needs to guarantee future growth, banging on instead about a dog-eat-dog industrial relations system. That is the only recipe that this Treasurer has for reform of our economy. It is simply a sole focus on bashing workers rather than a wide based reform program which invests in productivity and meets the real problems facing this economy. By far the most damning criticisms of this government's policy have come from the OECD's report card on Australia issued a few weeks ago. What the OECD said was quite plain. They said reform efforts had slackened off. The slackening off has occurred across the board, with all the drivers of economic growth being neglected, including labour market participation, productivity, tax and education. The Treasurer likes to stand up in this place at every opportunity and point the finger at everyone but himself. Listen to what the OECD said on the Commonwealth government's competition reforms: had Bringing the reform programme to completion according to an announced timetable is important to avoid the impression that difficult reforms can be deferred indefinitely. Among jurisdictions, the federal government in particular should make stronger efforts to raise its own compliance rate, which has been among the lowest of all Australian governments and is not commensurate with its leadership role in promoting enhanced product market competition. There is the OECD saying that the Treasurer has fallen behind even the states when it comes to product market competition. With the neglect of competition reforms, it is no wonder that Australian's exporters are struggling. Australia has now run 38 trade deficits in a row, with no end in sight. The current account deficit is heading towards seven per cent of GDP despite the best terms of trade in 30 years. Mr Brough- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not wish to stop the member in full flight, but this is a very tight measure and I would ask you to bring him back to the bill before us.",138
165,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,The member for Lilley will confine his remarks to the bill.,139
166,Mr SWAN,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is a bill about international tax arrangements and I am directing my remarks to that. I am talking about the international competitiveness of this economy and the fact that it is not internationally competitive has led to 38 trade deficits in a row. What could be more pertinent to the title of the bill? It just shows you that this government do not get the problem. They simply do not understand. We are not internationally competitive, and they have been criticised severely by the OECD for the lack of international competitiveness. That is the whole point. The minister has just demonstrated his profound ignorance of the problem that is facing the country. The Reserve Bank stated only two weeks ago that they are expecting a 6¾ per cent current account deficit for the December quarter. Only last week or early this week the Commonwealth Bank was talking about a current account deficit of seven per cent. If the terms of trade were now closer to the average that we have experienced over the last 10 years, we would be looking at a current account deficit in excess of nine per cent of GDP. When we head into that territory we are heading into very high foreign debt, which has now hit 50 per cent of GDP. So we certainly have a problem of international competitiveness, and this is another factor in addition to the government's spending spree putting upward pressure on interest rates. And all that impacts on the average family. The price that will be paid for this government's policy complacency and their spending spree during the election campaign is going to be increased interest rates for average Australian families battling to pay off their mortgages and bring up their kids. Nothing could be more relevant to our international competitiveness than that very basic fact. More than ever as a country we are reliant on foreign savings. The Treasurer used to say that a high current account deficit and foreign debt led to higher interest rates. His feeble excuse in this House last week is that now it is mainly a private matter. He says it has nothing to do with him any more. All of the debt is private. Mr Hockey-It's got to be twin deficits!",139
167,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,Order! The minister will cease interjecting.,139
168,Mr SWAN,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"That is not what the OECD says. That is not what the IMF says. That is not what Standard and Poor's says. No-one of any economic credibility agrees with that reply from the Treasurer, because he is running away from responsibility. Peter Costello in this House, again last week, tried to say that the current account deficit was cyclical, that it is a function of a strong economy, that it was caused by the high dollarMr Brough- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is not a debate about the current account. This is a bill called New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Funds and Other Measures) Bill 2004. There has hardly been a word uttered by the member for Lilley which has been even remotely directed towards this. I would ask him to please be brought back to the substance of the bill.",139
169,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,The member for Lilley will return to the bill.,140
170,Mr SWAN,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"Certainly, because what this country needs is international competitiveness. What it needs is an internationally competitive tax regime so that we can compete, so that we can export more and so that we can actually pay our way in the world. That is what this country needs, and that is why this bill is so important. We do need to be internationally competitive, and that is why we need an internationally competitive tax regime, which apparently we have not had or these amendments would not have been necessary. The truth is that we need to do better. We need to export more. Australia has been distracted by bilateral free trade agreements when the main game should be reinvigorating the multilateral trade round.",140
171,Unknown,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,Honourable members interjecting,140
172,Mr SWAN,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"Absolutely! You are asleep at the wheel when it comes to doing something about our export performance. The recent trend towards free trade agreements is a departure from APEC's commitment to open regionalism and liberalisation via the WTO. We need a much broader approach to trade if we are going to come to grips with the problems in our current account deficit and do something about our very poor export performance. We simply have to do better for the future of the country to guarantee our future prosperity. This bill goes a small way towards lifting Australia's competitiveness but much more the needs to be done. On tax we most certainly need to be smarter and more competitive. My discussions with business to date have revealed that Australia's international tax arrangements have acted as a barrier to attracting the best and brightest minds and entrepreneurs to this country. We are in the same time zone as Asia and can offer an attractive place for the brightest and the best minds to settle and to work. While mindful of protecting Australia's revenue base, it is important to have a competitive tax system so that we can provide our business sector with a competitive edge. With this in mind I support the international tax arrangements bill, but I am also interested in going further. For example, one issue that has caught my attention is the capital gains tax deemed disposal rule that applies to certain foreign citizens working in Australia. The rule means that after a period of five years residing in Australia if they become a non-resident they incur a capital gains tax liability irrespective of whether they have disposed of a specified foreignheld asset. To me this does not appear to be good tax design. I understand that the issue has been pursued through double tax arrangements. However, I am keen to hear from the government of ways that the process can be expedited and extended. Having an internationally competitive and efficient tax system needs to be a top priority. Despite the challenges Australia faces, all we have heard from the government on tax reform are the mumblings of the so-called ‘ginger group'. Using the word ‘group' is probably a stretch but, anyway, I will dignify them with the term. As far as I can tell it appears to be the usual grab bag of the usual conservative hobbyhorses-I have seen indexing the tax scales, getting stuck into welfare recipients, income splitting and lifting the tax-free threshold. About the only issue that seems to bind this odd assortment of disgruntled backbenchers is a belief that the government is the highest taxing government in Australian history-and they have certainly got that right. I certainly agree with them on that. The Howard-Costello government is reaping more than $100 billion extra a year in taxes compared to the tax take it inherited from Labor. That is a staggering $12,000 extra in tax paid by households next financial year compared to 1995-96, and that is even the case with the tax cuts We do need substantive tax and welfare reform, and it requires a lot more than the simplistic, ill-considered statements made by the members of the ginger group. In particular, the complex tax and welfare mess needs to be addressed. That minister over there is certainly not up to the task. The interaction of a vast array of different payments, withdrawal rates, thresholds, rebates and tax rates creates a system that is impossible to understand and punishes effort. Australia needs a tax system to be reviewed with an eye to lifting the efficiency and equity of the system. We need to lift the competitiveness of Australia's tax system in attracting and retaining workers and one that addresses the potential distortions that arise in the current system. Looking at those ministers opposite, you can absolutely understand why it is such a dog's breakfast. Just look at them rabbiting on. They have not got a clue about how to fix the disincentives and the punishment in the system. They would not have a clue about the impact of effective marginal tax rates on people on average incomes-not a clue. And they would not have a clue about addressing the issues to do with participation in our systighter tem-not a clue. That really demonstrates the problem we have in this country. While Liberals continue to rabbit on about an odd assortment of reforms, this country absolutely needs fundamental tax reform and particularly tax reforms that deliver to those families who are hit by very high effective marginal tax rates. Minister, people on average incomes do not work harder and do not give up their family time to hand back to you 40c in every additional dollar they earn in overtime. That is the system that you left in place during the last election. You added to it, made it more complicated, and left these people with the tax burden that is crippling them and does due in July. not reward effort.",140
173,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,Order! The member for Lilley will direct his remarks through the chair.,141
174,Mr SWAN,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,That is your legacy and that is the problem in the agency that you happen to administer. You should stand up and admit responsibility for it.,141
175,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,Order! The member for Lilley will direct his remarks through the chair.,141
176,Mr SWAN,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I support this international tax arrangements bill, but let us have a broader debate.",141
177,Mr SLIPPER,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"Fisher) (6.19 p.m.)Having listened to the member for Lilley with that diatribe I believe one could mount a very substantial case to change the way that bills placed before the House are given a certain form of short title. For instance, this bill, the New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Funds and Other Measures) Bill 2004 has as its short title ‘A bill for an act to amend the law relating to taxation, and for related purposes'. It has long been a hobbyhorse of mine that it would be better if the drafters of legislation actually had had a title to the bill so that people could only talk about the substantive matters in the bill rather than any particular matter in relation to taxation and for related purposes. If you had not heard the member for Lilley say at the end that he supported this measure it would have been very difficult to understand that the opposition was in fact supporting the government in this very important initiative contained in the New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Funds and Other Measures) Bill 2004. The difficulty is-and we saw this when the GST was introduced-that, over and over again, members were able to re-debate aspects of taxation that had no direct relation the particular measures before the House. So there has been a vast amount of repetition. There has been an incredible misuse of the forms of the House by the opposition. I suppose the reason that they are able to get away with it is because the legislation is not drafted in the title of the bill in the way that requires them to debate the particular bill, and they can relate any peripheral issue in relation to taxation when debating any bill brought into the House by the government concerning taxation of Australians. This particular piece of legislation has had an interesting history. Prior to the election was introduced and it lapsed when the parliament was prorogued prior to the election. The government believes that this legislation is an important initiative and thus, post the election when we were comprehensively returned to office and the Labor Party was rejected once again by the Australian people, the government reintroduced this legislation for debate. Hopefully, the legislation will be carried by both houses and the very important benefits that will flow through to the community will indeed be received. As the Bills Digest points out, there are three schedules to the bill. The purposes of the amendments to the tax law proposed in each schedule are, with respect to schedule 1, that there will be changes to the tax treatment of foreign residents who make a capital gain or loss in respect of an interest in an Australian fixed trust. Schedule 2 includes amendments to the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 aligning the tax treatment of foreign residents investing through managed funds that derive some or all of their income from sources outside Australia with the tax treatment that would apply if those foreign residents made those investments directly. The third schedule to the bill intends to implement three distinct amendments that relate to to the imposition of interest withholding tax, seeking to ensure that the interest withholding tax provisions operate as intended and are consistent with recent developments in the tax law. There will not be a substantial financial impact as a result of the carriage of this legislation but the impact will indeed be beneficial. The bill seeks to concentrate on removing distortions in international tax laws to make this country's managed fund industry more attractive to foreign clients. I think most people would agree that it is important for us as a nation to attract as many foreign it clients as we can. Most people appreciate that we have a significant managed fund industry facilitated by the strong economic performance of this government. We have a highly educated work force, a low-cost infrastructure, advanced regulatory systems and sophisticated financial markets. It is, however, important to appreciate that we ought not rest on our laurels; and this is why this particular piece of legislation is being proposed. It is good that the opposition is supporting it, although it is eminently regrettable that the member for Lilley seems to forget the appalling 13 years of the Hawke and Keating governments and the economic basket case that was Australia when we inherited the reins of office in 1996. It is a pity that he plays politics. It is important that people see through the rhetoric of the member for Lilley. He does make a lot of wind but does not necessarily make a lot of sense. The New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Funds and Other Measures) Bill 2004 is an important piece of legislation and it is vital that it proceed expeditiously through parliament. This bill is identical to the previous bill that was introduced in the last parliament, with the exception that some reasonably complex provisions concerning starting dates have been changed and the commencement dates for the individual schedules have been replaced by a new item 2, which provides that the entire bill will commence upon receiving royal assent. In my view this is an important change which will make implementation of the bill, once law, more effective. I commend the bill to the chamber.",141
178,Mr BROUGH,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"in reply-I particularly thank the member for Fisher for his contribution. I would like to thank the member for Lilley but he did not actually talk about the bill. was actually hoping that he would be here because I did have an invitation for him. He stands here and lectures the government about all of the issues to do with financial rectitude and looking after Australia's families. I invite him when he is next in the chamber to inform the Australian public that he has worked out that the $600 family payments are in fact real money. Once he has that fundamental issue off his plate then he can move on to bigger and more significant issues when it comes to international tax rangements. I am not deriding for one moment the absolute significance of those payments to the welfare of our families. In the 2003 budget the Treasurer announced the outcome of the review of international tax arrangements, foreshadowing over 30 initiatives designed to modernise Australia's international tax system. In a statement at the time the Treasurer said: ... to maintain Australia's status as an attractive place for business and investment, the tax system needs continually to adapt to the international business environment. Never were truer words spoken. I take the opportunity to congratulate my colleague and minister at the table here who at the time was Minister for Financial Services. I think it said a lot about the government's commitment to making Australia a global hub for financial services that Minister Hockey was the first ever minister for that particular portfolio. The government recognised the significance that the financial markets play and the importance of taking a lead role in these measures. So that largely commenced in 1996 and we have absolutely remained committed to ensuring that Australia is an attractive place to do business in the investment field in particular. The package of reforms announced by the government will improve the competitiveI ness of Australian companies with offshore operations. These reforms will reduce the cost of complying with the controlled foreign company rules, reduce tax on foreign ‘active' business income and effectively reduce foreign taxes by modernising Australian tax treaties. The reforms will encourage the establishment in Australia of regional headquarters for foreign groups and improve Australia's attractiveness as a continuing base for our multinational companies. The reforms will also enhance competitiveness and rear- duce the compliance costs for Australian based managed funds. The government first delivered on these announced reforms with the signing of the new tax treaty with the United Kingdom. The treaty was enacted in 2004. It provided significant benefits for Australian based multinationals operating in the United Kingdom. The New International Tax Arrangements Act 2004 and the New International Tax Arrangements (Participation Exemption and Other Measures) Act 2004 implemented many more of these initiatives. The changes reduced compliance costs and minimised the tax burden on the offshore operations in Australia's multinationals. The bill before the House is a further instalment of these ongoing and important international tax reforms. The bill focuses on making the Australian managed fund industry more attractive to foreign clients. Austrathe lia has a significant managed fund industry facilitated by the strong economic performance of the Howard government, a highly educated work force, low-cost infrastructure, advanced regulatory systems-which cannot be understated-and sophisticated financial markets. Reforms in this bill reduce taxation impediments to further growth in this area. These changes allow Australia's managed funds to become more internationally competitive, increasing their attractiveness to nonresidents. Under current capital gains tax arrangements, nonresidents investing in assets through an Australian managed fund may be taxed more heavily than if they invested in those assets directly through a eign fund. Measures in this bill will eliminate these distortions. The size of the Australian fund management pool and its prospect for continued growth are drawing global firms to establish operations here in Australia. The resultant clustering of activities and concentration of expertise have created a robust domestic industry. This infrastructure provides a framework for Australia to become the funds management hub for the Asia-Pacific, and these reforms will remove impediments to achieving this goal. This bill has very strong business support. I thank all in the business community who were involved in the process of developing this bill for their consultation and for their constructive approach to working with Treasury to ensure that we get it right. The future of the Australian economy is fundamentally linked to global prosperity and to Australia being part of that prosperity. That is why I found the comments today by the member for Lilley when he said that the government was ill-directed-I cannot quite recall the exact word he used-when we looked at bilateral relations with the US. It is single largest economy in the world, and he derides the government for taking on the enormous task of securing a free trade agreement so that we can push forward with our trade with the US and, in doing so, help the balance of trade. This bill is an important part of modernising Australia's international tax system to make the most of Australia's potential to market financial products to foreign investors. It is yet another instalment of the government's total commitment to ensuring we are at the forefront of both regulatory and tax improvements, so that overseas investors find this a safe, secure and a viable country to invest in, which at the end of the day will for- make us a more prosperous nation. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",143
179,Mr BROUGH,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"by leave-I move: That the bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 2004-2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 February, on motion by Mr Brough: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Swan moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its: (1) dishonest promises during the 2004 election campaign that it would keep interest rates low; (2) short-term, reckless spending during the lead up to the 2004 election, which is adding to inflationary and interest rate pressures; (3) gross neglect of Australia's education and training needs, leaving Australia with a skills crisis which is adding to inflationary terest rate pressures; and (4) failure to secure Australia's economic future by making the long term policy commitments that will improve the productivity and competitiveness of the Australian economy”.",144
180,Mr RICHARDSON,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"I rise today in support of the government's Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20042005 and related bills introduced into this House. The Howard government went to the Australian people at the last election seeking a fourth term in government. When we did so, we promised the Australian people that we would put in place an agenda which directly addressed their most vital needs. Each and every member of the Howard government is closely in touch with the people of their electorates and their needs. For that 2004-2005 reason we have been able to put together an appropriations package that will directly impact on the needs of the Australian people. I can assure you of that, Mr Deputy Speaker, 2004-2005 because I see every day in my electorate of Kingston that the Howard government's policies are supporting and addressing the needs of my constituents. The electorate of Kingston, which I represent in this House, is an exceptionally diverse and progressive area. Located in the southern suburbs of South Australia, it is an electorate that contains diverse industry from myriad sectors, all facing a plethora of different challenges over the coming years. My electorate will face increased and varied challenges over the coming years, but in the short time. I have been the representative of the fine people of Kingston I have come to get a real sense of optimism from them. It is a sense of optimism which stems from the confidence Australians have in the Howard government. The challenges that face my electorate are wide and varied but I seek to present some of them to the House today, along with a brief explanation of how the and in- Howard government's policies are making a difference in the lives of my constituents as well as filling them with the sense of optimism and hope that I spoke of earlier. I bring up the issue of crime first because it is an issue I can speak about with a certain level of authority, based on the fact that I spent the last 28 years as a member of the South Australian police force. I have seen first-hand the devastation that high levels of crime can have, not only on victims but on entire communities. Since my election to the federal seat of Kingston I have lobbied the South Australian government on policing numbers, not only in my electorate but right across the state of South Australia. I have made no secret of the fact that it is an issue I will continue to pressure the state Labor government about. The Howard government shares my concern and that of my community about crime. It has shown its dedication to the issue in its recent crime prevention package of funding. On top of the $8 million in funding for crime prevention and community safety, the Howard government has committed a further $10 million over the next 10 years. The structure of this funding is particularly propriate to the needs of the community and community groups in my electorate. The government's National Community Crime Prevention Program provides funding to community groups and projects which are working at the coalface. I am talking about community groups working directly in their communities to help prevent crime and who now receive funding from the federal government to do so. This is by far one of the most aggressive strides taken to prevent crime at a genuine and grassroots level. The success of these programs is evidenced by the 186 applications that have already been made for the funding. But it is more than that; it is just plain common sense. We cannot force the state Labor governments to allocate appropriate funds to crime prevention, police numbers and police resources, so we have done the next best thing: we are finding groups and projects from the local area, for the local area. We are getting groups and individuals who know the demographics of an area, and the hardships faced specifically by the people of that area, and providing them with the funding to continue their hard and valued work. The Howard government is dedicated to doing all it can prevent crime not only in my electorate of Kingston but across the nation. The government recognises that we possess no greater asset than our youth. This government has worked tirelessly to ensure that we hand to the future generations an Australia which is in the best possible position in every facet of Australian life, from the culture-the Australian way of life-to the ability of future generations to access health and education programs which are financially able to support their needs. But we want to go further; we want to ensure that that legacy is handed to Australians who are as equipped as they possibly can be to take ap- this nation into the future-and that is why we are dedicated to providing the best possible education to the children of this nation. The government's commitment to our young people and to education in this country is clearly outlined in the substance of our $1 billion initiative to restore and rebuild Australia's schools infrastructureinfrastructure which is needed for current and future generations. The government recognises the fine work, commitment and passion of our teachers and parents in providing a meaningful and fulfilling learning environment for all our children. That is why our funding commitments are being provided directly to schools to support the capital projects that school communities have identified. Across Australia, the Howard government's $1 billion investment is funding highpriority projects that will enhance the educational amenity of our schools. The list includes classroom improvement, library resources, computer facilities, air conditioning and heating, outdoor shade structures, play equipment, security fencing and many other essential amenities, all chosen in consultation with school principals and school-parent to committees. Projects of this nature are often desperately needed by school communitiesparticularly in my electorate-but never seem to rate highly enough on the list of priorities of the South Australian Labor state government and state governments nationwide. Earlier this week, I spoke in the House about Morphett Vale High School and the work of the Southside Christian Centre, which are both located in my electorate. It was the story of a public school so desperately in need of an upgrade of its basic infraclearly structure facilities that a local group of Christian volunteers put up their hands and rolled up their sleeves to get the job done. This school was failed by a state Labor government that neglected their needs. But, worse than that, the state Labor government did not even understand what those needs were. The Howard government will not stand back and continue to allow state bureaucracies to underfund education for our young people and to underfund the infrastructure development of our schools. We will continue to work with peak school-parent groups and principals' organisations to deliver results for our state, independent and Catholic schools alike, through our policies which provide grassroots funding where it is so desperately required. With a grant under the Howard government's new program, the Morphett Vale High School would not have had to rely on the dedication and selflessness of Christian volunteers to keep their school going, but would have had access to funding that directly targeted their needs. In an attempt to address the issue of skills shortages in the traditional trades, the Prime Minister announced in October last year a program to build and develop 24 Australian technical colleges. A consortium from my electorate has put in a submission to the ernment, seeking to build one of the 24 technical colleges in Adelaide's southern suburbs. I will lobby Minister Hardgrave, on behalf of the electorate of Kingston, for the establishment of such an initiative. Yesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition stood in this House and said no technical college would open its doors by 1 January 2006 and no graduates would emerge before 2010. I am here to tell the Deputy Leader of the Opposition just how wrong she is. The consortium from my electorate and other Liberal Party electorates, which has made a submission to the government, has stated that, assuming its proposal is accepted no later than July this year, it will be ready and willing to open the technical college's doors to the first intake of students at the beginning of next year. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may wish to stand before this House poking holes in this program, but she should remember that Australian people and businesses are dedicated to making this program work because they see and understand its real value for individuals, industries and communities alike. It would probably take an excessive amount of time to get a program like this up and running under a Labor government. The people of Australia put their faith in the Howard government at the last election because they understood this government's dedication to providing real solutions to real problems. The introduction of the technical colleges is an example of that dedication. The Howard government has consistently demonstrated its commitment to protecting and strengthening Medicare and delivering high-quality affordable health care to all Australians. In the electorate of Kingston, I represent a broad spectrum of the community who have varied requirements from the health system. I deal with elderly Australians who are looking to enter aged care facilities, gov- working Australians who are simply seeking to access the health system without paying an arm and a leg, and young families, in all kinds of economic situations, who simply need to know that they can keep their families healthy despite their financial circumstances. The Howard government is listening closely to the needs of all those groups in order to provide a health system that is responsive to their needs. The government's Medicare policies have delivered targeted incentives to encourage GPs to bulk-bill children under 16 and concession card holders. In addition, the government has implemented measures to ensure that the Australian health work force remains capable of meeting community needs as our population grows and ages. The government's Medicare safety net has brought greater peace of mind to all Australians, and substantial new benefits have already gone to thousands of Australian families. The health policies of this government remain an important issue in my electorate and they are vitally at the forefront of the minds of the constituents I represent. It is blatantly clear to me that the policies of this government have delivered real outcomes and results for the people of Kingston. As is the case nationally, bulk-billing rates in Kingston have risen significantly over the past 12 months and are now at 72.4 per cent-up 10.6 per cent from year-end 2003. These are not insignificant statistics. These statistics mean that under the Howard government the people of Kingston do not have to consult their bank balance before consulting their doctor. Nationally, more than seven out of 10 GP attendances are being bulkbilled and more than eight out of 10 GP attendances to people over 65 years of age are being bulk-billed. This is the first time in 10 years that the national bulk-billing rate has increased over four successive quarters. During the election campaign we heard much rhetoric from the Labor Party about how the re-election of the Howard government would spell the end of Medicare. Well, today I stand here in the House and present not empty rhetoric but cold hard facts that show that the Howard government is strengthening Medicare and the health system alike. And the people of Kingston, like all Australians, are benefiting from Howard government policies which address their needs. I turn now to the issue of families and communities. I am not just a former police officer or a politician; I am also a father and husband, and I have a first-hand understanding of the ever growing challenges facing Australian families. As a father I have watched my two sons grow into young men, and as a police officer I have watched and played a part in the lives of other families. As a football coach I have watched other parents' young boys develop into young men and I have helped to guide them through the challenges that life throws at them. But in all my experience I have learnt that there is no greater asset in life than a person's family. Mr Deputy Speaker, I now stand before you and the House as all those things-as a father, police officer, football coach, member of the Kingston community and representative of the people of Kingston-and I do so with a lifetime of experience and understanding of the needs of the families in my electorate and the community. It is the understanding of our communities by the Howard government that underpins our Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. It is a strategy to which the government has committed $365.8 million to provide support for local initiatives that intervene early to help families, children and communities at risk, with a particular focus on the early years of a child's life. This commitment empowers grassroots community based organisations such as Anglicare SA, in conjunction with United Care Wesley, to work with families and communities in Kingston to ensure their needs are supported. The needs of each family differ and this funding initiative allows the organisations working with needy families in the community to assess what their needs are and how best to address them. Anglicare SA, in conjunction with United Care Wesley, will receive $3 million in federal funding in 200405 through the government's Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, which will assist the Communities for Children in Onkaparinga project. The project establishes parent groups and parenting courses, improving coordination between family, health and other services such as schools and day care centres. And all of this is in consultation partnership with local community stakeholders, community leaders and local organisations. In conclusion, I am a very proud member of the Kingston community. I am proud every day that I stand in this House and represent the fine people of the electorate but I am always filled with an added sense of pride when I reflect on the Howard government of which I am a part and how we are delivering real results for the people of the electorate I represent. I have outlined only a few measures taken by the Howard government to protect and enhance the lives of the people of Kingston-and indeed all Australians-but they are examples which reaffirm the commitment and dedication of this government to make life that little bit easier that little bit better for all Australians. Australia is filled with mothers and fathers of sons and daughters who deserve a government who will fight for their future and fight to provide them with the services they need the most-and this government does that. The Howard government went to the Australian people at the last election seeking a fourth term in government and we returned with a mandate to represent the people of Australia and provide them with real solutions to their very real problems. This government and this nation are not just about today; this government and this nation are also about the future, and we strive every day to provide a genuine future for the nation we represent and to provide a legacy we can be proud of for generations to come. I support this bill because, like every member of this government, it strives to achieve those goals. It is for that reason that I commend this bill to the House.",145
181,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"Each of the last four election victories of the Howard government have been marred by the deceit of the Australian people and and allegations made by the government which simply have not stood the test of time. In 1996 the now Prime Minister said that there would never, ever be a GST. He was subsequently forced to say, ‘We've kept our core promises,' leading to the infamous division into core and non-core promises-of course, the non-core promises being election undertakings, commitments made to the Australian people which were not honoured. In 1998 in my home state of Victoria we experienced the Longford gas disaster and, on election eve, the government announced that there would be $100 million to compensate Victorians for the inconvenience and hardship arising from that disaster. After the election, we discovered that this amount was ‘up to $100 million', and in fact something like and $7 million was paid out. Prior to the 2001, election we had the notorious ‘children overboard' affair. We subsequently learnt that no children had been thrown overboard, that former minister Peter Reith knew that no children had been thrown overboard but made no attempt to correct the public record which he had generated through his statements and, indeed, that in all probability Minister Ruddock and the Prime Minister were in the same situation. Prior to the last federal election, we had the campaign based around low interest rates, which I will mention later. Also over in Western Australia a woman by the name of Melinda Poor rang ABC radio in a talkback call which caused a great deal of electoral grief for the Labor member for Stirling. This person, who described herself as an ‘ordinary mum', has now turned up as Liberal Party candidate Melinda Poor in the Western Australian state election. It is interesting that she has done this, because the West Australian contacted Mrs Poor in December 2004 to confirm that she was indeed the Liberal Party candidate for one of the state electorates and asked whether she knew Mr Keenan, the member for Stirling, before making the talkback call in September. She said, ‘No, I didn't.' As it happens, the West Australian has a copy of the July 2004 campaign newsletter of the member for Stirling, which says: Michael is well aware of the growing problem of graffiti and recently met with local mother Melinda Poor, of Dutton Crescent in Hamersley, to discuss this important issue. Mrs Poor told Michael that there are increasing levels of graffiti across the suburb. I do not think it is a great qualification for public office that you are prepared to mislead a newspaper in the way that Mrs Poor was prepared to do. Indeed, it was very poor on her part, and I regret that. I return to the central theme of the Howard government's re-election campaign in 2004, which was the promise of low interest rates. In the light of what the Reserve Bank has been saying recently, I guess it is a case of, ‘Let's just see about that.' But, in any event, it is ironic that the government was able to campaign around this issue, because home loan affordability has taken a nosedive in the last two years. Under this Prime Minister, the cost of buying a home has nearly doubled. In 1996 it took an average of 5½ years of wages to buy a house, now it is almost 10 years. Mortgage interest payments cost more than ever, and the burden of monthly mortgage debt has risen by more than 50 per cent. Household debt stands at $766 billion and growing, compared with $289 billion when the coalition took office. Household savings have sunk to new lows, giving Australian families very little to fall back on if they are suddenly placed under extra financial pressure. When Labor left office, Australians were saving $5.80 out of every $100 they earned. Today, for every $100 they go into debt a further $1.90. We have record levels of household debt, not just mortgages but also personal loans and credit cards have created a fear of economic ruin. Regrettably, instead of being held accountable for the pressure on family budgets which has led to this situation, the Liberal Party was able to turn it to advantage with a potent scare campaign. An analysis of the election result shows that that scare campaign resonated most loudly in the high-debt households of middle Australia. In fact, it was Labor's policies which displayed more fiscal discipline. Our spending initiatives were largely funded by planned expenditure savings. The Liberal Party, on the other hand, went on a spending spree which will run down future surpluses and put upward pressure on interest rates. We are in a situation where consumer spending is on fire. We have had very high consumption growth compared with the previous year. We have had some of the fastest consumption growth in 30 years and, instead of hosing down consumption spending, the government has fuelled the fire through a massive budget and pre-election spending spree, spraying an extra $66 billion onto the flames. That is one of the reasons why that household savings rate which I referred to is negative. We have had dozens of successive monthly trade deficits. We have a current account deficit above six per cent of GDP in the September quarter, and we are consuming the proceeds of our terms of trade from soaring commodity prices and cheap manufactured imports. The federal government says that these imbalances are okay and that our deregulated market economy will adjust to them. But the problem is that the adjustment process will cause human pain in the shape of falls in economic activity. The Howard government policy in relation to these matters, such as fuelling the consumption boom and neglecting Australia's export problems, only guarantees that this situation will become more serious in the years ahead. That is regrettable, because the previous Labor government left an economy in good shape to the Howard government. I note that the President of Ford Australia, Tom Gorman, said not so long ago: Twenty years ago the Australian automotive industry was more like a rustbelt industry and something to write home about. He said the turning point came with the Button plan in 1984 that cut tariffs, abolished quotas and encouraged model-sharing arrangements and exports of vehicles and components. So the President of Ford Australia attributed the current dynamism of the market to things which the previous Labor government had set in place. As I have indicated, this has now degenerated into a situation where research shows the average Australian household spends 2.3 per cent more than it earns each week. The government inherited an economy with sound fundamentals, but over its time in office it has allowed them to run down. It has not planned for the future, and the fundamentals of the Australian economy have suffered as a consequence. An example of this is the issue of the ageing population and superannuation. From time to time, the Treasurer talks about the ageing of the population as a matter for concern and comes up with statements like ‘Demography is destiny'. The words are all well and good, but it was the previous Labor government that understood the nature of this problem and sought to address it first through the introduction of the superannuation guarantee-a most important and wonderful thing for Australian workers. We lifted the superannuation guarantee such that nine per cent of workers' incomes is now being put into superannuation and had plans to increase the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 15 per cent. This government chose to jettison that plan, which would have set aside money for the retirement incomes of ordinary Australians and would have guaranteed a suitable alternative to the pension so there would not be that call on the budget from pensions and so on. The government was extremely short sighted and jettisoned that measure, which not will damage Australia's retirement income and this nation in the years ahead. Every time the Treasurer talks about the ageing of the population and what we need to do to address this, it should never be forgotten that it was he who jettisoned the very measures being put by the Keating government which would have genuinely addressed the issue and set Australia up for the future. Many Australians are concerned by the prospect of the coalition having control of both houses of parliament in the second half of this year. Indeed, after the election we learnt that one of the reasons that this has occurred was the success of the National Party in getting Mr Barnaby Joyce elected as a senator for Queensland's sixth Senate spot. That was the critical result which will enable the government to have more than half the Senate seats from the middle of this year. Intriguingly, there have been media reports that Mr Kevin Collins, the Senate candidate for the Fishing Party, was promised by the National Party in pre-election negotiations over preferences that the ban on fishing in certain areas of the Great Barrier Reef which the Howard government had put into place would be reversed. The Fishing Party stood on a platform of having those restrictions on fishing overturned, and Mr Kevin Collins said that he expected The Nationals to deliver on the promise. He said, ‘It looks as though we've got Barnaby Joyce up in the Senate.' Quite so, but the question is was there a secret deal? Why is it that prior to election nothing was said of the prospect that the National Party would seek to have the fishing zones altered? Did the Leader of the National Party know? Did the Prime Minister know? It is indeed very odd that the Fishing Party should have directed its preferences to The Nationals, given that it was the coalition government which had implemented the ban in the first place. These are serious questions regarding the nature of the Senate election in Queensland which need to be addressed and to which we are entitled to answers. The government is a mass of contradictions. I never cease to be amazed by the way in which it gets away with saying one thing to one audience and another thing to another, and taking entirely inconsistent attitudes on various issues as they come before us. For example, in the last few days we have heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs talk about the North Korean nuclear weapons crisis. He said: My own view is that we need to just keep up the diplomacy of encouraging the North Koreans to come back to the table to talk. Later on, he said: We need to encourage China to use its good offices to encourage the North Koreans ... At no stage during the debate we had in this parliament about the issue of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq did the foreign minister or other members of the government talk about the need to ‘just keep up the diplomacy of encouraging' the Iraqi regime ‘to come back to the table to talk'; nor did they suggest that it was the obligation of someone else to resolve the problem, as they are suggesting here. The attitude this government takes in relation to North Korea and nuclear weapons is totally and utterly at odds with the attitude it took in relation to Iraq. This points out the the contradictory approaches taken by this government and suggests that the government's motives, which it claims were causing it to act towards Iraq in the way it did, were not genuine. If they were genuine motives, the government would be putting forward a similar proposal in relation to North Korea. Let me also point out the government's position on the question of a national curriculum versus national testing as one of its contradictions. The Minister for Education, Science and Training has frequently opposed a national education curriculum and said this would encourage mediocrity. But in recent times he has come out saying he supports the idea of a national school-leaver's test. It is absolutely impossible to introduce a national school-leaver's test or national examination without having a national curriculum. It would be absurd to have a national examination without a common curriculum for those who were sitting the examination. The approach of the education minister, which he seems to be able to get away with, is a contradiction in this government's policies. Another contradictory position held by this government relates to its approaches to choice. With the prospect of this government controlling the Senate, there have been various outbreaks within the government as to how it should use this control. There are people raising the issue of abortion and proposing that there be a ban on abortions in certain circumstances. When it comes to the issue of pregnancy termination they are against choice. They say, ‘No, no, no. Choice is inadequate. We need to have the law at work here and we need to have a compulsory arrangement.' But you also hear people saying that the government ought to use its control of the Senate to get rid of compulsory voting in elections. When they are talking about compulsory voting in elections they say, ‘What we need to have is choice. We do not want a compulsory arrangement. That is a bad thing, so let's have voluntary voting.' Again, a government caught in a mass of contradictions. In the brief time available to me I want to turn to the issue of Iraq. We welcome the fact that there has been an election in Iraq, and I certainly hope for the people of that longsuffering country that it is able to fashion a democratic regime which respects human rights and enables living standards to improve. I remain astonished at the way in which this government has behaved in Iraq. In the last couple of days we discovered in the Senate that there was no effort being made to discover Iraqi civilian casualty figures, so we are simply left with a couple of estimates. The conservative estimate coming from Iraq Body Count suggests, as at the end of January, a minimum figure in excess of 15,000 and a maximum of 17,000, compared with the figures from the medical journal the Lancet, which suggests a figure of more than 100,000 civilian casualties as a result of the invasion of Iraq. It concluded that there has been something like 100,000 deaths of people who would not have died had Iraq not been invaded. I hope that the government shows a genuine concern about civilian casualties in Iraq and seeks to get information about what has been occurring in that country. Time does not allow me to speak further about these issues, but I hope on a subsequent occasion to talk some more about this because I do not think we have yet dealt with it satisfactorily.",149
182,Mr SLIPPER,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"In debates on appropriation bills we as members of parliament have one of the few opportunities to talk about a range of issues necessarily exactly covered by the provisions of the bills before the chamber. At the outset, though, I do place on record that I support the three bills that we are currently debating: Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005. The additional estimates request appropriations of $2.1 billion for the fiscal year 2004-05. The figures of the three bills are $1,540.2 million for Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005, $552.6 million for Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005 and only $0.3 million for Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20042005. In 2003-04, the additional estimates bills sought $1.4 billion. The statement of savings shows the expected savings against individual annual appropriations-and the amount of savings expected for 2004-05 is $298.6 million. More than half of this amount is an unspent appropriation arising from the abolition of the Australian Tourism Commission-that is, $121 million-but that is offset by a proposed appropriation in bill No. 3 to fund a new body: Tourism Australia. I do not think that any reasonable person in our community could suggest that the formation of Tourism Australia is not a good thing. Tourism is a wonderful resource for our country and I am privileged to represent the central and southern Sunshine Coast areas in this place. Tourism is one of our major industries. Increasing numbers of people are travelling from right around the nation and right around the world to holiday on the sun belt of the Sunshine Coast. We welcome them; we want as many of them as we can get. I am quite certain that the setting up of Tourism Australia will mean that many more people will be encouraged to come to our area and enjoy its very many natural and man-made assets. Returning to savings against 2004-05 apnot propriations, a significant proportion of the remaining amounts shown will not involve a saving to the budget. This is because they relate to movements of funding to other years, movements within the year to other programs and reclassifications of funding between appropriations. The additional estimates bills and the statement of savings reflect the annual appropriation impacts of measures agreed by cabinet or the Prime Minister since the last budget and routine variations to agency estimates as a result of changes in economic and program parameters, rephrasings and reclassifications. The government does not make any apology for its sound economic management of the Australian economy since 1996. I am proud to be part of a government which has ushered in a level of openness and accountability in financial measures that we have not seen in Australia in the past. As I said at the commencement of this contribution, this debate does give one an opportunity to talk in a wide-ranging way about various issues near and dear to one's heart or one's constituency. I was interested to hear the member for Wills, who spoke before me, refer to the issue of compulsory voting and voluntary voting. I would like to again place on record my very strong support for freedom of choice in voting. I believe that in a democracy people ought to have the right to vote or not to vote. I certainly would expect that everyone would enrol, but I believe it is the antithesis of democracy that after every election numbers of Australians are jailed because they chose not to vote. Australia is one of the few English-speaking countries which actually does have compulsory voting, and I think this is unfortunate. Australia did not have compulsory voting right from Federation. It was introduced only in the 1920s, and there was a very bare debate in the parliament of that time-it did not take very long; there was no controversy. It was suggested by one of the speakers that the introduction of compulsory voting would bring about a whole new enlightenment in the nation about how we are governed, our system of government, our parliamentary system and so on. One of the things this government has sought to do is encourage children, through the school system, to learn more about our wonderful Australian democracy. In this nation we have freedom, we have stability and we have a way of life that has made us the envy of people throughout the world. I think ours is the sixth oldest democracy in the world, and we consider ourselves to be a young country. We certainly are the lucky country. Many people forget that, during large parts of the past century, many countries which are now democratic did not enjoy our rights. I think we are one of the few countries to have been democratic right throughout the 20th century. We do have a great story to tell and it really is important that the children of Australia, who will become adults, are educated about our Australian democracy. I think most members of parliament would be concerned from time to time when constituents come to see them about fixing the local road or maybe arranging for an extra garbage collection. I recall on one occasion a person coming to see me about livestock that happened to be in a public park. I just think that, if we could educate people about how we are governed and about the responsibilities of local, state and Commonwealth governments, as Australians we would be very much better off and our democracy would be even more protected. Having said that, I do support voluntary voting. I think compulsory voting is quite the opposite of democracy. I am not very proud to be part of a country which jails people because they choose not to vote. What the parties ought to do at election time is to encourage people, through their promises and programs, to vote for them. But if someone makes a decision-it might be an ill considered decision-not to vote then that person ought not be dragged before the courts. As the polling booths get very close to closing at six o'clock at night, the people who are arriving are voting only to avoid a fine. I have seen some of them take maybe twice as long as it usually takes to walk the distance from the door of the polling booth to the actual place where they have to vote because they are zigzagging as they have been enjoying liquid refreshment during the afternoon. You have to question quality of the votes of people who are simply voting to avoid a fine. The issue of abortion was also raised by the previous speaker. I am one of those who is particularly concerned about the taxpayer's dollar being used to fund the termination of life. Many people talk about choice and freedom of choice. I believe that in a democracy we do have the right to do with our bodies what we want to within reason, but I have a personal belief that life does begin at conception and that when a woman is pregnant there are two lives to consider. is all very well for a woman to be able to do with her body what she wants, but there is a second life to consider. As a lawyer, I always found it interesting that if a child in the womb, a foetus, is actually injured in a car accident there are very many precedents which permit that child, when born, to sue through the courts for negligence and to in effect receive an award. Surely the ultimate injury is termination, and I get particularly concerned about late-term abortions, and I ask myself whether in the year 2005 it is appropriate that there ought to be taxpayer funding of abortions. In the Commonwealth we do not have the ability to regulate abortion because, other than in the territories where the Commonwealth does have an ability to override the territory governments, this is a matter for state governments. But I think it is appropriate that we should have a discussion in our community on whether it is appropriate that the taxpayer's dollar should be used to fund the termination of life. I certainly have a great concern about that and I can also understand how the Minister for Health and Ageing, for whom I have the highest respect and regard, says he has a concern, being in the position that he is in presiding over what could well be 100,000 terminations in this country. I also support very strongly the long-held and well-established principle in the parliament that on these issues of conscience people have a conscience vote. This, in my view, indicates that parliament is operating as people expect it to. I have to say, if people were forced to vote one way or another on these conscience issues because of party discipline, it would be a parody of justice and a travesty of democracy. I just want to commend the tradition which has grown up in the parliament that on these issues members are able to consult their constituencies and exerIt cise their conscience, and they are able to vote as they feel is right and appropriate. I think as you go around the country one of the issues that excites a great deal of interest is aircraft noise. I know around the major city airports this has been a very substantial issue for discussion. I recall that the Minister for Human Services used to chair a group in relation to Sydney airport. Members of parliament do have an obligation and a responsibility to in effect meet the concerns of those they represent. I just want to say how pleased I am that Jetstar is increasing the number of services it runs to the Sunshine Coast. The Sunshine Coast, of course, is the most wonderful part of this country in which to live. People move from the rustbelt areas of southern Australia-not that I would refer to the Central Coast of New South Wales, Minister Lloyd, as a rustbelt area",153
183,Mr LLOYD,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"Thank you, Mr Slipper.",156
184,Mr SLIPPER,NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX,"but there are many people who move from your area and other areas to the Sunshine Coast. One of the concerns that we have is that our population will double over the next 15 years or slightly more. Of course, that places great burdens on our infrastructure as a community. I suppose in a way we cannot really have our cake and eat it too. We want as many flights into the Sunshine Coast as possible because, when people travel to the Sunshine Coast from other parts of the country and other parts of the world, obviously they bring dollars, they help business, they grow our local economy, they create jobs and they give our kids on the Sunshine Coast the opportunity of getting one foot on a rung of the employment ladder. Equally, of course, it is important to make sure that these increased aircraft movements have as little an impact as possible on the quality of life of those people who reside on the Sunshine Coast. A couple of years ago I called public meetings at Buderim because I had complaints from my constituents about lowflying aircraft. The flight paths were such that many people had substantial interruption to their enjoyment of life. We were able to work with Airservices to come forward with an appropriate solution. I see that many people are now concerned by the fact that Jetstar will increase the size of planes flying to the Sunshine Coast. Obviously we need the larger planes because they bring larger numbers of people who will spend larger amounts of money on the Sunshine Coast, but I just want to assure my community and the Sunshine Coast that I would like to hear complaints from anyone who is concerned about flight paths or noise from aircraft. I believe that, working with Airservices Australia, it is usually possible to bring forward a solution which will not only encourage increased numbers of people travelling to the Sunshine Coast with all the benefits that will flow through to the economy but also do it in a way that does not impact on the quality of life of those people who choose to live on the Sunshine Coast. In the time that is remaining to me, I would just like to comment on a recent announcement by the government with respect to the $146.6 million allocated to Queensland's natural resources. The $146.6 million Australian and state government investment for Queensland's 15 natural resource management regions will help protect and restore our state's water quality, World Heritage areas, biodiversity hotspots, RAMSAR sites, cultural values and agriculture. The investment from the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality was a three-year allocation. The regional bodies that operate in South-East Queensland are the Burnett-Mary Regional Group for Natural Resource Management, South Queensland Natural Resource Management and the South East Queensland Western Catchments Group. I have to say that one of my regrets is that this government is not recognised, as it should be, as one of the greenest governments in Australian history. By setting up the Natural Heritage Trust, we have been able to do a lot towards redressing the impact of 200 years of European settlement in Australia. One of the good things now is that the environment is not owned by either side of politics. This government does have a proud record but, regrettably, when election time comes, the more extreme environment groups do not recognise the role that the Howard government have played. We have had a whole range of initiatives. We have by done a lot; there is more to be done. On the Sunshine Coast in particular I want to commend all of those participants in Green Corps over the years. The Sunshine Coast, as an area with a rapidly growing population, has great pressure placed on its environment and yet what we are noticing now is that many young people are keen to participate in Green Corps. I think this is a positive thing. We are also noticing that many people who traditionally would not be environmentalists are now coming forward. I believe that older Australians, including many who are retired, have become very strongly in favour of preservation and improvement of our environment because they know that it will improve the Australia that their children and grandchildren will inherit. The government have been in office since 1996. We have achieved an incredible amount in the area of economic management and in so many other areas. We have been able to achieve very positive social outcomes, but of course there is more to be done. We are not a government that rests on our laurels. I have to say that I am impressed by the fact that post 1 July we will have a majority in the Senate, and that majority will be used responsibly. Debate interrupted. NA",156
185,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Kyoto Protocol",157
186,Mr GARRETT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in the House on this most important of days-Kyoto Day. It is a day on which the headlines proclaim that ‘Climate change is upon us'. ABC news reports that many climate scientists say that floods, storms and droughts will become more frequent and that climate change is the most severe long-term threat to the planet's life support systems. On the day the Kyoto protocol comes into force worldwide, I want to record on behalf of the Australian people our strong opposition to the position taken by the Howard government on the issue of global warming: in particular, its refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol. What do the National Farmers Federation of Western Australia, the Australian Medical Association, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Institute of Engineers, the Pentagon, the CSIRO and a raft of community groups, academic institutions and the community generally all have in common? Unlike the Howard government, they recognise the very serious challenge to our way of life posed by global warming and the need for a far-sighted, proactive, national and international response to this issue. The words that introduce the Otin Taai declaration-produced by the Pacific Churches Consultation on Climate Change, which met on March 2004 on the small island state of Kiribati-read: Here on the small island atoll of Kiribati, the impacts of human-induced climate change are already visible. The sea level is rising. People's homes are vulnerable to the increasingly high tides and storm surges. Shores are eroding and the coral reefs are becoming bleached. The water supplies and soil fertility are being threatened by the intrusion of salt water. Weather patterns are less predictable, posing risks to fisher-folk and farmers. It is estimated that about seven million people in the Pacific are experiencing similar impacts of human induced climate change. What is the Howard government's response? In the face of these direct challenges and threats posed by global warming to the world, the Australian environment and the economy, the Howard government has spent today erecting a series of straw men to justify its failure to ratify Kyoto and to provide real leadership for the task of reducing greenhouse emissions. In so doing, either the Howard government has demonstrated its lack of understanding of the scientific basis for claims that global warming is a fact or it has willingly ignored such facts to appease sectoral and political interests. The government has also demonstrated a lack of confidence in the ability of the Australian people, communities and businesses to rise to the challenges posed by a rapidly warming world. The government has spent Kyoto Day underplaying the seriousness of an issue which will reshape our lives in the coming decades. It has betrayed young Australians who, looking forward, face a world in flux and chaos. The government is nowhere to be seen on one of the most significant environmental issues of our age-an issue which transcends economics, crosses natural and national borders and impacts on the health and livelihood of hundreds of millions of people. Where British Prime Minister Tony Blair identifies global warming as an international issue on the scale of terrorism, the Howard government is missing in action. This attitude is despite the fact that we can meet the emission targets, that we were granted a special deal on land clearing and that we have maintained economic growth whilst meeting the targets that 140 other countries have seen fit to sign up to. This attitude is also despite our scientists repeatedly telling us about global warming. At a metrological conference in Brisbane this week, Dr Holger Meinke, a climate scientist from the department of industry, said: ‘We can ignore it'that is, global warming-‘at our peril and pay the costs afterwards.' Despite all this, Prime Minister says the national interest will suffer, and the Treasurer blithely assures the Australian people that ratifying Kyoto will be a large detriment to the economy-yet, no evidence is produced to support this claim. Is the government unaware of increases in insurance premiums, expected crop losses, threats to tourism revenue-all of which are associated with global warming and which are being examined by companies who work in these areas now? The government has failed to identify that the national interest is at stake in combating global warming. The government ignores the fact that climate change induced drought already bedevils Western Australia and the south-east and south-western regions of Australia, and that it will continue to do so. The government's position is also confused. Astonishingly, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources said today that he even doubted ‘whether or not the emissions were causing climate change'. ‘I don't know,' he said. He ought to find out. I invite the minister to familiarise himself with the ever growing weight of scientific evidence broadcast daily on this issue, or to refer to his colleague the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, who has now come round to the view that the debate should move on, that there is consensus about climate change. Hallelujah! It is government policy-the imagination and vision to respond to the great challenges ahead that global warming represents-that is the missing ingredient in this debate. (Time expired) Employment: Skills",157
187,Mr BARTLETT,ADJOURNMENT,"It was no surprise yesterday to see the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and a former Leader of the Opposition using the appropriations debate to try to attract some attenthe tion. What was astonishing, however, was to see them all trying to use it to establish Labor's economic credentials to try and convince us and many on their own side that they had a story to tell here. This was a troika of Labor's economic flat earth society. We had the Leader of the Opposition trying to convince us that black was white by trying to explain away Labor's appalling record on interest rates. We had the deputy opposition leader trying to prove that black was white on the issue of skill shortages. We had the former opposition leader trying to do the same thing with regard to trade performance. I would like to have the time to address these, but on this occasion I will address the issue of skill shortages. It seems that Labor members have read a couple of media stories about skill shortages and have suddenly decided that it is an area where they ought to show some interest. There are two distinct aspects to the whole area of skill shortage: the first is the demand side; the second is the supply side. On the demand side it is clear that there is a growing issue with a tightening labour market. The reason that there is a tightening labour market is simply that we have had several years of strong economic growth, strong jobs growth and a strong demand for labour. When that is the case, you start to develop a tight labour market. We have had 1.5 million jobs created-1.5 million more people in work-over the past nine years. There were 307,000 in the last year alone, and 55 per cent of those were full-time jobs. We have seen unemployment fall from 8.5 per cent in 1996 to 5.1 per cent now, and that is with an increased participation rate, up from 63.5 per cent to 64.1 per cent. Labor's approach to the demand side of the skills shortage issue was simple: have a high level of unemployment and you do not have a skills shortage problem. Labor's approach was the recession that we had to have. This is not a satisfactory approach to the skills shortage problem. On this side of the House we believe in having more people in work, even if that does mean a tight labour market. Labor's approach to the demand side of the skills shortage is simply not acceptable at all. The second aspect of the skills issue is on the supply side. This is an issue of equipping employees with the skills that employers require, particularly the skills that they require in young people taking their place in the labour market. Again, let us look at the all of facts. Under Labor, apprenticeships and traineeships fell to a 30-year low. Their obsession with university places caused them to basically ignore the training and employment needs of the 70 per cent who do not go to university. Their approach to training, tied up in their so-called Working Nation package, really was more about hiding the unemployed than about providing genuine training that would lead to job outcomes. Compare that with what we have seen since 1996. In apprenticeships and traineeships we have seen an increase of some 250 per cent under this government, up from 157,000 when Labor left office to 395,500 in June last year. We have seen VET in Schools take off from 60,000 participants in 1996 to 185,000 just two years ago, including a 400 per cent increase in school based new apprenticeships. This year we have seen a record $2.1 billion in funding to the states and territories for their training programs, up by 48 per cent since 1996. Recently we have seen moves to establish 24 technical colleges to address some of these skills needsdescribed, might I say, by the Australian Industry Group in these terms: ...some of the best news heard in this area for some time ... The Government has ... made addressing skill shortages a major priority. This is from employers who know. Compare this with what we are seeing going on in the Labor states. In 2002 the Commonwealth government offered an extra 71,000 training places-rejected by the states. In New South Wales we have seen TAFE fees increase by 220 per cent. This is a great obstacle to young people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, accessing the necessary training. The point is this: do not listen to Labor's rhetoric; don't listen to what they say in opposition. Look at what they did when they were in government. Look at what the state governments are now doing. The contrast could not be clearer. (Time expired) Kyoto Protocol",158
188,Ms OWENS,ADJOURNMENT,"I sat in this place this morning and watched the Australian government refuse to even debate one of the most serious issues facing Australia and the world: climate change, global warming and, in particular, the extraordinary worldwide response to the Kyoto protocol and Australia's international obligation to ratify the agreement. We were one of the first to sign it. We were there from the start. We got a great deal-better than just about any other country in the world-and we are meeting our targets. We are on target. If we ratify the protocol, there are great nomic benefits to be made and we can be part of shaping the most significant environmental action in our history. And yet the Prime Minister will not ratify the agreement. Today, 140 nations around the world joined together to take action to tackle climate change, and we are not there with them. It is incomprehensible. My young niece has an interesting turn of phrase when she is faced with action that really makes no sense. She puts her hands on her hips and says, ‘What planet are you living on?' Given that we are talking about the planet, I cannot think of a better response to this incomprehensible decision by the Howard government not to ratify this agreement than to say, ‘What planet do the Prime Minister and his government live on?' Clearly, it is not this one. There can be no doubt that climate change is a very real threat to the world and to Australia. It is a mainstream view now that human beings, through the burning of fossil fuels, through the chopping down of our forests and through a sixfold increase in population in just 200 years, are causing a rise in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gas and a warming of the planet. Australians can see the impact of that climate change. Our major cities and towns have prolonged water shortages, the bleaching has damaged significant parts of our fabulous Great Barrier Reef and 75 per cent of the mighty red gums on the Murray River flood plains are dying. Locals in my area know it. While door-knocking last year, I was amazed at just how many people raised issues concerning the environment from water shortage to salinity, from the degradation of our mighty rivers to global warming. Ordinary people around Australia are noticing-and how could they miss it? Australia's failure to sign the agreeecoment does not make sense on environmental grounds, it does not make sense in terms of our international responsibility and it does not even make sense on economic grounds. The Howard government's failure to ratify the Kyoto protocol locks Australian industry out of a growing international market in environmental goods and services. Kyoto is essentially a carrot and stick approach. The stick is reaching the target of greenhouse gas emissions; the carrot is gaining access to the enormous economic benefits of global trading in greenhouse emissions. The world market for environmental goods and services is estimated at $US515 billion. That is about the size of the Australian economy. In another five years we estimate that it will increase by another $US150 billion. That is the carrot: entry into a global market worth over $US500 billion. We have taken the stick-we have set the targets and we are on target-but for some reason we are not reaching for the carrot. There is no carrot for us, just stick. And why? In John Howard's own words after signing the agreement in 1997: We end the year having achieved ... the absolutely stunning diplomatic success ... That was an extraordinary achievement ... He said that we are about to ‘make a massive contribution to the world environmental effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions but also to protect Australian jobs'. By the Prime Minister's own words, it was ‘an extraordinary achievement'. He said that we achieved a win for the environment and a win for Australian jobs. It was a good idea then. I do not know what planet the Prime Minister has moved to since then, but it is not the one that the rest of us live on. The rest of us see the degradation of the environment and the rest of us know that action must be taken. Our children and grandchildren will have no choice but to live on this planet-the one we leave to them. Perhaps the Prime Minister and his government should come back down to earth with us and ratify the Kyoto protocol. Hasluck Electorate: Kalamunda District Community Hospital",160
189,Mr HENRY,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to speak about the Kalamunda District Community Hospital in my electorate of Hasluck. The state Labor government in Western Australia, in particular the Minister for Health, has failed to listen to the community living in the Kalamunda shire. Over 95 per cent of residents who live in the area, which includes the suburbs of Kalamunda, Lesmurdie, Gooseberry Hill, Maida Vale, High Wycombe, Forrestfield, Wattle Grove and Walliston, demand the retention of the maternity and obstetric services at the Kalamunda hospital. Over the past 10 or so years there have been some 400 births each year at the hospital. The loss of maternity and obstetric services would devastate many families moving into new housing developments in the foothills and this would also clearly affect the quality of life for many existing residents. I have spoken directly with many of these people during my campaign for election and subsequently as the member for Hasluck. People of all political persuasions are outraged. Local paper headlines tell the storyfor example: ‘MCGinty lowers boom on hospital maternity services-death knell sounds'; ‘Doubt over hospital outrages doctors'; ‘Doctors move to prove hospital safe'; ‘Hospital's supporters send a clear message'; ‘Health minister says he will not bow to community pressure on hospital'; and ‘Maternity services to be cut after election'. This Labor health minister is not listening. He is holding this community in contempt, and has to go. He has refused to attend a public rally of over 1,500 residents. He refused to speak with over 300 residents gathered at the parliament house in Perth. He has ignored a petition signed by over 17½ thousand residents presented to the state parliament by the member for Darling Range, Hon. John Day MLA. Minister MCGinty made the following claim in the Echo newspaper: Dr Harry Cohen has done a study that effectively said that in the interests of the safety of mothers and their children, obstetrics should be shifted from Kalamunda Hospital. This claim is nothing but political scaremongering and typical of Labor's deceit, for which he should be ashamed. This is to suit the Gallop government's agenda in centralising essential health services against the wishes of the community. I am advised that there is evidence to show that clinical outcomes at Kalamunda hospital were no worse than at any other obstetric units. In fact it proved the opposite. Local doctors, obstetricians and residents were appalled when the safety of mothers and their children was given as a major reason for moving the maternity facilities. This cannot be supported by the facts. GP obstetrician Warren Thyer supported by the hills' doctors said: If there is a safety issue we certainly want to know about it because it attacks the professionalabout ism of the nursing staff and doctors to say not safe. The Kalamunda hospital has been ranked with the highest hospitals on a WA Department of Health patient satisfaction survey. Statistics have shown that it had significantly lower non-elective caesarian rates than other hospitals and that Apgar scores-indicators of a new-born's well-being-for all deliveries were excellent. Dr Thyer said that the Cohen and Reid reports referred to by Mr MCGinty as the basis of his safety claim did not specifically comment on the safety of the Kalamunda obstetric unit. I have been advised that the hospital meets all the requirements of the safe obstetric unit as outlined in the Cohen report. The political scaremongering used by the Labor Party has caused considerable uncertainty in the community. This has been compounded by further advice that the East Metropolitan Health Services are reducing resources available to the obstetric unit, forcing residents to seek obstetric and maternity services from other hospitals and thus artificially reducing the demand for these services to suit Labor's agenda. These actions by the Labor government are causing considerable anxiety, unsettling the community, staff, patients and doctors. Indeed, some local doctors have indicated they would consider their futures in the area if these services were lost from the Kalamunda hospital. The hills area is an area where we already suffer from a shortage of local doctors. I am pleased to be able to say that John Day, the local member, and the coalition strongly support the retention of maternity and obstetric services at the hospital. Kyoto Protocol",161
190,Ms KATE ELLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise on this historic day to also talk the Kyoto protocol and my firm belief we are that the government must show some leadership and ratify the agreement. On a previous occasion when I addressed this matter in the House the member for MCMillan responded by saying: What a delightful address by the member for Adelaide. Her pure, idealistic approaches and processes have obviously come from the member for Grayndler. I say to the member for MCMillan that the member for Grayndler is certainly not alone in believing in this agreement. I believe in Kyoto; many in my electorate believe in Kyoto; and many in Australia share these views. In fact, considering that this agreement has been ratified by 140 countries plus the European Union, it is the Australian government's position which seems unusual. I would also say that, whilst I am sure most of us could be ridiculously patronising to each other if we chose, I believe we are elected here to perform a much more important function. This function is to serve our electorates and the long-term future of our nation, and I believe we can do this by encouraging the government to ratify this agreement. On the day the Kyoto protocol comes into effect, as the world moves a step closer to achieving real outcomes on the issue of global warming, Australia is left out in the cold. We are distancing ourselves from the international effort to deal with climate change the only way it can be dealt withglobally. The government's refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol is further evidence of its patchy record on the environment and on honouring commitments. The Prime Minister stated in 1997 that the Kyoto protocol is ‘a massive contribution to the world environmental effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions but also to protect Australian jobs'. Why, then, is ratifying the Kyoto protocol such a bad idea? It isn't. The government has decided to refuse to engage with the world community, and by its doing so we are fast becoming an environmental pariah. This refusal to sign the protocol is in the face of a weight of scientific evidence. Climate change is not a fanciful idea. It is a fact. What is even more bleak than the current situation is what scientists predict near future. One of the absurd reasons the government peddles for not signing Kyoto is that we are already meeting our emissions targets and therefore there is no need to bother with this protocol. If we are already on track to meet emissions targets, why not sign the Kyoto protocol and let Australia and its industries take advantage of the lucrative carbon trading scheme? I was pleased to note the work of the South Australian government, who this morning announced that South Australia will be playing host to the Climate Change and Business: Australia-New Zealand Conference and Trade Expo in February 2006. It is expected that more than 400 delegates from around the world will attend the conference, which I am proud to say will be held in Adelaide. The conference and expo will focus on how business and industry can exploit the global demand for energy saving technology. This is yet another example of the holistic approach taken by state governments-the idea that economic and environmental concerns are not polar opposites but are intrinsically linked. This is something the current federal government fails to see. Indeed, another argument put forward by the government for not ratifying the protocol is the cost to business. How can they say this when Australia is being locked out of the lucrative multibillion dollar a year international carbon credit trading scheme? Only this morning, on local ABC radio in Adelaide, Dr Peter Ellyard, futurist and strategist and former CEO of the department of environment, told of people he knew who have new innovations to drive sustainable energy production and who plan to move them to New Zealand. This is because New Zealand has ratified the Kyoto protocol, and so people developing initiatives for sustainable energy production can take advantage of carfor the bon credit trading there. Already companies have reported losing out on contracts due to the government's refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol. This will only increase now that the protocol has come into force. If Australia had a clear and coherent greenhouse policy, if we gave our green industry a framework outlining our goals and expectations, industry would have the confidence to invest in new ventures. Without a clear framework, private sector investment in future power generation is stifled. The government must act now to provide some national leadership. Their inaction is preventing both further development and further investment in what should be a rapidly growing renewable energy industry. Let us look at what has gone on in the world today. With the Kyoto protocol coming into effect, what has been established is a first step in a process to redress the harm caused by climate change-harm which touches almost every aspect of life. Whilst 140 governments around the world have acted together to protect the environment, our government, I am ashamed to say, has decided to stand out in the cold. In doing so, they have dragged out there with them Australian business. (Time expired) Tangney Electorate: Schools",162
191,Dr JENSEN,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I am sure that you will be very pleased to know that, unlike those opposite, I will not be talking about global warming scare stories and Kyoto. I will be talking about something that is concrete and of very great importance to the community at large, and that is education. The schools in my electorate have performed extremely well over the last number of years. Dr Nelson, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, visited my electorate recently and visited Leeming Senior High School and Murdoch University. Dr Nelson was especially impressed with the solar car that was being developed by Leeming Senior High School for the Solar Challenge. It is hoped by the students of Leeming Senior High School that their car will be able to complete the challenge within the allotted time. In my electorate there are a number of schools that have come in the top one-third of TEE scores in Western Australia. The public schools include Applecross Senior High School and Willeton Senior High School, which have done very well over the last number of years and improved their positions in many areas. Melville Senior High School is consistently in the top third of the TEE scores in Western Australia. Lynwood Senior High School is also in that areaParkwood Primary is its feeder school and it has the highest proportion in the electorate of children speaking English as a second language and is also the home to the Intensive English Centre. Leeming Senior High School, which I have mentioned before, is a very highly thought of school and in fact is the only school in Western Australia to offer academic specialisation from years 8 to 12 in science through its recently opened Science and Technology Academy. Having previously been a scientist myself, I am extremely proud to have a high school in my electorate reach this achievement. Rossmoyne Senior High School is also not only among the top third in the state but among the very top schools in the state. It is consistently the highest performing high school for TER results in Western Australia-a magnificent achievement. We also have a number of private schools that similarly perform very well in the electorate. Santa Maria High School is in the top third of educational institutions in Western Australia. All Saints College has also achieved that educational height, as have Winthrop Baptist College, Corpus Christi College and Murdoch College. I am very pleased with the results of all of the previously mentioned schools in my electorate and I would like to issue a challenge to the other high schools in the electorate that have not quite reached those heights to continue striving to reach those high educational standards. Kyoto Protocol",163
192,Ms HALL,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to put on record my support for Australia signing the Kyoto agreement. Mr Speaker, I am absolutely disgusted that the previous speaker could refer to the environment as a matter that could create some boredom for you. We on this side of the house strongly support the ratification of the agreement and we believe that the environment and the protection of the environment are integral not only to the future of Australia but to the future of our planet. I feel that the total disregard for the environment and the Kyoto agreement by the government puts it in a position where it stands condemned. I call on the Howard government to reconsider its decision and immediately sign the Kyoto agreement. It is of great importance to the future of Australia and to the future of all Australians. I think it is absolutely despicable that members on the other side of this parliament hold the environment and the agreement in such contempt. Surely they can recognise how important the protection of our environment is to the future of Australia. I believe that it is of such importance that I am holding a forum on the environment in my electorate on 27 February where we will give due credit to the environment that it deserves.",164
