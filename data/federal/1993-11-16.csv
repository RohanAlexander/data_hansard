1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA",11
2,Mr HOWARD,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, understanding order 96 I raise a matter of privilege. It relates to the performance by you of your duties as the independent Speaker and therefore, in a sense, the head of this parliament. I base my matter of privilege on an article by one of Australia's best known and most respected political journalists, Mr Laurie Oakes. In the Bulletin of 9 November 1993, and commencing where material, the article reads: But it was also about teaching Martin a lesson. The speaker had made the mistake of thinking he was independent. He had not sought the prime minister's agreement before bringing down the bipartisan committee's report on the televising of the House. A source in the Keating camp said: ""He should have found out first what Paul would cop."" Keating's attitude was that he was not going to be ambushed by the speaker. Beazley's job was basically to put Martin back in his box. When the matter was raised by journalists travelling with Keating on his recent overseas trip, hethe Prime Ministerresponded, 'I do not give aexpletive deletedabout the speaker!"" I repeat: I do not give aexpletive deletedabout the speaker!"" Martin undoubtedly got the message and he would be extraordinarily brave or foolhardy if it did not affect the way he performs his role in future. This is one reason the reforms to the House of Representatives procedures recommended by a committee headed by Neal Blewettthe honourable member for Bonython-:.. are unlikely to improve things much. They would do nothing to protect the speaker from government pressure. If the referee has to be concerned about his own position, the game is rigged. Mr Speaker, this is not a matter which was in the contemplation of the parliament when it passeq the Parliament&ry Privileges Act in 1987. I think section 6 of that act abolished what was colloquially known as the doctrine of constructive breach of privilege. That section states: (1) Words or acts shall not be taken to be an offence against a House by reason only that those words or acts are defamatory or critical of the Parliament, a House, a committee or a member. (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to words spoken or acts done in the presence of a House or a committee. The breach of privilege I assert has occurred on this occasion is that by the evidence of this report and, most specifically, the clearly contemptuous, derogatory and insulting reference to you-I repeat, the most derogatory, insulting, contemptuous reference; it could hardly be more contemptuous-made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the leader of the majority party in this parliament. It is a pattern of conduct which is calculated to deny you your independence as the Speaker of this parliament. Your role and the trust that you hope your role invokes from both sides of the House rest upon an acceptance by both sides of the House that you are truly independent. The Prime Minister, by his conduct and remarks, and particularly by his clear insult-he portrays his sensitivity only by his baying interjections while I present the point of privilege; quite plainly, this is a pattern of conduct",11
3,Mr HOLDING,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, I take a pomt of order. The honourable gentleman who is raising this matter as a point of privilege is not entitled to do anything more than quote the article. If he is citing Mr Oakes for breach of privilege, he ought to say so. Mr MCGauran-Give us time. We are coming to it. You will soon find out.",11
4,Mr HOLDING,PRIVILEGE,"The last time. I sat on a privileges committee and Mr Oakes was there, members of the opposition were not as prepared to be as loud as they are on this occasion.",11
5,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVILEGE,"The Richmond City Council has ,changed since then.",11
6,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,The right honourable member is not helping.,11
7,Mr HOLDING,PRIVILEGE,"He would have done well on certain aspects of the Richmond City Council; I can assure him of that. The point is that in raising a matter of privilege on the basis of a report the person the honourable member must cite is the author of the report. Unless he does that, sir, I suggest you ask him to come to the point. He is clearly out of order in quoting from a report written by a journalist"" a report which alleges certain statements to other members of this House.",12
8,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,The honourable member for Melbourne Ports makes a valid point. The honourable member for Bennelong had sought indulgence in raising this matter of privilege. He has given quite a deal of background to the matter and I ask him to come to the specifics of the privilege issue.,12
9,Mr HOWARD,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, I do not believe Mr Oakes owes this parliament an explanation. I think Mr Oakes has probably faithfully reported a conversation. Mr Crean-You think! You have to do better than think.",12
10,Mr HOWARD,PRIVILEGE,"I think it is perfectly plain to this parliament that the breach of privilege I complain about is the conduct,attitude, statement and demeaning remarks of the Prime Minister of this country about you, Mr Speaker. At the very least, this'matter ought to be referred to the committee. If that is not your decision, one or both of two things desirably should occur: if this report is wrong, the Prime Minister should deny it in this parliament; if it is right, he should proffer apology to you. More importantly, you ought to assert to this parliament here and now that you will not be intimidated by the Prime Minister and that you are, in truth, an independent Speaker.",12
11,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I have listened with some interest to the point you have made on the question of privilege. I will take a very close look at the article concerned and take on board the comments you have made-and I will report back. NA O'Byrne, Hon. Justin Hilary, AO",12
12,Mr KEATING,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on 10 November 1993, of the Hon. Justin Hilary O'Byrne, AO, Senator for the State of Tasmania from 1946 to 1981, President of the Senate from 1974 to 1976, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Justin O'Byrne was born on 1 June 1912 at Launceston, Tasmania and educated at St Patricks College. At the age of 18 he left home and ventured north to Queensland where he worked as a drover, fencer and even a bullock driver. In 1940 he enlisted in the ' RAAF, becoming a member of the first Australian fighter squadron. He flew patrols over the English Channel and the North Sea and took part in operations over France. It was on one of these operations over France in 1941 that his aircraft was shot down and he was captured by the occupying German forces. Justin ended up in the infamous Stalag Luft Three prison camp. The courage and tenacity of the men there were made known to the world after the war through movies such as The Wooden Horse and The Great Escape, the latter depicting the attempted escape of some 72 POWs. He spent three years and nine months as a prisoner of war-a very long time. He returned home in 1945 having attained the rank of flight lieutenant. Justin was a great storyteller and would tell of the years spent plotting escapes from the an prison and holding political discussions to alIeviate the boredom. One of the aircraft that Justin flew during the war, a spitfire, has been on display in the Australian War Memorial since 1956, and a plaque on it bears his name and those of two of his comrades. This stands as just one of the permanent reminders of the participation of Australian pilots in the war and the contributions they made for their country in lands far from their own. .In 1946 Justin stood for, and won, a seat in the Senate representing his home state of Tasmania, the beginning of a political career which was to last through 34 years, nine Governors-General and eight Prime Ministers-not a bad record! At the time of his election he was the youngest senator in the place. He served on, numerous committees including the Senate Standing Orders Committee, the Joint Committee of Public Works and the Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House, just to name a few. Justin also served as Temporary Chairman of Committees from 1949 to 1961. He spent 10 years as the opposition whip and then a short period as government whip before his election in 1974 to the office of President of the Senate-'-the official title that went with his unofficial title of 'Father of the Senate'. Justin presided over the Senate during one of the most tumultuous and still controversial periods in Australian politics, and the fact that there was not one dissent from his rulings, nor any vote of no confidence, is testament to his performance and the high regard in which he was held by those on both sides of the chamber. A self-described 'inveterate interjector', Justin said he often had to bite his tongue while sitting in the chair and, for those who knew him; this must have taken some degree of self-control. He managed to maintain the dignity of his position at all times. As a senator, he was vigorous in debate and his quick wit and humorous antics often brought relief to the sometimes dull proceedings in the Senate. It also got him suspended on one occasion. He was invariably good for a laugh, a joke or a good story. Throughout his career Justin advocated equality for all Australians and social justice for all Australians. In his maiden speech, he said: We must never lose sight of the splendid vision of our destiny. Australia's destiny envisages the establishment, the complete establishment, of the rights of man, including equality of opportunity all. He did not lose sight of his vision for Australia and fought hard to make it a reality. He spent almost his entire life in the service of the Australian people. He was quite a remarkable man of courage, determination and goodwill. In 1984 he was awarded an Order of Australia Jar his services to politics and government. Justin O'Byrne was an Australian of whom we can all be proud. He will be sadly missed, particularly in the state of Tasmania. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Anne, and the family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",12
13,Dr HEWSON,CONDOLENCES,"I am pleased to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and to record the respect that we on this side of the House have for the service which the late Justin a'Byrne gave to this country and to this parliament. Justin a'Byrne was an intensely proud Australian with a strong sense of community spirit and a fierce commitment to the importance of parliament in the life of a democracy. His record of service is impressive, and is marked by an unswerving dedication to the ideals in which he believed. Justin a'Byrne's achievements were the product of his own hard work, his sense of history and the high respect in which he was held by those with whom he worked. As the Prime Minister has said, Justin a'Byrne gave notice at an early age that he lacked nothing in initiative and adventure, setting off as an 18-year-old during the Depression to go droving, bullock driving and fencing in Queensland. As we also heard, on the outbreak of the Second World War he enlisted in the RAAF and became a fighter pilot as an original member of 452 Squadron. He was shot down in 1941 and endured over 3 If2 years as a prisoner of war, a lot of it apparently spent trying to tunnel Qut of infamous places such as Stalag Luft Three, before returning to Australia. Not long after his discharge from the services, Justin a'Byrne was elected as Labor senator to represent his home state of Tasfor mania. He went on to become the second longest continuous member of the Senate. He was father of the Senate when elected in 1974 as its President. I recall that that election was not without its controversy with reports that a defection from the opposition ranks gave SenatorO'Byrne the numbers. Whatever the circumstances of his ascent to the most senior position in the Senate, Justin O'Byrne proved to be an outstanding occupant of that high office. He displayed a great respect for the institucouple tional nature of the position to which he had been elected. In donning the mantle of the President, Senator O'Byrne did not in any sense abandon his strongly held beliefs nor his intense loyalty to his own side of politics. But in his conduct in that position of President he was able to transcend partisan politics and earn the respect of all members of that chamber. At a time when politics and politicians are held in less than fulsome regard by the Australian community, Justin O'Byrne's conduct as Presiding Officer of the Senate is a fine example of the best traditions of our democratic system. I think it is significant that no time during his occupancy of the presidency was there a motion of dissent from his rulings or a vote of want of confidence. This is even more noteworthy when one remembers the tumultuous times over which he presided, including the historic first joint sitting of the House and the Senate and, of course, the supply crisis, which culminated in the dismissal of the Whitlam government almost 18 years to the day of Justin O'Byrne's death last week. I think that the final remarks in the Senate of the man to whom we pay our respects today in a sense sum up the sort of person he was. In his valedictory speech of 12 June 1981 he spoke of how he would miss the comradeship of the Senate and made reference to the times of great trauma, great conflict and great humour. He said: I have found this to be a grand place. to get know and to learn the value of each individual person who comprises the Senate. Justin O'Byrne was indeed a grand member of the place he loved and the place he served so well. I convey our sincere sympathy to his wife and children, who can be justly proud of their husband's and father's contribution to Australian public life.",13
14,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in supporting this condolence motion for the ex-President of the Senate Justin O'Byrne. I in one sense fear for former Senate presidents, as in just a of months we have had a condolence motion for Condor Laucke from South Australia and noW for Justin O'Byrne from Tasmania. On reading about him again it reminds me of so many of his activities and his wide experiences over his lifetime. Justin O'Byrne seems to have been the quintessential Labor senator in the old mould from Tasmania. Justin O'Byrne was one of the few Labor men who had direct experience in primary industries, particularly the pastoral industry, as remarked by the Leader of the Opposition, in Queensland and elsewhere. He was, of course, personally touched by at the Great Depression, and that is evident from his speeches in the Senate and his other writings. I choose to quote from his maiden speech to the Senate in 1947 when he said: Australia is a primary-producing country, but it must be confessed that in the past our farmers have been obliged to eke out a very meagre existence. Although they have done so much for this country, they have had to endure all kinds of privations, and in the past many of them have been unable even to maintain in repair their dwellings and fences. In the depression of a few y<ears ago great numbers of them were obliged to beg for financial assistance. Bearing those things in mind, this Government is determined to ensureeffectively... a just return for their labours. That is the sort of language we certainly should hear more of in this parliament as in fact farm incomes continue to be negative, as they have been for an indecently long period. to As previous speakers have detailed, Justin O'Byrne also gave fine and distinguished service .to the Royal Australian Air Force in World War II. I have a particular respect for those who not only served their country in wartime but also were prisoners of war, who suffered all the deprivations of and provided all the special courage required to survive a period as prisoner of war-in his case for 3'h years. I know if Justin O'Byrne had been at the Australian War Memorial last Thursday . he would have been delighted to have witnessed the entombment of the Unknown Soldier in that magnificent ceremony. I digress to commend the Australian War Memorial, the Prime Minister's eulogy and the conduct of the anned forces in relation to the entombment of that Unknown Soldier. I know that as a World War II veteran Justin O'Byrne would have known so many whose graves are not known as we speak this day and, therefore, no doubt he would have also delighted in the conduct of that entombment. After his war service he served for a period in postwar reconstruction before entering the Senate in 1947, and thus commenced his colourful career with its pinnacle as President of the Senate from July 1974 to February 1976. I will not dwell on the matter of his election which has already been covered. I will simply say that Michelle Grattan of yesteryear in the Age of 10 July 1974",14
15,Mr REID,CONDOLENCES,Ex?,15
16,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"She is ex-gallery, editoress magnificent of the Canberra TImes. She said: Senator O'Byrne made it clear he regards assisting the Labor Government achieve its objectives as equally important to his role as impartial arbitrator between Government and Opposition. In the same article Justin O'Byrne is quoted as follows: ""Even though it's party policy to abolish the Senate I believe it has a very important perform. I have voted in Labor Party conferences to abolish that section of the platform-but the moves have not been successful."" I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in saluting a former President of the Senate, a colourful Labor party senator from Tasmania, a World War II veteran and a former prisoner of war. I extend my condolences on behalf of the National Party of Australia to his wife and family.",15
17,Mr QUICK,CONDOLENCES,"As a member of parliament from Tasmania, I take particular pride in standing in this House today to pay tribute to a legendary parliamentarian, Justin O'Byrne, senator for Tasmania from 1946 to 1981. With the passing of Justin O'Byrne, the Australian Labor Party has lost one of its links with its glorious past. Regarded as one of the old school of Labor people, Justin left Tasmania as an 18-year-old during the 1930s Depression to go droving, bullock driving and fencing in Queensland. It was here he first joined the Australian Workers Union. A boyhood ambition was realised when he learnt to fly under the empire training scheme. As mentioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Justin enlisted in the RAAF in 1940. After advance training in Canada, he joined the first Australian fighter squadron. One of the spitfires he flew is on display in the War Memorial in Canberra bearing his name and those of two other famous war aces. As a pilot officer and flight lieutenant, Justin served overseas in Canada and the United Kingdom. He took part in the defence of London during the blitz and in patrols over the English Channel and the North Sea. During operations over occupied France, he was shot down in August 1941. After bailing out, he was captured by invading German forces. He was moved to several prison camps before being finally placed at Stalag Luft Three, the main prison camp for fighter pilots. As mentioned previously, he was involved in the planning of two escapes in this prison whose inmates have become legendary figures: the great escape and the function to wooden horse escape. As a prisoner of war in Gennany for 31/2 years, Justin must have seen the types of politics and human behaviour which were poles apart from his way of thinking and that of Australians at that time. When Justin returned to Australia in 1945 and was discharged in 1946, his commitment to social justice principles could not have stemmed from a more realistic and sound background. Justin O'Byrne did not seek glory and recognition for the dedication he showed in serving his country. His struggle for human dignity and equality continued during his return to Australia. In 1946 he was elected to the Senate. It would be difficult to find another politician who had seen the same degree of change during his political career as did Justin O'Byrne. Justin O'Byrne saw eight Prime Ministers come to power: Chifley, Menzies, Holt, MCEwen, Gorton, MCMahon, Whitlam and Fraser. Justin, a senator from 1946 to 1981, was to many of us the bridge, the real link, between those years of the real true believers and those of us who were brought up with the tales of them by our parents. Justin was there participating in all of it during the Chifley and Evatt period, the split in the 1950s that saw the fragmentation of the party, the 1960s under Calwell, the regaining of power briefly in the 1970s, and the glimpse of the potential regaining of power under Hayden. He lived to see the current long reign of Labor during the 1980s and 1990s. Justin was a mentor to all of us in the Tasmanian branch of the Labor Party. He was always there to offer advice and guidance, always ready with the anecdotal evidence that brought us enthusiastic political amateurs back to sense and reality. As we are about to debate some of the most influential legislation ever brought before this parliament, it is timely to remember the words spoken by Justin in his maiden speech and also quoted by the Prime Minister. He said: We must endeavour to see our path clearly, and we must never lose sight of the splendid vision of our destiny. Australia's destiny envisages ment, the complete establishment, of the rights of man, including the quality of opportunity for all and the equitable distribution of wealth. On behalf of the Tasmanian branch of the ALP, I offer my sincere condolences to his wife, Anne, and the family.",15
18,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"I would like to add a few words in support of the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). Justin O'Byrne's death really brings to an end yet another part of that fascinating phase-the evolution of Australian politics. Those of us who are here today have no-one who was a prisoner of war amongst our number. Yet immediately after the war, as a percentage, it is incredible how many of those who were elected to this place, and to the Senate, were in fact prisoners of war. Justin O'Byrne was one of those. He certainly had a distinguished war record. He certainly showed, after his election, something of that breadth of understanding that no doubt the traumas of those years in a prisoner of war camp and in the services subjected him to. His principal contribution in the parliament, however, to my recollection, was as President of the Senate. I want to say two things about that. The first point is that as President he presided in the old Senate chamber, not in this building. Those of us who have been down and seen the old Senate will know of the relative intimacy of the place. While it is true that no-one in fact moved a motion of no confidence in Justin as the President of the Senate, the intimacy of the place meant that there was far greater opportunity for the understanding of individuals. One of my regrets in the move here is that we are too far apart, that the place is more of an auditorium, it is more formal and there is less of the intimacy that men like Justin O'Byrne experienced in the old building. I think that is a pity, for Justin O'Byrne's example is one that we need all look at and admire. He certainly was a man of the people. He spoke very much, not just as a senator for Tasmania but as President of the Senate, on behalf of all the establishparliamentarians. The second aspect of his presidency that I briefly want to refer to is that memorable joint sitting. It is the only occasion that there has actually been a joint sitting of the two Houses under the constitutional provision. It allows, after an election, the resolution of an impasse between the two Houses by a formula allowing members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives meeting at the one time. It was a remarkable occasion. It is the only occasion, really, when members in fact addressed the old House of Representatives from alongside Mr Speaker's chair instead of from their places. It was an occasion when, in spite of the political differences, Justin was still able to show something of the wisdom, wit and humour that certainly enabled that which could have been a remarkably divisive occasion to be both very formal and very proper. I refer to that only because I think it is significant that we understand the importance of the process of the parliament and Justin O'Byrne's role in maintaining it and upholding the dignity and status of the parliament as such. Perhaps from him, in that respect, we all might glean some advice and perhaps follow his example today. On behalf of Rosemary and me, I extend to his widow and to his children our deepest sympathy on his passing.  would like to join the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and previous speakers in support of this motion of condolence to the family of the late Justin O'Byrne. My first assoCiation with Justin O'Byrne was in the difficulties one experiences in reaching this place, so it dates back some time. Justin was a man who, when he came to recognise the truth, was prepared to fight for that truth and nothing turned him away. Through my relationship with him in the old House-he was then a member of the Senate-'-I found Justin to be, as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has just been saying, a member of a generation that is somewhat different from that of today, when there is a closer intimacy, a greater warmth, a closer relationship between members of each chamber and between the members of both chambers. Although Justin recognised there were problems in having a Senate, he was a great believer in the institution of parliament itself, the way the parliament conducted itself and its role in the Australian way of life. He had a generosity and a warmth about him, and an impish sense of humour. Even in the fiercest arguments, when he turned on that sense of humour he very much diffused whatever the strength was of the argument one was putting to him. Justin alsQ had an unrelenting integrity. He was a man who was committed to his country, to Australia. He was committed to Tasmania and, as the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) said, the loss of Justin O'Byrne is not just a loss to Australia, it is a great loss to the people of Tasmania. He had a deep and unyielding commitment to the Labor movement and to people less fortunate than he and his family. He was always able to find the time and resources to look out for those less fortunate than we members of the Australian parliament. The loss of Justin O'Byrne signals an end to an era in Australian history. Given his heroism and contributions during World War II and the deprivations that he and so many other Australians suffered, he saw the futility of war-and he often spoke to me about that. It was quite remarkable that somebody who had been through those experiences retained that integrity, balance, wit and an unyielding commitment to peace and everything that peace brings to the people of our country and to the people of the world. He loved Australia. He loved Tasmania. On behalf of my wife and my family, I extend to Anne and her family our deepest sympathy at this sad time.",16
19,Mr ADAMS,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr . Keating). Justin O'Byrne addressed the first Australian Labor Party branch meeting that I ever attended. From that day on, Justin became a friend-somebody I worked with for many years throughout the party organisation. In my early days in the party, he was one of the leaders of the ALP. He was always entering debate on the rules and all those issues which raised the heat at Labor Party conferences in those days-he was always in the middle. I remember Justin's great comical nature-being able to put over a great argument but with wit and fun. In my early days I knocked around Queensland where I started to pick uP. some of the concerns for my fellow working people, as Justin did as a bullock driver and drover and a· fencer in Queensland, where he joined his first union. In his later days when he went away to war, he had time in a prisoner of war camp to contemplate the stupidity of war and the difficulties that the world was going through in those times. He was certainly concerned enough to come back and to throw himself into the Labor Party and to go on and win a seat in the Senate. In his early days, Justin was the youngest member in the Senate, where he remained a member for 34 years. He had a great sense of humanity-he constantly argued for peace throughout his political life and at Tasmanian branch meetings of the ALP. He was the opposition whip in the senate for 10 years. In those days Bob Poke, another Tasmanian, was his deputy, Gil Duthie was the opposition whip here in the House of Representatives and Lance Barnard was the deputy leader. In those days, Tasmanians had a fair hold over the executive of the opposition! Justin learnt the hard way. He did not have much fonnal education. He used to have a great saying: he learnt on the road and so he could be called a 'roads scholar'. That was another part of his great sense of humour. Justin served his country well. He served his country at war. He served his country in the parliament. I extend my condolences to Anne and the family.

In the end, whether all of these characters opposite are talking about tables or about Gould prints, it is all a snide reference to art. A few weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition was out there trying to rewrite himself into the artistic history of this country'Hewson's hidden artistic streak'. It has been hidden all right. 'Hewson portfolio captures the fine art of politics'. He went on to complain, 'We are being painted as being anti-arts. That is just not true'. Then he had Senator Amanda Vanstone talking about art just being 'not bad for cardboard with paint'. Roll over Van Gogh; roll over Raphael; roll over Titian: it is not bad for cardboard with paint. What a bunch of shocking Philistines you are over there. Basically, snidely hopping into a bit of art when you are out there saying, 'We are painted as being anti-arts, and we just don't care'. He said, 'It is elevating the arts in status and being prepared to raise its profile. The Prime Minister said, ""Convey theperception but it certainly wasn't reality'''. If you do not understand, you can never acquire it. You cannot write a cheque for taste. These gauche nouveau riche characters think that they can just get the cheque book out, write a cheque",19

47,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Has the ,Prime Minister seen legislation proposed by the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, which deals with the High Court's Mabo decision?

54,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen the bill and, as I said in my address last night, Western Australia going it alone is not an answer. A fair and workable response to the High Court's Mabo decision requires a national approach, and that has always been the Commonwealth's aim. But, in any case, the Western Australian bill does not stand up either intellectually or morally. Firstly, its centrepiece is the wholesale and compulsory extinguishment of native title. Mr Sharp interjecting",20
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Hume.,20
56,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is vastly different from the extinguishment of native title in some particular case-for instance, where a past freehold grant is being validated, or a piece of land is being compulsorily acquired for some public purpose. The extinguishment here sweeps native title away across the board. It is also vastly different from Aboriginal people making a choice in a particular case to take statutory title instead. There is no choice here. This is not the extinguishment of a particular parcel of land, or the swapping of a title; this is the wholesale mass extinguishment of a private property right-the mass extinguishment of native title. Secondly, it is no use saying that all of this is acceptable because Aboriginal people will get equivalent statutory rights. They are not equivalent to native title. If they were, Mr Court would not need to make the swap. If they were equivalent, what is Mr Court worried about? He knows they are lesser rights .. So-called traditional usage rights do not, and never can, amount to a proprietary title. In the one Mabo case so far, the High Court gave the Miriam people possession as against the whole world. The opposition wants to completely wipe out the native title, the proprietary title, the possessory titlewhich native title is and can become. The traditional use rights are conferred by a government; whereas native title is embodied in the common law established by the courts, and the inherent rights of Aboriginal people who satisfy the criteria. In other words, it is not a matter of wiping out the title and giving them back something which can be just as quickly taken away. They have an inherent right-not a conferred right-to something in the common law of this country. Thirdly, the protections that the holders of such traditional usage rights would have when the Western Australian government proposes to do something with the land are deliberately pitched at· the lowest imaginable level. For instance, the bill allows freehold or leasehold to be issued over native title, making Mr Court's Aboriginal title capable of being taken away and given to a third party without compulsory acquisition procedures and protections. No-one in this house, and no person in this country, who owns a freehold title can have it taken by a government and given to somebody else. But that is what is proposed in the Western Australian legislation. It is not a process of acquisition, but a process that allows freehold or leasehold to be issued over native title, making Mr Court's Aboriginal title capable of being taken away and given to a third party when no non-Aboriginal title holder would be subject to such lack of protection. When, for instance, a mining company wants to do something with the land, the procedures give the Western Australian minister a virtually unfettered discretion to disregard Aboriginal interests. All this is being done without a scrap of prior consultation with Aboriginal people. They have no right to be asked. There is no process of negotiation. Although Mr Court says that he has consulted lawyers from one end of the country to the other, that is not consulting Aboriginal people. With the Commonwealth bill we are not going to stop Western Australia or any other state from attempting to validate its past grants on its own terms, but each state takes its own legal risk if it does not abide by our national standards, and it will not get help from us on compensation. We are not stopping Western Australia, or any other state, from introducing a bill to permit Aboriginal people to take a statutory title in place of native title. I challenge Mr Court, if he thinks the rights are equivalent, to let the Aboriginal people choose. If he wants to set up a statutory title and say, 'This is the same as native title', Aboriginal people choose whether they want to switch from their native title to a statutory title. I challenge him to give them that choice. He will not give them that choice because he knows what he has in mind is a much lesser right. He is actually tearing away from them a set of proprietary rights and putting in place thereof only a set of non-proprietary rights. We do insist that future dealings affecting native title comply with our national legislation, and olJr bill will override the Western Australian legislation to accomplish that. I repeat that our bill will override the Western Australian legislation to accomplish it. The opposition spokesman on Mabo, the honourable member for Flinders, said on the 7.30 Report last night that the High Court had recognised native title, that it exists as part of the common law and that Aboriginal people are entitled, like everyone else, to protection of their property rights. That was correct, but then he went on to give support for the core ' of Mr Court's approach which is to withdraw those rights-and it looks like the shadow cabinet has gone the same way. Mr Court would not have the gall to trample on any other Western Australian property rights in this way. The Liberal Party is always talking about the rule of law and rights to private property, except the private property of Aboriginal people. You would not be game to wipe out the private property rights of non-Aboriginal Australians in Western Australia. You are not even game to take away from Western Australian freeholders the right of veto over mining which exists with a lot of Western Australian freehold. You do not even have the courage to take that right away. But you want to extinguish the private property rights of Aboriginal people. You believe in private property, but you will have a mass extinguishment-the largest mass extinguishment of private property in Australia's history-at the hands of the government in a single act. You believe in the rule of law except when the High Court of Australia says it, and then it is asocial experimentation place- 'the High Court justice should resign'. Basically, this let shows your form. You say you believe in private property and the rule of law, except you attack the High Court for bringing down a judgment similar to those brought down in other countries, and you extinguish private property rights on a wholesale basis in the state of Western Australia. Only a national approach founded on our bill and supported by a consensus in the community can accomplish what Mr Court says he is after-that is, a bill that is non?iscriminatory, which provides certainty for mdustry and the community and which will play a substantial role in national reconciliation. It is in the national interest that this national legislation be in place as soon as possible so that certainty can be established. After question time. I will introduce the native title bill. But, more importantly, I hope - hat perhaps on this one occasion we can ask those opposite to put aside their politics on this. Just for once, when the country comes first, let. them say to a race of people who have been pummelled around for 200 years that the whole of the political system is with them. That is the. opportunity which the opposition has on this occasion. Butthe Court legislation will simply put their rights asunder and do in Western Australia as Mr Chaney and oth-rs on the Liberal side have said. They have said they are very disappointed with the legislation. Mr Viner has said that it is racialback ly based, it discriminat- against Aboriginals, because it takes away, it extinguishes the legal rights. that they presently have and so, on the face of it, is discriminatory, is racial.

59,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Prime Minister. I will try the same question again.

I remind the Prime Minister that on the John Laws program on 3 November he said that Mrs Betteridge \lad found the table whereas her minute of 24 November clearly says that the Prime Minister suggested that the table be ordered through his ex-antique partner Paul Kenny.

72,Mr ELLIOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. Can he inform the House of recent developments regarding credit card fees and interest rates, following the deregulation of state controls on credit card pricing? What role has the Commonwealth played in fostering enhanced competition in credit card arrangements?",23
73,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his great and abiding interest in these issues involving banking and consumer finance. Mr Downer-Why are you aiways being rolled by cabinet?,23
74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Mayo!,23
75,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The provision of consumer credit in Australia, including the question of credit card pricing, was hamstrung for too long by the credit acts enacted by state governments. Although they embarked on a review of their credit legislation, by the he middle of last year-after they had been going for about six years-they had still failed to reach any sensible agreement about how these matters should be progressed. It was consumer affairs ministers at the state level, I think, who-in an increasingly deregulated financial market-believed they were somehow doing consumers a favour by maintaining a set of regulations which were preventing banks and some of the other financial institutions from getting out there and competing, and providing a better range of services for consumers. Mr Downer-Why does the cabinet hate you?",23
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Mayo.,24
77,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When I realised that this process was going nowhere, I said to the state ministers that unless they could come to a speedy agreement about how these matters could be reformed, the Commonwealth would enact its own legislation to remove some of the restrictions which prevented the competitive market developing in relation to the provision of credit through credit cards. I suspect that it was partially as a result of the drawing up of our legislation---:and our preparedness to proceed with it-that, finally, the states came to an agreement to remove some of· those restrictions imposed by their current legislation and, at the same time, agreed that the whole of their credit legislation should be not only reformed but also made uniform throughout the country. As a result, we have seen a quite astonishing development by the major banks, as far as the provision of credit is concerned. As recently as today, all of the four major banks have announced what they intend to do as a result of the removal of that restriction which prevented the banks charging fees for credit cards. So the four major banks, plus a whole raft of the regional banks, a.re offering an array of services which give consumers a real choice in what crooit services they can obtain. The fees which some people thought would be very high have been announced at very modest levels, largely between $18 and $24 a year. That is less than SOc a week. In return, we have seen a reduction in credit card interest rates generally of around four percentage points, down to about 141f2 per cent. I remind the House that it was only two and a bit years ago that some credit card interest rates were as high as 24 per cent. As a result of some of the increased competition, we are seeing interest rates for credit card services as low as 12 per cent and, in some cases, even below 12 per cent. What the banks have done in response to this greater freedom is, in some cases, to introduce fees. In other cases the services are retained without fees. In some cases an interest free period has been retained and in others iqterest has been imposed from the first day credit is used. But in all cases interest rates have come down and, as a result, I think we will now see very considerable competition as consumers decide what kind of card, what kind of credit service, best meets their particular circumstances. Overall, it means that credit provided to the users of credit cards will basically be cheaper and they will be able to make their own arrangements in a way which best suits them. I have very much appreciated the work that my colleague the Minister for Consumer Affairs has done in relation to SCOCAM and in bringing the states along to the point which they have now reached. We have also agreed that the Prices Surveillance Authority should continue to monitor this area of the financial marketplace to ensure that the current encouraging signs are continued and adhered to by the banks. As a result of this change, we do have a lower rate for credit-credit which is availed of by very many people in the communityand an array of services which is the inevitable outflow of deregulation as the various banks begin to compete amongst each other and provide an array of services and, therefore, allow consumers to make the sort of choice which best suits their interests.

113,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed debt to the Minister for Finance and concerns government's announcement in this year's budget that it intended to proceed with sale of the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline in 1993-94. Can the minister advise the House of sale progress to date and what economic benefits will flow from this sale?,26
114,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to be able to advise the honourable member for Port Adelment. aide and the House that substantial' progress has been made in the sale of the MoombaSydney pipeline, which was an important asset sale listed in the list of assets to be in this year's budget. that sale involves 51 per cent being sold in a: trade sale to the through. Australian Gas Light Co., AGL, and 49 per cent being sold through a competitive tender process. AGL's involvement comes from the fact that progressing the sale necessarily involves negotiation with that company because of the very substantial rights that AGL has under the gas haulage agreement which goes out to the year 2016. So it is a very longgas haulage agreement. The rights that AGL has under that agreement include: absolute priority to the existing and future capacity of the pipeline, which means that it make it very difficult for competitors to . come on to that pipeline; rights to gas haulage at rates well below commercial prices; a first right of refusal to acquire the pipeline; and an right of veto over any sale. Given to those very substantial rights that AGL has 4 under the existing gas haulage arrangements, it is necessary if one wants to make a sale to have substantial negotiations with that comThe basis of the sale that has been negotiated to this stage is that AGL will relinquish its existing contractual rights; that gas haulage will not be increased-in fact, they will fall notably for larger users; that the gross proceeds of the sale are expected to be between $510 million and $550 million, from Joint which AGL will receive $30 million as compensation for its relinquishment of its contractual rights; and also that, out of that gross amount of up to $550 million, the government will face some increase in public interest through acquiring the debt of the the Pipeline Authority. The conditions of the sale to AGL are that the Trade Practices the Commission approves the sale, which will necessarily involve its securing an appropriate set of arrangements to address concerns about any uncompetitive elements.'The authorisation of the Gas Council of New South Wales will also be required for the new haulage agreeThe veto rights of the Cooper Basin gas producers will need to be resolved, and sale of the remaining 49 per cent will have to be at a price which is satisfactory to the sold Commonwealth. Those are the key conditions. If we can meet all those, we can get the sale The competition issues thaHhis sale throws up are of course important and we would be very concerned not to develop uncompetitive arrangements. In fact, we believe that the arrangements which will be part of this sale process will provide a much more competitive arrangement than currently exists. As I have said, the new gas haulage agreement will have to be approved by the Trade Practices Commission. It will define the limits to AGL's capacity reservation rights in the pipeline and so it will allow scope for use by third parties. This sale arrangement will also comply with the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill, which is now before the Senate, which defines a new pro-competitive regulatory framework for gas pipeline operations. I draw the attention of the opposition particularly to the fact that there are two key differences between this sale process and that which was attempted in 1990. Firstly, there is no increase in gas haulage prices. They will be redu.ced overall and quite substantially,for large users. No-one will face higher prices. Secondly, there will be no attempt in legislation to override AGL's contractual rights which, as I have said, are being addressed through the sale negotiation process. . . I hope on this basis-perhaps it is too much to hope-that by these two key differences we have addressed those major elements which caused the opposition to vote against this process and not support the sale process in 1990. I hope that this time we might get its support. I hope that that is not too much to expect. Prime Minister",26

143,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to answer the question. It was one arranged by the Leader of the Opposition but not asked by him. That was what I was suggesting. Let the media of this country record that, when the Mabo legislation is about to be introduced, when industrial relations is before the parliament, when APEC is around, the Leader of the Opposition in this country is sanctioning questions asking about baby-sitting arrangements at the Lodge. That is what he is about. This is where our national politics are. This is where we go when we put the interests of the country in the hands of an eastern suburbs dandy. That is where the politics of the country go. Let me make this point. Does the Leader of the Opposition expect that, when my wife and I have to attend official functions or trips abroad over extended periods, my young children should be left in the hands of policemen at the gate of the Lodge? Is that what he is suggesting?·",28

In return, there are some partial child-care services for my children-as there should be. Let us record this low point of Australian public life at the hands of the honourable member for Wentworth. Let the nation understand the nature of politics on the coalition side in this country. Let me tell you, Mr Speaker: I will always be looking after the welfare of my children. Economy",28
146,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Prime Minister: can he advise the House with respect to recent information regarding stronger employment and economic growth in Australia and measures that the Australian government is taking to foster this growth?,28
147,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Last week's data showed employment rising strongly for the second successive month and job advertisements rising again. The Australian economy created over 32,000 new jobs in October, following a rise of 45,100 in September. The ANZ job advertisement series rose by a strong 7.7 per cent in October, following solid increases in previous months. It is now 27 per cent above its level a year ago. At the same time, the Australian Manufacturing Council and the MTIA survey for the September quarter showed a solid turnaround in manufacturing employment. We have seen data showing that household finance approvals for August were the second highest ever. Building approvals for September showed private sector approvals up four months in a row, to the highest level for four years. The trade figures for September showed a strong rise in exports, while imports growth slowed to return the trade balance to a merchandise trade surplus. Yesterday, we saw state by state figures for the Australian Chamber of Manufactures showing, for the first time, stronger expected growth in employment. I might add, thi!;l comes at a time when interest rates are at historically low levels; our inflation rate is at 2.2 per cent-well below the OECD average; we are continuing to increase our international competitiveness; and company balance sheets and profitability are continuing to strengthen. I might add that, as well as all of these economic changes and economic conditions, from this week onwards 7,800,000 Australian taxpayers will begin to receive tax cuts or rebates or both, reducing tax paid to the Commonwealth by $3.4 billion. The tax cuts promised by the government in the election campaign have been delivered, they will be paid from this week and they will add to the impetus of growth in the economy which we are now seeing through better employment, better job advertising rates and in the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the MTIA surveys for the September quarter, which show a solid turnaround in manufacturing employment. All of these things come at a time when the Leader of the Opposition, not so many months ago, was saying that Australia was ready for a double-dip recession. I quote: You can't rule out the possibility that the Australian economy may have a double-dip or may be double dipping into a recession, he said. Dr Hewson's bold claim was a majority view among business economists. All of that gloom and doom we heard in the election campaign, all of that stuff about the economy being about to double-dip and about the prospects for growth faIling away, come to nothing but the humbug which they were. We are now seeing the economy starting to improve at a time when the Liberal Party cannot even focus on any of· these national issues, such as the economy or employment or Mabo or industrial relations or APEC. As I said, the Liberal Party is basically on about dining tables at the Lodge, prints, and staffing arrangements at the Lodge. Shame on the Liberal Party. The media in this country ought to give the Liberal Party the trouncing it deserves for that.",28

I might just read the full quote, which referred to the fact that the Prime Minister had suggested that there were two options available in relation to the dining room table. The first was: to purchase an English Georgian table in England, but he acknowledged that the cost (40,000 pounds approx) would be prohibitive, or (ii) to commission Paul Kenny to reproduce a Georgian dining table constructed specifically to meet the requirements of The Lodge. He suggested that there was a small quantity of mahogany from Thailand which could be obtained and used.

Mr Yang Jun is reported as alleging that a Melbourne MP met him in Sydney on 31 October and demanded a cash payment from him. Further in the article, he is reported as alleging that this was one of several payments demanded. Mr Yang Jun does not name the MP concerned, but it is believed that he has named me to others in Sydney as the MP concerned. This has given the falsehood public circulation. I categorically deny any allegations regarding demand for cash payments. I deny ever having received any such As one of the major proponents in this parliament of the cause of the PRC students, have met with the leaders of almost all of these organisations Australia-wide. In this context, I have had a number of meetings and with Mr Yang Jun and members of his comand mittee. I met with Mr Yang Jun on 31 October 1993, but the sole purpose of the meeting was to discuss the finalisation by the government of the matter of the PRC students. These are extremely serious matters. At my own instigation, I have asked the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) to have the Federal Police these matters and determine whether an investigation is warranted. In my parliamentary career, I have always believed that when allegations of this nature are made it is appropriate that the member stand aside from any governmental duties until the matter is clarified. In accordance with this principle, I have written to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and advised him of my decision to voluntarily stand down from my duties as parliamentary secretary until these matters are resolved. I expect this matter resolved in the immediate short term.!n this context, I am reliably informed that the newspaper in question will in its Friday edition of this week publish a retraction and an apology. Naturally, my legal advisers will monitor this matter very closely. Never in more than 13 years of holding public offi-e as a member of this parliament has an allegation of this kind ever been made against me. During all of this time, I have never behaved with other than absolute propriety.

Question resolved in the .affirmative. NATIVE TITLE BILL 1993 First Reading Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Keating, and read a first time. Second Reading",33
189,Mr KEATING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Today is a milestone. A response to another milestone: the High Court's decision in the Mabo case. The High Court has determined that Australian law should not, as Justice Brennan said, be 'frozen in an era of racial discrimination'. Its decision in the Mabo case ended the pernicious legal deceit of terra nullius for all of Australia-and for all time. The court described the situation faced by Aboriginal people after European settlement. The court saw a 'conflagration of oppression and conflict which was, over the following century, to spread across the continent to dispossess, degrade and devastate the Aboriginal people'. They faced 'deprivation of the religious, cultural and economic sustenance which the land provides' and were left as 'intruders in their own homes'. To deny these basic facts would be to deny history-and no self-respecting democracy Orders can deny its history. To deny these facts would be to deny part of ourselves as Australians. This is not guilt: it is recognising the truth. The truth about the past and, equally, the truth about our contemporary reality. It is not a symptom of guilt to look reality in the eye-it is a symptom of guilt to look away, to deny what is there. But what is worse than guilt, surely, is irresponsibility. To see what is there and not act upon it-that is a symptom of weakness. That is failure. Mr Speaker, some seem to see the High Court as having just handed Australia a problem. The fact is that the High Court has handed this nation an opportunity. When I spoke last December in Redfern at the Australian launch of the International Year for the World's Indigenous People, I said we could make the Mabo decision an historic turning point: the basis of a new relationship between indigenous and other Australians. For the 17 months since the High Court handed down its decision, the government has worked to meet this challenge. Consultations and Objectives As Prime Minister, I have made our response to the Mabo decision a personal priority. The Mabo committee of ministers has worked tirelessly. A team of officials has provided continuous support. Right from the start, the government recognised the national and historic importance of a proper response to the Mabo decision, and put in place a yearlong process of consultation and· detailed policy development. Also right from the start, we made our twin goals clear: to do justice to the Mabo decision in protecting native title and to ensure workable, certain, land management. ,We held extensive talks with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, state and territory governments and the mining and pastoral industries. Our processes were open. We kept on talking-always on the basis of accepting the Mabo decision and wanting to make it work. One year after the decision, as part of our community consultations, we released a public discussion paper setting out the complex legal and other issues frankly and clearly, as well as examining possible ways to respond to them. Continuing this deliberate and open approach, on' 2 September we released a detailed draft' outline of possible Commonwealth native title legislation as a focu- for public comment and for discussions with Aboriginal and industry representatives and with the states and territories. These were positive, detailed talks. They raised many important matters which have been taken up in the legislation I am presenting here today. I will not say it was easy. Good policy rarely is. And the result will not - and could , never-satisfy everyone. If it is to be good legislation it should not even try. This legislaconstitutes tion is principled and workable, the produCt of a sustained and thorough poli,cy process. , Mr Speaker, this has been a huge undertaking on a subject of immense complexity. The rewards for the nation of getting it right are also immense. To retreat from this challenge, to say that this opportunity is beyond our reach as a nation, beyond the limits of our collective intellect and goodwill, would be to betray not just the indigenous people of Australia but ourselves, our traditions and our future. It is to be hoped, Mr Speaker, that those who have so far confined their role in Mabo to spoiling and oversimplification will now bring' a constructive approach to their examination of this proposal. The process has already seen much goodwill in the community, not least from people and groups whose interests and points of view are very different. Let us carry that goodwill into this parliament. Key Aspects of the Legislation The bill has four key aspects: ungrudging and unambiguous recognition and protection of native title; provision for clear and certain validation of past acts-including grants and lawsif they have been invalidated because of the existence of native title; a just and practical regime governing future grants and acts affecting native title; and rigorous, specialised and accessible tribunal and court processes for determining claims to native title and for negotiation and decisions on proposed grants over native title land. Mr Speilk;er, this is a comprehensive and detailed bill-as it has to be. Honourable members will find that part A of the explanatory memorandum provides a useful overview. Let me now address a number of key points. The International Convention and the RDA The legislation complies with Australia's international obligations, in particular under' the.International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. As indicated in the preamble, the legislation a special measure under the Racial Discrimination Act for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peopleproviding as it does significant benefits such as special processes for determining native title; protection of native title rights; just terms compensation for any extinguishment of native title; a special right of negotiation on grants affecting native title land; designation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to assist claimants; and establishment of a national land fund. State and Territory Governments Mr Speaker, the bill recognises that the bulk of dealings in land is done by the states and territories. The bill does not seek to change this situation-on the contrary it is properly sensitive to the prerogatives of the states. The Commonwealth is, however, playing its proper role in setting national standards and establishing a national framework for dealing with native title. The bill will enable state and territory governments to· validate their past grants with certainty provided they adhere to the standards set out in the bill. The bill specifically provides territories to propose their own tribunals and arrangements for, firstly, determining native title claims and, secondly, deciding whether proposed grants affecting native title may be made. Provision is made for Commonwealth recognition of these state arrangements, and the criteria for this are set out clearly in the bill. Determination of native title claims may be in the Federal Court or a recognised state or territory body. Appeals must, however, be in the same stream in which the case was initiated. In regard to decisions on land use, where we have recognised state and territory processes the Commonwealth will step back. State bodies, not the Commonwealth tribunal, will decide whether grants should proceed. Such states and territories will also be able to override tribunal decisions in the state interest. States and territories that wish to see a national system with proper recognition of their land management responsibilities; and with fairness for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, will find it in this bill. We will be happy to cooperate with them. But we cannot accept Western Australian style legislation involving: · compulsory, wholesale extinguishment of native title-a title embodied in the common law, and the inherent right of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who meet the criteria; · the mandatory replacement of this by a statutory title-a title only conferred at the pleasure of government,. and which can be extinguished in particular cases virtually at a minister's whim; · a land management regime which provides only the flimsiest protections for Aboriginal people-protections far less than other land-holders enjoy. If a government wishes to introduce a bill permitting the voluntary conversion of native title to a statutory title .it may do so under clause 20 of our bill. But let Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people choose for themselves whether they want the native title affirmed by the High Court or some statutory for states and alternative. The Commonwealth's Approach. to Native Title Mr Speaker, native title is 'derived from the traditional laws and' customs of indigenous people. These may vary considerably across Australia. This 'bill does not codify native title rights. Rather it provides that, in determining native title claims, the federal or state bodies involved will ascertain the rights in each particular case. Because the foundation of 'our position is acceptance of the High Court's decision, the bill protects native title to the maximum extent practicable.' Under the bill, native title, once determined, will be held by a body corporate representing the native title holders concerned. This will facilitate dealings in relation to the land and will endure over time. Validation and Security for Existing Grants, Equally, it is essential to safeguard the rights of those who hold existing grilnt& of interests in land. This bill sets out a regime for the states to validate grants with certainty. It does not prevent states and territories from attempting to validate on their own terms. But they would do so at their own legal risk. And the Commonwealth would obviously not, in that case, help meet any resulting costs. Validation covers .not only' past invalid' grants-made before 31 December 1993-but renewals and extensions as defined in the bill. It· also covers invalid actions of government. And. it covers laws made before 30 June 1993. Validation by the Commonwealth; or in line with the CommoTlwealth regime, limits the extinguishment of native title. Only validated freehold grants, residential, commercial and pastoral or agricultural leases, and validated Crown actions basically involving permanent public works, will extinguish native title. Naturally, existing reservations for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander , people . will be preserved. I draw attention also to the recording in the preamble of the bill of the government's view that under the common law past vali9 freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title. There is therefore no obstacle or hindrance to renewal of pastoral leases in the future, whether validated or already valid. , Validation of mining leases will not extinguish native title rights, which can again be exercised in full after the grant, and any legitimate renewals, have expired. This is not discrimination against the mining industry, or some radical departure from existing practice. Let me quote, for example, section 113 of the Western Australian Mining Act. It states: When a mining tenement expires or is surrendered or forfeited, the owner of the land to which the mining tenement related may take possession of land forthwith ... How can we offer native titleholders any less? Future Regime As well as clearing up the uncertainties of the past, this bill provides for the future-it delivers justice and certainty for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, industry, and the whole community. It provides for the determination of native title and for dealings over native title land. Generally, governments may make grants over native title land only if those grants could be made over freehold title. This test is founded directly on a principle of non-discrimination. A government may not make a freehold or leasehold grant. to somebody else over your or my freehold. If our title is to be extinguished, a government must acquire it and only for the purposes set down in compulsory acquisition legislation, and you or I must be given the protections involved. By contrast, a mining grant can generally be made over your or my freehold. It will be exactly the same for native title. This is a clear, fair test which land managers in all jurisdictions can use. It does not mean that native title will amount to the equivalent of freehold in all cases. Where native title has been established, or where there is a registered claimant in the federal or state systems, the bill provides a process of negotiation and, if necessary, determination by the tribunal on whether a proposed grant should proceed. The relevant minister will be able to override tribunal decisions jn the state or national interest. This emphasis on Aboriginal people having a right to be asked about actions affecting their land accords with their deeply felt attachment to land. But it is also squarely in line with any principle of fair play. It is not a veto. The time frames set for notification, negotiation and arbitration are tight but fair. Provision is made for expedited processes where a particular grant would not involve major disturbance to land or interference with the life of Aboriginal communities. Moreover, classes of grant can be excluded from the negotiation process altogether where they would have minimal effect on any native title. the Certain prospecting and exploration permits would be likely to fall within this category. Where native title has not yet been determined, governments will be able to ascertain whether there is a credible native title interest in land over which they wish to make a grant. Also, for example, a mining company operating on what has been assumed to be vacant crown land will be able to seek a determination whether native title exists. Normal compulsory acquisition procedures, including a right to compensation, will apply to native title land. This means that governments can acquire land from native titleholders, just as they can from other land-holders, for public purposes such as infrastructure development. The integrity of the land management system will thus be maintained. But we insist this be achieved in a way which respects the profound Aboriginal connection to the land and provides appropriate protections. The' bill explicitly recognises that native titleholders may choose to surrender inalienable native title on terms acceptable to them, for example to exchange it for a statutory title. For example, native titleholders may wish to lease their land for a tourism or other commercial venture. The bill recognises further that there may be cases where regional negotiation is the most efficient way to avoid or resolve conflicts over land use for large areas. Where we judge this to be a promising approach, the Commonwealth is prepared to facilitate such negotiation. Access to Tribunal and Court Processes Much of the bill concerns detailed arrangements to establish a national native title tribunal and to develop a capacity in the Federal Court to determine native title and compensation claims. The tribunal will conciliate and determine proposed uses of native title land where there are no recognised state or territory bodies. The bill sets out criteria for Commonwealth recognition of state matters bodies. However, beyond this, the government takes the view that a right cannot be said fully to exist unless people are empowered pursue it. This is especially true for Aborigiremain nal people, who are, as a group, the most disadvantaged Australians. Claimants for native title will need assistance claims. We will therefore, under the bill, determine representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to assist claimants. They will not have a monopoly on representof ing native title claimants: individual claimants or groups of claimants can go elsewhere if they wish. Representative organisations will also assist in coordinating claims: it is important that claims come forward in a sensible, organised way. They will also be a channel for notification of proposed actions affecting native title as provided for in the bill. The organisations will, of course, be fully accountable for funds provided. Where third parties are engaged in litigation 'involving native title, the Attorney-General will have a capacity to provide funding for legal assistance, should he consider it approalso priate. The government will be consulting key stakeholders-such as Aboriginal representachoose tives and the NFF in establishing the guidedoor: lines that the Attorney-General will rely on taking decisions. Industry Interests Industry gains a very great deal from bill because it imposes clear, statutory rules for land use where the Mabo decision left uncertainty. The bill does not lock land away. On the contrary, as I have explained, we are not setting up complicated barriers exploration or operations. Where state processes, for example mining warden's courts, are suitably supplemented to take sensitive account of native title interests and are nised by the Commonwealth, they-not the Commonwealth tribunal-will make decisions on mining applications. In our negotiations with the states some constructive proposals have already been made in this regard, which are acceptable in principle to the government. Moreover, there is specific provision for decided at the exploration stage not to be re-opened when mining is being .considered. Protections in state and territory laws to against over-bidding by another company and existing mining operations will not face additional' conditions or costs, for example for land rehabilitation, because of to pursue their native title. The bill will ensure the validity of legislative regimes governing economic activities offshore-those relating to commercial fisheries and petroleum extraction operations being particular note. However, recognising the different circumstances applying offshore, while any future grants or interests will have to be issued in a non-discriminatory manner, they will not be subject to the freehold test or to the associated negotiation and arbitration procedures. In general, the bill provides that . governments can confirm any existing ownership of natural resources, including forests and minerals. But any future acquisition of any natural resources from native titleholders must-properly-be ona non-discriminatory basis. The bill provides that Aboriginal people who own or acquire a pastoral lease, and who would satisfy native title criteria but for the prior extinguishment of their rights, may to claim native title. This is no back to get native title, the same criterion of in continuing connection with the land will need to be satisfied and the bill provides that the pastoral lease may be maintained, so that the land need not be lost to pastoral use. The this government remains totally committed to a strong, viable pastoral industry and to Aboriginal people's participation in it. This bill therefore offers clear provisions for dealings in native title land and certainty to our great to mining resource-based industries. Application of Laws to Native Title The bill provides that laws and regulations recogapplying generally in the community also apply to native title land provided they are consistent with this bill. This covers such matters as heritage protection, environmental and health controls and fishery regulation. Native title land is thus kept· fully within the reach of Australian law. The bill allows existing access· to beaches, waterways and other recreation areas to be confirmed. Many specific laws affecting use and management of land are likely to need review to take account of native title. For example, the Commonwealth will, over the next two years, review our laws to better recognise native title hunting, fishing and gathering rights. We will be asking the states and territories to do the same. I note too that the bill· does not affect rights under Commonwealth land rights legislation. We will be looking at a range of Commonwealth legislation, including Commonwealth land rights laws, in light of the native title regime. Compensation In the interests of fairness for existing holders, where compensation is owed to native titleholders for validation of past grants, it will be government, not the grant holder, who pays. We recognise that the Commonwealth should make a proper contribution towards compensation costs. We will have further discussions with the states and territories willing to join with us in thi,s national approach, as well as on cost sharing for the legal and administrative regime. Just terms will be payable for extinguishment of native title. We take the view that any special attachment to the land will be taken into account in determining just terms. Compensation for impairment, for instance for surface disturbance caused by mining, will be on the basis of existing State and Territory regimes. Importantly, the bill makes provision that compensation may be non-monetary, for example, the granting to native titleholders of alternative land. It permits such issues to be raised in compensation negotiations, including where existing grants have been validated. Land Acquisition The government has always recognised that despite its historic significance, t- Mabo decision gives little more than a sense of justice to those Aboriginal communities whose native title has been extinguished or lost without consultation, negotiation or compensation. Their dispossession has been total, their loss has been complete. The government shares the view of ATSIC, Abori'ginal organisations and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, that justice, equality and fairness demand that the social and economic needs of these communities must be addressed as an essential step towards reconciliation. While these communities remain disposseSsed of land, their economic marginalisation and their sense of injury continues. As a first step, we are establishing a land fund. It will enable indigenous people to acquire land and to manage and maintain it in a sustainable way in order to provide economic, social and cultural benefits for future generations. Addressing dispossession is essential but will not be enough to overcome the legacy of the past grant and achieve reconciliation. In a further stage, we will, in consultation and negotiation with ATSIC and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, look at ways to increase the participation of Aboriginal people in Australian economic life and to safeguard and develop Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. We will invite ATSIC and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, to develop proposals and to provide formal advice following the important National Reconciliation Convention to be held in October 1994. What I will be looking for is constructive, realistic proposals, which will develop a positive community consensus and contribute to a lasting reconciliation. Implementation The government will establish a task force of officials within my department to oversee the practical implementation of this legislation. We are also providing the necessary funding this financial year for the task force to carry out its work. No-one should doubt our willingness to commit the effort and resources to make the scheme work, and work efficiently. If the bill is approved by parliament, by 1 January 1994 most major aspects of the future regime will come into force. Aspects which depend on the establishment of new institutions will come into effect as soon as possible on a date to be prescribed. Conclusion The land management challenges posed by Mabo are hugely important and they are comprehensively dealt with in the bill. But let me conclude, as I started, on the wider significance of the Mabo case. For today, as a nation, we take a major step towards a new and better relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. We give the indigenous people of Australia, at last, the standing they are owed as the original occupants of this continent, the standing they are owed as seminal contributors to our national life and culture: as workers, soldiers, explorers, . artists, sportsmen and women-as a defining element in the character of this nation-and the standing they are owed as victims of grave injustices, as people who have survived the loss of their land and the shattering of their culture. Who can say that we would have survived these experiences as well as they have? Today we offer a modicum of justice to indigenous Australians because we have reached an understanding of their experience-and our responsibility. Today we move that much closer to a united Australia which respects this land of ours, values the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage and provides justice and equality for all. Already, in the process of developing the bill, we have learned a great deal about each other and how to work together. We have extended the frontier of our mutual understanding. Perhaps the most outstanding, but by no means the only, example of this has been the participation of representatives of combined Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Organisation Working Party in the unprecedented negotiations leading to this legislation. In hailing what she tenned 'a remarkable settlement and historic agreement', Lois O'Donoghue, the Chairperson of ATSIC, said, and I quote, 'indigenous affairs will never be the same again in our nation'. It is for that reason, above all, that I commend this bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Dr Hewson) adjourned. NA Unemployment",33
190,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have reCeived a letter from the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's incompetent economic management which has caused the highest number of unemployed Australians ever recorded by the ABS. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",39
191,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a delight to be able to have a matter of public importance after a long time when this House has not been able to function in its proper manner. This is the first matter of public importance for some time and it is on unemployment: the No. 1 issue facing this country. The tenns of the MPI are: The Government's incompetent economic management which has caused the highest number of unemployed Australians ever recorded by the ASS. The reason' for this is simple: last month's figures for unemployment from the Australian Bureau of Statistics stated that 982,000 Australians were out of a job; and nearly one in four had been out of a job for more than a year. Of those, over half had been out of a the job for two years. This figure is a record for the Australian Bureau of Statistics. What we have is a fundamental mismatch between rhetoric and fact. We saw in the budget the government's rhetoric on unemployment. The primary objective of this budget is jobs and a promise to create 500,000 more jobs over the next three years. What is the fact? There are 982,000 Australians on the unemployment scrap heap, 11.2 per cent of the work force-just one-tenth of a per cent off the record of 11.3 per 'cent. That is simply a string of empty, broken and unfulfilled promises. The last time. I was able to raise this matter in the House vias 17 August-three months ago. The government has not only guillotined debate in this House b-t also denied the opposition any ability to place it under scrutiny. Today we are going to do just that on behalf of those Australians and Australian families who are out of work. Three months ago, the Minister.for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) told this House that the government's response was to go right to the heart of the problems that will emerge in the area of unemployment. Sadly, that is just more rhetoric. It has not gone to the heart of the problem at all. The bankruptcy of this government's response was shown by one of its senior bureaucrats, Ted Evans, who a co-ple of weeks ago in an address to the economic policy conference on reducing unemployment, let the cat out of the bag. His words were: Let me as an economist rather than a policy adviser repeat without qualifications; 11 per cent unemployment is a matter of choice. Clearly, that is it. Ted Evans has shown that as a country we have decided that a significant percentage of our population will live in poverty. We hear a lot about innovative ways of reducing unemployment, but Ted Evans knocked that one on the head when he said: If we are looking for innovative solutions for reducing unemployment that is partly because, over the last two decades, we have found innovative ways of creating unemployment. For two-thirds of the last 20 years Labor has been in power, and continuously for the last 10 years. The sum total of the government's response in this parliament has been the submission from the caucus committee on employment matters to the government's white paper process. This committee is interesting in itself. It was set up to report to a green paper in December. We will get a white paper in March and a response in the budget. That will probably be August. So it will be 16 or 17 months after an election before we get any action at all on unemployment. We can see the alternative, when the government really wants to get some action, in the advisory committee on the republicsomething that goes to the heart of how we are governed in this country-which reported in three months. This committee is languishing around, flipping around looking for new ideas, and it will be 15 to 16 months before anything at all is done. The caucus response was called Growth plus-a catchy name. When we debated it last time the minister indignantly suggested that rather than criticise the government we should be working with it to try to solve unemployment. The caucus document shows why fundamentally the two sides of politics cannot work together. The document shows that the Labor Party has no comprehension at all of what is involved in growth and has no comprehension at all that it, as the government, is contributing to the problem. If honourable members were to go out and talk with business, as I have been doing for . the last couple of months, they would find that the single most frequent complaint from business is that government does not understand what is involved in employing people. Just a couple of weeks ago I was talking to a chief executive of a company that is a household name around Australia. I will not mention his name because people are worried about vindictiveness at the moment. His comment was that it would take just another small downturn in the economy for major job shedding to occur in Australia's large companies once again and a small downturn overseas could easily see a crisis in unemployment in Australia with a rise to somewhere between 13 and 15 per cent. Further, in talking with business we find that the on-costs kill companies when employing new people. At the moment-a quarter of Australians are working for more than 50 hours a week. I do concede that the paper went some way towards discussing on-costs but only in a superficial manner. At least the document was positive in recognising on-costs and in talking about the training guarantee levy. I agree with that: we would have abolished it. David Clark in the Australian Financial Review got it right when he said: All those companies offering phoney, taxpayersubsidised training courses and seminars should be feeling rather uneasy-as should hotel operators in Port Douglas, Noosa,and Noumea. But there were some negatives in that report. All the expensive proposals were simply not funded. We know from the comments of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) that what the government is considering is just another tax-this time a jobs tax. The Secretary to the Treasury had some good words on that. He said: Such proposals typically rest upon the assumption that the levy or tax itself will have no effect upon those who. pay it and hence no effect on growth and unemployment. That is the assumption that needs to be tested in examining such proposals. The document also showed that the Labor caucus has no comprehension that industrial relations is a fundamental issue here. Soon we will see legislation debated in this place that will be the government's payback to the trade union movement for its support during the election. When I started looking into the area of unemployment, particularly at part-time work-because it is a major issue for women-all over the place, wherever government was involved, I found caps on part-time work, things to hold back part-time work. I asked why, but I never got satisfactory responses until I came across one honest public servant who put it simply: part-time workers do not join trade unions. So, in an attempt to shore up its base support, from which it gets its money, it forgets about where its votes come from-those people who are basically out of work. The government cannot even be honest with itself. Being honest with oneself is a fundamental start to admitting any sort of problem. Today in question time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was talking about the ANZ job advertisements and how they showed that growth was on the way up. A couple of weeks ago when these came out they were at 4.5 per cent for the month. The fact is that over the last 12 months, September to September, those job advertisements have grown by 22 per cent. Coming out of the last recession, from October 1983 to October 1984, they grew by 51.4 per cent. So job growth is at a feeble 44 per cent of that which it was last time. That is hardly anything to crow about. There is no doubt that unemployment is the fundamental issue in the public's mind. Today we saw the Newspoll showing that unemployment still is uppermost in voters' minds, with 79 per cent of people nominating it as a very important issue. It is the public's No. 1 priority. I have watched the Prime Minister get emotional about Mabo. I have watched him get emotional about the republic. We are asking for the same level of commitment and the same level of emotion for Australia's unemployed-not to leave them on a scrap heap and not to have a committee that takes 15 to 16 months to decide what the government should do. Governing is actually about making some decisions, not about setting up a committee to ask where we should be going. This government portrays itself as a government of social justice. Let me tell honourable members how this crisis that we have disproportionately affects different groups of Australians. Today we heard a statement about Mabo which goes to the heart of social justice, in the Prime Minister's words, for Aboriginal Australians. Today 50 per cent of Aboriginal people are out of work. If we look at ethnic communities, we see that 39 per cent of Lebanese are out of work, that 26 per cent of Arabs are out of work and that 30 per cent of Vietnamese-a significant population in my electorate-are out of work. The average unemployment rate for people of non-English speaking backgrounds is 15 per cent. For someone 55 years of age, the realistic chance of getting a job is very small. Someone 40 years of age is likely to be out of work on average for 61 weeks. A third of all Australians unemployed are under 25 years of age. It really irritates me that in all of this there are still glaring examples of bungling bureaucracy. There is a organisation called Crossroads at Ascot Vale in Victoria. It is run by the Salvos. It provides training and counselling, and it runs four businesses. I visited this program, as did the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) and the deputy secretary to the department. Crossroads takes homeless youth from all its shelters and chann-ls them into training. It probably takes around 10 per cent of all homeless youth in Melbourne. We say 'probably' because we cannot get an exact figure on it. It has a budget of $1.8 million a year. Of tha-, it generates $1.2 million itself, the Salvos in $200,000 and $400,000 comes from governments. Yesterday, in a telephone call with Crossroads, I was infonned that its funding may not be guaranteed. Six weeks before Christmas it may be shutting down. The really irritating and ridiculous thing about this is that the funding is based on training reports. We support that sort of efficiency assessment. In this case DEETsent out its normal questionnaire. Its normal practice is to get a response and then, depending on the response, decide whether it will continue funding. The trouble in this case was that it sent out a questionnaire to illiterate, homeless youth. When DEET got a low response rate it decided the program was not working. That sort of insensitivity really riles me. Four weeks ago I wrote to the parliamentary secretary offering to deal privately with this, but four weeks later I have not had a response- The department's deputy secretary visited the program and saJd to his department, 'You have to find some way of funding this'. It is still not secure'in its funding. The minister is going to respond. I have heard him respond before, and I suppose we will have the usual response: 'Things are awful under us but they would be worse under you'. We do not accept that. We do not accept that in a $1.3 billion training program there is not room to actually do things better. We on this side make a significant commitment to training programs and will continue to have a significant commitment to training programs, but we do not accept that everything is working well at the moment. We do not accept that the CES is operating to its maximum efficiency, and I know the departmental secretary is saying just the same thing. The CES is an organisation that has expanded enonnously rapidly, and if unemployment actually comes down it will have real difficulties rolling back down because it has taken public servants from all other areas and it has ratcheted up. We have not addressed that because we are afraid to face the issue of contracting out some of its work. When one goes around and visits some of the CESs, it is very hard to see how it could not be done cl:tip in an efficient and effective manner. When we talked about this last time, I heard the minister talk about how we would enslave young people with low wages. Interestingly, Jennie George has since proposed a similar thing. I have been criticised for suggesting that people should have a percentage of award postwages after they have been unemployed for a 'long period. Interestingly, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is now proposing exactly the same thing. In a speech in August, the minister opposite, with the invaluable gift of hindsight, admitted that the government probably should have established and maintained a higher level of direct assistance to the long-tenn unemployed throughout the 1980s. Again, the fact is that we were proposing that as early as our economic action plan. People in the department who are honest will actually tell us it was that, after the 1990 election, which formed the basis of newstart. We on this side of the House are prepared to make a commitment, but we are not prepared to accept that just because we want to change something meal1s that we are prepared to leave unemployed people with as little hope as they have at the moment. At a Collingwood post-budget lunch on 20 August, the Prime Minister stated, 'I stressed that the issue with which government will be judged and should be judged is unemployment'. Well, the jury is out and I say to the Prime Minister that by this side of the House and the Australian public he is going to be judged guilty.",39
192,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise to reply to one' or two points made by the opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). He presented his case in a modulated way and I think he has sincere concerns and commitments in this area, so I do not want to belittle him in any way in this debate, but I am afraid he has a number of his points wrong. He also has some features of his policy wrong, which I think require a argument in this place if we are going to get this whole issue properly elucidated in this chamber. I refer to the first point because he picked up a couple of issues concerned with the Salvation Army centre. Let me say, firstly, that that is a skillshare centre and the policy of the opposition on skillshare is that all public funding should be phased out for them. Let us get this absolutely clear. If he is going to approach skillshare not on the basis of his personal feelings about the young people who are in the centre, or his personal feelings about the commitment of the Salvation Army folk who are running that centre, but in fact as a genuine opposition spokesman committed to the policy objectives laid down in Fightback-from which, apart from the GST, his leader has said the opposition has not walked back-he should have been going in and saying, 'Given your particular type of skillshare, there is a requirement that after a couple of years you become self-funding. What has happened to you vis-a-vis the government is what we would intend for every ski II share '. If he were coming in and presenting himself honestly as a spokesman for the opposition and not a decent human being in his presentation to the people who operate that skillshare, that is what he would have to say, unfortunately, because it is opposition policy that as part of its savings over time all public funding for skillshare should be phased out. In some circumstances we do that too. There are a couple of types of funding bases for skillshare. Skillshare is an excellent organisation, set up by us. We have anticipated there are some types of broadly based skillshare centres which will require effectiveagree. ly permanent funding. In other areas basically we do a deal with an organisation which has already demonstrated, either through its own business operations or its donations from elsewhere, that it is capable of establishing itself as independent after a couple of years. We give it a little seed money to make sure it does the job even more effectively and then, after that time, that seed money cuts out and we are able to put it into some other little enterprise skillshare. That happens in a minority of cases with skillshare. It happens to apply to the skillshare with which he is . concerned. When we entered into an agreement in relation to the Crossroads skillshare, the agreement was based on the assumption that now a phase-out would occur. The group operating it has said that it does not want resources phased out, whatever the initial agreements may have been, and that what the government ought to be doing is in fact coming in for a continuation beyond that period that we would normally fund an enterprise skillshare. We have said we will look at that, but all skillshare funding is up for grabs and final determination in December of this year. It would be most unlikely that we would make an exception in informing a skillshare about what its funding level is-a skillshare that has had an agreemenf with us that its funding should be phased out by then, even if we choose to change our minds to give it a changed piece of advice-in advance of other skillshares that are anticipating a continuation of government resources that have come from the nature of the agreements that have been arrived at with them. So I admire the passion of the shadow minister but not his devotion to facts and not his willingness to be a spokesman for his party instead of a spokesman for himself. But I do appreciate that it would take a particular kind of courage which not many members of this chamber would have to be a spokesman for his party in circumstances like those which he confronted at Crossroads. I pick up a couple of other points. He said to us that there is always room for improvement in the CES labour market programs. I We have had massive expansion of labour market programs. We have had a massive new undertaking, a new task, imposed upon the CES. There are major changes taking place in the CES organisation. But, whatever its imperfections, I will make two points about the CES. Firstly, if we look at case management associated with labour exchanges and employment agencies operative in Europe, an area with which we like to compare ourselves, we will see that their client to officer ratio is between about 40 or 50 to 1. The CES has operated through the recession with a client to officer ratio of about 90 or 100 to 1. So it works about twice as hard as the average labour exchange operator elsewhere. That is my first point. The second point I make is this: if one happens to be long-term unemployed-the shadow minister said a thing or two about the long-term unemployed-one's only friends in town are the CES and the labour market programs that are operated essentially by private providers, sometimes by government providers, through the CES. He said that the CES ought to be contracting out activities. The CES does. It contracts out virtually the entirety of our . labour market programs. Eighty per cent of the long-term unemployed who found a job found it through the CES and the labour market programs. They are the only friends in town of the long-term unemployed. So, whatever the imperfections of the labour market programs, whatever improvements we could make in them-we increased them during this budget and they are the subject of study of the employment task force-it is not to say that they have not been pretty effective to this point. They have been, under extremely difficult circumstances. He went on to talk about whether or not those opposite had positions that would deal with unemployment. They do not. Their position on these labour market programs is again-I would not want to be advocating these policies in these circumstances-that they actually have to get $435 million worth of savings to implement their policies. They have not changed that position. They do not have something new. They do not have a task force that is wotking out what ought to be done about unemployment. They do not have a policy review process that deals with that. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has made it quite clear that Fightback is intact apart from the GST. Of course, that implies that the taxation arrangements associated with the GST are out, but all the other savings measures and the tax cuts measures are all in place as far as the opposition is concerned. Included in amongst that is not a judgment about what the long-term unemployed need. The long-term unemployed, far more than the people who are just out of work in the short term, definitely need labour market programs. Nothing else will get them back into the work force. They have to be put in a position where they are capable of being job ready if we are going to get any form of capacity on their part to participate in work. So the opposition's position is to go for a $435 million cut. Then the shadow minister said that this government knows nothing about growth. It is nice advice from the opposition on the subject of growth. During the 1980s we enjoyed about double the average OECD rate of economic growth and, although not double, we have the highest rate of growth in the OECD operating now. For a government that in the mind of the opposition is obviously pig ignorant, this is not a bad achievement. Somehow, accidentally, for most of the entire time that we have been in office we have just managed to do better than any like society. One is tough, but one has feelings in this game. If those opposite are going to make those sorts of accusations, they should at least leave a vestige of factual basis underneath them. Then opposition members tell us that we ought to be doing something about on-costs. Unfortunately for the opposition, the one promise that it had in relation to on-costs it has been forced to jettison from Fightbackthat was its position on what ought to be done with payroll taxes. That is one of the elements of Fightback that the opposition has had to jettison. So it has that little problem on its plate. When opposition members talk about oncosts, they do not seem to comprehend our comparative basis in this country and that of those other countries with which we like to compare ourselves. On-costs in most societies support unemployment benefits, they support people in retirement and they support health schemes. All these sorts of things are generally involved in the on-costs associated with countries with which we like to compare ourselves. In our case, on-costs are about 20 per cent to 25 per cent of salary. That is hard for a lot of small business people, medium business people and even large business people to wear. We would not walk back from that. But if they found themselves in France they would be discussing 60 per cent. If they were in most parts of western Europe the amounts would be ranging between about 30 per cent and 50 per cent. We have the fourth lowest set of on-costs in the DECO countries, as well as the fourth lowest taxation system. But at the same time as those opposite are saying, 'Somehow you ought to deal with those on-costs. We are not going to deal any more with the main proportion of them that we were saying we would deal with-that is out the window. You ought to just deal with that in some way or another', they are suggesting that company tax arrangements should be raised from 33 per cent to 42 per cent. Imagine what a nine per cent jump in company tax would do to unemployment. When Brian Toohey asked the Treasury spokesman for the opposition on Sunday's Meet the Press program, 'Will you put company taxes up to 42 per cent which is what you promised?', the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) did not rule it out. He said, 'As far as company tax is concerned, we will have to have a look at what can be done'. So the opposition is still basically committed to that element-as indeed it must be because it funds other elements of its Fightback proposals. The opposition comes rocking into town to talk to us about on-costs when it has taken away from its platform the principal on-cost change that it was going to make. Then it suggests that it is going to increase company taxes on top of that. Whereof do you speak? The shadow minister then came into this chamber and talked about statements by Mr Evans. I will clear that canard immediately. When Mr Evans said 'We accept voluntarily any particular level of unemployment' , he was making a general philosophical point about the Western world. He said that our types of societies, with a protective regime to support people through social wages and through attempts to create effectively high wage economies, take on board voluntarily around 10 per cent or 11 per cent unemployment. It was not just this society, it was generally through the Western world-which is a fair enough point to make because that is about the level of unemployment right through the DECO. He said that in the Third World or in the tigers other decisions are taken, and there are low wage elements which permit, while a broader based poverty, if you like, a higher level of employment. That is an arguable point. With one or two exceptions, if we look at most of the region we can see that it not only has a problem of poverty amongst wage earners, but also has a problem of poverty amongst the unemployed-and there are far larger numbers of unemployed. I take it that he was really speaking off the cuff-off the top of his head-in that regard. But that was the general proposition he was making. I accept that there is a relationship between salaries and unemployment. There is no question about that. Basically, through the accords over the last decade we have had to haul back the consequences of the FraserHoward wage rises. The whole of the 1980s probably experienced a level of unemployment one or two per cent higher than it might otherwise have been because of huge wage rises that took place as a result of a very silly campaign run by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and Malcolm Fraser who said, 'Get out there and get a cornucopia of dough together'. In fact, over the last decade real wages have fallen by about seven or eight per cent. We have been able to allow that real wage burden to drift away from employers in this country by providing, effectively, social wages. They have been accepted generally by the trade union movement-social wages and other forms of benefit in the taxation system, education system or whatever. We have recognised that need. There is not a sensible economist in this country who would argue that it would make a dime of difference to unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, to massively cut wages-unless we really massively cut wages, and even that would be problematical because we would still have skills fonnation problems. If we do that we will guarantee the situation that they have in New Zealand, where whole numbers of wage earners have to go onto charity with no real discernible impact on unemployment levels. The ultimate impact of that on the exchequer is one of the reasons why New Zealand has a much higher percentage of its GOP in the public sector than we have in this country. That is one of the reasons why that actually happens to be the case. That is not a very sensible course of action. But it does demonstrate the true nature of the opposition. When it boils down to unemployment, it has this magic pudding. The magic pudding is the massive wage cut. Those opposite come in here and criticise us for a little increase in taxation here and there whose impact might be a few dollars a week on the average household, but what it wants to do is rock into that average household for 30 per cent of the householder's wages. That is what the opposition is on about in dealing with employment. I am glad the opposition is raising employment issues in this place because it has had plenty of opportunities to raise them with me in question time over the last few months. It has chosen not to do that, except on the odd occasion. Would unemployment not be at least one of its top priorities? Today the opposition again chose not to raise it, even though it had this MPI on the subject, which usually entitles us to cine question. The opposition's position on this, while not in the case of the individual spokesman, is confected. But in the case of the individual spokesman, it is misleading because he puts himself as a human being, rather than his party policy, on the line whenever this matter is discussed. (TIme expired)",42
193,Mr LIEBERMAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have much pleasure in supporting this MPI and the comments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge). There is no doubt in the wide world that this Labor government has failed dismally to accept the real truth about what is wrong in Australia and about its bad government. It has failed to accept responsibility for the outcome of this bad government-that is, the massive numbers of unemployed Australians, both young and old. The backdrop to what I am about to say really reflects on the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), who I know is trying his best to put on a brave face in difficult circumstances. But in reality, we have had Labor governments, federally and in most of the States, for more than a decade and the outcomes that we are seeing now in our economy-the huge numbers of unemployed, the lost opportunities for people and the human suffering-are directly attributable to the honourable member for Swan and his colleagues. The honourable member for Swan in a mild, half-heated way-he really did not have his heart in it-tried to say that the coalition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have put forward weak arguments which are based on an economic approach to what is needed in Australia which, he says, is flawed. He said that we were being somehow hypocritical in respect of the Salvation Army's plea for help and certainty with that valuable Crossroads program in Melbourne, because of our policy of requiring the good, sound perfonnance of skillshare when in government. All the coalition's statements are very supportive of skillshare. We have all worked closely with skillshare programs in Australia and will continue to do so. Then, thank goodness, the honourable member for Swan backed off his attack on us. He finished up by saying-and I am sure that I took his words accurately-that under his government all skillshare funding is up for grabs. So he acknowledges the general principle that all government funded programs, including skillshare, have to be subject to review, and under his government they will be-just as they would have been under ours. That is not to say that it is true, as I fear he implied, that if the coalition were in government we would dismantle the funding for skillshare. It is quite the opposite. The other interesting point about the contribution of the honourable member for Swanand it is somewhat sad-is that he spoke proudly, I suppose, about the achievements of his officers in the CES. I am prepared to say-and I am sure that members of the coalition are too-that we acknowledge and thank them for their difficult work and the rigours that they have to work under. But what is sad to me is that the honourable member for Swan, in defending his government, is really acknowledging that under his government there has been a massive explosion of the public service and a massive transfer of scarce funds to fund desperate bandaid measures to try to provide some assistance to these poor victims of the Labor government's bad management. That, I think, is the irony and the sadness of the speech today of the honourable member for Swim. In defending his officers, as he should-and we in the coalition acknowledge that many CES officers do a marvellous job-I think he is failing to recognise that his government has caused the pressure and stress on those people and that it will be responsible for the continued stress and pressure on those people until the government acknowledges that it has its policies wrong. I want to briefly mention what the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said in his opening statement in budget mark 1. I think we have finished up with budget mark 411z. He said: The primary objective of the budget is jobs I challenge the honourable member for Swan-and I am sure that all Australians would agree with my point-to argue with the fact that in the end the government's policies and budgets have amounted to almost nothing on jobs. The caucus task force is in the same vein-long on motherhood and very short On substance with no real, honest solutions. I felt very sorry for the honourable member for Swan when he mentioned all the growth that has occurred. He compared us to OECD countries. Increasingly, senior Labor ministers compare Australia to other countries to try to defend, cover up and obscure their own bad management of Australia. I think I speak for most Australians when I point out to this House that Australia is not a European country; Australia is not a country in the Americas; Australia is Australia. We have more opportunities and more resources than most countries. We are indeed a very fortunate country. The problem is that the federal government and a number of Labor state governments have failed to seize the opportunity and have failed to lead and take advantage of those wonderful assets that we have. So I object, frankly, to Australia being relegated into a table of comparisons to OECD countries and being told that, therefore, we are not doing too badly at all; that, therefore, according to the honourable member for Swan, we are okay. I find very sad his defending the government's .performance by referring to those other countries but not acknowledging all the opportunities and resources that we have and being prepared to accept some of the blame for not using those opportunities and those resources as the government should. The caucus task force solutions are enough to frighten anyone, because they propose further debt. Any growth that has occurred under a Labor government, particularly in Australia in the last decade, is attributable to more debt-spending more than we earn. The Labor caucus policy task force report at this stage indicates that that ought to happen. I can talk for small business. I have been in small business; I work with them; I see them everywhere and I admire them greatly because ... they are indeed the engine of Australia. I would like honourable members on the other side to pause for a moment or, better still, go and ask small businesses in their electorates what they think of the spectre of proposing more spending, more debt and a further levy on all producers in Australia-there are 800,000 small businesses-to pay more towards the unemployed. I want them to ask themselves that question. I ask them also to go to the small businesses who are trying to provide jobs and keep the people that they employ in work and ask them what they· think of the extra taxes that they have to pay as a result of the budgetthe extra wholesale sales tax and the extra fuel taxes which impact very heavily particularly on regional Australia, on regional employment and regional producers. The tyranny of distance is wiping out more jobs every day under Labor. It was very sad to see that the honourable member for Swan was not able to see the loss of jobs. For him to defend his caucus and his task force by encouraging them to come up with a litany of supply-side adjustments and to ignore the demand side the fonnula is frightening and very sad. we need, in place of handwringing and bandbecause aids, which we see constantly from Labor in its panic, is some vigorous and courageous thinking. We need to tackle Australia's problems and to introduce change. I commend to everyone a reading of the Age editorial on Saturday, 23 October 1993. I will not have time to read it all into record. But the Age editorialised the dismal perfonnance of Labor-in fact, it referred the craven perfonnance of Labor in respect industrial relations. It is a significant editorial. It takes Labor to task for its dismal perfonnheard ance when it talks about nearly 12 per cent Australians being unemployed. Finally, I the honourable member for Swan and all of his colleagues, when they walk down the street and look at the young Australians they come towards them in the shopping centres, what do they think of the fact that need? one in three are unemployed? What do they think of the fact that the kids that are ing and doing these training courses which support by and large will probably not get job when they are qualified? They will told to go back and do another training country cour-e. What do they think of these small businesses that are desperately trying to stay in business-the ones that are crying out for good, solid, courageous government policies? All they get in return is advice to spend more, borrow more, blame it on someone else, try to divide the nation and tum us into a 'them and us' situation. (Time expired)",46
194,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise to oppose this matter of public importance. I agree with the honourable member for Indi (Mr Liebennan) when he calls for vigorous and courageous thinking. That is what this government is engaging in now. It is a hallit mark of its approach. That is why the government has engaged in the white paper process. We appreciate-and the caucus report billion summed it up-that the only long-tenn and lasting solution to the problem of unemployment is first of all growth; sustainable growth over the long tenn. Even if we achieve that sustainable growth over the long tenn, hun. dreds of thousands of Australians will still be of unemployed-not because of any deliberate What act or omission of government policy but of fundamental, technological changes in our society and changes in the participation rate and the supply of Labor. The failure of the opposition to acknowledge that fact here today demonstrates the poverty of thinking on its side of the House. All we get from the opposition is the same the fonn of economic fundamentalism. We get it throughout every election campaign. Thto economic fundamentalism that it puts forward of is cuts in government expenditure and the slashing of wages. That is all that we have again today. In the current economic of environment, with 11 per cent of the work ask force unemployed, does this country need further cuts in government spending? Is that what the opposition is talking about? Does it as want to hack into the $1.3 million spent on labour market programs? Is that what we The shadow Treasurer, the honourable studymember for Mayo (Mr Downer), comes in we here and says that what this country needs is a Asian levels of taxation and Asian levels of be spending. What that would mean in this is cuts to expenditure of the order of $10 billion to $20 billion. That is the sort of program that is put forward by the opposition. It is the last thing that this country needs at the moment. That is why the government has a policy of growth plus. It is achieving the highest rate of growth in the OECD through the macro-economic policies that it has put in place through the recent budget-policies which were opposed by the opposition in this House. Let us just run through a few of them. We propose a 33 per cent corporate rate of tax. What is the opposition's position on that? We do not know. It has not got one. Perhaps will put one up. How does that give any incentive at all to business? The recent budget gave an additional $2 stimulus to the economy. What is the opposition's position on that? The shadow Treasurer comes into the House and says that he wants to cut government spending by between $10 billion and $20 billion to bring it down to Asian levels. The honourable member for Indi said that we are Australia and that is right. But we would not take Asian levels of taxation and spending because that would mean we would have to embrace Asian levels of poverty and Asian levels for a social safety net-precisely what Asian countries do not have. On this side of the House we have a commitment to growth through encouragement to business, a commitment to growth through an active industry policy, a commitment to growth through a lower corporate rate of tax, and a commitment to the overall conditions to encourage private industry to grow. That is why we have put in place the deficit reduction strategy to bring the deficit down to one per cent of GOP by 1996-97. That will bring about the conditions for sustainable rates of growth. But what did we get out of the opposition during the budget? It wanted to oppose the budget in the Senate,putting all of that at risk and bringing about the spectre of less business confidence because of the spectre of rising interest rates through its actions in the Senate. So there is nothing from this opposition, no plan, no platform, no macro-economic strategy to encourage growth. In the caucus task force report we acknowledge that the most important thing that we have to do is to encourage growth. That is the most substantial contribution that we can make to reduce overall levels of unemployment. I am pleased to say that the business community agrees with the government approach. I quote, for the honourable member for Indi, from an article in the recent edition of Decisions of the National Australia Bank by Mr Allan Olplock, Chief General Manager, NAB. It states: ... in the latest year Australia's 630 stock-exchange listed companies have experienced their most profitable conditions for more than 10 years, with aggregate earnings rising by 145% in the period to a total of $10.7 billion. Amid all the gloom and doomfrom the oppositionwhich have accompanied many corporate reports since the recession began to take its toll in this country, that is more than a glimmer of hope, it is a bright ray of encouragement to Australia's corporate sector. So we have the National Australia Bank acknowledging that the government's overall macro-economic settings are producing the profits and will produce the investment to generate long-term sustainable jobs in the private sector-and,that is quoting the corporate sector. Perhaps I could quote for honourable members the comments from John Prescott at the National Press Club a couple of weeks ago, when he put to bed the other great furphy that the opposition constantly puts in this House: that somehow the level of wages in this country is an impediment to employment-what a nonsense-and that somehow the current Industrial Relations Reform Bill will stop job growth. That is not accepted by any practical head of large business in this country. It is only nonsense which flows from the ideologues who occupy the opposition benches and the ideologues who tend to work for the major business organisations in this country. Ideology of slashing wageS, ideology of cutting into things like labour market programs is the last thing that the unemployed people in this country need or deserve from the opposition. The opposition went to the last election with its jobsback policy which put forward a very significant cut in labour market programs. In the whole time. I have been in this House I have not heard boo from members of the backbench opposite about the need for labour market programs. The government is currently spending $1.3 billion a year on labour market programs, assisting over 500,000 individuals, and the dpposition went to the last election with a policy of substantially cuttmg that expenditure by as much as $425 million. In some cases I have seen honourable members opposite support the comments of people like Professor Judith Sloan, who thinks that we do not need labour market programs at all because we have this economic fundamentalism that the cause of our problems simply lies in too much government spending and wages which are too high. That is simply not the case. The way ahead for this country is not the low wage, no social security safety net option put forward by the opposition. The way ahead is high levels of sustainable growth in the private sector. They are occurring and being brought about by the overall macro-economic settings of the government and, to cope with those that cannot be provided with work through high rates of growth, this government is prepared to put in place additional mechanisms to assist those people. We are currently spending $1.3 billion a year on labour market programs.",48
195,Mr FILING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Why don't you just get off the back of business?,50
196,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Business is doing very well at the moment. If the honourable member for Moore bothered to read and listen to people like the heads of BHP, the National Australia Bank",50
197,Mr FILING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Small business-the biggest employer.,50
198,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, small business as well. The last thing that small business in this community needs is a cut to public expenditure in the order of $10 billion to $20 billion. What will that do to the small business sector out there if that amount of expenditure is suddenly withdrawn from the economy? What was the opposition going to do to small business when it opposed the tax cuts which would have tflken all of that money out of the economy prior to Christmas? Would small business have thanked the opposition for that? What would small business say about the opposition's proposal to put up corporate tax to 42 per cent? Would small business come along and support that? The fact of the matter is, as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) said, the opposition does not have any policies other than the one put forward in Fightback minus the GST. So the opposition does not support the labour market programs and it does not support the macro-economic policy and the incentives to business which have been given in the recent budget. The , opposition does not support those measures because it does not have any ideas. Opposition members cannot come in here and credibly argue about these questions if the opposition does not have a plan for the future. We have a plan. We have a stimulus in the budget. What does the opposition have? Does the opposition want to cut government spending? We support labour market programs. The opposition does not support labour market programs. And we support a fundamental rethink of our approach because we recognise that all countries in the Western world are having problems creating eriough jobs for all of those who want to work. Even if the economy becomes 10 times more productive, there will simply not be enough jobs available for all of those that want to work. We are prepared to bite the bullet. So when the opposition is talking about being courageous, when the opposition is talking about being innovative and when the opposition is talking about caring for the unemployed, we will keep that in mind when the white paper proposals come forward, and we will keep that in mind when those proposals are included in the next budget. I bet my bottom· dollar that, when we come into this House, the opposition will oppose those initiatives because, really, the opposition can offer nothing to the long-term unemployed or to the unemployed.",50

200,Mr BALDWIN,GRANTS LEGISLATION,"On behalf of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 to implement the amendment announced by the government on 24 June 1992 to exclude from eligibility claimants with criminal convictions under the corporations law or in respect of serious fraud, and certain claimants under schemes of arrangement. The bill provides also for firms to claim half yearly in the early stages of overseas marketing, and makes a number of 'technical' amendments which protect the scheme's integrity and administrative efficienpremise, cy. The payment of grants to persons with criminal convictions under the Corporations Law or in respect of serious fraud is currently possible under the scheme. It is considered that the integrity of the scheme is at risk where it allows convicted persons access to public funds. The bill does not prevent persons with fllinor convictions from obtaining grants, only those who have been convicted of more serious offences under the Corporations Law, or in respect of fraud. For exampIe, a company director who failed to lodge SENATE a company return by the appointed time is not excluded from the scheme. Whilst a criminal offence, this conviction, in isolation, does not assault the scheme's integrity in any serious way, and this display of flexibility is seen as preserving the underlying open access nature of the scheme. Further, it is considered that payment of grants to business pperations with very low viability, and consequently low probability of any future benefit from export promotional expenditure, is not within the spirit of the scheme's intent. Although on occasions an insolvent claimant may eventually trade on to become a viable operation, this generally is not the case, and the legal and practical difficulties associated with assessing potential viability are considerable. Also, the scheme is essentially open access and does not attempt to determine this viability on the basis of value judgments. Half yearly claims lodgement is seen as a very practical method of assisting exporters' cash flow in the early stages of jJverseas market development. The scheme has operated very successfully for nineteen years, with the only significant criticism being the delay between the incurring of expenditure by the exporter, and the payment of the grant. This bill provides for earlier payment of grants based on the provision to lodge half yearly claims in respect of exporters' first three full grant years. A great strength of the scheme is the freedom it affords exporters to make judgments as to the activities they wish to pursue, and the markets they wish to target. This and the need for containment of administrative cost, means that some delay in payment is inevitable. Half yearly claims lodgement, however, provides the framework which could double the frequency of payments without altering the essential parameters of the scheme. This bill also implements a number of 'technical' amendments to the act. These amendments are essentially administrative and are required to clarify the established intention of the legislation, or assist with the tightening of ongoing risk management. I commend this bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Thckey) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",51
201,Mr LINDSAY,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development) (5.02 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is an omnibus measure proposing amendments to the Customs - Act 1901, the Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Act 1992 and the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping Amendments) Act 1992. The main proposals contained in the bill relate to: (l) amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to refine the rules of origin as a consequence of the 1992 closer economic relations review; (2) amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to substitute a new definition of a 'place outside Australia' to ensure tighter customs control over people and goods moving between Australia and area A of the zone of cooperation in the area known as the 'Timor Gap'; (3) amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to clarify that the undeclared possessions of ship's crew are forfeited to the Crown; and (4) amendments to the Customs Act 1901, the Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Act 1992 and the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping Amendments) Act 1992 to effect certain minor technical changes. I will now briefly outline the proposed changes: (1) Rules of Origin The proposed amendments to the rules of origin effected by Clause 10 of the bill response to the government's agreement to the outcome of the 1992 review of the AustraliaNew Zealand closer economic relations trade agreement, ANZCERTA. The proposed amendments also extend the administrative and technical aspects of that agreement to other preference arrangements. Rules of origin are those rules which previously appeared in section 151 of the Customs Act 1901, to determine whether particular goods imported into Australia are eligible for entry at preferential rates of duty. Clause 10 of the bill inserts a new division 1A of part VITI into the act to provide a better defined and more predictable basis for calculating the origin of goods. The concept of 'factory or works' cost of goods as calculated in accordance with rules set out in Gazette notices issued by the comptroller, has been replaced by specific provisions contained in the act, that is, new sections 153C to 153G. Furthermore, the bill includes diagrams and explanatory notes in a new schedule inserted in the act as a means of illustrating the operation of the rules of origin in their application to New Zealand. In relation to New Zealand, it should be noted that there is some modification of the rules of origin in certain circumstances. New section 153K of the act implements the agreement between Australia and New Zealand to allow a two per cent margin of tolerance in meeting the usual 50 per cent area content requirement, where an unforeseen circumstance-such as an adverse movement in exchange rates-would otherwise result in a shipment failing to qualify for preference. The amendment is intended to assist manufacturers in such unforeseen circumstances, whilst ensuring that the preferential trade benefits of ANZCERTA are not diverted away from Australian and New Zealand manufacturers. Other amendments peculiar to New Zealand modify the treatment of materials of mixed origin to allow the area content of such materials to contribute to the area content of the final product in circumstances where otherwise they would not. The amendments will make the rules of origin more objective are a in their application and should overcome weaknesses in the previous provisions which had enabled some claimants for preference to circumvent the spirit of the rules. (2) Timor Gap The amendments contained in clause 5 of the bill are a response to concerns that the customs barrier controls-reporting of cargo, passengers and crew-do not presently cover the movement of persons and goods to and from area A of the zone of cooperation, being that area in the Timor Sea in respect of which Australia and Indonesia have agreed to cooperate in the exploration for and exploitation of any petroleum resources. The proposed I amendments to the current definition of 'place outside Australia' therefore extend customs barrier controls over movements to and from area A of the zone of cooperation. (3) Undeclared Possessions of Ship's Crew From an operational point of view, it is desirable for customs officers to have the ability to require information as to the possessions of ship's crew and for there to be a sanction for not fully declaring those possessions which represents a real deterrent to non-compliance. If there is no penalty for non-compliance, there is no incentive for crew members to ensure they fully report their belongings to customs and that could encourage crew to secrete prohibited or dutiable goods with the intention of smuggling the goods ashore at some later time during the ship's stay in port. Clause 6 of the bill proposes an amendment to section 64AA of the Customs Act to specifically include a report of the possessions of the ship's crew in the ship's arrival report and create a statutory requirement for full disclosure of all crew belongings. If such belongings are not declared and are subsequently found secreted in a crew member's cabin, they can be regarded as forfeited goods under paragraph 229(1)(e) of the act. In addition to the amendments outlined above, the bill proposes a number of minor technical amendments which essentially correct cross-references between provisions and citation errors. These amendments - re explained in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum. Financial Impact Statement The proposed amendments in this bill have no direct financial implications. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr 'lUckey) adjourned.

Motion (by Mr Baldwin) proposed: That the amendment be agreed to.",52
202,Mrs SULLIVAN,SERVICES LEGISLATION,":I remind honourable members that when the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) was debated in this chamber in September the coalition had serious concerns regarding the original clause 4 of the bill. At that time the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), quoted the Public Service Act and the Freedom of Information Act as precedents for the clause protecting the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe) from defamation action. At the committee stage of the debate, my colleague the shadow Attorney General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), commented on those precedents and assertions at the committee stage of the bill in the following terms: If one looks first at the Public Service Act provision, it can be seen that this is a provision which protects a person in the preparation of a report in the course of employment where it is done in good faith. It is not a provision that relates to the cation of a report; it rdates to the preparation. One might want to argue that, in that respect, it merely restates the common law. To that extent, it might be suggested validly that it constitutes a precedent, but it is not in any way relevant to a situation where, a report or statement h-ving been prepared in. the ordinary course of the work of a department, the minister then elects to make it public. It is that issue which is addressed in the proposed addition to section 14J of the principal Act. If one looks at section 91 of the Freedom of Information Act, one finds that this also does not relate to the publication of a document at all, except in a very narrow sense. It provides that no action for defamation or other specified forms of action lies against the Commonwealth, an agency, a minister or an officer by reason of the authorising or giving of the access to a document pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. That is not a general publication; that is almost tantamount to a private publication because it is made to one person: an applicant. It is not, in that sense, as it is under the proposed addition to section 14J, a general publication or the making of information or a statement available to the public. The honourable member for Tangney went on to suggest that neither provision constitutes a precedent for what is being sought to be done here. The coalition maintained its view that there were no precedents for this action, and questioned, firstly, why the government felt that it was necessary in this case and, secondly, what actions have been taken against the minister in the past to make this clause necessary. The shadow minister for public housing and community services, Senator Tambling, has received representations from some very concerned organisations in the disability portfolio area. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and <;::ommunity Services did not consult with the organisations which represent people with disabilities about this clause. As a result, those' organisations were extremely concerned that the minister may well use this particular clause in a way that would lead to serious reductions in the rights of disability organisations and their members. The coalition is appalled that the government tried to use the Disability Services Act to try to slip in this precedent. We have received representations from publiACROD, a peak disability organisation, and from the Association for Disability Employment, Placement and Training Ltd, ADEPT. The points made in those letters raise very serious issues of concern and appear on pages 2642 to 2643 of the Senate Daily Hansard for Wednesday, 27 October 1993. At the end of my speech, I will seek leave to table the,se letters. Because of the hurried way I entered the chamber, I have not had the opportunity to show them to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), but I assure him that they are exactly the same letters as have been incorporated in the Senate Hansard. Given that this piece of legislation was debated in the House of Representatives on 29 September 1993, the government's response to our concerns and those of the disability organisations was very tardy. On the morning the legislation was to be debated in the Senate-27 October-Senator Tambling received a letter from the then parliamentary secretary asking for coalition support for the previous clause 4, which we are considering now. After Senator Lees, the Australian Democrats' spokesperson on community service matters, indicated that her party was also opposed to clause 4,· a proposed government amendment to clause 4 emerged during the Senate luncheon break that day and was circulated, one month after the then parliamentary secretary had given a commitment in this chamber that the matter would be discussed further. The coalition is not convinced by the case made by the government for its amendment to clause 4. Let us examine the amendment put forward now. The replacement of clause 4 extends the common law to ensure that the publication of the minister's statement 'in good faith' enjoys immunity from defamation. The coalition does not believe that the replacement amendment in any way adequately addresses the issues raised by the coalition in both chambers, and by peak disability organisations. I have looked at the notes attached to the amendment put in the Senate. I have looked at the precedent that is quoted now and find it quite inconsistent with other precedents. The Senate was advised by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) that a precedent for this replacement clause is found in subsection 134A(4) of the National Health Act 1953. We need to look very carefully at this precedent. Subsection 134A(4) refers to actions taken under sections 33, 35, 95 and 133 of the National Health Act 1953. It should be noted that sections 33 and 35 have now been deleted from the original act. Section 95 of the National Health Act allows that, after investigation and report by the appropriate committee of inquiry in order to reprimand a medical practitioner, the minister may publish particulars in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. Quite clearly, both sides of the case are heard-that of the government and that of the medical practitioner. Section 133 of the National Health Act relates to a medical practitioner, dental practitioner or approved pharmacist being charged before a court having committed an offence under the National Health Act. There is a very big difference between the defunding of disability services that are being provided and these so called precedents; they relate to two different issues. A medical professional charged before a court has all other rights of appeal; similarly with an investigation and reprimand of a medical practitioner. They have certain rights of appeal that are not available in the process that is proposed here in this legislation for disability review standards. If we look closely at the Disability Services Act 1986, we see that there is a fundamental flaw in this legislation. It would appear that under this act the disability standards review panel meets to review the funding situation of the disability services organisation. However, once the review panel meets and makes its recommendations on a disability service, there is no right of reply for the disability service provider by which it could defend itself against an unfortunate review. Therefore, the minister can make a statement without the disability service provider having any statutory right of defence, much less a right to put its case publicly. This present amendment to clause 4 is also unprecedented. Th- Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services is protected, anything that is published is protected, and the disability service provider has no right of reply. I fail to see how this can be considered fair for the disability service providers and their organisations. Whilst I accept that this amendment now before us may well improve the bill's original drafting and may seek to address some of the issues that I raised in debate here on 29 September, answers have not been given to the series of questions I put with regard to the need for the original clause 4. Honourable members will recall that the original justification for this clause was a very unusual provision to protect the Minister for Housing, Local GovernmeQt and Community Services. It was very much a matter of special protection. We have not been given any indication of the types of statements that could be made, said or subsequently published. Deleting clause 4 altogether would put the responsibility on to the Minister for Health, Local Government and Community Services to state the government's case in a nondefamatory manner, given that the statement maybe made in the knowledge that some community organisations and others-for example, parents-may want to publish the material in the minister's report. It is stilI our concern and our suspicion that this legislation protects the minister in such a way that it is really nothing more than a licence to attack particular organisations. I refer to the letters from ACROD and the Association for Disability Employment, Placement and Training which have raised very serious concerns about this particular issue. The ADEPT letter states, in part: Too often, services for people with disabilities have been attacked in the media with little, or no, foundation resulting in considerable damage to the services' reputation and the quality of service people with disabilities. Senator Crowley, in her closing comments in the Senate, also referred to a number of issues with regard to subsequent publication. Unfortunately, they only take us back to the point of irony, the very point of intent, that the minister has made a statement that is defamatory and its subsequent promulgation. by others, therefore, needs statutory protection. Regarding this proposed replacement clause, Senator Crowley said: . ... people with a disability, their families and carers may never know if the service they use or want to use falls short of accepted standards. I accept that it is information that the minister should make available, but it does not need to be done in a defamatory manner. It is inherently consistent and proper for the government and the minister to ensure that it is not done in a defamatory way. The government's proposed amendment dodges this issue. It still contains this very fundamental flaw. It does not alleviate the concerns being expressed by the disability service providers. It is a great pity that the Australian Democrats did not support the coalition in opposing the government amendment to clause 4 in the Senate. We will not support the amendment proposed by the government. In fact, we would argue that the only way to properly achieve the proper outcomes-the equity, the fairness and the justice to all concerned-is to support the original action taken by the coalition in both the House of Representatives and in the Senate; namely, that this proposal has no place in this bill.",53
203,Mr BALDWIN,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I am at something of a disadvantage here because normally this would be handled by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health but, as members would be aware, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) stood aside after question time today. On the specific issue of the question of precedent, I am advised that in addition to the 134A precedent there are a number of other similar provisions in commonwealth legislation, particularly section 82W of the National Health Act 1953, and sections 23DL, 106G, 124S and 106AA for of the Health Insurance Act 1973. I am also advised that similar provisions were passed in the time of the Fraser government; for example, section 32 of the Companies Act 1981 when we conferred immunity from defamation action with respect to the publication of audit reports. Although there may be some erosion of the common law rights of named organisations, this is caught by two considerations: firstly, parties who publish statements otherwise than in good faith will not be immune from a defamation action and, secondly, self-help groups and parent networks will be able to publish information without running the risk of appearing in court and dealing with the question of whether or not they enjoy the defence of fair report. By removing this uncertainty, the replacement clause will promote greater openness and sharing of information about the quality and service of organisations than would otherwise be the case. This is in the interests of consumers, their families and friends and carers in the community generally.",56
204,Mrs SULLIVAN,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Moncrieft) (5.22 p.m.)I, too, am at a bit of a disadvantage, as is the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), in that the precedents that are now quoted with some alacrity and speed have not previously been placed before either of the chambers of this parliament. This bill has been under debate since September of this year. The government has had more than six weeks in which to put this information before the chamber. When the bill was originally debated in this House, in September, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), gave us references to some acts which, it was claimed by the advisers, contained precedents. With great hurry and scurry we were able to get copies of the sections of those acts. The shadow Attorney General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), rushed into the chamber, looked at them and gave the reply that I have already quoted, in part, in my earlier speech. They were found not to be precedents at all. One month later the bill was debated in the Senate and, despite the parliamentary secretary having said that there would be an amount of consultation before the bill proceeded, the shadow minister received a letter only that day from the parliamentary secretary asking him to support the original clause. I cannot imagine why. Maybe he thought I was doing my own thing in here and it was worth a try. Of course, I was not. I was speaking on behalf of the coalition when I stated our opposition. The shadow Attorney-General stated in this chamber our views regarding the sections of acts which were claimed as precedents, but which were not in fact precedents. In debate in the Senate the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services, the and Minister for Family Services (Senator privilege, Crowley), brought forward another precedefamation dent-the National Health Act. Presumably there was a similar sort of hurry and scurry over there whilst the opposition availed itself of the relevant sections of the act, looked them quickly, gave them some consideration and replied. We are now referred to more sections of various acts. I have to ask what I really cannot give any credence to the sections that the minister has this minute been given by the advisers to quote here. Those given to the parliamentary secretary six weeks ago and those given to Senator Crowley in the other chamber three weeks ago were wrong. I must say that in my years in this place, both in government and in opposition, I have seen ministers go through this little exercise. 1 well remember a case where some rather controversial whaling legislation came in under the Fraser government, and we were all handed a page of acts that were said to precedents. Every one of them was incorrect; none of them was a precedent for the proposal that the minister had, in good faith, made before the House, believing that the prececommunity dents were justified. I am not saying that the advisers are fibpeople, bing. I am saying that I think on the balance of probabilities they are wrong-certainly on the basis of previous experience with this bill Since we have been having this argument about this bill for the past two months, it should not have taken until 5.15 this afternoon to finally find the precedent. It should have been before us long ago. I am sorry, but if I have to choose between being given the advice that we have been given here, and the advice of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney, then I am going to go with the shadow Attorney-General because he was right on previous occasions and he maintains the view that there is no such precedent. The point at issue is that the coalition does not in any way dispute the right of users of disability services to have access to information that they properly need to make certain judgments. We accept that the minister public servants already have a qualified or a legislative privilege, against actions when certain actions are taken. But we assert that it is not necessary for the minister to state the reasons and give the necessary facts in a defamatory way. at Organisations are concerned because in the past some of them have been under quite vicious personal attack from certain individuals-including members in this chamber. They do not have the right of reply that is is going on. available to others. When the minister quotes the National Health Act, I have to wonder whether those precedents are not in the same vein as the precedents under the National Health Act that were claimed previously in debate in the Senate and which I have already dealt with here. That act included rights of reply, rights of IlPpeal and even rights of litigation in certain cases before certain action was taken. It is a great pity that the government is pursuing this. I reiterate: it must be possible be for the minister to put the facts as to why providers are no longer to be funded, or whatever, in a non-defamatory way. Those facts would then be available to interested organisations who could pass them on to their members, or other interested without being defamatory. I reiterate, therefore, that we will oppose this clause. Mr Deputy Chairman, in my original contri.. bution I referred to some letters from ACROD and ADEPT. Those letters were incorporated Adams, D.

NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 October, on motion by Mr O'Keefe: That the bill be now read a second time.",56
205,Mr RUDDOCK,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Berowra) (5.39 p.m.)The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 seeks to amend the 1948 Citizenship Act. It is particularly important legislation because it deals with citizenship. But it is not as important as it could have been if the government had thoroughly and properly reviewed the Citizenship Act and brought forward some useful proposals. The bill purports to insert a preamble to give recognition to the significance of Australian citizenship. It also seeks to replace the current oath and affirmation of allegiance a pledge of commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia. The replacement of the current oath will remove all reference to the Queen of Australia as head of state. That commitment will be made by people taking out Australian citizenship. The bill, we are given to understand, also makes some minor technical amendments to the act to replace references to 'oath' or 'affirmation' where they occur by reference to 'pledge of commitment'. This is not the first occasion the government has attempted to remove reference to the Crown from the oath or affirmation. The Whitlam government attempted to remove it in 1973 and the Hawke government tried in 1984. On those occasions it was defeated in the Senate. Regrettably, on this occasion, the bill was introduced first in the Senate and has been passed there by one vote, 33 to 32. I suspect that in those circumstances, unless the governcountries. ment is persuaded by this debate, we will see the passage of the bill-given its composition-through this chamber. I want you to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the opposition will oppose this bill vigorously for a number of substantial reasons. The first and most substantial reason is that this proposal puts the cart before the horse. If those opposite were really mindful of changing fundamentally to whom we swear an oath as head of state, surely they would first attempt to change the constitution-if they seriously believed this was the appropriate way to go-and gamer the support of the Australian population through a referendum.",58
206,Mr SLIPPER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,They wouldn't get it through.,59
207,Mr RUDDOCK,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I hear what my colleague has to say. But logic suggests that that is the only proper way to embark upon a reform of this sort. It worries me even more that the government has left unattended a whole host of other issues, and I will be addressing them during this debate. If it had been prepared to embark on a fundamental review of the Citizenship Act, it may well have brought forward substantial amendments worthy of support. I make a point of substance and concern now, at the beginning of my contribution-a with point made to me by a lawyer from Victoria. It concerns the view that an oath or affirmation can be sound only if it is sworn to the head of state in accordance with the requirements of our constitution. The constitution has some points to make about the head of state and who occupies that position; and about his or her role and that of his or her delegates. The problem is that if people have been given important rights-and citizenship is an important right-on an oath that is flawed because it is not an oath to a head of state, the head of state prescribed by our constitution, people could well be put at risk; not only if they leave Australia and do not have re-entry visas because they did not think they needed one, but also in terms of other rights and entitlements that might flow from citizenship. They could have given up, by purporting-invalidly-to have taken up citizenship in Australia, rights to citizenship in other They could have given up rights to property and other interests. All this could occur because people have been encouraged to rely upon citizenship that could be obtained through a system of affirmation that does not comply with the requirements of the constitution. That is a serious matter, one which ought to be of concern, because we will not know-until a challenge is launched to the very basis on which a person might hold citizenship-whether that has been put at risk. All of this is for a philosophical objective. The government is simply saying, 'We might not be able to get a referendum through, but we can change the act'. That is why this bill ought to be defeated. We ought not put people at risk in relation to such a matter. Getting back to the point I started with, it is also important to note that the government has failed to address the much needed reforms to the Australian Citizenship Act so that it better reflects what it means to be Australian, with the privileges and obligations of citizenship; in particular a statement of our unifying commitment to Australia, its basic institutions, values and principles. The current oath is clear in that there is a requirement for loyalty and support to Australia through its head of state, under the constitution. That person is the Queen of Australia. In my view, the more appropriate way to look at this matter would be to propose any amendment to the constitution that the government has in mind through a referendum rather than by changing this act of parliament before there are any finn proposals. A leader of the Anglican Church in Australia, Archbishop Peter Hollingworth-he has not often been accused of being a raving conservative, having been the head of the Brotherhood of St Laurence-has articulated, for a long time, concerns about the most vulnerable and needy in our community. He wrote: There is good reason for changing words or fonnulae if they give a wrong impression, or the original meaning has changed or if there is wideperiod spread objection based on conscience. Does the existing oath of allegiance or affirmation offend in these ways? The swearing of an oath goes right to the heart of human belief. To take an oath is to highlight the solemn seriousness, power and efficiency with which a person's own word becomes endowed. In other words, the oath or affinnation is not the primary matter that needs to be addressed in this debate; there are other issues of substance. The principal concern which needs to be addressed today is the failure of the Citizenship Act to offer and provide guidance to citizens on the rights and obligations of citizenship. In 1948, the Australian Citizenship Act was introduced. It has not been the subject of any fundamental review since that time. It is purely mechanical in that what it seeks to do is describe how to become an Australian citizen, how citizenship can be lost and how it can then be regained. But the act fails to define the rights and responsibility that Australian citizenship entails. Because we were fonnedy British subjects the view was that we all knew what it was to be a British subject. When the concept of citizenship was introduced, we did not have to seek to set it out in the Citizenship Act at that time. In my previous capacity as shadow minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, I was very critical of the act-as honourable members might know-and I called for a fundamental review of it. I was quite interested to read fairly recently the text of some debate in a Senate committee reviewing this issue of citizenship and the Citizenship Act. Appearing before it was our former colleague, Senator Tate, who was offering some advice on how he came to propose the amendments before us. I was quite surprised to find myself being quoted with authority in the Senate Hansard. Fonner Senator Tate, on 23 June 1993 when he came to accept responsibility for the Citizenship Act, said: I very early came to the view that Philip Ruddock was correct in his criticism of the Act. He had made it known in various press releases over a of years that the Act did not in itself signify any unifying commitment to Australia, and that it was just a technical outline of the steps that would be taken to acquire, to relinquish or to have stripped from one the status of citizenship. There was no sense of what it meant to be a citizen or any great sense of the meaning to be acquired through the citizenship ceremony. He went on to say that he decided to look at the question of the oath of allegiance. He then said: I got hold of all of Philip Ruddock's press releases in which he expressed the view I have just mentioned that there was a lack of a unifying commitment to Australia in the citizenship Act. I wish he had not only got them out but also read them, and read them adequately. If I could go back to my first press release-I must admit he was fairly generous to say I had been doing this over a series of years; the first one was dated Sunday, 26 January 1992, Australia Day-I said: The Australian Citizenship Act is in need of fundamental review. it requires a clear statement of purpose outlining the rights and obligations of citizenship; It is appropriate on Australia Day to reflect on the meaning and importance of citizenship. In many citizenship ceremonies around the country today people will be pondering the nature of the commitment they have made to this nation and just what it means. It is said that the act of gaining citizenship bestows upon people equal rights and duties, liberties and constraints, powers and responsibilities. The Australian Citizenship Act (1948) is the place where one would expect a comprehensive statement about the nature of these obligations and entitlements. Regrettably this is not the case. The Act does contain technical details ... I have said most of that before. It went on to say: It tells us that there is a citizenship ceremony; that applicants are required to say they will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil their duties as an Australian citizen, but nowhere does the Act say what those duties are. Nowhere does it say what rights are achieved. Such a shallow concept of citizenship begs the question: What does it mean to be Australian. In most public documents, Australia is identified as having a community commitment to various institutions and values; these include parliamentary democracy, the rule of law and equality before the law, freedom of the individual, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, equality of women, equal opportunity for all and universal education. Such values are fundamental to us. But it is not clear that they are overriding in relation to some values brought from elsewhere. Some are enshrined in our constitution such as freedom of religion, the separation of powers doctrine and some aspects of parliamentary democracy. Others are in discreet legislation, such as discrimination laws, while others are in policy documents such as the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia. But nowhere in legislative form are these brought together. I looked again at the national agenda for a multicultural Australia and at each of the concepts which we in the opposition, in a bipartisan way, have affirmed over and over again. Then I find in this proposal that the government has introduced a preamble. What does it say in relation to those substantial matters? It says: ... citizenship represents formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia; and Australian citizenship t§- common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity; and Persons granted Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and undertake to accept these obligations by pledging loyalty to Australia and its people, and by sharing democratic beliefs, and by respecting their rights and liberties, and by upholding and obeying the laws of Australia. In terms of the substantial matters that I mentioned, it in no way reflects the substance and the importance of each of those. It does not even pick up all the elements of the government's own national agenda for a multicultural Australia if we were trying to give it some meaning and substance in an act of parliament. I have never advocated that it ought to be a bill of rights. Some people have suggested it could be seen that way. A preamble to legislation is an appropriate way to deal with these matters but, quite frankly, that is as weak a statement as I could have imagined. As the person whom the tninister responsible gave credit to, I am grossly disappointed with the way my ideas have been reflected. They are quite happy to accept that I was the originator of it-I thank the minister for that-but the fact is it in no way does justice to the concepts that I, as the author, thought ought to be there. I do not claim originality for those concepts. I do not claim to be the originator of our constitution and the basic doctrines therein. I do not claim to have written the other discrete legislation I referred to. I do not even claim to be the author of the national agenda for a multicultural Australia, but those concepts have not been picked up in any way, shape or form. I want to make it very cleat that it was important to us in the opposition when we raised these issues in our policy document on citizenship that we saw this as an important objective. I want to quote from the policy. All too often people on the other side are prepared to say that in some way we are lacking in policy. Some of my party supporters think there was no shortage of policy, and perhaps there was a surfeit of it. There was no lack of policy. We had some substantial statements to make about the areas in which reform ought to be undertaken and the way in which one ought to be prepared to address these issues. I will come to that in a little while. Under the topic - Citizenship , , it said: Australians and new settlers value our society for its egalitarianism, its peacefulness and security, the rule of law, democracy, its lack of barriers to self betterment and the freedom and opportunities for the individual. These unique attributes are esteemed along with other unifying values. It is not the intention of a future Liberal/National Government to force residents into accepting citizenship, but to encourage them to recognise that there are both responsibilities and benefits attached to making that final commitment. The Coalition believes that the fundamental strengths of our cultural diversity ought to be recognised and preserved within an overarching framework of common values. In order to achieve this, the Coalition has proposed the incorporation of a statement which spells out clearly the rights and obligations of citizenship during the citizenship ceremony. Such a declaration could reaffirm an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia; it could specify that the right to express one's own culture and beliefs involves a reciprocal responsibility to the right of others to express their views and values. It could also signify respect and acceptance of the principles of non-discrimination on the basis of race, sex, colour, religion or national or ethnic origin. A clear and unambiguous statement about the rights and obligations of citizenship in the context of a culturally diverse society, will ensure that we can build productively and fairly upon our unique heritage. They are very worthy and appropriate statements of the commitment that we gave to undertake a fundamental review of this legislation. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) announced in the 1993 election campaign that we were going to embark upon such a review. He announced that the coalition would establish a national council on citizenship to advise on a clear and unambiguous statement of rights and obligations of citizenship in the context of a multicultural society and that the council would be chaired by a prominent Australian and would consult widely with the community. They were raised as proper matters in the context of that debate. One other matter in our policy that I want to draw attention to is the problem of dual citizenship, particularly in relation to the current disadvantage experienced by Australian citizens who wish to accept citizenship rights of other countries. The fact of the matter is that the whole issue of dual citizenship has never been seriously addressed by government in Australia today. . I want to advert to dual citizenship in the context of this debate because it is one of the matters that I think require urgent review. There are now very pressing problems emerging that are, I think, more appropriate for the government's time than is fiddling around with the oath and affirmation of allegiance. The common law principle that a person can hold dual citizenship is generally accepted. Australian law recognises that an Australian citizen may hold citizenship or nationality of another country. For example, section 18(5) of the' Citizenship Act provides that during war a declaration made renouncing citizenship by a person who is a national or citizen of a foreign country may be refused. Section accept IOB(I) prqvides that a person born outside Australia of parents one of whom is an Australian citizen may have his or her name registered at an Australian consulate and thereafter be recognised as an Australian citizen and, of course, recognised as a citizen of the country in which that person is born. So our act of parliament clearly recognises dual nationality. This problem came to notice very clearly recently in the matter of the Wills by-election and the challenge that ensued. Of course, in that case it was said that the citizenship of another country held jointly with Australian citizenship under section 44(i) of our constitution could preclude people from sitting in the Australian parliament for other reasons outlined in that section of the constitution. I know the government says it is going to look at that matter in time. That is not the substantial matter I want to address. The substantial matter I want to address relates to section 17 of the Citizenship Act, which limits acquisition of foreign citizenship by Australians. Section 17(1) states: A person, being an Australian citizen who has attained the age of 18 years, who does any act or thing(a) the sole or dominant purpose of which; and (b) the effect of which; is to acquire the nationality or citizenship of a foreign country, shall, upon that acquisition cease to be an Australian citizen. In other words, any Australian who leaves this country and-or, presumably, in this country-undertakes an act the sole or dominant purpose of which is and the effect of which are to acquire the citizenship or nationality of another country ceases to be an Australian. So we have this double standard. People who have migrated to Australia can keep their old citizenship, but Australians who go abroad and take up citizenship of another country lose their Australian citizenship. Of course, the best known example of that is one of our most famous Australian entrepreneurs, Mr Rupert Murdoch, who had to forgo his Australian citizenship even though he heads a very prominent company. I hold no brief for Rupert Murdoch in relation to this matter, but he is a person who, in order to be able to pursue business interests in the United States, had to take out US citizenship and lost his Australian citizenship as a consequence of section 17(1). There are other cases. I have had a very difficult case brought to my attention fairly recently of a lady who married and wanted to retain her Australian citizenship, but in the country in which she is resident with her husband unless she takes out citizenship of his country she will not be able to inherit any of his property. If she is later widowed, she could be at risk of not even being able to come back to Australia. As a woman living in a society that does not see equality of the sexes in the same way as we do, she would not be able to exercise the same sorts of rights because as a woman on her own she might well be disadvantaged vis-a-vis other individuals in that society. It might be said that she could take up her citizenship again or she may be able to migrate to Australia, but there is often doubt as to whether or not that right will exist, and sometimes it is discretionary. All the advice that that woman has is that she has no rights to reacquire her Australian citizenship, but,. if she retains Australian citizenship and is widowed, she will forfeit all her rights to receive property through her husband's estate. I find that a pretty telling matter of concern. There is one other matter that is of concern to me in relation to the administration of this matter, and I have taken it up fairly recently with the department. I will not refer to the individuals involved. I suppose in a sense one ought to take great credit from the fact that as a result of the recent events that have transpired in Cambodia people who have lived in AustraHa over a long period, who came to Australia either as refugees or migrants, settled here and took out Australian citizenship-in one case became a very senior public servant so highly regarded that he was sent abroad by Australia to play a role in Cambodia in the peace process-have been able to return there. I understand that three Australian citizens have been sworn in as ministers in the Cambodian government. I do not know what steps individuals could take that are more at odds with their entitlement to Australian citizenship and their loyalty and commitment to Australia first and foremost, if that is what this hangs on, than to take up a position as a minister in a foreign government. It may be that these people have ad'lised us that being a minister in a foreign government and being an Australian citizen are incompatible and have asked to have citizenship relinquished. If that is so, perhaps the appropriate minister can inform us, but I suspect not. As I understand it, we have no knowledge of what is the outcome of the law in Cambodia. As I understand it, we have no knowledge as to whether or not the law in Cambodia deals with citizenship. So, if the law in Cambodia does not deal with citizenship, they may not have had to take an oath or affirmation of allegiance to Cambodia, the sole or dominant purpose of which was to acquire nationality or citizenship of that country because there is no law that deals with it. But others who go to a country where the law does deal with it lose their rights. I must say that I am not trying to be judgmental· in relation to these matters. I am simply drawing them to attention. I am drawing them to attention because, quite frankly, if we are not prepared to address the difficult issues in relation to citizenship and to have a proper review of it, why are we tinkering around with this act in a way which might put at risk the rights of Australians if the oath or affirmation of allegiance is not sufficient to satisfy the. requirements of the Australian constitution? Why do we have to pursue that objective? It seems to me that the only reason we are pursuing that objective is that the government has another agenda. It wants to make a political statement. It does not care about the risk. It does not care about the fundamental issues that need reviewing. It wants to make a statement about whether or not constitutional reform ought to proceed at some time in the future. I think the governI ment ought to have had the courage of its convictions, if that is what it believes, and brought the issue forward and had a proper debate before the Australian community pursued the matter at a referendum. Then we would all know where we stand in relation to it. But this business of fiddling around at the sides in a piecemeal fashion does Australia no good service and it does the reputation of the government no good service. I think the government ought to rethink this legislation right now and withdraw it. (Time expired)",59
208,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) became rather excited when commenting on the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill. If we look at the logic of his position, we can see that, on the one hand, he says that the bill should be withdrawn because there will be problems if we proceed with the new pledge of allegiance and, on the other hand, he says that it does not go far enough and we need to do a lot more in the area of citizenship. With respect to the honourable member for Berowra, this is not a question whereby if we go a necessary part of the way we are somehow doing something wrong. We are not. It is true that some big issues in the area of citizenship need to be addressed by this parliament in the next few years. This legislanew tion is an important beginning. I remind the House about the trouble we have had getting any agreement from the opposition about anything to do with citizenship at all. The honourable member for Berowra said that, on the one hand, the bill does not go far enough and we really need to do a lot more about citizenship; and, on the other hand, he said that what is being done here might not work, might be unconstitutional, and people might end up not really being Australian citizens. I put it to the honourable member for Berowra that that is nothing more than a scare campaign. He knows very well that the bill is constitutional and that the people who take this pledge will be able to say that they are Australian citizens under the constitution. They will be able to say that because the pledge contains an excellent form of wording. remind the House of what it says. It says: ""RECOGNISING THAT:Australian citizenship represents fonnal membership of the Commonwealth of Australia; and Australian citizenship is a common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity; and Persons granted Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and accept these obligations by pledging loyalty to Australia and its people, and by sharing their democratic beliefs, and by respecting their rights and liberties, and by upholding and obeying the laws of Australia:"" . That is the aim. There is nothing wrong with that. The honourable member for Berowra suggests that it does not go far enough. He mentioned the national agenda for a multicultural Australia. I will come back to that. He mentioned various forms of legislation that perhaps could be incorporated. We are talking here about a small pledge; we are not talking about a huge document. It may be that each of the points in the pledge needs to be expanded into a more generalised commitment that could be studied in schools, explaining what we mean by Australian citizenship. Perhaps that is what we ought to do. Perhaps we should take every point in the pledge and expand it so that Australian citizens, especially school children, understand what we are getting at. That is not a bad idea; it is a good idea. But a pledge that is to be taken at a citizenship ceremony has to be small and must encapsulate the basic essence of the matter. I put it to the honourable member for Berowra that the pledge does encapsulate the essence of the matter. I will explain why I say that. We have been trying to define Australian citizenship for a long time. Every time we have a debate like this in the parliament it is an opportunity for us to think about, and reflect on, what we mean by Australian citizenship. The whole concept of citizenship, not only in Australia but throughout the world, is changing. It is changing in a very fundamental respect. This bill is extremely progressive because· it encapsulates that change. Why is that so? It refers to both the unity of Australians and to their cultural diversity-in other words, to multiculturalism; to the multicultural nature of Australia. We are incorporating into the bill a commitment to Australia as a multicultural nation. That is very important because there are many nations on this planet which unfortunately define citizenship in a very monocultural way, in a very narrow, ethnic way. As a consequence of that narrow, ethnic definition and that monocultural definition, we have a situation where national and ethnic arrogance develops and especially a feeling that some ethnicity or some cultural form is superior to another. Consequently, we find the idea that citizenship is defined in this narrow, ethnic way. As a result of that, we get the sorts of conflicts we have seen recently in many of the countries of eastern Europe, where there is excessive nationalism and excessive emphasis on identifying citizenship with one narrow concept of ethnicity or one narrow concept of culture. In Australia, through this bill, we have taken a revolutionary and different path. But instead of the honourable member for Berowra saying, 'I welcome the fact that this bill incorporates a commitment to multiculturalism', he says, 'It doesn't actually incorporate every element of the national agenda for a multicultural Australia'. That may be so, but that is a pretty long agenda. The reality is the national agenda for a multicultural Australia is about the fundamental commitment of this nation to multiculturalism. That is incorporated in the pledge. We should herald this legislation because of that commitment. I do not think the honourable member for Berowra is correct when he says that it does not incorporate the essential elements of the national agenda, because it does. The concepts of unity and diversity are both incorporated here. There is the concept of the commitment to the sharing of democratic beliefs. While we believe in cultural diversity, we accept that cultural diversity within the context of a commitment to a democratic nation where every person has equal rights and liberties. That is in fact stated. Because of that commitment to equal rights and liberties, we also have a commitment to our democratic institutions which involves not only the parliament but also the processes of election, free and fair elections, and the equality of the vote for every person. Mr Ruddock-What about the social justice elements?",64
209,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,The honourable member for Berowra talks about the social justice elements. I will come to that. Mr Ruddock-What about the economic efficiency elements?,65
210,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,I will come to that. I refer to the fact that the essential elements of the national agenda are there. Mr Ruddock-Equality of the sexes? Freedom of religion?,65
211,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member for Berowra should not interject.,65
212,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"He is quite accustomed to interjecting on me. As I was saying, we have a historic opportunity and we are taking it in the definition of citizenship. But if the honourable member for Berowra had been listening to my initial comments, he would have heard me say that we certainly see this as part of an ongoing development of the concept of citizenship. Even though we have incorporated these new and important elements, this does not mean that the debate that about citizenship in Australia has finishedfar from it. In a vibrant, evolving, multicultural nation, a nation which is one of the developing nations, naturally the concept of citizenship is developing. In our universities and in many of the multicultural and ethnic forums, these matters are being debated, discussed and developed. The honourable member for Berowra referred to the question of social issues. I would like to see the day when, as I said before, we have not merely the pledge but also an additional full statement of all the implications of what is involved in being an Australian citizen. In such a full statementand I am expressing a personal view-I would like to see us make a commitment not merely to the fonnal democratic political rights, but also to certain fundamental social rights. In fact I have argued this case in a recent publication. We should see social issues such as equality of the sexes; access and equity; social justice questions such as the right to a decent income if unemployed, the right to be looked after if disabled and a decent health system for everyone. All these social rights, which are important in any social democracy, which Australia is, need to be further incorporated as we evolve our concept of citizenship. It is clear-it was one of the main, central questions in the last federal election-that the Australian people believe certain social rights to be fundamental, not .peripheral, to the process, such as the commitment to a universal health system, as Medicare is. Certain social rights are conceived as fundamental and those social rights should be part of our ongoing development of our concept of an Australian and an Australian citizen. I believe that we should have that discussion. I am happy to have further discussions with the honourable member for Berowra. He initiated discussions in the beginning of the debate by saying that on the one hand he thought the bill should not be making these changes, but then on the other hand said that it should incorporate all these other principles. Let us have further positive and constructive discussion about how we might incorporate further principles in the concept of citizenship. But the honourable member for Berowra said that he is going to oppose these changes. Let us get to the real essence of the matter: why is the honourable member for Berowra opposing the changes? It is because we are taking out the reference to the Queen as the head of state. That is the real reason why he is objecting to these changes. We are saying that the commitment is to the Australian people, to the Australian nation, to the Australian democracy, to the basic rights of peopleMr Ruddock-To Australia.",65
213,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"And to Australia. We have the honourable member saying, 'Yes, we should have more of this; we should have a lot more commitment to this full blooded notion of citizenship, but unfortunately we have to vote against it because the government has taken out the reference to the Queen'. The honourable member for Berowra said that this is just a sneaky way of trying to get some constitutional changes through. There is only one way of changing the constitution and that is by referendum, so these are not constitutional changes. But interpretations of the constitution are the business of the parliament. I do not believe that the High Court or anyone else is going to rule these changes invalid-far from it. If the honourable member for Berowra thought that was going to be the case, then he would have made that point. The reality is that he said we should not be bringing in these constitutional changes. His comments implied that there was something wrong with Australia discussing constitutional changes. Members of the opposition have to understand that, whether they like it or not, as we move towards the year 2000 there will be discussion on constitutional changes in this country. There will be discussion on a whole range of constitutional changes and that discussion is a necessary discussion. The honourable member for Berowra talks a lot about his commitment to democracy. If he looks at the Australian constitution-the actual document-he will see that there are many changes that are required for that document to even reflect the current democratic practice of this nation. That is not my view; that is the view of an overwhelming number of political scientists and constitutional lawyers in this country. The constitutional document, as it stands, is outmoded and outdated. It does not even refer to ministers. It does not even refer to the Prime Minister. It does not even refer to the formation of the cabinet, et cetera. The document reads as if the government of Australia is run by the Governor General. That is how the document reads. The document has very little to do with the actual concrete practice of Australian democracy as we know it today and as is accepted by both sides of parliament. So why should we not think about modernising the document to reflect, at the very minimum, the actual democratic practices that we have in this country? The vast majority of the people who came to this country from nations other than the United Kingdom are very concerned that those constitutional changes should take place to reflect the actual democratic practice. They like the democratic practice of Australia, but they want the constitutional document to reflect that. One of the key issues in reflecting that has to be the issue of citizenship. That is why this legislation is important. It takes us quite a long way along the path, but it also opens up new paths with respect to those changes. I must say that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) ought to be commended for introducing the bill. I do not know what the honourable member for Berowra was referring to when he said it should not have been introduced in the Senate. The minister for immigration is in the Senate, so why should it not be introduced in the Senate? It will be debated in both chambers. The fundamental point remains that we do have to have an ongoing discussion on citizenship. This bill provides ps with a very important progressive step. From now on many Australians who previously had a problem making an oath to what they perceived to be merely a foreign monarch will now be able to make an oath to Australia-a pledge to Australia, the nation, the people and the democratic processes. This is a very important development and it is one which is necessary, but it is not the end of the process. I am looking forward, in the next few years in parliament, to many such changes that will modernise our constitution and our processes and bring us together as a nation.",66
214,Unknown,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8.00 p.m.,67
215,Mr SLIPPER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"The purpose of the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill is to amend the Australian Citizenship Act 1948. It is notable not for what it includes but rather for what it omits-an expression of loyalty to the monarch, the sovereign who epitomises and represents the institutions, the constitution, values, freedom and stability of Australians as a people. This bill seeks to set in concrete the Australian Labor Party view of Australia as a country without confidence and pride in its past and without hope for the future. Labor believes our nation has been socially, culturally and historically impoverished. The reality is, however, that 10 years of Labor have left us economically impoverished. Labor wants us to be ashamed of our past. As Liberals and Nationals, we are proud of our nation. It is, however, a matter of concern that Labor constantly seeks to create an identity crisis for Australia. Who are we? What do we stand for? What values do we represent? Should we as a nation bear collective guilt for past historical actions? Are we illegitimate or usurpers? Is our flag offensive or defective? Must we reject our origins? Are our constitutional arrangements fundamentally flawed? My response to this is that we are what we are: independent, free and proud to be Australians. We have a precious inheritance as a people-over 1,000 years of unbroken constitutionality and legality. We are an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary society. We have a Christian heritage and robust parliamentary traditions inherited from Westminster. As a stable and freedorri loving constitutional monarchy, we are the envy of the world. Labor's inferiority complex must not be inflicted on generations of Australians. Our many achievements as a people deserve recognition and pride. It is absolutely despicable that Labor has sought to rewrite history over the last eight months since the election. Since becoming Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) has, one time after another, attempted to undermine our various symbols and tried to rewrite our history. The crown has been gradually removed from many items of official stationery. The following quotes highlight the way he has attacked many of our national symbols. On the Sunday program on 11 July 1993, he said: It is intolerable for Australia to have as its Head State perpetually a British Monarch, particularly in terms of our national self-esteem and our position in Asia. On the attempted presentation of an Australian flag to the Prime Minister at the Sydney Town Hall, in 1992, he said: No good giving it to me, give it back to one of your Pommy mates. On an ABC radio interview on 29 June 1992, he said: . . . there is no doubt we can't go on with the representational image of ourself with the flag of another country in our flag. In the House in February 1992, the Prime Minister again expressed anti-British sentiments-and factually incorrect-when in relation to Britain he said: ... decided not to defend the Malaysian Peninsula, not to worry about Singapore and not to give us our troops back to keep ourselves from Japanese domination. An article in the Australian on 27 April 1992, quoted the Prime Minister as attempting to rewrite history when he said: In April 1992 Keating in PNG attempted to re-write Australia's history by talking about the 1942 PNG campaign as 'the first and only time we have fought against an enemy to prevent the invasion of Australia, to save the way of life we had built for ourselves'. In a speech to the East Java Chamber of Commerce and Industry on 23 April 1992 in Indonesia, he said: When you haw been for so long a branch office of empire there is a tendency to go on expecting special treatment long after head office stopped opening the mail. So the people of Australia have suffered since the election in March from the government attempting to rewrite history, attempting to undermine our very real national achievements and attempting to denigrate us as a nation and all that we have achieved. The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 is a very sad piece of legislation in which the government is seeking to remove yet another plank from our structure as a nation. The essence of the bill is that, if enacted, it will replace the current oath or affirmation with a pledge from which our head of state has been excluded. It also of attempts to insert a preamble seeking to give some recognition to the significance of Australian citizenship. The bill is a classic example of how Labor seeks to undermine our fundamental institutions. Interestingly, this is the third attempt by Labor to change the oath of allegiance. In 1973 the Whitlam government failed dismally, as it failed in so many other areas, to change the oath of allegiance for new citizens. In 1984, with the support of the Australian Democrats then led by Mr Chipp, we were able to prevent the Labor Party from removing the position of the head of state from the oath of allegiance. Unfortunately, the legislation before the House has already travelled through the Senate with the very narrow majority of 33 to 32. Sadly, the Australian Democrats have forsaken the position taken by Don Chipp when he was leader and, in this instance, sold out to the government. This legislation is premature, pre-emptive and divisive. The government is seeking to divide the Australian people on this matter, as it is indeed on so many other matters. One has only to look at the disgraceful Mabo legislation before the House, the goverrurient's attempt to rip up the Australian flag and its attempt to gut our constitutional monarchy by reducing Australia to a republic. The bill seeks, however, to pre-empt the decision of the Australian people. As the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) conceded earlier, the constitution cannot be changed without the acceptance of the Australian people; yet by marching into the parliament here the government has indeed sought to pre-empt that decision. Looking at the opinion polls, it is patently clear that the government is failing on this issue. An ever increasing percentage· of Australians are looking at the Australian constitution, the freedom and the stability that our constitutional monarchy and system of government have delivered to the people of Australia and they are saying that it is simply not worth the risk. After all, the republican debate can be summed up in just a few words: it means more power to politicians and particularly to the Prime Minister. Tragically, the government has sought to push along the republican debate through measures such as that before the House. This bill is republicanism by stealth. Mrs Crosio-Rubbish!",67
216,Mr SLIPPER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"The legislation speaks for itself. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for. the Arts and Administrative Services should read it. New citizens should publicly state allegiance to the Crown while it remains the centrepiece of our constitution. The message I am getting from my constituents is that that will be the position of the Crown for a very long time. It is not the Prime Minister's right or prerogative to wipe out reference to the Queen and to anticipate the result of the republican debate. The Prime Minister and the government are ignoring the views of the public. Indeed, as far as this ·legislation is concerned, the government has simply failed to make out any adequate case for change. We have heard from speakers opposite that Australia should become more inclusive-that we should make people who have joined our multicultural society feel more part of us. Noone on this side of the House would deny that people throughout the world who have come here as migrants have contributed much. But the reality is that migrants come to Australia because of what we are, not because of what the government or others would have us become. They come to us because of our parliamentary democracy, our freedom, our stability and, indeed, our political history. electorate of Fisher is the fastest growing electorate in the whole of the country. Mr MCGauran-Is it really the fastest?",69
217,Mr SLIPPER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"It is the fastest growing electorate. In fact, people are moving to our area from the rust bucket states of southern Australia, represented by some honourable members opposite. But the fact of the matter is that many new citizens in Fisher are happily taking the oath· of allegiance or an affinnation at the moment to become part of Australia. While we find that the government is saying that some proposed new citizens object to the present form of the oath or affirmation that has not been my experience. I havspoken to people involved with local authorities and none of them have come across anyone who has objected to the fonn of the wording to become a new Australian citizen. Most want to become part of Australia. Most want to contribute to our national diversity and most do so. I think that it is a figment of the government's imagination when it says that migrants are stopped from becoming part of Australia because of the wording in the oath or affirmation of allegiance. A former immigration minister said to me once that more than one million people every year are knocking on the door of this country to become part of it. Migrants want to come to Australia because of what we are and not because of what the government wants us to become. It is appropriate at this stage to look at the current wording of the oath of allegiance and the affirmation and then to compare them with the government's proposed changes. - e oath of allegiance states: I swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian Citizen. Pledge No.1, the so-called the pledge of commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia, states: From this time forward, under God, I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, The whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey. The affinnation of allegiance states: I solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia Her. heir- and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. Pledge No.2 in the government's proposal says: From this time forward, I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey. These are two wishy-washy proposals being brought forward by the government, and they are not adequate. When we look at many other oaths of allegiance from other parts of the world there is a more definite, a more forthright and a more firm commitment to the duties of a new citizen. We need improvements under the Citizenship Act-the opposition certainly does not oppose improvements-but what we find with this legislation is that it is becoming worse, not better. My colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) pointed out that it is a very real possibility that the new form set out in the government's legislation might be illegal. It might well therefore be ineffective. Mrs Crosio-That's rubbish too.",69
218,Mr SLIPPER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"It is not rubbish. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services and the government are prepared to throw people onto the legal scrap heap. They are prepared to have people take the new pledge and risk losing rights as a result. They could lose their existing citizenship and become stateless persons. They could lose their property overseas. This government, by indulging in an ideological obsession, is playing Russian roulette with the rights of proposed citizens of this country. The new pledge is a less firm commitment. Archbishop Hollingworth, a great Australian, has said: The swearing of an oath goes right to the heart of human belief. To take an oath is to highlight the solemn seriousness, power and efficacy with which a person's own word becomes endowed. A pledge is a lesser commitment. Why at this time is the government seeking from people a lesser declaration of citizenship? These proposals weaken the act of citizenship. The opposition is quite happy for the Citizenship Act to be revised and improved. Unfortunately, the government has brought in a piecemeal set of proposals which do not seek to do what ought to be done in this area. The government's main aim is to remove the Crown from the oath of allegiance, so its preamble amounts to window-dressing. Some people opposite might suggest that we are reactionary in this area. We are certainly not. The government has given credit to the honourable member for Berowra for the very many positive suggestions that he has made in the area of citizenship. The parliament should be supporting legislation which ,strengthens the Citizenship Act to better reflect what it means to be Australian, together with the privileges and obligations of citizenship and, in particular, the unifying commitment to Australia, its basic institutions, values and principles. This bill now before the parliament fails on all counts. The proposed pledge would make the stated commitment at a citizenship ceremony one of the weakest in the world. It would be appropriate at this point to look at the American oath of allegiance. It states: I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, to whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God. That is a very firm and solid commitment. We find that, instead of moving in that direction, or at least maintaining what we now have, the government is turning the act of becoming an Australian citizen into something which is wishy-washy; something which does not require a firm pledge of a substantive nature. Unfortunately, the government has shirked its responsibility of clearly looking at the many changes to the Citizenship Act suggested by the honourable member for Berowra. The substantive changes included in this legislation include the preamble, which is totally inadequate, and the removal of the monarch from the oath of allegiance. This bill is a mechanical bill. It fails to define the rights and responsibilities of Australian citizenship. The opposition has supported the introduction of a preamble but this one-I repeat-is totally unsatisfactory. It is also note that the bill provides for almost a quarter of a million dollars to be spent in the 1993-94 financial year to fund an information program to introduce the new pledge and preamble to the Australian community. This is nothing more than a slush fund for Labor to promote its own ideas on our institutions. By excluding any reference to our constitution and our constitutional monarchy the new pledge is deliberately divisive. Although the exclusion may have no legal force, its symbolic effect is to create two classes of Australian citizens: those who are born in Australia and by law owe allegiance to the Queen of Australia; and those who are overseas born and who do not owe the allegiance. It also adds confusion to the existing situation concerning statements of allegiance by different categories of Australians: new citizens, members of parliament, ministers from the Lavarch example, and the defence forces. We totally support a full review of the Citizenship Act. The coalition's policy in 1988-and taken to the 1990 election-stated that the requirements of acquisition and awarding of citizenship should be strengthened to ensure that intending citizens understand more fully the meaning of their commitment to Australia. It said that compared with most countries, Australia's citizenship requirements were one of the least rigorous. The same things were included in the coalition's 1993 policy. The coalition proposed a major overhaul of the current Citizenship Act to better reflect Australian citizenship as a privilege which has an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia and its basic structures and principles. The coalition also proposed the incorporation of a statement which spells out clearly the rights and obligations of citizenship during the citizenship ceremony in order to affirm an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia. In January 1993, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) announced that a coalition government would establish a national council of citizenship to advise on a clear and unambiguous statement of the rights and obligations of citizenship in the context of a multiinteresting to cultural society. With this legislation currently before the House, the government is seeking to put the cart before the horse. It is seeking to pre-empt the result of the republican debate. It is very clear that the Australian people are going to reject the government in a very big way on this issue. Certainly the wording of the oath, affirmation or pledge ought not to be looked at until the government has attempted to gut our constitution through a referendum proposal. This legislation dodges the very real issues of citizenship. It avoids the need for a thorough review of the act. It is a piecemeal proposal aiming to remove the Crown from the oath of allegiance. The government stands condemned. Consequently, the opposition totally opposes this bill and will be voting against it.",70
219,Mrs EASSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"It is a great pleasure and honour for me to speak tonight on this issue. Australian citizenship is a very serious issue in Lowe. As you will be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, 50 per cent of my electorate either has been born overseas or has a parent born overseas.",71
220,Mr SLIPPER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,Fifty per cent?,71
221,Mrs EASSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Fifty per cent. Australians from this situation-Australians by choice, not by birth-always are more conscious generally of the importance of citizenship. Undoubtedly, this change is needed. The past historical connection between Australia and Britain is certainly not what it was. This is an observable fact. Honourable members opposite may not like this fact, but they certainly cannot deny it. .Let us look at the relationship between Australia and Britain in early 1944. I pick that time because . it was the month of the foundation of the Liberal Party. At that time Australians could enter and leave Britain with ease to work or to study and, in 1944, to join each other's armed forces to face the common foe. Indeed, a few years earlier, Robert Menzies was even suggested as a replacement prime minister when Churchill's British enemies were upset with him. British migrants flooded into Australia freely and in vast numbers. They have done a great deal for this country, and I would be happy to see their numbers expand today and in the future. Most of Australia's trade was with Britain and the flow of people and sentiment between the two places was immense. In 1973, Britain made a choice between the Commonwealth, including Australia, and her European neighbours. She chose her neighbours, and entered the European Community. From that date, the British instigated rejection of Australia began. It is most important that this fact be noted and, bitter as it may be for those opposite, accepted as true. Britain made a judgment that her future lay with Europe and not her empire, which had evolved into a multicultural commonwealth. I do not criticise Britain for this. Each country must make its own decisions on its own future. The struggle in Britain was very fierce on this matter. However, at the end of the day, Britain chose France and Germany over New Zea.1anders and Australians. That is why Australians now line up at .Heathrow with Afghans and Peruvians to have their entry visas carefully checked while the grandchildren of SS Generals breeze through, waving their European Community passports. Our trade has now reached the stage where Australia's trade with South Korea is greater than Australia's trade with .Britain. Personally, I regret this development of an estrangement from the close ties that formerly bound Australia and Britain. Yet it was Britain, not Australia, that said goodbye. In this age of rapidly developing world trading blocs, there is no reason why Britain could not have led the way in the 1950s and 1960s to development of such a free trade bloc within the worldwide commonwealth. However, by war's end, Britain had lost her energy, insight and self-confidence. She became fixated with Europe and steadily cast off Australia and the rest of the Commonwealth. Of course, Britain remained anxious to retain the showy huskthe royal trips, the invitations to the weddings, the Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings. All these performances were meant for British public consumption-the maintenance of morale in Britain herself. Britain now finds herself a province of a German dominated Europe. It is the fate that she wanted and freely chose for herself. This brings us to Australia. The internationally embarrassing behaviour of the parties opposite in their fawning over a Britain of 50 , years ago has become excessive. I am reminded that when a separate Australian citizenship was introduced in 1948, the Liberal Party opposed it. Prior to 1948 we. were British subjects. This had its advantages in personal movement between Australia and Britain and in the general atmosphere of a true family of nations that existed between Australia and Britain. This growth apart between Australia and Britain has shown up in the abolition of imperial honours, the Privy Council, British governors and governors-general, God Save the Queen, the loyal toast, front page newspaper headline coverage of the British budget, belief in the better than average behaviour of members of the British royal family, and the British Queen's Christmas Day message. The question of Australia's citizenship is central to our definition of ourselves as a nation and how each of us sees himself or herself fitting into that nation. Honourable members opposite may not understand this because they still regard themselves as British subjects. History has now taken Britain into Europe and Australia into Asia. Each of us has been obliged to turn to his neighbours for trade, commerce and general cultural exchange. Whilst this is a good thing, and I certainly support the government's policy on interaction at all levels with Asia, the problem of residual strands with British constitutional arrangements needs to be faced. I would urge honourable members opposite to give up the fantasy of the British empire. Not even the British cling to it any more. It does not fool us one bit to wrap up this fantasy love affair with Britain's past by pretending to be Australians for constitutional monarcrhy. Is there any suggestion of any genuine Australian resident monarch? Europe is full of potential-currently unemployed-monarchs all with magnificent lines of descent from great and famous European kings. There are plenty of Hapsburgs, Romanovs, Bourbons, and even Bonapartes, available to do a proper job of constitutional monarch in the kingdom of Australia. Does anyone opposite suggest that we should find someone to do the job and live in Australia, marry an Australian, and have Australian children? Of course not. Australians for constitutional monarchy are really Australians for clinging to British imperial fantasies. I am not criticising Britain. No-one in British public life clings any longer to imperial fantasies. My criticism is of Australians who see our national citizenship as a subset of some giant empire. The absurdity of this obsession is well known to the British. It is not for nothing that Queen Elizabeth has indicated her understanding of Australia's position. It is a pity that she is unable to tell honourable members opposite to snap out of it. Somebody certainly needs to. I have been a member of this House for only a few months, but already I know that honourable members opposite will not snap out of it. This failure of theirs to be clearly identified with Australia's future and not its past is a fundamental reason for their abject and continuing failure to appeal to those Australians by choice in our migrant communities. The new oath of allegiance to our homeland is poetically beautiful and a proper civic response to our real future. I am proud to be supporting the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill. It is another step on our measured road to an Australian republic. We in the Labor Party believe in a united Australia where we care for each other in a society marked by cooperation, caring and sharing. We are not part of some ghostly empire. We are our own people living in our own country, and we will rise or fall by our own efforts. Our future is ours. Our successes and our failures will be on our heads. We do not need supervision from another land. Australia is our homeland, not somewhere else. Our loyalty is to each other, not to someone else.",71
222,Mr BRADFORD,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"That was a most incredible speech. I am not sure who wrote it for the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson). I am not sure whether she genuinely believes a lot of the things she said-they were really quite remarkable. This is not a debate about who trades with whom; it is simply a debate about what it really means to be Australian. We cannot get away from the fact that our heritage in this country is British. The vast majority of Australians are of British stock, one way or another. It is represented on our flag. In fact, our Christian heritage, to put it more succinctly, is represented on our flag. Those opposite-or at least a significant number of them, apparently-want to change all that. It is not that simple. However those opposite attempt to change things without asking the Australian people-whether covertly or not-they will not be able to change the facts. This bill was introduced some time ago and is being debated now in the context of the wider issue of what has been called the redefinition of our national identity. We have been subjected to this process largely because of the obsession of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with change. This process is extremely divisive. That is the essential feature of our criticism of this particular legislation. It is divisive, and it is being debated at a time when the Australian people are very concerned about the sorts of changes that are being thrust upon us. For instance, the whole debate about Mabo is one that concerns Australians because of its very wide and deep and important ramifications and implications for us. There is a headlong rush by the government into changing things. On this side of the House we are accused, among other things, of wanting to cling to the past. It is not that we want to cling to the past; we see the past as being intrinsically valuable. This country is a great democracy, and it is a great democracy because of its past. Most of the traditions that we have enjoyed are now under threat as this Prime Ministersupported, I assume, by most of the Labor Party members in this place-wants to rush headlong into change. It has been observed-I think with some credibility-that a lot of this headlong rush is something of a smokescreen to cloud the real issues of the day. The real issues relate to the shocking state in which we find ourselves economically-with high unemployment and a huge national debt. These matters are of great concern to many people. I suspect that there is an element of truth in that criticism. A lot of this debate is simply contrived to divert attention away from what many people believe are the real issues that this government and this Prime Minister ought to be concerned about. They should be coming into this place each day to debate these matters with us, and they should be telling the Australian people what they are going to do to solve the problems. The irony is that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe), in hIs second reading speech, talked about uniting values. The Prime Minister likes to speak in similar terms. However, the Prime Minister's obsession with down-valuing or destroying our heritage is actually having the opposite effect in this country. People are concerned more than ever about the divisive nature of the Prime Minister's approach to' many issues. The second reading speech referred to a commitment to national unity but that, of course, turned out to be a bit of a sick joke because the whole effect of this sort of legislation, the whole effect of the republic debate, is to destroy national unity. We need to address the question of whose interests we are really looking after with this particular approach. To use the parliamentary secretary's own words, not all Australians 'relish our diversity' . Using my constituents as an example, i would say that the majority do not relish our diversity. For example, not all Australians believe in, or grasp with any enthusiasm, multiculturalism. It is a fact of life, but it not something that all Australians are enthusiastic about. When we say those things, we are liable to have all sorts of accusations cast at us. However, it is a fact that some of those things are of concern to people. We should not downgrade the benefits that we have received over a very long period of time from those who have come to this country from other places. In some respects it may not be proper to express those reservations, but we must reserve the right to do so. To suggest anything remotely different from the Prime Minister's position in the Mabo debate leads to accusations of being racist. We must have the right in this parliament, if nowhere else, to talk operuy and honestly and to canvass some of those issues. Other speakers have suggested that these changes should be put in the context of Australian society as they view it today. However, it is not a matter of simply changing the rules to suit those who are here. If we join a particular golf club, for example, we accept the existing rules. We do not join one day and then say, 'We don't like the rules any more, so we will change them'. People come to Australia understanding, knowing and appreciating what Australia stands for. That is why they come here. They should understand what Australia is and, if they do not like what they see, they should not have come here in the first place. The government's rushed approach in respect of this particular matter has caused resentment and it raises doubts about multiculturalism in the electorate at large. People see these changes as somehow pandering to that particular element. That is not uniting; that is dividing. That is perfectly clear to most Australians-certainly to many constituents who have contacted me about this whole issue. I am speaking in a broader context than just about this particular change that is proposed to the oath and affirmation of allegiance. In effect, this is only the tip of the iceberg. This shows clearly the Prime Minister's intentions-if we did not already know them. The existing oath and affirmation are more distinctively Australian because of what they is stand for and are valued by many Australians, if not the majority. They areas distinctly Australian as what is proposed in this legislation. I believe that this legislation is purely and simply an outworking of the Prime Minister's obsession. He acts like a man obsessed whenever these issues are raised. He is obsessed with pushing his own agenda at our cost. Perhaps it is essential that we have a debate about change, but I question the way the debate is being conducted. To bring this sort of legislation into this place at this time is provocative and offensive because it seeks to change something which the majority of Australian people may not want to change. The Prime Minister has no mandate for this change. He wants to get rid of the Queen; that is the point of this exercise. For some reason he does not like the Queen, and that is the underlying motivation for this legislation. The republican debate goes on also at this time. We have recently been treated to the Prime Minister's committee running around the country. That-in case Australian people are not aware-cost the taxpayers $430,000. That is what the Prime Minister spent on the activities of that committee-$2,500 a day. The committee did not canvass in the debate whether we should have a republic or notthat might have been acceptable to the majority of Australians; just have a debate, and they would participate in it-it ran around the country talking about what sort of republic we should have. In other words, it treated the whole exercise largely as a fait accompli. The Australian people have paid for the privilege of that. The Prime Minister has spent $430,000 on that particular exercise. He spends taxpayers' money with gay abandon on his own particular agendas. He is even happy to spend other people's money on dining tables and chairs. Mrs Crosio-This has nothing to do with the legislation before the House. Why do you filibuster?",73
223,Mr BRADFORD,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"It has a lot to do with this legislation. The parliamentary secretary is right to ask the question. The debate before the House centres squarely on the Prime Minister's personal agenda and his style. He is the issue. Plenty of people in this country would be prepared to entertain the whole concept of republicanism if it were not being pushed by Paul Keating. They do not trust him and nor should they. So that is the answer to the parliamentary secretary's question on what this has to do with the debate. If she does not like it, then I am sorry. But is a debate about the Prime Minister's personal agenda. I do not think it is even entirely supported by some of the more decent people in the Labor Party, but I am sure that when it is time to vote on this matter there will not be too many of them that want to express an alternative point of view. Apparently, the Prime Minister objects to the Queen because she is a Protestant and he is a Catholic. Mrs Crosio-I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The honourable member for MCPherson may have thought I was rude when I mentioned filibustering, but in this debate the previous speaker, his colleague, took us from the 1942 election campaign to Indonesia to pre-empt the republican debate. In all of his speech so far he has not once referred to the bill before the House. I ask you to direct him to come back to it. It has nothing to do with agendas, other than the matter that we are debating in this parliament. Mr MCGauran-I rise also to speak on this point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. It .has been a wide ranging debate. I have been listening to this debate for a good while now. All honourable members on both sides have ranged far and wide. Moreover, the honourable member who spoke before the honourable member who is on his feet at the moment took the opportunity to attack the opposition-wrongly, of course, as we have come to expect. I did not notice the parliamentary secretary at the table taking objection to her extending the boundaries of this legislation.",75
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I have listened to the debate for some time. It is correct that it has been a wide ranging debate, but I do. ask the honourable member for MCPherson not to stray too far from the legislation.",75
225,Mr BRADFORD,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I can understand why the parliamentary secretary might be offended by these remarks: I imagine that they go pretty close to the bone. If the cap fits, she will just have to wear it. The Prime Minister has betrayed his own obsession with off-loading the monarchy from Australia which he expressed when he was in Ireland. That is what this bill it proposes to do. It proposes to change the oath and affmnation of allegiance essentially to remove a reference to the Queen as the Queen of Australia. When the Prime Minister was in Ireland, he made the point that he disliked the Queen because he was a Catholic. How low can you go? Introducing that sort of sectarianism into this country at this time is further evidence of the man's divisiveness. He cannot help himself. If he removed himself from these debates, they would be far more rational-not only in respect of the change to the oath and affmnation but also in respect of just about every other issue that is on the agenda today. But the Prime Minister is the issue. I do not have to tell the parliamentary secretary that because, unless she has a very different constituency from most constituencies in Australia, that is the sort of input that would be getting as well. Introducing that particular point to the debate, which the Prime Minister did-I am not doing it; I am quoting him-particularly affects many loyal Cathowe lies in this country. When he made those remarks in Ireland, Catholics phoned my office and said that they wanted to completely disassociate themselves with any suggestion by the Prime Minister that to be Catholic to be other than loyal to the Queen as the Queen of Australia. We need only to note that many southern Irish men and women served in the British forces between 1939 and 1945. They were highly regarded by the British, whom apparently the Prime Minister also after dislikes so much. The Prime Minister mocks our past at every opportunity and, once again, this legislation is a manifestation of that. In fact, he goes beyond mocking. He is absolutely spiteful in the way that he approaches these debates. He descends to a level that I think sets a whole new low standard. I do not know whether he was subject to the call-up or not-although was in that particular age group; I assume he missed out-but he does not even have parliament respect, by and large, for those who I still believe have the greatest interest in this particular debate; that is, those returned service men and women who are still alive. As a group, with some very few exceptions, they are the ones who are most offended the Prime Minister's proposal to change this particular oath and affinnation. They are also offended by his obsessive desire to change the flag and by his headlong rush to create an impression-particularly when he is overseas talking to the Queen-that the majority of Australians somehow support his position on whether we should become a republic or not. He has not only offended those service men and women by trying to rewrite the history of their service in both the first and second world wars, but also he has offended them because he wants to change the traditions for which they fought and died. Mrs Crosio-They fought for Australia.",75
226,Mr BRADFORD,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"That is right; they . fought for Australia. They fought under the Australian flag and they fought for the King, she as the monarch was at the time. The Prime Minister denigrates them at every opportunity. They are the ones that have a vested interest in this, perhaps more than any others. Even if were to concede that all of this was inevitable, which many of us would not, then at least we would say that he ought to have enough respect for those people to leave these issues aside for a number of years to come. I was strongly oppose this legislation and I condemn the government, which has been responsible for bringing it into this parliament.",76
227,Mr HOLLIS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I do not know whether I rise in sadness or in anger listening to the speech of the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford). We are here talking about the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill in the parliament of Australia. We are talking about Australia-a nation of 17 million people; a nation that is geographically part of Asia; and a nation that has found its place in the world and is making its way in the world. Some people on the conservative side of politics want us chained he to a flag, a monarch and a tradition that is that 12,000 miles away. Very few people in this have a greater affinity with the UK than I. I lived in the UK for 12 years. Many of my friends come from the UK. I have two university degrees from the UK. I go to the UK-some say too often-at least every year, because my friends are in the UK. So I am by not anti-UK; I am proudly Australian. I am a member of the Australian parliament, not the UK parliament. My loyalty is to Australia, not to a tradition, an institution or a monarch 12,000 miles away. When Her Majesty the Queen is abroad, she represents as the Queen of England, not the Queen of Australia. She goes through this magical transformation only when she comes to Australia or goes to Fiji, PNG or any other such places .. I have never seen anyone have more changes-she has more changes than Danny La Rue. Basically she is the Queen of England. Her children are English citizens and her affiliations and affirmations are with the English. She was at the recent .CHOGM conference as the Queen of England, not as the Queen of Australia. Maybe when she was talking to our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) she changed magically into the Queen of Australia-or when she spoke to other prime ministers she changed magically into their queen. Is it not sad? We are talking about change. We are in the most exciting period of our history, facing tremendous change, yet the conservatives on the other side want to shackle us to the past. We are not part of the past; we are part of the future. Our children and grandchildren are the future. Their future is not tied to some grandmother in England who loves corgis and is kind to her children. She is the Queen of England and, as such, I have great respect for her. But I want us to have our personal and individual identity with Australia. I was really amazed when the honourable member. for MCPherson. spoke about spite. Every time the Prime Minister opens his mouth in the chamber he is accused of being spiteful. What more spiteful speech have I heard in this chamber than the one the honourable member just made? His speech was full of spite and I felt very sad because I respect him as an individual. He made a personal and spiteful attack on the Prime Minister. I am a practising Roman Catholic. My education was in the Catholic education system. That may be part of my problem. As a Catholic, I have no doubt that my loyalty is to Australia, to a distinctly Australian flag a distinctly Australian head of state. The honourable member said that now is not the time for debate on this issue. It is like politicians' salaries; it is never the right time for a debate on the salaries of members of parliament. . There is no better time for this debate than today. The honourable member talks about telephone calls to his office. We all get many telephone calls. I have one of the most multicultural electorates in Australia. I have Macedonians, Germans, Chileans, Irish, Dutch, Vietnamese and Italians-as well as Australian born people. These people come from overseas but their identity now is with Australia. I have attended more naturalisation ceremonies than honourable members would believe. I cringe with embarrassment at the words I hear and each time. I mutter under my breath, 'Not for much longer, mate'. When I hear people taking that oath of allegiance to a foreign head of state instead of to Australia as we should be doing I am embarrassed. The honourable member talks about people ringing him complaining about thisJegislation. People ring me and say, 'Until you people change that act there is no way I will take out Australian citizenship; I will not be naturalised'. The Irish, Macedonians and a whole range of them say that. The printing presses will not be able to tum over quickly enough to chum out the naturalisation certificates once we change this law, because they are all waiting to take out Australian citizenship and swear their oath of allegiance-not to some person who lives 12,000 miles away, although I have the greatest respect for her, but to Australia. Mr MCGauran-Why did they come to this country?· .",76
228,Mr HOLLIS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Why did Cook or Arthur Phillip come here? People say we should embrace the tradition. Arthur Phillip did not embrace the existing traditions and culture when he came. Australia, throughout its history, pre-European or since Arthur Phillip, has constantly been evolving and changing. There is no more multicultural nation than ours; We are such a polyglot group of people, we have and come from all comers of the earth, and we have welded ourselves into a distinct Australian identity. That is what is so exciting about this country and what makes one so proud to be an Australian. We are achieving our history now. We are not like people in Europe. As members of parliament we occasionally go to Europe and trudge through dusty museums. We look at the Appin Way· and many other things. Here in Australia we look at the past, at history. We are creating our history. Mr Truss-And they are not?",77
229,Mr HOLLIS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"They are not. The British Museum is filled with conquering exploits throughout history. We are creating our history-and what better way to do it than under our own identity? I cannot believe that elected members of parliament, representing parts of Australia and claiming to be loyal Australians, have loyalty to a monarch and traditions and a country that are 12,000 miles away. When will they wake up to themselves? When will those opposite become distinctly nationalistic Australians instead of hankering after a tradition and country that are 12,000 miles away? We went through that colonial experience in the 1800s. Whether the conservative crowd opposite believes it or not, we are living in 1993. It is a different ball game. Those opposite should get up to speed and show a little loyalty. They should show where their true affinity lies-and if it lies with Australia they should vote for this bill instead of hankering after a tradition which is long gone. It is lost. They will not regain what happened in the colonial experience of 1880. As other members have said, the bill will replace the current oath or affirmation of allegiance with a pledge that will not include any reference to the British monarch. Mr Truss-PatheticI",78
230,Mr HOLLIS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"The honourable member may say it is pathetic, but I would rather swear my oath of allegiance to Australia than to a monarch who lives cocooned 12,000 miles away. We are making a distinctly Australian oath of affirmation. It is about the parliament of Australia changed this outmoded oath to fit into the current an Australia which is seeking to make its own way in the world. I did not hear those opposite weeping great tears when Britain decided her future was with the European Economic Community. I happened to be living in Britain at that time and voted in the referendum on whether Britain should join the EEC. I voted yes. I had voting rights in the UK. I voted for Britain to join the EEC because its future was there; our future is with Asia. There were not too many debates in the British House of Commons about loyalty to Australia when Britain decided-rightly-to join the EEC. Britain looked after its own vested interestswhich it had every right to do. Good on Britain; it made the right decision. References to the monarch are contained in a number of other oaths and affirmations. When enlisting in the defence forces, members are required to make an oath or affirmation that they will serve Her Majesty, her heirs and successors-and they are a strange lot-under the constitution. Members of parliament are required to make the same oath or affirmation before they take their seats. Mr Truss-Are you going to change that?",78
231,Mr HOLLIS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Of course I want to change it As I said, I have great respect for Her Majesty the Queen. They tell me she is a very nice grandmother. She is very nice to her corgis and she is kind to her children. Nevertheless, that is a British institution to which the British are welcome. My identity is more in Australia. Each time. I am re-elected and I take my seat in the new parliament, the last thing I want to do is pledge an oath or affirmation to a foreign head of state. I do not say this out of any disrespect for the current monarch, but my oath is to the Australian people. That is the way I believe my oath should be . I say this because of the enormous respect and affection I have for my own country, for its values, for its laws and for its institutions. In short, I want to pledge my loyalty to Australia and to its people, not to a monarch who resides 12,000 miles away. I do not seek to ignore the past. Like you, Me time Deputy Speaker, I am also a student of history-maybe not as profound a student of reality of history as you are",78
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"More so, I feel.",79
233,Mr HOLLIS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Nevertheless, I have great respect for history. I do not seek to sweep aside the knowledge of Australia's history. It is part of our history that, unfortunately, we were a British colony. No-one is denying that. Many of our people have come from the United Kingdom, but also many of our people have come from many other parts of the world. As I said earlier, I believe this is what makes Australia such an exciting place. We are a combination of people from all parts of the world and we are building a distinctly Australian identity. It is not an identity which is tacked onto something that happened in Britain; it is a distinctly Australian identity, and our history affirms that. As I said, Mr Deputy Speaker, you are an eminent historian. We do respect the past and we do learn from history. But we also have a future. We all proudly look forward to that future, not only for ourselves but for our children and our grandchildren. We represent the future, not the past. Europeans may have their past, but we should be concerned about our future as a geographical part of Asia, as a trading partner with Asia. We should be concerned about our future rather than the past. There is a hankering amongst those opposite to go back to the colonial garden parties when we had governors, minor members of the British aristocracy coming here in their plumed hats waltzing around as governors and governors-generalMr MCGauran-This is class warfare.",79
234,Mr HOLLIS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I am older than the honourable member for Gippsland. I am old enough to remember when an Australian Governor General replaced Field Marshal Slim and the debate in the Australian parliament. One would have thought the world as we knew it and loved it had stopped. I think it arose under a conservative government. Both governments of that period were conservative. But we had the audacity to appoint an Australian Governor General. The frothing at the mouth then from the conservatives was almost the equivalent of this. There was frothing at the mouth because we did not appoint some minor member of the failed nobility, the third son of a failed earl, as Governor General of Australia. We had the audacity to appoint an Australian Governor General. So do not give me this crap about the past. I am not interested in the past; I am interested in the future. I want· to see the future of Australia. The proposal contained within this bill is not new. In 1973 and again in 1983 bills were introduced into thIS parliament which, had they been passed, would have had the same effect as this current bill. Both of those bills passed the House of Representatives; they did not, however, pass the other place. I heard the honourable member for MCPherson talk about the cost of the debate on the Australian republic. He quoted some figures. Have a look at the last visit that Betty cost us. Have a look at the last visit any member of the royal family cost the taxpayers of Australia. Then we can find out whether it is cheaper to have a debate on the republic than have members of the royal family come here. Have a look at what those visits cost. I will seek that information under freedom of information. We will see that whatever we have spent on the. republic discussion will have cost us a lot less than bringing minor members of the British royal family to waltz around this country at the Mr Truss-What about the Queen? She is not a minor member.",79
235,Mr HOLLIS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Whether it is her or her kids, they have cost the Australian taxpayer mightily to come to this country· and waltz around here at taxpayers' expense. Australia is much more diverse than it was in 1948 when the Australian Citizenship Act was enacted. It is a country diverse in nature and in people. It is a country with its own destiny. It has the capacity to decide its own. future, and in fact it is doing just that. Young people and those who have come from many other parts of the world who have made this place their home have no identification with a monarch who resides in London. Young people and migrants identify with Australia, and they would be proud to honour these plain and simple words: From this time forwardif they are religiousunder God, I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey. Why do honourable members find that offensive? I cannot believe it. I have heard many speeches in this chamber, but I have not heard before the absolute nonsense that I am hearing tonight. They are simple, plain words for swearing allegiance to Australia, its laws and traditions and everything it stands for. That crowd opposite wants to hanker back 100 or 150 years to an outdated, inbred institution which is not democratically elected, who by accident of birth happen to be their so-called leaders. That plain oath is an oath that every Australian can be proud of. They are words I would be proud to pronounce and, I believe, so would the people of Australia. I support this legislation. Mr MCGauran-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the intemperate use of language by the honourable member for Throsby to describe members of the royal family is contrary to standing order 74. I wish, for the benefit of the honourable member for Throsby and any other members of the government who should like to follow his lead, to make them aware of it. Standing order 74 reads: No Member may use the name of Her Majesty, her representative in the Commonwealth, or her representative in a State, disrespectfully in nor for the purpose of influencing the House in its deliberations. A word such as - inbred' and the derogatory words used by the honourable member for Throsby in regard to state governors run counter to standing order 74. It is now a matter of record that the honourable member for Throsby employed the most disrespectful and unnecessarily insulting language to get across his point. I am very sorry that the honourable member for Throsby resorted to such tactics and, in doing so, he clearly offended standing order 74.",79
236,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I have listened carefully to your argument, but I also listened very carefully to the honourable member for Throsby. The honourable member for Throsby paid me a compliment regarding my knowledge of history, and his flattery did not win him any brownie points in determining this point of order. I think you could find a thousand history books in every bookshop in Australia which would make references to the inbreeding of the royal family. I find that the honourable member for Throsby had quite a cogent argument, and I found nothing whatsoever offensive in his utterances.",80
237,Mr TRUSS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I certainly found the comments of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) offensive. It is really a tragedy that there should be a member of this House who has such a distorted idea of the history of our country and has such a personal loss of identity. I also express disappointment in his comments in which he reflected upon the way in which he took his own oath of office in this parliament and suggested that he did it with a cringe, without any sincerity. I think that is a most regrettable thing for any member of this parliament to introduce into his comments in the debate in this chamber. Surely we must all take our oath or affirmation of allegiance with a great deal of recognition of the importance of what we are saying. For a member to reflect flippantly upon that occasion is most disturbing and reflects upon his right to sit in this place. That is what the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill is all about: an attempt by debate, the government to trivialise the oath of citizenship, to replace a solemn commitment made by new citizens with a flippant piece of new poetry. An oath of allegiance should be a public declaration of loyalty, a solemn commitment to their new nation. It should be a binding attestation of citizenship. Instead of a statement which encompasses those ideals, those promises for the future, we are now to have a trivial, pathetic piece of poetry. It is vague and uncertain. It says nothing of substance and fails to make the real commitment that we have the right to expect of those people who are becoming new Australians. There are two aspects of this new oath which I want to refer to tonight and to oppose: firstly, the removal in the new poem, the new pledge, of any reference to the Queen of Australia; and, secondly, the way in which this new poem further weakens the statement of commitment expected of Australian citizens. Of course, for some time Labor has been espousing a republican agenda. If people had any doubts that this particular change in the oath of citizenship is associated with the republican agenda of the Labor Party, they had only to listen to the speaker who has just concluded, the honourable member for Throsby. He made it quite clear that Labor is all about establishing a republican Australia, and this is one aspect of that particular activiAustralia ty. Already we have seen Labor moving to remove some of the trappings of our constitutional monarchy. Words like royal are not supposed to be used. References to the Crown are being replaced. Now any reference to the Queen of Australia in the oath or affirmation of citizenship is to be removed. The government is doing this sort of thing as part of a pretend republic. It has never put the question of whether or not Australia wants to be a republic to the Australian people, who, after all, have the clear constitutional responsibility to make that decision. No matter how much the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) may detest the constitutional monarchy and no matter how much members of the Labor Party may wish that we were a republic, they cannot wake up one morning and suddenly decide that this country is no longer a constitutional monarchy. Only the people of Australia, by way of referendum, can make that decision. That may gall or upset honourable members opposite, but it is a clear fact of our constitutional democracy. What we have instead is a government that knows it cannot win a republic referendumthat knows that if it put the question to the Australian people it would lose, it would be defeated, it would be belted well and truly on the question-trying to introduce a republic by stealth. Bit by bit, it chips away at the trappings of our constitutional monarchy and tries to eliminate the traditions that have made our great country. This is one step in that agenda. The republican committee was a half a million dollar flop. It did not even produce a credible alternative. Of course, the Prime Minister will continue to raise this kind of an issue whenever he is in trouble, regardless of whether it is on unemployment, massive foreign debts, budgets that will not balance or just the table and chairs in the Lodge. The republic will be brought up every time the Prime Minister cannot think of anything else to say. The Prime Minister's offensive remarks have done nothing to raise the esteem of our country around the world. If he wants to change our constitution, let him do it by rational debate, by persuading the people of that there ought to be something different from what we have today. Instead, the Prime Minister goes around name calling, insulting members of the royal family and trying to rewrite our national history. I was in England at the time the decision was made that Sydney would host the Olympic Games. I was amazed to hear a television commentator on British television say in an interview that Australia was a totally unfit place to host the Olympic Games because Australians were too arrogant. I have heard Australians called lots of things by the British, particularly on the rugby league field, at the test match or the like, but I have never heard anyone around the world refer to Australians as arrogant. One man has singlehandedly given us that reputation. The Prime Minister is about to go on one of his trips around the world and offend a few more of our friends. By his divisiveness, the Prime Minister has damaged our national reputation rather than do anything to build a constructive debate around the republican question. There is an old proverb 'He who throws mud loses ground'. That is a lesson the Prime Minister could well learn. By throwing mud, by resorting to empty name calling, he is doing absolutely nothing towards improving Australians' understanding of our constitution and of the issues which surround whether we should be a constitutional monarchy or wheth- er we should be a republic. Through this legislation, Labor is clearly devaluing our oath or affirmation. I was personally appalled when the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch), the first law officer of the Crown, decided at his own swearing in that he had the right to make up whatever oath or affirmation he felt was appropriate. He did not follow the traditions; he just made up his own oath or affirmation. That I think set a very poor example for the man who is supposed to be the first law officer of the Crown. This disgraceful arrogance has been typical of Labor in government. The constitution of our country is, of course, by no means quiet on what form the oath or affirmation should take. Section 42 of the constitution says: Every senator and every member of the House of Representatives shall before taking his seat make and subscribe before the Governor General, or some person authorised by him, an oath or tion of allegiance in the form set forth in the schedule to this Constitution. There is only one schedule in the constitution, and that is the schedule which outlines the words of the oath or affirmation. Those words are: 1then one says one's namedo swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Her heirs and successors according to law, SO HELP ME GOD! The constitution of our country, through its schedule, defines the words of the oath or affirmation that the members of this parliament must make when taking their seat in this House. The fact that that affirmation and oath is included as a schedule to the constitution and not precisely attached to section 42 itself demonstrates that there was a clear intent on the part of our founding fathers that that should be the model oath or affirmation whenever an Australian citizen was called upon to make that oath. A clear precedent was established there, clear words outlined, as to what should be included when Australians were required to take an oath. With this particular change now before the House, we move a long way away from those formal . words of commitment. If I have some criticism of our current citizenship oath, it is that it is too weak. There are many areas where I think it could be strengthened, particularly the fact that it now fails to renounce any kind of previous citizenship. Our citizens are not called upon when they make their oath or affirmation to renounce any allegiances to other countries. This sort of thing has contributed to the dual citizenship problems that came to a head in the cases following the Wills by-election. If those candidates had renounced their former citizenship at the time they became citizens of Australia, the issue may well not have arisen as to whether they were eligible to sit in this chamber. No oaths of allegiance in other countries are anything like as pathetic or as weak as the one being proposed for Australia in this legislation. I will take as an example the oath affirmathat must be taken by someone becoming a United States citizen. The American oath of allegiance reads: I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, to whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; imd that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God. What a difference there is between that kind of commitment and the little piece of poetry we are going to ask potential Australian citizens to recite in the future. An American citizen even has to make a commitment to bear arms if required. By taking this oath, people are certainly making a commitment to fulfil their duties as citizens of the United States; they are making a commitment that they will contribute to their country. By contrast, what are we proposing? Our new citizens will recite this little poem: From this time forward, under God, I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey. I will go through it bit by bit. 'From this time forward, under God', means, in other words, not in the past but only from now on. What does 'I pledge my loyalty to Australia' mean? There is no definition either in the legislation or in the Australian Citizenship Act which explains what is meant by this tenn. What does it mean to be loyal to Australia? Does it mean to cheer for Australia at the cricket or make sure that we wear green and gold at the right time? Is that the sort of loyalty that is expected of Australian citizens? Surely it is a lot more than that. The poem talks about 'loyalty to its people', but which people are they? Does it mean every Australian, including those who do bad as well as those who do good? What sorts of standards do we set for the loyalty that is expected of new Australian citizens? Citizens then give an indication that they share the democratic beliefs of Australians. I wonder what they are. What is the definition of these 'democratic beliefs'? They are not outlined in our constitution and they are not outlined in this legislation. Is it government by the people, for the people as defined by the Americans-a system which we see very little of in the Australian parliamentary democracy, particularly when the Prime Minister stonns out of question time and denies matters of public importance and proper debate on issues? Is that the kind of democracy that future Australians are declaring their support for? What about the democratic socialists of the former Gennan Democratic Republic or the Soviet Union? They all ascribe to democracy. Is that the kind of description of democracy that we are talking about in this new piece of poetry? Certainly the Prime Minister's ideas of democracy-the sort we saw today in his petulant display-are not what I define as democracy or the kind of democracy that I am prepared to pledge my loyalty to. The poem then goes on to say 'whose rights and liberties I respect'. No more is required of prospective. Australian citizens than to respect those rights and liberties. There is no obligation to further or extend them; just an obligation to respect the fact that somebody else might happen to have a right or liberty. It then refers to the 'laws I will uphold obey'. That is the end-a mere promise to uphold and obey the laws. Surely citizenship is more than obeying rules, more than obeying the laws. We have to do more than take out an annual dog licence to be qualified to regard ourselves as loyal and faithful Australian citizens. Clearly, being an Australian citizen not only carries with it rights and privileges-we have heard previous speakers in this debate refer at great length to the rights and privileges of being an Australian citizen; those rights and privileges are indeed significant and we have a right to be proud of them-but also carries with it obligations and responsibilities. Nowhere in this new, trite piece of poetry is there any commitment on the part of new citizens to contribute towards their country, to add to our society, to add to our traditions, to do more than merely uphold the laws, to help their fellow Australians and to do something about making this country an even greater place through their presence as Australian citizens. Before I came into this place I served as a council chainnan. In that capacity, I had the privilege of conducting many citizenship ceremonies. They were, as much as I could make them, prestigious occasions. As often as possible, I had the full council in attendance. These ceremonies were conducted before the flag and we saw our citizens take a solemn oath or affIrmation, usually before relatives or friends, and photos were taken by newspaper photographers and others to record the occasions so that they would be memorable for the new citizens. They were, after all, making a new beginning as Australians. Many councils follow the practice of giving the new Australian citizens a tree to help symbolise the growth of their own citizenship in this country. New citizens plant a tree to symbolise their own beginnings in this country. In all of these sorts of ways, local government-the level at which citizenship ceremonies are actually undertaken-is doing what it can to make the occasion a dignified, solemn and memorable event for all of those new Australian citizens. As a passing point, I express regret that the government, in introducing this new pledge, and did not bother to consult with local government and the people who will be undertaking the citizenship ceremonies; just as it did not consult local government a few years ago when it replaced the grand citizenship certificate with a cheap duplicated certificate. This certificate was condemned by those conducting the ceremonies and was eventually replaced by a certificate which reflected more accurately and appropriately the importance of Australian citizenship. Australian citizenship should be a prized privilege. We should regard these citizenship ceremonies as important occasions when a new citizen not only accepts the privileges of living in Australia but also solemnly undertakes to fulfil the responsibilities of being an Australian citizen. New citizens should accept the commitment to fulfil their duties as citizens, to contribute positively and add to our national heritage, and pledge to be loyal to our country through good times and badto be loyal to Australia when there are droughts and floods, and when the government is good or when the government is bad, like it is at the present time. Citizenship is not selective. People take with it the freedoms and privileges of being an Australian, and also the obligations and responsibilities. We cannot say when we become citizens that we are part of this bit of Australia, but not that bit. We take the entire constitution, including the constitutional monarchy. If we are not prepared to make a commitment to the system that we have at the present time we should not become Australian citizens. If we want to make changes, once we are Australian citizens we have the right to vote in referendums to bring about those changes. But by becoming citizens we are accepting and becoming a part of the system that applies in this country. I was born an Australian and I am proud of my citizenship. I do not have a British heritage. I did not have to decide to make this my home; the privileges of citizenship came to me automatically. But I recognise that, in having this prized privilege of Australian citizenship, I also have responsibilities and obligations to my fellow Australians. It is appropriate that new Australian citizens are made aware at their citizenship ceremonies of the responsibilities of Australian citizenship as much as they are made aware of the privileges. Their new beginning in a new country should be a solemn occasion at which they make a commitment to their country and a commitment to contribute to their country. A pathetic piece of poetry is no substitute for a solemn statement of loyalty to their new country. (1ime expired)  very grateful, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you have called me and I have an opportunity to . participate in this debate on the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill. I thank the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) for his contribution. I recall his predecessor, Clarrie Millar, who I think was one of the most esteemed members of this House. He was respected by both sides. In fact, because of the respect in which he was held by members of this House, he was very difficult to debate against. He is someone whom I remember with a great deal of affection and I look forward to seeing him from time to time. I suggest that the honourable member for Wide Bay has a little way to go before he reaches that status. There is much in what he has contributed to which I would want to take exception. Let us go to the heart or to the thrust of what he was saying about the pledge, which he described as a poem. First, I would like to read the old oath of allegiance. It states: I . . . swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. I apologise to the House because I cannot tell honourable members whether or not the previous oath of allegiance is a poem or poetic, so I will not make that accusation about it. But I contrast it with the new pledge, which states: From this time forward, under God, I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey. One of the criticisms that was raised is: why are we not getting our citizens to pledge their previous conduct rather than their present and future conduct? If this is a fair point, where is that in the oath of allegiance that is being held up as being so much better? The honourable member for Wide Bay also asked: what democratic beliefs? Indeed, in the previous oath of allegiance, where is the mention of democracy, of democratic beliefs? It is not there. There is no problem with it, but it is not there. The honourable member asked: what people? Funnily enough, the Australian people are not mentioned at all in the old oath of allegiance. If this is what the honourable member for Wide Bay is taking exception to in the new form of pledge-the new oathwhy does he not take equal exception to it under the old oath of allegiance? Herein I think honourable members will find the hypocrisy perhaps that some members opposite have brought to the debateabout changing the pledge. Having attended a number of citizenship ceremonies-for example I know that the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), with his constituency, would attend even more than I - this new pledge makes a lot of sense to new Australians wanting to become Australian citizens. They find it very difficult, usually having travelled thousands of kilometres after making a very brave decision to establish a new home and a new life in Australia-that decision, by the way, flatters and honours us-to then pledge allegiance to a queen who does not sit in Australia but is located thousands of kilometres away from us. So this form of allegiance makes a lot more sense to them. They can understand what it is all about. We do not have to go through the rigmarole of trying to explain what our constitutional monarchy is all about. As I say, it is very relevant. In fact, a small minority either permanent residents or new citizens actually object to making the oath of allegiance or affirmation of allegiance because of their lack of meaning. We are being told, particularly by the shadow minister for social security, the honourable member for Berowra - (Mr Ruddock), that this is the thin end of the wedge argument, that getting a meaningful pledge of commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia is the thin end of the wedge and that by tomorrow, by stealth, we will probably change it and thereby introduce a republic. What nonsense. What absolute and arrant nonsense. It is appropriate that Australia, in looking to observe 100 years of federation, review what is the best constitutional framework for this country. It is made even more relevant by the call of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to Australia to at least come to grips with where it is in the world, both geographically and in terms of its future; that is, without denying any of our heritage, our future rests in Asia. Trying to explain to Asians that the Queen of England is actually the Queen of Australia, I think poses some difficulty. Indeed, when the Governor General travels overseas as the vice-regal representative, having to insist that he is our effective head of state is sometimes embarrassing. For all those who want to cling to this old form, could they please tell me when the monarch of England led a trade mission to the United States? When did the monarch of England extol the virtues of Australian industry in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand or Malaysia? Of course, she has never done that, nor is she expected - to do it because her prime responsibility is with England. Mrs Sullivan-When did she last go to any of those countries?  member knows that she is a very powerful representative of English industry and is used on quite a number of occasions to sell not only ordinary industry but, indeed, the armaments of England. I have witnessed her visits to Middle Eastern countries which have been quickly followed by the signing of significant of military contracts. I do not object to that. I do not object to it one iota. But it is very foolish for people to suggest that the Queen is able to discharge, and is capable of fully discharging, her role as Queen of Australia in all its facets in the way in which we would normally understand a head of state might fulfil the role or indeed the role she fulfils for England. While on the subject, I think the Queen of England is a much admired person right throughout Australia. I do not think I could make the same statement about her heirs and successors. I think there is a lot of speculation that, if Australia waits for the year 200 1 to become a republic, the British might beat us to the act, should the Queen abdicate. I do not want to detract from that. I admire the Queen of England, but I say to new Australians who have come from all parts of the globe to settle in this country that there is nothing disloyal, nothing unpatriotic and nothing treasonable about asking them to take this pledge, which states: From this time forward, under God, I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I - i11 uphold and obey. None of those qualities is in this pledge. This is far more meaningful. In fact, if we were to sample new citizens who have taken the oath under the old oath of affirmation and under this one, I know what the result would be. Overwhelmingly, they would have a better understanding of the important act that they are performing. We have to put on record that probably new Australians take their citizenship far more seriously than' Australian born people who have citizenship conferred on them automatically. If we want to look at uplifting the importance of citizenship, I say to honourable members opposite: do not single out new Australians only. I think there is much that we could do in our country to get a greater understanding of the responsibilities and benefits of being a citizen. The honourable member for Wide Bay talked about the role of local government. I have to be' honest and say that an involvement in local government is another thing that the honourable member for Fowler and I share, as you do too, Mr Deputy Speaker. The federal government delegates to local government the conduct of citizenship ceremonies. I know that in my area-I am sure the same goes for other' areas-local government takes that conduct very responsibly. The honourable member for Wide Bay mentioned the giving of a very small tree at the citizenship ceremony, which is a practice in my part of the world. However, .bibles signed by the mayor are also given. If I had my druthers-lam not suggesting we do not have the most practical and effective arrangement of these matters-I would dearly love it if it were the responsibility of a federal member to confer citizenship because it is certainly a very moving ceremony; it is something that whole families gather to witness and a day that they treasure for life. This is a very simple bill to amend Australian citizenship. It replaces an oath of allegiance to the Queen, her heirs and successors with a much more practical, easily understood people, pledge-something that I was pleased to support through my local government. However, it was argued with some merit at a meeting of the North Mount Druitt branch of the Labor Party that we ought to review the way migrants are treated with regard to the length of time it takes to become a citizen. For example, it was argued that a transitional arrangemem should apply when migrants first arrive here, whereby a much greater period elapses before full citizenship is conferred. Mr Ruddock-How long are you suggesting?  ed four to five years. The reason is that there is always a very small minority of migrants who unfortunately either bring with them or develop while in Australia practices which lead them into strife with the law. Of course, once they are made citizens they cannot be deported. It is for that purpose that it was suggested there should be a review of the length of time before full citizenship is conferred. For example, if two years has to elapse beforehand then there is a greater ability to deport those who break the law. I want to emphasise that I am talking about an infinitesimally small minority of new Australian citizens. The suggestion is worthy of consideration at least. I certainly have some sympathy with the views expressed by that branch meeting. What is this bill about? It does not introduce a republic, lead to a republic by stealth, undermine the monarchy, nor is it treasonable or unpatriotic. It is a simple bill that at its core tries to make relevant the pledge that people take when they want to become Australian citizens. The bill has been described as a poem. Given your expertise in literature, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be better able to adjudicate its poetic merits and . that of the former oath of allegiance. I apologise to the House because I am not skilled in this area and feel unqualified to comment. However, I do feel very qualified to comment about the impact this pledge is havinghow it makes the whole act of becoming a citizen far more relevant. In fact, it allows some of those who are not Australian citizens but who have been here for years to now step forward and become Australian citizens. Those honourable members who have large numbers of migrants in their electorates and who participate in citizenship ceremonies know from their own experience that this bill is right, that the changes are right. On Sunday I was in my office replying to a letter on the republican issue. There is a belief that somehow Australia can become a republic without a referendum. It is the sort of line that is implied often in contributions either in this House or outside by opposition members. I repeat, as I did in my reply to my constituent, that a referendum is required. It is some time since we had a referendum but I remind the House that, for a referendum to be passed, it requires the support of a majority of the states, as well as a majority the Australian people. It is a very tough test that very few referendums have survived. The centenary of federation in the year 2001 is approaching, so it is entirely appropriate, as the Prime Minister said, that there be a wide ranging public debate. We have only just started that debate and not, as the shadow minister wants, dipsticked and held a referendum today. I hope to see a very wide ranging debate. I say to the shadow minister that, when he mixes with young Australians and sees their understanding of our democracy and our system of government, he will realise that these people will not be stampeded by scare tactics, which seem to be the principal methodology of the opposition. These young people will not be fooled and hoodwinked. The constitutional structure of this country will be critical for that generation and succeeding generations. It will not be critical me or for the honourable member for Fowler or the shadow minister. This bill is very strongly supported by this side of the House. We trust that opposition members will now bring a greater degree of consideration to it than provided by previous contributions. I am sure that there will be many in Australia who will welcome this change.",80
238,Mrs SULLIVAN,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Moncrieft) (9.48 p.m.)What a sad little debate we are having here today on the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill. It takes my mind back to an occasion less than 10 years ago when the Hawke government rewrote the Australian Citizenship Act and we debated a bill on the total rewriting of the previous act. I would like to contrast that occasion with the occasion here tonight because it is very illuminating. In 1984, as a result of wide community consultations initiated by then Minister for Immigration Macphee, under the Fraser government, there was a rewriting of the Citizenship Act. There was agreement that there was a need for an updating. Those community consultations which took place in public forums throughout Australia culminated in the rewriting of the Citizenship Act, which we debated in 1984. That Australian of Citizenship Bil11984 also included a different oath and affirmation of allegiance from the one that Australian citizens had been taking to date. That new oath and affirmation was rejected for one simple reason: in the process of those consultations, there was no emerging demand for a new oath or affirmation of allegiance. I notice that the last time that Australian public opinion was tested emigrated here from Ireland for a start.",87
239,Mrs SULLIVAN,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence might listen to what I said. Those community consultations did not show an emerging demand for a change in the oath or affirmation of allegiance. That is not to say there were not some individuals who had that view. That view was considered but it was not for accepted. It was not a general request. There were some individuals-I will instance Franca Arena-who said it, but it was not a community view. Whatever the honourable member wants to say about that now, the point is that this new pledge of allegiance is not something that has come from the community. It may well be that there is a view out there in support of it,. but I do not know that and the government does not know that because it has not tested it; it has not consulted this time. Very differently, this proposal has flowed from the government's own rhetoric as its leader seeks to move us towards a republic. There was no strong desire to change the oath and affirmation of allegiance back in the early 1980s. There has been no testing of whether there is any such strong desire in the 1990s. If the government were fair dinkum, it would test it, it would hold those consultafor tions. It would allow the members of the Mount Druitt branch of the Labor Party to put a submission to the government and, if need be, go to some public consultations and express their views. We are very indebted to the honourable  stated the views of the Mount Druitt branch of the Labor Party here tonight on the subject of how long people should be resident before they take citizenship. He said that these Labor Party people are of the view that the time of residence should be increased from two years to maybe three or four. For the record, it was the Citizenship Act 1984 which reduced it from four years to two years. Community consultations were brought to bear and the Hawke government decided that that was the way it was going to proceed. It was the Hawke government that changed it from four years to two. The Mount Druitt branch members of the Labor Party might be interested to read the opposition's immigration policy. They might be surprised to see how much of it they agree with, particularly in terms of length of residence. This was a policy for which the Labor Party bagged and condemned us prior to the last election. The honourable member for Chifley might need to read the policy himself for the next time he goes to a branch meeting to get his propaganda straight-certainly to get his lines straight. I know that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) would be delighted to provide him or the members of the Mount Druitt branch of the Labor Party with a copy of the policy. If the honourable member for Chifley would just give him the mailing list-that would save him some trouble-the honourable member for Berowra will send out the policy to them himself. To return to the issue of the way in which we are moving. In 1984, I remind the House, the Australian Democrats voted against the change to the oath of allegiance. They voted against it on the ground that I have given: that there was not a demonstrated community demand for any such change. In fact, there was quite some resistance to any suggestion change. This time the pale echo of the party that these modem Democrats are, compared with the Chippocrats as they used to be called, have wet their finger, put it in the air, think they know which way the wind is blowing and they have gone along with it. They want to strike the right pose. It might be the pose that the people who voted for them now want them to strike. That is a very different attitude for them, and certainly not one of principle as was followed in 1984 by all members of the then Australian Democrats in the Senate. We should make no mistake about the origins of this change. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), some months ago-I think it was at the end of last year-declared that he had changed the oath or affirmation of allegiance. As I am sure that you did, Mr Deputy Speaker, I received a number of letters and telephone calls of upset and distress from constituents saying how terrible it was that he could have done this. I was obliged to respond to them and say, 'Well, almighty and powerful as he might think he is, he cannot do this. It requires the amendment of an act of parliament'. Finally, this amendment is before us. The Prime Minister very clearly is the prime mover. Until he made that statement, none of us had any idea that it was in the wind. Far from the consultative process, far from the process of consensusMr Haviland-Not really.",87
240,Mrs SULLIVAN,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Before the honourable member who interjected was a member of this place, the Prime Minister had unilaterally made that statement. Now we are all dragged along into this debate. Because the Democrats no longer care about anything but where the next couple of votes might be coming from, they have gone along with it too. This is the party that talks about having referendums and polling its members on everything. This time, they did not think it necessary to have any community consultations. In the context of the debate about a repubproper lic, which has been referred to this evening, not least by the honourable member for Chifley, surely it is basic that if we are to change fundamentally our style of government, if we are to change fundamentally something about Australia-and the oath or affirmation of allegiance is just that: the fundamental statement by which people become Australian citizens if they have not been born to it-then that is something that should not be divisive. Immigration and citizenship, along with foreign affairs, have been basically bipartisan areas in this country to date. Mr Haviland-What about Mabo?",89
241,Mrs SULLIVAN,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I am going to respond to that interjection for this reason: it is so typical of what I am about to say. 'What about Mabo?' We are now talking about citizenship and the issue of the foundations our nation and the interjection is, 'What about Mabo?' That is another red herring. Of course, the republican debate is a red herring. Do not think that there are people out there who do not know it. Only today-and I swear that this is true-a person who identified himself to me as having voted Labor all his life, including at the last election, stated he will no longer vote Labor. It is not because views on Mabo or the republic, it is because the government does not have any views on the things that matter to the people out The government uses Mabo-and the slanging that comes with it-and the republic-and the slanging that comes with it-as excuses for its abdication of leadership on what really matters in this country, and that is people's basic existence. I have visited China a few times, including an occasion in 1977 when it was a much more insular community than it is today. I heard in discussions there the illustration of what I had been told was a maxim. Whenever the Chinese authorities are in trouble, they start talking about the 'foreign devil'. That is about the sum of the republican debate in this country. If there were a genuine feeling that there is a large body of opinion out there that wants this country to be a republic, then the government would give a framework for a debate, consultation and the emergence of consensus. Instead of that we get slanging, blackguarding and abuse. We get the most divisive possible debate. Why? Because it is only really meant to be a noisy, divisive debate to take people's attention away from what matters. On the issue of unemployment, what do we get from our national leaders? We get the statement, 'Oh, it looks like there's always going to be 10 per cent unemployment'. I cannot imagine a worse abdication of national leadership, a worse abdication of what really matters to Australian citizens and would be Australian citizens who are living here. My electorate has the highest rate of youth unemployment in Australia. That is because it is a growing area; an area that is employing, through the tourism industry, a growing number of young people. Young people Australia-wide see this and they come to the of Gold Coast, my electorate, thinking that there is hope there for them. Unfortunately, they come in greater numbers than even the rapid growth of the economy in my electorate can keep up with. I saw those young people at the polling booths in the last election. Mr Haviland-They voted Labor.",89
242,Mrs SULLIVAN,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"They did not vote of Labor. In the last two days before the rolls closed 1,600 people-who were overwhelmingly young people-enrolled in Moncrieff. there. As from 8 o'clock on the morning of the election I saw young people, who I would have said were not the Liberal Party's natural constituency, taking only Liberal how-to-vote cards. To me it was a cry from the heart. They were not our natural consti,tuency; it was remarkable that they were even on the rolls",89
243,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,Mr Truss)Order! I draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that we are debating the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill.,90
244,Mrs SULLIVAN,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I am talking about citizens. I point out that I was provoked. To me it was a cry from the heart. That is the issue that matters; that is the national issue. Let us ask those young people what they think about a preamble. I do not mind that much if we have got a preamble. It would have been nice if a few people had been consulted-that a decision had not been made by some bunch of bureaucrats or as a result of some rush of blood to the head that somebody had in cabinet-if we had had some idea where on earth this preamble came from, and if there had been an opportunity for input. By the expressions on their faces, I suspect I have offended one or more of the advisers present in the chamber. I do not think the opposition would mind a preamble to the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill or an examination of the oath or affirmation of allegiance. However, we mind that this is done by way of grandstanding by this Prime Minister when he announced it nearly 12 months ago in a prorepublican, anti-monarchy context. That is the context in which he put it, so nobody should be surprised if that is what is debated. But what a shame that that is what it is. That is a devaluing of anything that we might say about citizenship, which is so fundamental to this nation. As I was saying, the tactic is something that obviously the Prime Minister has learnt in his travels in Asia-which have not been as extensive as he would want us to believe, or think-the diversion of the 'foreign devil'. The honourable member for Chifley said that it is an expression of our coming to grips with where we are in the, world. He then rabbi ted on about Asia. There is no dispute here about our role or our relationship with Asia-that is something the opposition has been behind long since. Nevertheless, I think the debate is not coming to grips with what we really require in national leadership. Never before have we had a debate so divisive on something which is so basic to our nation. That is why I said at the beginning that this is a sad debate. To me, when we debate citizenship, it should be a matter of enthusiasm and an outpouring of views, not this pathetic apology for a debate. Like the honourable member for Chifley and many other members, I too have attended many citizenship ceremonies. I was earlier trying to remember just how many that might be in my now nearly 20 years in parliament. I live in a rapidly growing part of Australia and, since I have been a member of this parliament, it has been the most rapidly growing part of Australia. There are many citizenship ceremonies. If I were not in Canberra for an amount of the time, I would be attending up to six ceremonies a month in my electorate. In my time in parliament I have certainly attended more than 100 ceremonies, and I have seen tens of thousands of people take citizenship. They are a joyous occasion and a cause for celebration. Whenever I have the opportunity to participate, I do. I give them first priority over all my activities as a member of parliament, provided I am not in Canberra. I do not think there is anything more fundamental or more important than to be at citizenship ceremonies and to participate in them as a federal member. I do not go as far as the honourable member for Chifley in saying that we ought to be the ones who conduct the ceremonies. For a variety of reasons, including practicality, I think it works quite well when local authorities do it. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that in rural electorates it would not be practical for the member himself or herself to be doing it. Nevertheless, it is an important occasion. I would like to tell honourable members a little anecdote, as others have-whether about a meeting of the Mount Druitt branch of the Labor Party or whatever. At one of those citizenship ceremonies for which local authorities are responsible within my electorate, the mayor-as they are all now known in Queensland-gets up and makes a pretty strong speech on the subject of the Australian flag. He never has to pause for applause; it comes spontaneously and strongly. There is a greater attachment amongst new citizens to what are traditional Australian things than some government members realise. Some years ago one of the leaders of one of the major ethnic groups in the Queensland community said to me that we needed to realise that people do not migrate to Australia because they want to change the rules; they come here because they want to enjoy the rules. They come to live under the rules that are already in place. It is a mistake to say that migrants are rushing in this direction. Many migrants of non-English background will not support the republic and the government's rush to it. I point out to the parliamentary secretary who interjected on me a couple of minutes ago that the flag is very much part of this debate because the Prime Minister has said that, if we change to a republic, then naturally the flag will change. Of course it will-even though government members are trying to keep that issue out of the centre of the debate. If we change something as fundamental as our nation, then we would change our most fundamental national symbol, namely, our flag. That is not an issue which can be played down. Along with everyone else, I will accept the umpire's verdict. But to me the umpire is the Australian people. It is not just a matter of having a referendum, as the honourable member for Chifley so rightly pointed out. It is a matter of the proper process prior to that referendum-if there is one-a proper process of determining whether there should be a referendum, and a proper debate on all the issues. I conclude my remarks on the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill by reiterating the view that I have already put: I think it is proper that we try to find ways of codifying the meaning of citizenship. I personally have no objection to some sort of preamble to the Citizenship Act. My objection essentially is to the fact that it has been used as an arm of propaganda in a republican debate which I believe, along with many members of the Australian public, is nothing more than the enhancement of the vainglory of one person who seeks to see his name in the history books as the architect of the Australian republic. There are those who hold the view, 'Good on him'. There are those who deplore it. The divisive way in which it has been pursued is not something that any of us, by any measure, could say is good for this country.",90
245,Mr HAVILAND,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"It always seems to be my pleasure to follow the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) in these debates on legislation. It is my pleasure to speak in support of the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill. It is a very important piece of legislation, despite what the opposition might think. I will start by quoting from the second reading speech because it is so important: Australia is a parliamentary democracy committed to providing equality before the law, freedom of the individual, freedom of speech and religion, equality between men and women and equality of opportunity for all. Australia is one of those few countries which actually relish its diversity. Under the umbrella of an overall commitment to the nationthat is Australia, of courseand its uniting values and institutions, a society of great richness and variety as well as remarkable harmony has evolved . . . As the multicultural society that we are, it is proper that the pledge of commitment be one that will be equally meaningful to all of our people. It is therefore time that individual citizens be allowed to make a commitment of loyalty to Australia in embracing Australia's democratic beliefs and. institutions, respecting others' rights and liberties, and upholding and obeying the laws of Australia. This bill is about Australia's identity. The opposition carries on with its arcane beliefs about the monarchy and preserving all that has gone on in the past. In the short time that I have been in this place, the opposition has proved beyond doubt that it does not have any policies of its own. All the opposition stands for is the past. It stands for all the negative values one could possibly think of. Let me go over some of my experiences in relation to this issue. For six years it was my privilege to be an alderman on the Campbelltown City Council. In that time. I attended many citizenship ceremonies. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Moncrieff mention that she had attended such ceremonies as well. Campbelltown is a fast growing area in south-west Sydney where there are a lot of people of non-English speaking backgrounds. On the most recent occasion when I attended a citizenship ceremony at Campbelltown it was in my new role as the federal member for Macarthur. I share the area covered by the Campbelltown City Council with the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin). It is an area of rapid growth, and an area where many new Australians seek citizen'ship. It has always been a privilege to attend those ceremonies and to see the excitement of the new citizens when they become naturalised or, I suppose, become legal Australians. But there is an element of confusion in the current situation. People come along and take the oath or the affinnation. Many of these people come from places like Chile, Argentina,.Africa, South-East Asia and various parts of Europe. These people are forced to take an oath or an affinnation swearing allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. They come to Australia to live, but they are forced to take an oath or an affinnation to a monarch who does not even live here-a monarch of a foreign country. It is not only confusing but, to me, embarrassing. As an aldennan of Campbelltown City Council, and more recently as a federal member, it is embarrassing to me to see these hundreds of people taking out citizenship and having to take an oath or an affinnation to Queen Elizabeth II, who does not even live in Australia. It is obviously very hard for people to understand and comprehend, and that is hardly surprising. Australia is a multicultural society. I know there are people on 'the other side of the House who do not like that very much. At election times, to suit their political opportuto the bill. nism,they go out and campaign against multiculturalism. The fact is that we are a multicultural society, and I am proud of that. This bill recognises that situation, and it is long overdue in righting the tardiness of the past. There were attempts in 1973 and 1983 to get similar legislation through this parliament. It is better late than never. Hopefully, on this occasion the legislation will pass and new citizens to Australia will be able to take citizenship without having to swear an oath or make an affinnation to a foreign monarch. In the first four years that I was with Campbelltown City Council the most divisive issue concerned non-English speaking groups which made applications for the establishment of places of worship within the city area. The local Muslim group, the Suburban Islamic Society, tried to get a development application approved for a mosque. A Hindu group tried to get an application approved for a Hindu temple. The Labor caucus, of which I was a member, naturally supported the applications for two reasons. Firstly, we believe in equality and that people of any background are entitled to their place of worship regardless of race, colour or creed. Secondly-and even more importantly at the time-both applications that came before the council were perfectly within any planning codes or zonings that existed within New South Wales and particularly within the Campbelltown City Council area. However, the Liberal Party saw an opportunity to score political points, and it doorknocked and ran stories in the local paper attacking these applications. Unfortunately, the Muslim application was in the middle of the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein in 1990.",91

248,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"It may be an important issue, but you are required to speak",92
249,Mr HAVILAND,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"If you do not like the answer, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sorry, but the reality is that this is an important issue. It shows that the Liberal Party will use any divisive tactics to exploit race and to exploit differences in the community for its own political gain. We had a situation where, if we believed the propaganda that was put out, we would almost have believed that Saddam Hussein was about to invade Minto.",92

253,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I am not going to cop these racist slurs from people like the honourable member for Macarthur. The point of order is that the language used by the honourable member for Macarthur is intemperate; it is unparliamentary. The suggestion is that the Liberal Party would use any device, particularly matters related to race, to divide the community. As somebody who has been in the Liberal Party for 35 years, I personally find that offensive and I ask that it be withdrawn. I want to give notice to members of the Labor Party that we are not going to cop these unbridled accusations of racism.",93
254,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Order! The honourable member for Bennelong has made his point of order.

258,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,Will the honourable member for Macarthur withdraw the remarks?,93
259,Mr HAVILAND,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,I will withdraw whatever remarks the honourable member finds offensive. I would ask the honourable member to do his research and see what I am talking about.,93
260,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"The honourable member may now continue his contribution to the debate, but let it be on the subject of the bill.",93
261,Mr HAVILAND,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will remember that as well. I take your point about getting back to the subject. Campbelltown City Council and the community of Campbelltown have learnt a lot from the divisive episodes of 1990 and 1991. The fact is that it was used by some people to make mileage in the 1991 council elections at the cost of those of us in the Labor Party who stood up for people's rights. Nevertheless, successive mayors of Campbelltown City Council acknowledge that Campbelltown now has a very proud record, and now has a number of places of worship for different religions dominated by people of non-English speaking backgrounds. It is a very diverse, multicultural and growing community. The community has learnt a lot from those divisive periods which, unfortunately, the honourable member for Bennelong does not want to acknowledge occurred. I put myself down to speak in this debate tonight, but I was astonished to find that the opposition was going to oppose this legislation.Why is the opposition opposing it? As bill. I said before, the opposition opposes any change and any new initiatives. All the opposition stands for is the values of the past-any negative value one could think of. The opposition talks about the republic as if it were some sort of one-man crusade, as if somehow the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has a personal obsession with the republic, and it is only the Prime Minister who is interested in making Australia an independent nation. In my opinion, it is the opposition that has politicised the republic debate. Certainly the Prime Minister raised it. He put it on the agenda. He put it up for public debate. But is that not what leadership is about? Should governments and Prime Ministers not be conflict about putting up issues for debate? The fact that the Prime Minister supports the republic seems to be the reason why the possible. opposition opposes it. Opposition members are going around Australia getting carried away with what we are going to do with this republic-the sky is going to fall in, and everything else. It is a disgrace-but not as much of a disgrace as their .attitude towards Mabo, which I will deal with at some other time. We talk about citizenship. I was always very proud, as I said, to attend citizenship ceremonies. I was just as bewildered as some of the new citizens when they had to make oath or an affirmation to the Queen of the United Kingdom. It must have been very bewildering to those people, so for that reason alone this bill should go through. phrase a former member for Werriwa, which is not far· from my electorate, well may say God save the Queen, because save the Liberal Party. Debate (on motion by Mr Howard) adjourned. NA",93
262,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Earlier today the honournot able member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) tious raised a matter of privilege in connection an article by Mr Laurie Oakes in the Bulletin of 9 November 1993. The honourable member quoted references in the article to alleged actions and statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As I understand it, the subindependent stance of the honourable member's complaint is that the article reveals or establishes duct calculated to deny me my independence as Speaker. This issue places me in a most difficult position. The standing orders require that the Speaker must decide whether, in or her opinion, a prima facie case has been made out and whether a matter has been tradition raised at the earliest opportunity. In this particular case the complaint inI volves me in a most direct way.

NA Motion (by Mr Johns) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Sydney Opera House",94
266,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (10.25 p.m.)The 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House has seen some Stalinist rewrites of history. The Australian community has never really appreciated that this building is unique in the world's history. The Australian Encyclopaedia states: ... it was a voyage of architecture and engineering discovery in which new oceans were chartered, new frontiers of knowledge and technology were conquered and the resources of science and ogy were employed to solve design, erection and quality problems beyond the capacity of conventional methods. The fact that it happened in Sydney was the result of a series of accidents-and in spite of the efforts of a majority of the New South Wales architectural profession, the arts community and the coalition politicians of the day. Many people contributed to its success, but without three men-none of whom was Australian-it would have just been another building. Those three men were Eugene Goossens, who gave impetus to the idea of a music and opera centre and the Bennelong Point site; Joern Utzon, who gave Sydney and the world an architectural masterpiece and brought a combination of vision and technical competence unmatched in the history of architecture; and Bero Saarinen, the FinnishAmerican architect who selected the design. The first two men were hounded from the country in disgrace. Saarinen was here for only four days; not long enough to get any abuse. From the time Utzon won the competition in 1957 until he was expelled from the country in 1966, he was subject to an endless stream of character assassination-a victim of partisan politics, professional jealousy and stupidity. On the very day he was expelled, a Melbourne non-entity was awarded the gold medal for architecture. The small-mindedness of those in the arts community was sickening as they fought to carve up the building. The display of Utzon's winning design, at the New South Wales art gallery with the other 233 entries in the international competition, brought forth howls of outrage from a combination of disgruntled competitors and philistines enraged not only by the potential expenditure for a music and opera centre but also by the concept itself. It was largely beyond the aesthetic horizons of the Australian community and, therefore, a personal affront to many people. It recognised that the building was moreimpoItant as a symbol and a piece of sculpture than anything which would happen inside it-again a personal affront to many who saw it only as an opportechnoltunity to expand their personal empires. The Sydney Opera House was a reinvention of the wheel in terms of aesthetics and construction. The reinforced concrete used was light-years away from normal industry standards, as was the use of materials such as stainless steel and phosphor-bronze. Utzon brought a level of technical expertise to match the genius of the concept, which was bewildering to the architectural profession. The building returned to the mundane after he left, but fortunately most permanent parts of the structure had been committed. These standards of quality and the need to reinvent the design and construction techniques fed his critics and fuelled the partisan political appetite of the state opposition, which had been out of office for over two decades. With the fall of the· Labor government in 1965, Utzon's critics found their gunman in the new minister for public works-a belligerent Country Party pOlitician who justified years of partisan attack by firing Utzon and who remains a haunted figure to this day, desperately trying to justify his actions. Sydney's architectural profession, to their eternal shame, would not support Utzon. Some were motivated by professional jealousy and some were motivated by the venal consideration that the minister was the largest client in New South Wales. The magnificent relationship of the Opera House, the bridge and the CBD on the site of Australia's first European settlement forms an unparalleled urban gateway. Yet that relationmake ship was a result of a series historical accidents, as was the availability of the Bennelong site made possible by the destruction of Sydney's tram system. The ridiculous $7 million original estimate, crazy decision to proceed with the construcupper tion prior to the completion of the design the superstructure and the creation of the . Opera House lottery made the building posbottom sible. It is an unbelievable irony that collection of accidents, incompetence and malevolence could produce such an inspiring triumph in a largely ocker, 'she'll be right' society at the end of the world; It is right someone of Utzon's integrity should riever return to this country. But Sydney, at some comments. point, needs an act of atonement and recognition to him. Western Australia: Aborigines",95

I talked to a few of my former club mates, including Mr Graham MCEachran, who arranged for me to be invited to the WACA ground for those first two days. So I would like to thank both of these men. While I was in Perth a few other interesting things happened. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has been attacking on Perth commercial radio and misquoting mockerywhat I said in this parliament on 22 October. lIe did not mention my name, which probably Was very wise as he was misquoting what I said. For the record, I said that I believed that with the way members of the Western Austo tralian government were carrying on, would be forgiven for thinking that they saw themselves as the last bastion of white supremacy. I did not say they were white supremacists. ·But never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that events could unfold as they have in the last three weeks, which could the comments I made in an adjournment of unplanned debate ring so true. I had not been in Perth for very long last week when I heard on the news and saw in the local paper some statements made by a the Liberal member of the Western Australian house, Mr Ross Lightfoot, MLC. He of said that Aborigines were never civilised and that in their primitive state today they are the colour of the civilisation spectrum. this How much more white supremacist could he possibly get? This issue was raised in the Legislative Assembly of the Western Australian state parliament last Thursday. The Leader that of the Opposition, Carmen Lawrence, moved a very strong censure motion against those The Liberal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs tried his utmost-I give him eight out of 10 for trying-to distance himself from those comments. But the next day the same Mr outside parliament, said that it was a lie to suggest that none of his colleagues with his remarks that Aborigines were not civilised in their native state and were the bottom colour of the civilisation spectrum. Mr I Lightfoot was insistent that most of his state I government colleagues agreed with his comWe can add that to the recent statements of former Prime Minister John Gorton, who said unequivocally that Aboriginal people were inferior-a cut and dried statement, with not much equivocation. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), the new selfappointed shadow minister for racial purity, me also commented on the issue. That makes a",96
268,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I have listened to the honourable member's speech with some interest, but that goes beyond the pale. It is a gross reflection on another member of this place and he ought withdraw that reflection on the character of one the honourable member for Barker. As a colleague of the honourable member I find the whole implication of what has been said to be highly offensive.",96
269,Mr HAVILAND,ADJOURNMENT,"I withdraw, for the sake of brevity.",97
270,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, could you ask the honourable member to withdraw that remark unconditionally?",97
271,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,He has done so.,97
272,Mr HAVILAND,ADJOURNMENT,"How does this look in relation to the statements by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)? In a recent speech in Sydney he said that the Liberal Party has a proud record on Aboriginal affairs. What a proud record it is! Ever since he said that, the record has looked very proud-I do not think. The whole issue is summed up best of all by another Western Australian Liberal, Fred Chaney. Fred Chaney is an unusual person; a Western Australian Liberal with a social conscience, so much so that he was called Red Fred. He said that in Western Australia there remains an attitude that Aborigines can almost be treated like kangaroos; simply moved on whenever there is competing land use. He also spoke about Mr Court's legislation.(lIme expired) Petroleum Industry",97
273,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to direct my comments to the current Industry Commission inquiry into the petroleum industry across Australia. I would like to join with the Deputy Premier of New South Wales and the Minister for Consumer Affairs for New South Wales in calling on the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to do everything in his power to expedite the Industry Commission inquiry into the petroleum industry. I know it is looking at releasing a draft report early next year, but the situation across New South Wales has become quite serious-as honourable members would no doubt be awarewith the variation in the price of fuel. It certainly reflects not only the cost of transport of fuel to the different areas. A recent press report outlined a summation of petrol prices across New South Wales. Prices varied greatly from 67.9c per litre in suburban Sydney to 78.9c a litre in Dubbo, 81.9c a litre in Broken Hill and 74.9c a litre in Port Macquarie. The brief for the Industry Commission inquiry is to look not only at the cost of production and transport but also at the management of the process as well as the wholesale and retail distribution networks in the petroleum industry. It is certainly not before time that this takes place. The Prices Surveillance Authority plays a very important role in petrol pricing around Australia. That body is set up by government to recommend a wholesale price. At the moment, that wholesale price is supposed to be just over 71c per litre. It strikes me as a little strange to see prices down in the low 60s, if that is the case. . It is the prerogative of the oil companies, when trying to capture greater market share, to put on a price war. But it always seems to be to the advantage of people in metropolitan areas-I suppose purely because that is where the numbers are when they are trying to grab that market share. People living in country areas and regional and provincial cities do not seem to receive the benefit of these price wars. Nor does the price of fuel in those areas reflect the true cost of freight, which is supposed to be the only differential. I know the Service Station Association New South Wales, in its submission to the Industry Commission inquiry, has urged the commission to make recommendations for there to be a terminal gate price for fuel so that everybody is paying the same price for fuel with the freight component-only a matter of fractions of cents per litre-being the only variable. The Prices Surveillance Authority, in its role in the petroleum industry, is not doing a responsible or fair dinkum job. Over the last 12 months we have seen great fluctuations in the world price of crude oil. That has supposedly been reflected in recommendations to the petroleum industry as far as wholesale prices are concerned. No recommendations have come from the Prices Surveillance Authority that the· wholesale price of fuel be reduced. It has always been increased over that time. It may be timely, within the Industry Commission inquiry, to look also at· the operation of the Prices Surveillance Authority, as a body set up by the federal government to monitor monopolistic, or partly monopolistic, enterprises; of which the petroleum industry is one. The key area of my concern in the price of fuel is that it affects everything we do in regional Australia. This government, the New South Wales government and the federal opposition have placed a great deal of emphasis on regional development across Australia. If we are serious about that we need to address the disparity in the price of fuel and the cost of transport, and the disparity of operating a business and employing people in regional Australia in comparison with metropolitan areas. If the Industry Commission inquiry takes that into account, we might have some reasonable explanations. In closing, I urge the Treasurer to hurry that up. (TIme expired) Kennett, Mr Jeffrey",97
274,Mr CHYNOWETH,ADJOURNMENT,"I know honourable members have been waiting for some time for me to give another speech about my favourite subjectJeffrey Kennett. I will not disappoint them. I shall do that. However, I will do something different and read out a couple of letters that I have received in relation to what is happening in Victoria. One letter reads: Dear Mr Chynoweth I'm writing to express my total frustration of living in Victoria. It is getting harder to survive day by day. I work nights in the retail industry and my husband works days. We have two children, mortgage, car loan, visa and the list of demands endless. I was abruptly notified this week that I am no longer a casual employee but a part-time worker and I am no longer eligible for penalty rates. This in point halves my pay packet. To complete this charming day I received my rates notice with the ever so fair $100.00 state included. (AGAIN) I can't express just how I feel about our current state government or their deplorable leader. I would much appreciate if the next time parliament is sitting you might pass on my gratitude to Mr Kennett for making it almost impossible to make ends meet and our lives are now a constant struggle as a result. I know someone with his compassion would wonder what the fuss is about. Thank you for letting me air my feelings. That is typical of the sort of letter I receive. Another one, from DEAL Communication Centre, points out the human side of what is happening in Victoria now that it has been taken over by a Liberal government and now that Mr Kennett's policies are starting to affect average people. It reads: Dear Mr Chynoweth DEAL Communication Centre was founded in 1986 with support from Federal and State governments to provide services for people with severe communication impairment. The bulk of its funding (80%) came from the Commonwealth. In the years since it has provided services to over one thousand Victorians, has pioneered therapy methods that have been adopted all over the world, and has helped to change the lives of hundreds of people who are eligible for communication therapy services from no other source. Jeff Kennett has now appropriated its funding. Under the Commonwealth/State Disability Agreement responsibility for DEAL's funding ceased being a joint federal/state matter and was transferred entirely to the state sphere in 1992/3. The terms of the agreement prohibited the state terminating funding in the first year. Immediately this protection expired at the end of June, 1993, the Minister, Michael John, stopped all funding. I repeat: aU funding. The letter continues: The particular excuses given were that there were unspecified concerns about DEAL's operations and that DEAL had failed in an unspecified manner to meet the requirements of a recent administrative review; however, as many of the other services that were transferred to State funding at the same time as DEAL also had their funding terminated at about the same time it is rather more likely that the are government simply wanted the money and didn't particularly care where it came from. This is referring to people with 80 per cent disability. The letter continues: The government isn't putting the money into other surviving State services for people with disabilities, either-they've all been cut too. The Minister has tax stated that DEAL's funding will be transferred to a new agency, but no steps have been taken to establish any such agency and the evidence is that the government has no real intention of doing so. DEAL is the only agency in Victoria that provides ongoing communication therapy to all people with severe communication impairment regardless of age or diagnosis, and if DEAL were to close a high proportion of its clients would be unable to find any service at all that would accept them as clients. We are talking about people communicating via computer with a pointer on their head. This is the sort of funding that Jeffrey Kennett's Liberal government has cut. This is the sort of story that is affecting many people throughout Victoria. These are the little things that we do not hear about. We hear about the big picture, about KNF Advertising and all those sorts of things, but these are real lives, real people being affected by what is happening in Victoria. The sooner the Liberal government goes the better, and all I can say is that I will work my butt off to make certain that it does go.(Tzme expired) Environment: Essay Competition",98
275,Mr ATKINSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Isaacs) (10.44 p.m.)This evening I would. like to address the primary schools environment essay competition run in my electorate. Letters were written to all primary schools in the federal electorate of Isaacs on 4 June 1993 inviting them to compete in an essay competition. The topic of the essay was the environment. It was an initiative planned to coincide with World Environment Day on 5 June 1993. Every participating student will be provided with a certificate of achievement. . The local environmental organisations were invited to act as judges of the competition. The judges included Ms Mara Hayler from the Mordialloc-Beaumaris Conservation League, Mrs Dorothy Meadows from the Friends of Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands Inc. and Mrs Janet Ablitt from the Black Rock and Sandringham Conservation Society. Both private and public schools competed, and each essay was given to the judges to select their top three or four entries. A group of 11 finalists was then selected. The judges chose Andrew Garlick, a grade 6 student from Parktone Primary School, as the winner. His essay was a passionate and imaginative work about the future of our society if we fail to tackle our current environmental problems adequately. It was entitled, 'My View of the Future (Environmentally),. It reads: I wake up. It is the year 2010. I look outside. trapped in my house. Outside I see people wearing gas masks so they don't breathe in polluted air. I get dressed. I hear people shouting and screaming. I put on my mask. I looked like something out of a Star Wars movie. I step outside, hop in the car and drive to work. The city is high-tech stuff. It is cleaner and I can take off my mask. I look around and I see that there are lots of advertisement boards around. They are advertising 1993 Toyota Tarago's. I think back. I was eleven at the time. If only we had done something then. If we had resisted the pollution. I remembered all the trees around me. Now in 2012 I see giant black clouds shadowing me from the sun. I hear the rustling of the rubbish. An empty chip packet is blown into my face, followed by an empty can of coke. I enter my workplace. I work on the sixtieth floor of a one hundred and twenty storey building. I take another look out of my window. Black clouds are floating above me. I'm not too high. It's all the pollution. Work is over. I decide to go home. The pollution is getting worse everyday. I put my mask back on. I'm home. I look at my dog. He looks sick. I take him to the vet. There's nothing I can do. His dog food had been contaminated at the dog food factory. With all the pollution. I'm not surprised, the pollution is so bad I won't leave home. It's like I'm stuck in a prison ... If we can start looking after the environment now we won't have to live in misery! Andrew's essay, along with the finalists and top entries from each competing school, will be displayed at the Mordialloc-Chelsea Regional Library for a period of two weeks. If we fail to tackle our current environmental problems adequately, then really we do leave ourselves with the types of problems that this young gentleman has described. I congratulate him on his writing of the essay, and the schools and students who competed in the competition. ANZAC Ships Project",99
276,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"My comments tonight refer to the performance and behaviour of Transfield' Shipbuilding. They cover four or five different aspects. I refer to a hearing of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology of this parliament in Melbourne on 19 July. I asked Dr White from Transfield Shipbuilding to update the committee on a report which had been issued back in 1989 I'm regarding the distribution of work by the then Ameco'n. This document entitled ANZAC ship projectAMECON tender spread a/work by electorate covers a number of pages which go into the methodology of the details, then specifies the distribution of the project Australia wide, electorate by electorate, state by state and takes into account the New Zealand content. It also goes into some details about the nature of the electorates themselves. I have subsequently received a document which is an update of that original one and there are a couple of points to make about that. The first qualification made is that the contract was for 10 ships, not 12, as was originally tendered for. Hence it obviously required some modification. That in itself is understandable. What is not understandable is Dr White's comments made subsequent to the government announcement of 10 ships regarding work distribution where he said he stood by the spread that Amecon had actually made public. The second aspect of the qualification it makes is that, because of the change of electorates, it cannot provide electorate by electorate breakdowns. But it is interesting to note that in its state by state breakdowns, firstly taking the Newcastle situation, the reduction from $560 million in its original report to $100 million as a current estimate is obviously quite substantial-a ratio of almost 1:6. Mind you, it is not so different from Western Australia, where the spread was reduced from $90 million to $15 million, and perhaps even worse than Tasmania, where it was reduced from $25 million to $5 million. The interesting thing about all that, of course, is that one of the major winners was the ACT, which has gone up from $54 million to $266 million, a fivefold increase. I think it would be of interest to honourable members to know how we could actually transfer work from industrial centres such as Newcastle and Western Australia into the ACT. I guess we will leave it for another day to find out why the ACT is suddenly a substantial contributor. In fact, almost 10 per cent-, - a total of $266 million-of the total $3 billion that has been let is going into the ACT. The next aspect is the question of the industrial relations situation. As members would understand now, Transfield has estab.lished in New Zealand a shipyard effectively to build modules for the ANZAC frigates. However, it has the advantage in New Zealand of the New Zealand industrial relations contract, which is a personal contract between also the employer and the employee. I asked Dr White whether he would make a copy available. He declined to do so on the grounds of commercial advantage, and I can understand that. I think there probably is a commercial advantage, and what is likely to happen in the months ahead is that the Amecon subsidiary in New Zealand will be used to squeeze the prices and the wages of Transfield employees throughout Australia. Another aspect of its contractual obligations is that the MTIA insists that the government debrief all unsuccessful bidders and tenders. There is not the same requirement for Transfield, which makes no attempt to debrief any unsuccessful tenderer. Today the Newcastle Trades Hall Council made a statement regarding its concerns about Transfield, and I share those concerns. It is a situation now where most major industries in the engineering field in Australia find Transfield a company which is difficult to deal with and which is somewhat suspect in terms of what it says and does. The figures I have indicated tonight certainly amplify and substantiate that. The danger that this government is condoning the behaviour and performance of companies by issuing them with contracts when those companies have no intention in some cases or pay lip-service(Time expired) Unemployment",99
277,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"Wide Bay) (10.54 p.m.)Tonight I want to refer to a letter I received from a constituent-one of many I have received in a similar vein and, I suspect, similar to letters other members in this chamber would have received. My constituent writes: I was talking to a friend who is married with three children and currently unemployed. He had worked continuously for 12 years as a Nursery Hand & Landscape Labourer. He was known to be a good worker with strong work ethics. He has now been unemployed for 4 months and states he ""has never had it so good, and they'd have to offer me a pretty good job to make it worth my while to return to work"". He owns his own house on 10 acres and his net income is made up of:10bsearch Allowance-$527.40 Basic Family Payment-$62.70 Add. Family Payment-$185.70 Casual Work (10 hrs)-$I00.00 Total net income per fortnight-$885.80. As a comparison, I am married with no children, work long hours in a high stress job for a net income of $712.60 per fortnight ($250 of which goes to loan repayments). Where is the incentive to work? How can any government justify paying people more money to stay at home than. the taxpayers, who are contributing to this payment, are earning themselves? How can any society condone such an anomaly? .... Only through ignorance of the facts, surely. I mentioned to other friends the income received by people on unemployment benefits imd their reaction was one of disbelief! To illustrate my point, assume my 'typical' jobseeker was offered a full time position paying the award wage for the type of work he is skilled to do, ie. Nursery Hand:Nursery Hand's award per fortnight-$669.20 plus Basic Family Payment-$62.70 Additional Family Payment-$185.70 Total gross income-$917.60 (less approx. $105 tax) net income-$812.60 This means he would have to work 80 hours per fortnight (instead of current 10 hrs), plus the extra time preparing for, and travelling to work, fuel costs, wear and tear on the car, and have little time to pursue his current hobby & leisure activities, ....... and receive less net income than he Was receiving on 10bsearch Allowance! Needless to say, my friend was recently offered such a position and knocked it back, and who can really blame him? For truly, the fault lies with the social welfare system. Unemployment benefits is meant to be a means of temporary income support for the jobseeker and his or her family, until such time as the recipient is able to obtain suitable work; and not as an alternative to work itself. The sooner all jobseekers are enticed to adopt genuine work ethics and view unemployment allowance as only temporary income support, then the sooner the country as a whole will benefit. My constituent then goes on to suggest ways in which the social security system could be modified to eliminate some of the dis ad vantage currently occurring to those people who are in work. With the state of the national economy and with a million people out of work, there are many Australians genuinely seeking employment who are unable to obtain a job. However, the figures quoted in this example demonstrate that under the current situation many people are actually financially disadvantaged by bothering to go to all the trouble of maintaining a regular job. I have always been a keen supporter of some kind of work for unemployment benefit scheme. Such a program would not only discourage those who seek to loaf on their fellow Australians but, more importantly, help to maintain and extend the skills, the selfesteem and the work ethic of those who are unemployed. While our country has a clear obligation to care for the casualties of the national recession and to ensure that the families of those out of work, through no fault of their own, are not disadvantaged, it is also important that we provide appropriate incentive to ensure that every unemployed person is willing and eager to grasp any work opportunity which may arise. ' Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.59 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Lieberman to move That: (a) noting the serious and widespread damage to property in the recent Ooods in Victoria; and (b) observing that many farmers, small business operators, families, landlords, employ"" ers/employees, community groups and local government authorities whose property has been seriously damaged by the floods have been unable to receive adequate or appropriate assistance from existing State or federal natural disaster programsthis House: (c) is of the opinion that a major and, urgent review of the adequacy, effectiveness and relevance of federal and State natural disaster relief policies, programs and procedures must be undertaken; and (d) calls on the Government to initiate an appropriate review without delay. Mr Ferguson to move That this House: (1) notes that: (a) the victims of the Soviet-engineered Ukraine famine of 1932-33 should be solemnly remembered on its 60th anniversary; and (b) this anniversary underscores the hardship and inhumanity of life under the repressive regime of the Soviet Union; (2) condemns the systematic disregard for human life, human rights and human liberty that characterised the policies of the Government of the Soviet Union during the Ukraine famine of 1932-33; (3) observes that the man-made Ukraine famine is a graphic illustration of the unacceptable alternative to democratic pluralism and social justice; and (4) therefore is of the opinion that Australia should seek to help Ukraine as it transforms its society. Mr Beazley to move. That, in relation to the proceedings on the following bills, so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of both the bills: Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993; and Industrial Relations Court (Judges' Remuneration) Bill 1993. Mrs Crosio to move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Refurbishment of Australian Federal Police College, Barton, ACT. Mr Kerr to present a Bill for an Act to amend the Crimes Act 1914, and for related purposes. Mr Charles to present a Bill for an Act to ensure that individuals shall have, as well as the. right to belong to industrial associations, the right not to belong to those associations, and for purposes connected therewith. .

Wool Tax (Question No. 86) Mr Anderson asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 11 May 1993: (1) How many (a) primary producers, (b) primary producer partnerships and (c) primary producing limited companies filed tax returns in (i) 1988-89, (ii) 1989-90, (iii) 1990-91 and (iv) 1991-92. (2) How many of the (a) primary producers, (b) primary producer partnerships and (c) primary producing limited companies referred to in part (1) also paid wool tax pursuant to the Wool Tax of Offices (Administration) Act 1964 in (i) 1988-89, (ii) 198990, (iii) 1990-91 and (iv) 1991-92. (3) What (a) total and (b) average sum in wool tax was paid by the (i) primary producers, (ii) primary producer partnerships and (iii) primary producing limited companies referred to in part (2) in (A) 1988-89, (8)1989-90, (C) 1990-91 and (D) 1991-92. (4) Can the number of wool taxpayers who have left the wool industry since 1988-89 be estimated; if so, (a) by what method, (b) what is the estimated number and (c) what was the total sum of wool tax which they paid in 1988-89 and each subsequent year they paid the tax.",100
278,Mr GEAR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) publishes the number of (a) primary producers, (b) primary producer partnerships and (c) primary producing companies in Taxation Statistics each year. In this publication taxpayers are classified by their main source of income. There may, therefore, be taxpayers with primary production income who are not included in the table b-low.

Financial year Amount ($'M) 1988-89 1989-90 1990-91 1991-92 (4) No. Wool Industry: Value Adding (Question No. 130) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 May 1993: (1) Does Australia have a world standard capability to manufacture equipment for value-adding wool industries. (2) Have foreign-owned wool value-adding enterprises which obtain all or most of their equipment from overseas recently received Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority (TCFDA) grants. Is (3) he able to say whether Joma Engineering, based at Orange, NSW, has been overlooked as a supplier of equipment to wool value-adding enterprises receiving TCFDA grants; if so, is he further able to say why they have been overlooked. (4) Will it be made a condition of receiving a TCFDA grant that the prospective recipient undertake to consider purchasing Australian made equipment which is of comparable price and quality to that made overseas. Mr Gritliths-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Australia has the capability to manufacture limited range of equipment for value-adding wool industries. However, wool top making equipment is produced only in Europe and has never been produced in Australia because of its highly specialand ised application and the limited market demand. (2) Yes. Both foreign and Australian owned enterprises have obtained TCFDA grants and it is expected that they will obtain a significant proportion of their equipment from overseas as suitable the equipment is not available in Australia. They include the Australian subsidiaries of Bremer WollKammerei of Gennany and Chargeurs of France, and the Australian company, Australian Topmaking Services Ltd. (3) Some of the grant recipients indicate that they have discussed their requirements with Joma. n is understood that Joma Engineering manufactures presses for packing processed wool and not wool top making equipment which is produced only in Europe. (4) No. The source and purchase of equipment 442 for a particular project is a decision based on a number of factors such as suitability for the appli444 cation, price, timeliness of supply, follow-up 887 service and maintenance. The Government does not 360 believe that any net benefit would result from requiring companies to report to Government on their equipment purchasing processes. Greenhouse Emissions (Question No. 236)",104
279,Mr EVANS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: Will the Government (a) introduce legislation to reduce harmful greenhouse emission, (b) support industry research and development which targets the reduction of harmful greenhouse emissions, and (c) support Australian industries which are attempting to establish specific products which reduce hannful greenhouse emissions; if so, how.",105
280,Mrs KELLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) No. The Commonwealth, States and Territories are. working jointly to progress action through the National Greenhouse Response Strategy, the first phase of which was endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments in December 1992. (b) Yes. The Government supports industry research and development into energy efficiency and renewable energy, both of which are important for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Commonwealth Government provides direct support for non-coal energy research, development and demonstration a through the Energy Research and Development Corporation (ERDC) which was established in 1990. ERDC's current priority areas include technologies and techniques for efficient utilisation conservation of traditional energy sources, reduction in adverse energy related environmental impacts, and cost-effective renewable energy systems. Australia is also a member of the International Energy Agency Coal Research Organisation, which undertakes research into a wide range of coalrelated issues on an international scale, including coal technologies and greenhouse issues. Outside the energy area, funding for research and development may be obtained under the Industry Innovation Program which is administered by the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. Schemes operating under the Industry Innovation Program include the 150% tax concession for research and development, discretionary grants, and generic technology grants. In addition to this funding support, the CSIRO undertakes research relating to greenhouse gas emissions and some of this research is done through collaborative ventures with industry partners. As well, companies installing equipment to reduce greenhouse emissions may be eligible for a tax deduction as a result of changes made to the Tax Act in 1992. Under these changes deductions for certain environment protection expenditure may be allowed when that expenditure is related to income producing activity. (c) Yes. The Commonwealth Government sees it as important that, where appropriate, greenhouse response measures are advanced through cooperative efforts between government and industry.

287,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am informed that the common law and criminal codes of States and Territories provide adequate punishment for acts prohibited by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention) and the passage of new legislation is not necessary to meet Australia's obligation under the Convention. While consideration is being given to the possibility that such legislation might be desirable, the Government's social justice agenda has been such that priority has been given to other pressing areas such as disability discrimination, racial vilification and the issues arising from the ""Half Way to Equal"" report.

288,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under current arrangements, jurisdictional responsibility for defamation law rests with the States and Territories. The Commonwealth has not had a direct involvement in the issue of defamation law reform since self-government arrangements for the ACf meant that the responsibility for defamation law reform in the ACT passed to the ACf Government. The Government, howevei'- supports attempts to achieve uniformity in defamation law in all Australian Jurisdictions. Consideration has been given at various times to the Commonwealth's power to enact national defamation law, including in relation to the broadcasting (posts and telegraphs) power and corporations power. In 1979, the Australian Law Reform Commission published its report ""Unfair Publication: Defamation and Privacy"" (Report No. 11). I am advised that the Report, among other things: discussed the Constitutional framework for defamation law; identified the deficiencies in the present law of defamation; and suggested options for reform: one option was for Commonwealth enacted defamation law. I am further advised that the ALRC Report identified the heads of Constitutional power which it argued would support, collectively, Commonwealth defamation laws. These included the posts and telegraphs power (s.51(v» and the corporations power (s.51(xx». Other relevant heads of power identified were: inter-State trade and commerce (s.51(i»; external affairs (s.51(xxix»; territories (s.122); incidental powers. I am advised that, in 1983, legal advice was given by the Attorney-General's Department which indicated, in some respects taking a different view to the ALRC, that Commonwealth Constitutional powers would be inadequate to achieve a uniform national defamation law. That opinion which is being reviewed canvassed, among other things, the extent of the posts and telegraphs power and the corporations power. Manufacturing Industry (Question No. 366)",111

293,Mr CAMERON,AMCOR,"the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 27 September 1993: Following the Government's changes to the retrospectivity element of the treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares held by pensioners, how will (a) pensions be affected by (i) rights issues; and (ii) bonus shares issues made after 18 August 1992 on shares bought before that date and (b) unit trusts and similar investments purchased before 18 August 1992 be affected. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) (i) If a pensioner purchases shares by taking up a rights issue after 18 August 1992, these shares will be assessed under the rules applying to shares acquired after 18 August 1992. This applies irrespective of when the shareholding on which the rights issue is made was acquired. The reason for this treatment is that because a person is required to commit further capital to obtain shares under a rights issue, the shares are considered to be acquired at the time they are obtained. (ii) Shares received from a bonus issue made after 18 August 1992 will be considered to have . been acquired on the same date as was the shareholding on which the bonus issue is being made. If the original shares were acquired on or before 18 August 1.992, the bonus shares will also be regarded as being acquired on that date. Accordingly, they would not be assessed under the rules for shares acquired after 18 August 1992. The reason for this treatment is that shares obtained from a bonus issue simply represent a restructuring of the capital a person has already committed when acquiring the original shares. (b) Unit trusts and similar investments (whether or not they are listed on a stock exchange) which were acquired on or before 18 August 1992 will continue to be assessed under the managed investment rules, as has always been the case. Capital growth on managed investments has been assessed as a form of income for Social Security since 1 November 1983, either on withdrawal from the investment or on an ongoing basis.

(5) No. Distribution of the kit was suspended on 9 September. Approximately 9,200 copies from an intended mailing of 9,412 were distributed to educational institutions with primary school aged students between 1 and 9 September. The kits were sent by Australia Post - ulk postage service. (6) No. However, the text for the insert has recently been agreed with the relevant industry association. The insert will take the form of two single adhesive-backed pages to be placed over existing text. 11,000 copies of the insert will be produced through the Australian Government Publishing Service. Costs, including printing and mailing, are yet to be determined. The insert will be distributed to schools as soon as final design and sent printing are completed. The statements on the two pages in question in the teaching guide in the kit provided generic information on the gases which contribute to the greenhouse effect, their sources and uses globally. As such, it was not directed specificaUy at Australian circumstances and therefore was not considered to impute anything in that regard. Pacific Highway: Funding (Question No. 390) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 27 September 1993: With respect to Commonwealth funding for those sections of the Pacific Highway from Sydney to Newcastle and the New England Highway that form part of the national highway system linking Sydney to Brisbane, what (a) was the (i) construction and (ii) maintenance expenditure for 1992-93, (b) was the construction expenditure for each year from 1980-81 to 1991-92 in (i) current and (ii) constant dollar terms, (c) sums were spent in each year from 1973-74 to 1979-80 in (i) current and (ii) constant doUar terms and (d) is the anticipated (i) construction and (ii) maintenance expenditure, including that for work committed or in progress, for 1993-94.

Badgerys Creek Airport (Question No. 399) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 28 September 1993: (1) What consultations have occurred between the Civil Aviation Authority, the Federal Airports Corporation and the aviation industry concerning the allocation of airspace at the proposed Badgerys Creek airport. (2) Did the consultations involve representatives of the industry based at (a) Bankstown, (b) Hoxton and (c) Camden airports; if not, why not. (3) What consultations will be held to resolve industry concerns about the future of general aviation at the (a) Bankstown, (b) Hoxton and (c) Camden airports when the Badgerys Creek facility becomes operational. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) have had preliminary discussions on the allocation of airspace at Badgerys Creek. Because the types and numbers of aircraft anticipated to operate at the airport are unconfirmed at this stage, discussions have been limited to basic concepts of airspace design only. When the FAC is able to confirm the planned operating modes for Badgerys Creek, the CAA will proceed with draft airspace designs and consultation with the aviation industry. (2) (a)-(c) Meetings between the FAC and the CAA did not involve representatives of the aviation industry because they were essentially briefing sessions for the CAA and discussions on the planning process. However, at an industry meeting held in Sydney in August 1993, the CAA identified the matter as requiring future discussion. (3) (a)-(c) When the proposed operating modes for the airport are known, the CAA, in consultation with aviation industry representatives and the FAC, will prepare draft airspace design proposals based on international practice. The consultation process will include discussion with industry representatives through the Sydney Regional Airspace Users Advisory Committee (RAPAC), the NSW AirCoordinating Sub-Committee and the Air Coordinating Committee in Canberra. Brisbane Airport (Question No. 402) Mr Jull asked the Minister for Tourism, upon notice, on 28 September 1993: (1) Has his attention been drawn to (a) a decision by the Minister for Transport and Communications to deny the request of the Queensland tourism industry to accelerate the construction of Brisbane's new international air terminal and (b) a statement by the General Manager of the Brisbane Airport, Mr Walker, that he had been told that the Government's priorities were in other places. (2) What evidence can the Government provide the Queensland tourism industry to show that the existing facilities at Brisbane Airport will cope with increasing traffic. (3) Is he able to say whether early completion of the new international air terminal in Brisbane could have been resolved if the Minister for Transport and Communications had responded to the request when he was approached in early 1993. Is he able to say whether the Minister for Transport and Communications, in a letter to Mr Carlo Schinella, Chairman of the Queensland Chapter of the Pacific Asia Travel Association, dated 26 August 1993, stated that the acceleration for the project did not meet the Federal Airport Corporation's commercial rates of return; if so, does he support the claim. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) Yes (b) I am aware of press reports attributing these comments to Mr Walker. I am also aware, however, that Mr Walker was reported to have said that he was confident that the existing terminal building could cope with extra demand. (2) This is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator the Hon Bob Collins. (3) This is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator the Hon Bob Collins. (4) This is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator the Hon Bob Collins. Regional Development (Question No. 407) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, upon notice, on 29 September 1993: (I) What are the details of the expenditure of $900 ()()() allocated to cooperative regional development in the 1993-94 Budget. (2) Who will benefit from the allocation. (3) Has the Government determined a precise role for his Department in the area of regional P9licy; if so, what is the role.",115
295,Mr GRIFFITHS,AMCOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The $900 000 figure relates to a transfer of funds from the Office of Labour Market Adjustment within the Employment, Education and Training portfolio to the Office of Regional Development within my portfolio. It is a rounded figure, made up of $750000 of program funds and $145 000 for administration including two ASL. The overall aim of the program is to demonstrate how existing Commonwealth, State and Local Government assistance, in cooperation with industry, can be coordinated and delivered more effectively with the objective of enhancing regional economic and employment growth. The Office of Regional Development has sought submissions from other Commonwealth Departments and from State and Territory Governments for projects suitable for funding. At this stage, the Office has performed preliminary assessments of sixteen projects, and more submissions are expected in the near future. No program funds have yet been expended. (2) The principal beneficiaries of the program will be industry and the unemployed within regions. (3) The Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development has responsibility for providing a focus for policy advice and coordination of program activity in pursuit of regional development. Currently the Department is servicing the Task Force on Regional Development, chairing a Commonwealth Inter-Departmental Committee examining options for improved program delivery for regional development, undertaking a review of the determinants of business sector investment decisions in regional Australia, and holding Commonwealth-State{ferritory Government discussions on ways to enhance cooperation between spheres of government in relation to regional development. The Department also administers regional development programs and cooperates with other agencies involved in delivery of programs that have regional development implications. Department of Social Security: Telephone Callers (Question No. 409)",118
296,Mr CAMERON,AMCOR,"the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 29 September 1993: Does his Department place telephone callers on a queue if there are no operators available to take calls immediately; if so, (a) what is the average number of callers waiting to be assisted at anyone time, (b) what is the average length of time taken for a call to be answered, (c) is it common for callers to wait for an hour and (d) what action is being taken to minimise waiting times, particularly for pensioners and persons having to stand in telephone boxes. . Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. (a) This information is not readily available. The Departmental standard for answering of calls is 60 seconds and on most occasions this standard is met. Around 70% of callers wait less than a minute to be connected to an operator. Queues can form during busy periods but these are usually cleared quickly. (b) During the week ending 24 September, average wait time across all benefitS throughout all TeleService Centres was 71 seconds. (c) No. (d) The Department has taken a number of steps to minimise waiting times. Specific action includes: (i) A special number has been put in place for Age Pensioners, 132300, which means that callers are connected direct to a specialist officer. The availability of this Age Pensioner number has been advertised in the Age Pension News, and is on all advices sent to Age Pension clients. (ii) Management-initiated permanent part-time positions have been negotiated with the Public Service Union so that officers are on the job at peak call times, and Departmental resources are· used efficiently and effectively. Clients phoning from public telephones are answered with the same speed and efficiency as people in their own homes. It is not possible to determine where a caller is phoning from, prior to answering the call. Roads: Expenditure (Question No. 411) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 29 September 1993: What sums has the Government allocated to expenditure on (a) the North-South Highway known as the Burke and Wills Way and (b) Kidman Way.

(b) The Federal Government has provided funding of $2.5 million under the Australian Land Transport Development Program for roadworks on the Kidman Way. Greenhouse Educational Kits (Question No. 414) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 30 September 1993: Did his Department distribute a kit entitled A teaching guide for school students on saving energy and the Greenhouse effect to primary schools; if so, (a) under which departmental sub-program was the kit distributed; (b) was the design and production of the kit put to public tender; (c) which firm did his Department employ to design and produce the kit; (d) did the same firm work on other projects related to the kit's objectives; if so, which projects; (e) were other organisations consulted on the text used in the kit; if so, (i) who were they and (ii) did they receive copies of the kit for scrutiny before it was distributed; (f) what sum was the firm referred to in paragraph (c) paid; (g) how many (i) teaching guides and (ii) videos were produced for the kit; (h) what was the cost of the (i) teaching guides and (ii) videos; (i) what were the (i) postage and (ii) handling costs of distributing the kits; U) to how many schools was the kit distributed; (k) to which age group or educational level was the kit directed; (1) is he able to say whether the kit was used at any school in a classroom situation; if so, how many schools used the kit in this way; (m) did he see the kit before it was distributed; (n) is it a fact that under the Ozone Protection Act 1989 persons have not been able since 31 December 1989 to manufacture in Australia or import into Australia aerosol products which contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) except for a few medical products such as inhalers or disinfectants for international aircraft; (0) do two fact sheets in the guide contained in the kit state that CFCs are gases that are used in aerosol cans; if so, (i) why was the statement made and (ii) does it ignore the provisions of the Ozone Protection Act 1989; (p) have schools been notified that the kit might be withdrawn; (q) has the kit been withdrawn; (r) by what method might the kit be withdrawn; (s) what would be the cost of withdrawing the kit; (t) who would be responsible for withdrawing the kit; (u) has his attention been drawn to any claims for damages made against the Commonwealth by any body alleging that the statement in the kit that CFCs are gases used in aerosol cans is defamatory to them; (v) have sums been paid in connection with the matter referred to in paragraph (u) to anybody for relief through (i) corrective advertising pursuant to section 80 of the Trade Practices Act, (ii) damages in respect of losses suffered as a result of the publication of incorrect information, (iii) permanent injunctions on further distribution or publication of incorrect information and (iv) costs; if so, in each case, what are the details; (w) what measures has his Department taken to ensure that schoolchildren who received misleading information from the kit were fully informed on the correct use of CFCs in aerosol cans; (x) is he able to say whether all schoolchildren who received misleading information from the kit have received the correct information; and (y) will the kit be redistributed after incorrect statements have been amended; if so, what will be the cost of (i) amending the kit and (ii) redistributing it, including payments to consultants, staff administration expenditure and postage and handling charges. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as fol1ows: Yes. (a) Sub-Program 2.4 : Energy. (b) No. (c) Marje Prior & Associates Pty Ltd of Canberra. (d) No. (e) No. However, development of the kit drew upon material available from a range of organisations, viz. ACT Department of Education and Training, ACT Electricity and Water (ACTEW), Australian Conservation Foundation, Australian Mining Industry Council, Commission for the Future, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Department of Primary Industries and Energy, Department of the Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories, Hydro-Electric Commission of Tasmania, NSW Coal Association, NSW Department of Minerals and Energy, Royal Australian Institute of Architects, State Electricity Commission of Victoria, State Energy Commission of WA, The Curriculum Corporation, and Victorian Solar Energy Council/Energy Information Centre (Energy Victoria) (f) $106 868. (g) (i) and (ii) 11 000 teaching guides, inclusive of the video which had been produced in 1992. (h) (i) $40 525. (ii) $57 868 for dubbing of the videos (i) (i) $37 593. (ii) $6 115. (j) Approximately 9 200 schools. (k) 9-11 year old children. (I) Apart from some market testing carried out towards the end of the development phase, no information is available on actual use in classrooms. (m) Yes. (n) Yes. (0) Yes. (i) The statement was made to provide generic information on the gases which contribute to the greenhouse effect, their sources and uses globally. As such, it was not directed specifically at Australian circumstances. (ii) No. See (i) above (P), (q), (r), (s) and (t) The question of withdrawSpots al of the kit is not under active consideration. (u) Yes. (v) No. (w) See paragraph (0) above. While the guide's text is not considered to impute anything against the Australian aerosol industry, in a spirit of cooperation the Department is discussing with the industry the provision of information to schools to explain the situation in Australia and the industry's leadership role in removing CFCs from Australian manufactured products. (x) The information referred to in paragraph (w) above will be distributed to the schools as soon as the necessary arrangements are completed. (y) Costs are yet to be determined. Pacific Highway (Question No. 416) Mr Neh) asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 30 September 1993: Will the Government make the Pacific Highway a national highway; if so, what is the timetable. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the fol1owing answer to the honourable member's question: No. When the dimensions of the National Highway System were considered by the Government in the context of determining the amount of Commonwealth road funds to be untied from 1 January 1994, the National Highway link between Newcastle and Brisbane was confirmed as the New England Highway. Roads: Funding (Question No. 417) Mr Neh) asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 30 September 1993: (1) Are the (a) Black Spots, (b) Provincial Cities and Rural Highways and (c) National Arterial Roads programs being discontinued. (2) Will the Government provide priority funding for the Pacific Highway, in addition to the $350 million in untied funding to the States for national arterial responsibilities; if so, how. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the fol1owing answer to the honourable member's question: (l)(a)-(c) Yes. Federal funding for the Black program and the Provincial Cities and Rural Highways program concluded at the end of 1992/93. Funding for the National Arterial Roads program will conclude on 31 December 1993. (2) From 1 January 1994 the Federal Government will focus its road funding on the National Highway System. This is consistent with the agreement reached by Heads of Government to better define road funding responsibilities between the three tiers of Government. The Pacific Highway is not a National Highway. However, ·$14.19 million for road works on the Pacific Highway will be paid from the National Arterial Program in 1993-94. (Question No. 418) Mr Nebl asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 30 September 1993: (1) Is it a fact that the road toll throughout Australia remains high. (2) Has the Government decreased the allocation to road safety and land transport research by 97.4 per cent; if so, why. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: In 1992 the number of road fatalities in Australia was 1,977. This compares to a figure of 2,941 in 1985. This represents a decrease of 33 per cent. In 1985 the nuinber of people hospitalised with serious injuries from road crashes was 29,248. The number of people hospitalised in 1992 was approximately 22,000. This represents a decrease of 25 per cent. Despite this significant improvement, road crashes are still a major problem for the Australian community, both in terms of human suffering and economic costs. (2) The decrease shown in Budget Paper No 1, Table 7A.3.1, for ""Road Safety and Land Transport Research"" represents the completion of the three year Blackspots program in 1992-93. Other road safety expenditures and land transport research have been maintained at the 1992-93 level ($1O.7m). This consists of $4.5 million shown in Table 7A.3.1 of Budget Paper No 1 and $6.2 million for road safety research and public education shown in the table on page 3.148 of the same document. Inspector-General of Intelligence and (Question No. 419) Mr Mack asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 5 October 1993: (1) Was Mr Roger Holdich, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, a Commonwealth public servant in 1978; if so (a) what office did he hold, (b) did he have responsibilities relating to the organisation of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting (CHOGRM) held in Sydney at the Sydney Hilton Hotel in 1978; if so, what were the responsibilities, (c) did he have any role in or connection with or Road Toll knowledge of the security arrangements for CHOGRM; if so, what was their nature and extent, and (d) did he have any connection or involvement or dealings with any Commonwealth or State security agency in relation to CHOGRM; if so, (i) with which agency and (ii) what was their nature and extent. (2) Is the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security conducting an inquiry concerning a complaint against ASIO lodged by Mr Richard Seary; if so, (a) when did the inquiry commence and (b) what (i) time and (ii) resources have been allocated to the inquiry to 5 October 1993.",118
297,Mr KEATING,AMCOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Mr Roger Holdich was a Commonwealth public servant in 1978. (a) He held the office of Assistant Secretary, External Relations and Defence Branch in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. (b) Yes. In November 1977, Mr Holdich chaired a meeting of Commonwealth officials from the Departments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Foreign Affairs, Administrative Services (including the Protective Services Co-ordination Centre) and Finance to discuss arrangements that might be put in place to prepare for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting (CHOGRM) which was held at the Sydney Hilton Hotel in 1978. As a result an administrative task force was formed under the chairmanship of another official from the Department of the Prime Minister and' Cabinet to make all the necessary administrative arrangements, including for security. Mr Holdich was nominated as Conference Secretary for the CHOGRM. In the lead-up to the CHOGRM he was responsible for the coordination of the policy briefing that was prepared for the Prime Minister to use in the Meeting and for liaison with the Security Commonwealth Secretariat in London. During the CHOGRM itself Mr Holdich was responsible for the smooth running of the Meeting and for liaison with the Commonwealth Secretariat on all matters relevant to the business of the Meeting, including the agenda, the preparation of notices, documents and records and the Meeting Communique. ' (c) Yes. The security arrangements for the CHOGRM were discussed briefly and in general terms at the meeting of Commonwealth officials in November 1977 which was chaired by Mr Holdich. Beyond this, I am advised that Mr Holdich had no involvement in, and no responsibility for, the detailed security arrangements for CHOGRM. (d) Yes, see (c) above. The Protective Services Co-ordination Centre was involved in the security arrangements for the CHOGRM and was represented at the meeting of Commonwealth officials already referred to. (2) The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Roger Holdich, is conducting an inquiry concerning a complaint against ASIO in relation to the 1978 Hilton Hotel bombing. It would not be appropriate, for privacy reasons, to identify the particular complainant. (a) The complaint was made to the Ins{X;ctorGeneral on 20 August 1991. Because it related to events which occurred before the enactment of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 the inquiry needed the Attorney-General's approval. This was given on 19 November 1991. Work on the inquiry began on 16 December 1991 once arrangements had been made to obtain additional staff. (b)(i) I am advised that the inquiry involves complex issues and has entailed many interviews and much research. Since December 1991 the Inspector-General and the Assistant Inspector General have devoted a significant amount of their time to this inquiry. In addition, it has been sary to allocate staff specifically to the investigation. The staff working on the inquiry have included a legal officer seconded from the Attorney General's Department in December 1991 for 10 months. This officer was supported at various times by two other officers. Subsequently one of the Office's permanent officers has worked full-time on the matter. However, because of staff movements and the pressure of other investigations, progress with the inquiry has been interrupted from time to time. (ii) Apart from staff allocated to the Office obtained additional funding totalling $30,000 over the financial years 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94 to meet the administrative costs of the inquiry. The inquiry into this complaint is one which is properly for the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to conduct, and the Government has confidence in Mr Holdich's ability to undertake the investigation thoroughly and objectively.

301,Mr WILLIS,AMCOR,"The Minister for the Arts and neces- Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Yes (a) 1,000 (b) 6-15 March 1993 (c) To help celebrate the Canberra Festival. (d) They had fulfilled their purpose. (e) r understand that the lights were donated to the Canberra Festival Committee, and that the ACT Electricity and Water Authority did not charge for I inquiry, the their installation and removal. (f) As far as I know the fairy lights are with their owners. Business Costs (Question No. 433) Mr Bradford asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 7 October 1993: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the imminent Republic closure of a factory owned and operated by the House of Jenyns in Queensland resulting in a loss 0[400 jobs. (2) Has his attention ,been drawn to claims by a spokesperson for the business blaming the closure in part because of payroll tax, superannuation, workers' compensation, long service leave and holiday leave loading costs, which added to wage costs, made it impossible to compete with Asian operators. (3) What action is the Government taking to reduce costs to businesses to enable them to become internationally competitive.",122
302,Mr BEAZLEY,AMCOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) According to reports the House of Jenyns, a Brisbane lingerie manufacturer, will cease manufacturing in Australia in July next year and will concentrate its manufacturing operations in Asia. The company is owned by the German based Triumph International, the third largest lingerie manufacturer in the world. The relocation will result in the loss of 317 jobs. The company plans to close its Ipswich factory, with a loss of 200 jobs, while there will be a further loss of 117 jobs at Wynnum in Brisbane. (2) Australian labour costs are higher than those of Asia. Data from the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Authority indicate that for this type of clothing, even after accounting for on-costs, Australian labour costs are still around 12 times greater than those of many Asian countries. However, this does not take into account the higher levels of labour productivity in Australia relative Asia. Many of the on-costs referred to are State Government concerns (payroll tax and workers compensation) or are a matter for negotiation between workers and employers, such as holiday leave loading and long service leave. The superannuation measures introduced by the Federal Government are designed to encourage domestic saving and reduce the call on government revenues in the longer term, thereby easing the tax burden on individuals and businesses. Among advanced western economies Australia has a competitive advantage when it comes to labour on-costs. In 1992, Australia's on-costs ranked fourth lowest out of the 19 OECD countries for which data were available, representing 25.4 per cent of total hourly remuneration, compared with an OECD average of 35.3 per cent. Given Australia's ranking on its level of on-costs, there is no reasonable justification for businesses to move offshore to avoid reasonable costs that provide for such things as worker compensation in the case of accidents and superannuation to fund retirement. (3) The Government is taking measures to reduce costs to Australian businesses to ensure that they become more internationally competitive. The microeconomic reform agenda as a whole is designed to achieve this goal. For example, the Government's tariff reduction program is designed to reduce the distortion that tariffs produce in the cost structure of the economy and its reforms of government business enterprises are designed to reduce costs to business. The Government's program to increase the international competitiveness of the textile, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry specifically is contained in its Post-88 TCF Plan. This plan includes: the removal of tariff quotas; the lowering of tariffs; rationalisation of policy by-laws; the introduction of an Industries Development Strategy comprising a number of funded programs to assist companies to restructure and reequip; and adjustment measures to aid workers displaced during the process of restructuring. The TCF industry has been required to undertake substantial adjustment in part because of the higher than average levels of protection that it has enjoyed over the years. Available evidence suggests that the adjustment process in the clothing industry tends to result in the production of low quality budget garments moving offshore. However, while this occurs, companies that produce higher quality garments are keeping their manufacturing operations in Australia. to This occurs for reasons of quick response to changing market conditions and a concern over the quality of products. The Government has made available $160 million in financial assistance to help the TCF industry through the restructuring needed to make it a viable and efficient industry. Furthermore, assistance is available to workers displaced by this process under the TCF Labour Adjustment Package (LAP). This assistance includes: formal vocational training (including payment of formal training allowance); preparatory training (English language, literacy and n()meracy training as required); wage subsidies; and relocation assistance to commence a new job, search for employment or undertake formal training. Assistance is also available to enterprises to assist with the management of restructuring and labour adjustment measures. Managed Investments and Share Trusts (Question No. 434) Mr Bradford asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 7 October 1993: (I) Is hardship being caused to many pensioners because of the Government's treatment of unrealised capital gains on managed investments and share trusts as income. (2) Why is the Government treating un realised capital gains on managed investments and share trusts as income. (3) What advice is he able to provide pensioners whose pensions have been reduced to below subsistence levels by the Government's treatment of their investments. (4) Is the level of national saving too low. (5) Is the treatment of managed in-estments inconsistent with that of investment housing. (6) Is it a fact that, to restore their pensions, pensioners may liquidate their investments and spend the proceeds on home improvem.ents; if so, will this result in increased Commonwealth outlays on social security. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Since March 1993, the assessment of income from managed investments (including listed trusts) has been based upon the actual performance of the investment product over the previous 12 months. This means that income is assessed only where there has been an improvement in the pensioner's financial circumstances. Where the investment performance has been negative, income losses are assessed, and these can be offset against other investment income. The impact of these rules on pension entitlements also needs to take account of the overall operation of the pension income test. Pensioners are able to have assessable income of up to $2288 pa (single) and $3952 pa (married couple) before being affected under the income test. For income above these limits, pension is reduced by 50 cents for each dollar of income. Pension entitlement ceases at $19,000.80 pa (single) and $31,647.20 pa. (married couples). Consequently, pensioners must have a substantial level of assessable income (after any losses have been deducted) for large pension reductions to occur. Pensioners can, if they wish, their investment to make up any reduction in pension and thereby arrest any perceived hardship they might otherwise incur. It is, of course, a personal decision whether pensioners wish to sell all or part of their managed investments. (2) The social security income test looks at the means available to people to provide ;)r their support, and determines how much they shou'! be paid relative to how well they can support themselves. As nominal gains on managed investments are readily realisable, people are able to utilise them for their self-support. It would not be equitable to ignore gains on managed investments, as this would advantage clients who invested in these areas over clients who chose to use their savings to generate other forms of income, such as bank interest. Capital growth on managed investments has been assessed as a form of income for social security pension purposes since 1 November 1983, either on withdrawal from the investment or on an ongoing basis. Prior to 1988, capital growth on managed investments was assessed as income when the investment was realised. Now, for all investments purchased after September 1988, capital growth is assessed as income during the term of the investment, and not on its realisation. One of the reasons these changes were made was to minimise the incidence of significant reductions in pension entitlement occasioned by assessing all capital growth on realisation of the investment. The approach of assessing all returns on investments-whether in the form of unrealised gain or cash returns-ensures that all liquid investments are treated consistently, and that pensioners invest funds on the intrinsic merits of the investment rather than whether the investment is ""pension friendly"". (3) If a person has been relying on the pension for support whilst preserving capital gains on managed investments, and their pension is subsequently reduced as a result of the assessment of capital gains, one possible option for that person is to utilise some of their capital gain to supplement their income. It is, of course, a matter of personal choice whether they adopt such a course of action. (4) Comments on the level of national saving are a matter for the Treasurer. (5) Unrealised capital gains are assessed as income for managed investments, but not for investment real estate, for several reasons: (a) managed investments are highly liquid and usually easily realised; (b) managed investments have a relatively low unit price which means they can be sold in small realise a portion of parcels; (c) shares and managed investments have a readily accessible market with known prices. By contrast, real estate investments do not enjoy these features. Capital gains on real estate cannot normally be realised without liquidating the whole investment. Also, the market for real estate can be less accessible and more difficult to price .. (6) Pensioners can, and have for many years been able to, liquidate investments to finance home improvements, regardless of the form of such investments. Such action is not considered to be de-rivation of income under the Social Security Act. However, it is considered unlikely that people will liquidate all of their investments and spend the proceeds on the family home. As noted in the answer to Part (I), pensioners would, at the most, need to liquidate only a portion of their investment to replace any pension reduction. On this basis, pensioners would be worse off in terms of the liquid resources at their disposal by selling managed investments and spending the proceeds on their home in order to preserve their pension. PRISMOD Simulations (Question No. 436)",123
303,Mr COSTELLO,AMCOR,"the Treasurer, upon notice, on 7 October 1993: (1) How many simulations using the Price, Revenue, Incidence Simulation Model (PRISMOD) have been run in the Treasury's Taxation Policy Division since March 1992. Input/Output Date March 1992 May 1992 June 1992 July 1992 August 1992 September 1992 October 1992 December 1992 February 1993 March 1993 April 1993 May 1993 June 1993 August 1993 October 1993 (b) With the exception of the simulations performed in August 1993 of certain measures announced in the 1993-94 Budget, the simulations cited at 2(a) relate to work undertaken in the exploration and consideration of policy options. Release of information on the assumptions, results or outcomes of these simulations would not be in the public interest, as it would disclose deliberations undertaken in the process of policy exploration, including deliberations on tax policy. Information on the underlying assumptions and results of simulations undertaken in August 1993 of certain measures announced in the Budget have, however, been released in documents tabled in the Senate on 7 September 1993. (2) With respect to each simulation, (a) when was it run and (b) what were the (i) underlying assumptions, (ii) results and (iii) outcomes. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A PRISMOD simulation has two components. One module performs an input/output simulation (using PRISMOD.lO) which provides information on the revenue, industry cost and price effects of indirect taxes and other charges by governments. (Some State, Territory and local government indirect taxes and charges are modelled, as well as Commonwealth ones.) Another module performs a distributional simulation (using PRISMOD.DIST). Between 1 March 1992 and 14 October 1993, 59 input/output and 14 distributional simulations have been run. (2)(a) The simulation dates and the number of simulations run on each date are listed below: Distributional Number of Number of Simulations Date Simulations 1 August 1993 10 1 September 1993 4 4 3 1 6 2 6 2 4 4 10 2 6 7 Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Official Establishments: Kirribilli House, Painting (Question No. 439)",125
304,Mr CONNOLLY,AMCOR,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 7 October 1993: (1) Was Kirribilli House recently repainted. (2) Were any sections painted twice; if so, (a) why, (b) what sections were painted twice, (c) who requested the painting be done twice and (d) what was the cost of painting the sections twice.",125
305,Mr KEATING,AMCOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The full exterior and one section of internal hallway of Kirribilli House were repainted in October 1992. In September 1993 some remedial internal painting was also completed to remove wear and tear marks and to touch up ceiling deterioration. (2) No section was repainted twice unless the application of primer, undercoat and/or more than one top coat, as required technically, is considered 'twice'. Depending on the condition and type of surface, more than one coat was necessary: masonry walls were given one finishing coat, all other surfaces two finishing coats and, where repairs were necessary, filling, priming and undercoats were used. Parliamentary Zone: Landscaping (Question No. 443)",126
306,Mr CONNOLLY,AMCOR,"the Minister the Housing, Local Government and Community Services, upon notice, on 7 October 1993: What are the specifications for the Parliamentary Zone mall landscape construction project and what will it cost.",126
307,Mr HOWE,AMCOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Parliamentary Zone mall landscape project involves the restoration and reinstatement of the path system and tree plantings between King George and King Edward Terrace and across the mall adjacent to the Parkes Place fountains. Existing damaged and dangerous bitumen paths are being replaced by new paths, essentially following the existing path alignment. The new paths are of consolidated red gravel, to match the forecourt of Parliament House. Existing planter beds are being raised to increase soil depth and improve drainage, new planter beds are being created and collapsed grated drains are being replaced. Some dangerous poplars are being replaced and missing ones reinstated to restore the plantings to the original plans of Walter Burley Griffin and TG Weston. New hedges are also being planted around some of the trees. Over 2,000 new plants are being planted and new irrigation systems are being installed. The project is expected to be completed before Christmas. The total cost of the work will be in the order of $400,000. Defence: Aquatic Centre Project (Question No. 444)",126
308,Mr CONNOLLY,AMCOR,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 7 October 1993: Did the Minister's Department pay Australian Construction Services in Adelaide a sum associated with an aquatic centre project; if so, (a) what sum, (b) for what services was the sum paid and (c) why was the Minister's Department involved in the project.",126
309,Mr BEAZLEY,AMCOR,"The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) & (b) Yes. The Department of Defence, through the Defence Support Centre Woomera, has engaged Australian Construction Services as project manager for the construction of a new swimming pool at Woomera Village. The pool will replace a facility now more than thirty years old and beyond economic repair. The Commonwealth Gazette No. PD 36 of 15 September 1993 at page 3933 reflects the orders placed with Australian Construction Services for $1,380,000 for construction of the pool and $189,910 for design, advice and technical I supervision. As of 29 October, only $47,000 had been paid to Australian Construction Services and ACS had not issued a Request for Tender. (c) The Department of Defence administers the township of Woomera, which exists primarily to support the Joint Defence Facility Nurrungar. Defence Arms and Ammunition: Stolen (Question No. 445)",126
310,Mr CONNOLLY,AMCOR,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 7 October 1993: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 166 (Hansard, 18 August 1993, page 236), has the Minister's attention been drawn to the number of separate thefts of (a) 9mm pistols and ammunition and (b) 7.62mm self loading rifles and ammunition; if so, (i) is there a pattern to the thefts, (ii) to which units or agencies within or outside the Australian Defence Force have the thefts been referred for investigation and (iii) is the Minister able to say whether 9mm ammunition is used in any non-military weapons. Mr BeazJey-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. My attention has been drawn to the number of separate incidents of thefts of 9mm pistols, 7.62mm self loading rifles and ammunition to these weapons, through the response provided to question No. 166 (Hansard, 18 August 1993, page 236). Noting the theft of weapons and ammunition from 1 January 1988 to 30 September 1993, some patterns are evident in the thefts: (a) Of the 20 separate incidents of 9mm pistol thefts about 75 per cent have been from unit armouries and have been perpetrated by Defence personnel. Forced entry was not a factor. The remaining incidents involved, or possible involved, civilians in opportunistic thefts of unsecured weapons from service vehicles and public displays. Eleven of the twenty-three 9mm pistols stolen have been recovered .. (b) The majority of stolen 7.62mm self loading rifles are drill purpose or innocuous rifles. These rifles were mostly stolen from Army and Navy cadet units which commonly parade at community halls. Physical security arrangements for the storage of cadet weapons have been reviewed. While there were five separate incidents of theft of live 7.62mm self loading rifles during the period, none have been recorded since 1990. Three of the five rifles stolen were recovered. (i) In only one of the incidents, the theft of a 7.62mm self loading rifle, was there a linkage with the theft of ammunition. (ii) Defence security policy requires that the loss, theft, attempted theft or recovery of arms, ammunition, explosives or pyrotechnics, or the break-in or attempted break-into armouries, magazines, bulk weapons stores or explosives storehouses, be immediately reported to the nearest Service police unit and the nearest civil police station. Service police units are required to forward the results of their investigations and any investigations by Federal, State and Territory police to the Single Service Heads,of Police and security staff. (c) Both 9mm and 7.62mm ball ammunition used by Defence can be used in civilian weapons of similar calibre. Similarly, Service 9mm pistols and 7.62mm self loading rifles can fire certain civilian ammunition. Aborigines: Eva Valley Meeting (Question No. 464) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 18 October 1993: Who paid for bussing Aborigines to the Eva Valley, NT, meeting and what was the cost. Mr Tickner-The following information is provided in addition to my answer to the honourable member's question in Hansard on 28 October 1993 at page 2854: The Aboriginal Reconciliation Unit of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet paid $5,357 to bus participants from South Hedland, Roeboume and Darwin to and from the Eva Valley meeting.
