1,Mr CLARKE,Unknown,"I asked the Acting Minister representing the Postmaster-General on Thursday lost a question with reference to the installation of the telephone system at Grafton. The Minister's reply was .that the matter was then being inquired into, and I should like .to know if he has yet received any information.",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"There has been a series of most untoward accidents in this telephone .extension. After the tenders were called, two contractors, each of whom had his tender accepted in turn, failed to carry out the work. The vote expired on the 30th June last, and it was necessary to wait until the. sum appropriated was revoted in the Bill, which is to receive the assent of the Acting Governor General today. I assure the honourable member that there will be no further delay. PEARL - SHELLI NG INDUSTRY .",14
3,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,I should like to know what are the intentions of the Government regarding the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act in relation to the pearl-shelling industry in Northern Queensland during the recess 1,14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Arrangement s are now being completed. I hope that in a day or two we shall be in a position to take such measures as will allow the owners of the pearl-shelling fleets to replace the men who are returning to their homes. We shall require a satisfactory guarantee that these men will not enter the Commonwealth except for the purpose of being signed on, or under short exemptions, and that they shall be expatriated at the termination of their engagement. In addition, a movement is taking place, which we shall be able to assist by other means, for reducing the number of aliens who were in the Commonwealth prior to the operation of the present Act. Careful returns are being prepared showing the names of all aliens who enter the Commonwealth in connection with the pearl-shelling industry or otherwise, and each person will be carefully marked off only when he. leaves the Commonwealth at the expiration of his term of engagement. By an alteration of the administrative methods hitherto pursued we hope to obtain at. Thursday Island what has not been secured up to the presenta complete record of those coloured aliens who are' in, enter, or leave the Commonwealth. ELECTORAL BILL .

PARLIAMENTARY TOUR.  attention of the Minister for Home Affairs to a report appearing in one of the newspapers regarding the discussion which took place yesterday upon the tour proposed to be made by Members of Parliament during the recess. It is represented that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports asked, by way of interjection, whether cigars and whisky were to be provided, and that the Minister replied- "" If the Government will not pay for them. I will do it myself."" I wish to ask the Minister if he said that if the Government dkl not pay for the whisky and cigars for honourable members, he would pay for them himself.",15

7,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I desire to know day whether the Minister for Home Affairs when explaining a certain item on the Estimates stated that it was intended to give the honourable member for Gippsland an opportunity to visit the sites proposed for the federal capital, because he had been unable to join in the tours of inspection previously undertaken ?",15
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I mentioned whether that there were seven or eight honourable members who could not ' go when the bers previous trips were organized, and that amongst them was the honourable member today ? for Gippsland, who could not very well travel in the same way as others. I had previously spoken to the honourable member on the subject, and there were six or seven others, who I , understood, were prepared make the trip through Gippsland to Bombala. I thought it was only right to offer to those honourable members the same facilities as were afforded to others.",15
9,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"As a matter of personal explanation, I think it is only right to say that no one had a right to use my name in mates for next year by £62,000 connection with expenditure such as that referred to. I stated distinctly to this House that when the number of sites would be reduced to four or five, I should visit them in my own time and at my own expense.",15
10,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,When does the Minister for Home Affairs propose to appoint the committee of experts to consider the claims of the proposed capital sites ?,15
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"As soon as possible after the prorogation, when we are in the calm of recess, I intend to lay the matter before my colleagues.",15
12,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"In view of the importance, of having the report ready for submission to Parliament when the next session opens, I desire to know whether the Minister for Home Affairs is prepared to say that the appointment of the committee of experts will be one of the first acts of the Government in recess.",15
13,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Certainly . I shall bring the matter before my colleagues within a very few days. PUBLICSERVI CE ACT.,15
14,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Can.the Minister for Home Affairs tell us when the Public Service Act will be brought into operation 1,15
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I cannot fix exact date. I had a conversation yesterwith the Public Service Commissioner; who told me that as soon as two or three matters connected with the regulations can be finally dealt with, the Act will be proclaimed. Probably this will be done within a month, and possibly within a fortnight. DEFENC E RETRENCHMENT .",15
16,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I should like to know the Acting Minister for Defence is in a position to lay before honourable memthe details of the defence retrenchment, which he said he would endeavour to present",15
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"If 1 were to submit full details of the proposed scheme I . should occupy a considerable time, but in view of the statements made in reference to to the direction in which retrenchment should take place 1 think it is due to myself that I should present a summary of the proposed scheme. On referring to Hansard I find that last week I statedI undertake to reduce the expenditure for the present year as stated, and to reduce the EstiI give my word, which I hopefchecommittee will accept . . . thabfchereductions be made, not in the direction which some honourable members seem to fear, but mainly in expenses of the administration staff. I cannot give particulars now, but I shall take care the spirit offchedebate to-night is reflected in reductions, and that honourable members shall not be in any way hoodwinked or misled. Later on I saidThe Estimates include rifles and warlike but do not embrace the construction and maintenance of works. The leader offcheOpposition says that it is desired that the reduction is to be effected this year shall not apply to provision which is made for warlike stores. That is not intended, and will not be done. Next year a little more or a little less money may be appropriated for warlike stores, accordin ingfcothe requirements of the year. the amounts provided on the Estimates for the purchase of warlike stores quite as low as I felt justified in doing, and the reductions in accordance with the wish of the House will be effected in connection with the administration, from the Head-quarters Staff downwards. That is the gist of what I said. I do not want honourable members to think that the whole reduction can be made in the cost of the administrative staff. In order fco show fchafc this is so, I have had prepared a'return showing the cost of the administrative staff, including all' permanently employed officers and non-commissioned officers, other than permanent artillery and permanent engineers. The total is £72,148, State staffs; and it is manifest that, on such a sum, it would be quite impossible to make a reduction of £62,000. received from the General Officer Commanding, a report suggesting reductions in order to effect a saving of £62,000. A summary of that report shows that it is proposed fco reduce the Head-quarters Staff by two officers and one clerk. In each of two - of the States, a commanding officer has been retired under the provision as to age limit, but I do not think I ought to mention names. In the administrative and instructional staff it is proposed to do away with ten positions for commissioned ficers, made up of four in New South Wales, two in Victoria, and one each in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and TasSouth mania. Of these ten positions, four are already vacant, so that only six officers would retire. It is proposed to dispense with the. services of fourteen warrant non-commissioned officers, made up of nine in New South Wales, two in Queensland, one in South Australia, and two in Tasconsider mania ; and to reduce the establishment of Sir William Lynt the permanent artillery by ten officers and will 363 non-commissioned officers and men. the The establishment of the artillery is now short by seven officers, and about 100 men, that and these vacancies, which - would not be the refilled, are included in the proposed reductions. The establishment of the permanent artillery would then remain at 33 officers, and 660 non-commissioned officers and men. It is stores, proposed to reduce the permanent engineers by three officers-tw o of these positions are which at present vacant-and by four non-comthe missioned officers and men. A reduction in contingencies is expected by £6,436 ; in the cost of camps of instruction, £ 6 , 0 2 5 ; and expenditure on uniforms for reservists, I reduced New South Wales, £800.",15
18,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Are there no reductions to be made in the civil branch 1,16
19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"- I believe it is proposed to dispense with one or two clerks in the civil branch. I have told the General Officer Commanding that the Headquarters Staff, and also the Head-quarters Staffs in the States must ""be still further reduced to a considerable extent. I have suggested that a conference should be held, or that the General Officer Commanding should devise some more simple method of dealing with the business, especially in the States, so as not to necessitate including the passing of so many papers, which compels the employment of numerous clerks I give the House this information in order. I have to protect myself, and to show what steps have been taken in regard to the recommendations already made. NA INSTRUCTORS.",16
20,Mr BATCHELOR,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,I should like fco ask the Acting Minister for Defence what reductions are proposed in the South Australian Instructional Staff?,16
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I think the proofposal is to reduce the staff by one. I may tell the honourable member, for his own satisfaction and that of other representatives of Australia, that I have told the General Officer Commanding that, in my opinion, the instructors generally will have to be reduced by one-half. That, of course, will and mean the reduction of the number of instructors in South Australia by one-half.",16
22,Mr BATCHELOR,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Does the Minister that a reduction of the Instructional Staff by one-half is fairly carrying out his promise made when the Estimates were under consideration? That promise was that the line providing for the instructional staff in South Australia would be altogether omitted.,16
23,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The honourable member must be gifted with second hearing, because I never said anything of the kind.",17
24,Mr BATCHELOR,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The ""numbers"" would have been against the honourable gentleman had such a promise not been made. Sir WILLIAM LYNE , - I said then pracextract tically what I am saying today. I did not fix the number, but I think I led honourable members to understand ' that I presumed there would be probably a reduction by one-half. I do not think it would be just to the forces to altogether withdraw the instructors.",17
25,Mr BATCHELOR,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,That was not the idea conveyed at the time.,17
26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I have done used unless my best, and I am going a great deal further than was intended, by now asking the General Officer Commanding to make a general reduction in the instructional staff peat it now. by one-half.",17
27,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Can the Minister ter point to any remarks of his in Hcmsa/rd which bears out his present statement ?,17
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I cannot very well point to any particular passage, but do not think that the honourable member can point to any words of mine in Hansard which bear the meaning he has indicated. I never made any such statement.",17
29,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I make the statement that I had the assurance from the Minister that this line in the Estimates would be struck out.  during the discussion on the Defence Estisatisfactory. mates the Minister for Home Affairs said that he was going to strike out which provided for the instructional staff in South Australia : that subsequently, same day, he said he had been informed by the Clerk, that such action could not be taken ; and that he then said he would see that the money was not expended ?",17
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I said that I was going to strike out the line in regard to the instructors; but I said further, it should not have appeared in that - that the money should have been out of another item. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - I should ceedingly like to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, when the Defence Estimates before this House, I was not induced to stay my hand in this matter of moving that the line relating to drill instructors be omitted by a suggestion made to me? Mr L. E. GEOOM - In the House 1 Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - Yes .",17
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"B y me ? Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - I did not say that the suggestion was made by the Acting Minister for Defence: but I would direct his attention to the following from the Hansard report of his speech, which is to be found at page 16430 :As to the drill instructors, it has been explained to me that to withdraw the amount from the Estimates now would cause a great deal ot trouble. Therefore I wish to say that I shall deal with the matter in another way, which I think will be satisfactory to all parties. The amount will be continued upon the Estimates, but ib will not be it is absolutely wanted, and I venture to think that the whole of it will not be wanted.",17
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The report is correct. I made that statement, and I re",17
33,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"But the Minisproposes to retain five instructors, which is contrary to the understanding.",17
34,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"As the first part of the honourable member's question was addressed I to me, I would state that except that I knew that there had been some proposal for the reduction of the number of drill instructors, I knew nothing of any understanding in reference to them. As I was passing from the Chamber when the matter was before the committee, I think the honourable member, who had been following the question very closely, made some observation to me that the settlement now proposed was What that settlement was, or how it was proposed to be made, I did not the line then nor do I now know.",17
35,Mr BATCHELOR,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,The understanding was on the that the line would be withdrawn. PATENTS. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - About six months ago this House called for a return in reference to patents. I should like that to know from the Minister for Trade and way Customs what progress has been made in paid the preparation of that return ?,17
36,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,It has been an exdifficult and lengthy job to obtain information; and I find that the papers were have not-yet been sent to my office. NA,17
37,Mr MAHON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Can the Acting Prime Minister tell us whether it is proposed, during the recess, to ""convert the present select committee on the Bonuses for factures Bill into a Royal commission that be the intention, I would remind the honourable gentleman that the session has lasted a long time, and that a Royal sion will mean a considerable strain on the Hansard staff, who, I understand, will called upon to report the evidence. Does the Acting Prime Minister consider that that is quite fair to the reporters 1 I wish to know if the Acting Prime Minister knows of any precedent in the history Parliament of a select committee being"" transformed into a Royal commission ?",18

39,Mr TUDOR,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Does the Minister for Home Affairs know whether it is tion of the Public Service Commissioner to pay the men employed in the general division of the public service the minimum wage of £110, as soon as he receives information proving that the men are entitled to the advantage, or does the Commissioner intend to wait until the men in the clerical division have passed the necessary examActing ination ?",18
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I should have again 1 liked notice of the question, having regard to its importance, and the liability to take in making a reply. As far as I know, I believe, that as soon as the Commissioner is in a position to say that the men referred to are qualified to do the work, they will get the minimum wage.",18
41,Mr TUDOR,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,-But will the Commissioner BILL. wait for the men in the clerical branch to pass the examination before he gives the wage to the men in the general branch %,18
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I think that Manuthe minimum wage should commence as "" ? If from the same time in both branches.",18
43,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,But the men in the general branch are entitled to the wage as commissoon as the Act is proclaimed.,18
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,What I mean be is that those entitled to the wage should receive it as from the same time that those in the other division receive it . When the also Government are in a position to give a minimum wage to one division it will be of given to the other division.,18

46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"At the present the moment, I am not aware of the intentions of the Commissioner. I have had no conversation with him on this point, but I anticipate that he will satisfy himself as to the qualifications of the men in the general branch, not by a technical examination, bub on probably by some practical examination. Without knowing exactly what is in the mind of the Commissioner, I think that before he does anything he will very likely consult me as to the best course to be adopted.",18

49,Mr HIGGINS,COMMENCEMENT OF NEXT,"I desire'to ask the Prime Minister when, so far as he can foresee, we shall be called together",18
50,Mr DEAKIN,COMMENCEMENT OF NEXT,"The question demands misan amount of foresight of which I am quite incapable. Our meeting next session will depend very largely, first on circumstances that may intervene after the rising of the House, and, in the next place, on the business which it may be possible to introduce in consequence of the recent visit of the Prime Minister to the mother countiy. That visit had reference not only to the questions of defence which were considered at the Imperial Conference, but also to inquiries directed to a number of other matters of practical importance, such as the appointment of a Commonwealth High Commissioner, and the conversion of the debts. If the inquiries of the Prime Minister on these points enable the Government to mature the measures dealing with them sufficiently early, it may then be necessary to provide for a session of some duration before this Parliament closes.",18
51,Mr HIGGINS,COMMENCEMENT OF NEXT,"Suppos e the conversion of the debts is not undertaken, will that affect the date of meeting ?",19

55,Mr BATCHELOR,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"I desire to ask the Acbing Minister for Defence whether ib will nob be found, after he has made his reductions in the Defence Estimates relating to South Australia, that the forces there still cost more than they did prior to being taken over by the Commonwealth ?",19
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"There may, or may not, be an increase over the actual expenditure of last year. I have already explained the matter by showing that last year's expenditure was not as great as it would ordinarily have been, owing to the fact that a number of men in the forces went to South Africa, and that while they were on service there pay was not debited to South Australia but was met by the Imperial Government.",19
57,Mr BATCHELOR,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,The same thing has occurred in every State.,19
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"It is unfair to compare the actual expenditure for last year with the Estimates for this year. In view of the fact' I have stated, last year's actual expenditure cannot fairly be compared' with the Estimates for the current financial year. PROROGATION CEREMONY.",19
59,Mr OMALLEY,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister why, in view of the fact that this House comes directly from the people and acts directly back on the people - and that ,in all Assemblies where some sit, and many stand, the sitters are considered superior to the standers-member s of another place should not be brought down here in connection with the prorogation ceremony? Will the Acting Prime Minister see that in future the closing ceremony takes place in this House ?",19
60,Mr DEAKIN,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"In closing the session in the other branch of the Legislature, we follow an historic precedent, dating back many hundreds of years.",19
61,Mr OMALLEY,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,We should create precedents.,19
62,Mr DEAKIN,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"It is a precedent not to be lightly departed from in any case, and especially in view of the fact bhat members of anobher place are elected by the whole body of the elecbors as we are elected.",19
63,Mr OMALLEY,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,But they represent only water and trees and bandicoots.,19
64,Mr DEAKIN,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,I think that the compliment that we pay to them cannot be cavilled at.,19
65,Mr WATSON,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"Why not prorogue by proclamation, and save all the fuss ?",19
66,Mr DEAKIN,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"J u s t as the President, by tradition takes precedence of Mr Speaker, so, according to custom, we concede to honourable members of another place a precedence which simply marks our respect. What we value is real power. In matters of precedence we are perfectly prepared to bow to them. REMISSION OF FODDER DUTIE S.",19
67,Mr BROWN,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"I should like to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, in view of the fact that the drought in Queensland and New South Wales still continues, and that the outlook for the farmers and pastoralists is, if anything, more unpromising than ever - and having regard also to the fact that the disasters occasioned by the drought are extending to Victoria-the Government can see their way to remit the fodder duties, so as to enable the farmers to save their starving stock?",19
68,Mr DEAKIN,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"I see no prospect of any such remission. The fact that Victoria is now suffering as the States of New South Wales and Queensland have most unhappily suffered cannot alter our attitude, ti which must be in accordance with the needs and wishes of-the whole of the people of Australia. Their deepest sympathy goes out to the afflicted districts, but the permanent policy of the whole cannot be dictated even by their temporarily sad condition.",19
69,Mr BROWN,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"Then the Australian attitude is starvation ! Ministers laid upon the table the following papers :1. Defence Department - Minute by the - General Officer Commanding on proposed further reduction in Estimates. Minutes in regard to promised further reduction in the Military Estimates.

70,Mr FOWLER,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether it is correct, as - reported in the press, that the Government have appointed a gentleman to act as the representative of the Commonwealth at the Durbar at Delhi, and, if so, whether the appointment will involve any additional expenditure 1",20
71,Mr DEAKIN,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"No appointment has been made, and no nomination will be made' until the Prime Minister returns. ""When a nomination is made, it will involve practically no expense to .the Commonwealth. TRANSFERRE D DEPARTMENTS . Sir LANGDON BONYTHON asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether he will give the House a statement of the cost of each of the transferred departments in South Australia for each of the post three financial years; and 2. Whether he will explain the reasons for the apparent increased cost provided for each department on this year's Estimates ?",20
72,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"The honourable member asked me a question in regard to this matter some time ago. I mentioned then that I had applied on two occasions to the Treasurer of South Australia for certain information, but that it had not been furnished. Immediately afterwards I made a third application for the information, but up to the present time. I have not even had an acknowledgment of my request. AVe have the information so far as the two years which have elapsed since the inauguration of the Commonwealth are concerned, but in regard to the previous year we have to pick out the details from various documents. That has been done to some extent by my accountant, who is a very careful officer; but I do not desire to make any official statement with regard to the expenditure in any State until I have satisfied myself as well as I can that it is correct. I shall then be able to give the Treasurer of the State in question PAPERS. an opportunity to point out any inaccuracy if a mistake has been made. I have not had an opportunity to examine the information which has been obtained, but propose to do so as early as possible. I shall endeavour to obtain the official information from South Australia, as I have obtained it from the other States. As soon as I have completed the statement, I shall take care that it is circulated amongst honourable members, and made public. Taking into consideration the fact that we are now constructing new works and buildings out of revenue instead of out of loan moneys, and that in some years we have had to pay off heavy arrears belonging to an earlier period, we shall be able to show that there has been no extravagant increase. The increase will be small indeed, and will have been occasioned by the growing .necessities of the Postal department, and similar demands in other directions. SUGAR EXCISE DUTY"".",20
73,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"for Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ) asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Whether he has read and considered the petition of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, dated 18th August, 1902? 2. Does that petition allege that, while under a certain section of the Excise Act sugar in the free store of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited was charged the full duty, other companies and individuals, in whose case the dut}' was equally chargeable, were allowed to go free ? 3. Is it a fact that through this error of the Customs officers a sum of about £25,000 was lost to the revenue ? 4. Will he cause inquiry to be made, and Lay on the table of the House the fullest information connected therewith ?",20
74,Mr KINGSTON,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1 and 4. I have read and considered the petition. Every information required by the House will be supplied. 2. The petition alleges that discrimination was exercised against the company, but this is not true. 3. It is not a fact that by any action Customs officers a sum of about £25,000, any other sum, was lost to the revenue in this connection. N AVALBRIGADE : NEW SOUTH the",20
75,Mr WATSON,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"the Acting Minister for Defence, uupon notice I. What is the sea-goingexperience of volunteer officers of the New South Wales Naval Brigade, and how many are qualified under port regulations to take a ship, say, to Caledonia'.' 2. Is it not considered advisable that officers who are appointed to the Naval Brigade be properly qualified to carry out the duties naval officer, and be competent to take charge of a vessel at sea ?",21
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE,"In reply to to the honourable member's questions, I beg to state that.1. The qualifications held by officers New South Wales Naval Forces are as follow Lieutenant Commander Brownlow was a number of years in the mercantile marine, and holds mate's certificate from the Board of Trade, London ; Lieutenant Williams, Lieutenant Hixson, members. Lieutenant Roberts, Lieutenant Spain, Lieutenant Alcock, Sub-Lieutenant Coggins, and Sub-Lieutenant Stevens hold certificates master of a harbour steamer; Sub-Lieutenant Wilson holds a certificate ns master of a coast yacht; Commander Gardiner was a number of years in the mercantile marine, and holds Board of Trade second mate's certificate, and local certificate as master of coastal vessels. It does not appear from the records-of the departgather ment that the other officers hold any sea-going qualification. None of the certificates referred to would entitle the holders to take charge ship to New Caledonia. 2. l t is considered absolutely necessary the executive officers of the Naval Brigade'should be properly qualified to carry out the duties naval officer, and this will require to be dealt when the S3'stem of naval defence for the Commonwealth is decided, and the naval forces ganized in accordance with such system.

78,Mr THOMSON,REDUCTI ON IN DEFENCE," Sir , it would not be right if the Opposition did not join in the well-deserved appreciation of yourself and .the officers of the House, whom allusion has been made by the Acting Prime Minister. I feel that I am expressing the views of honourable members upon this side of the Chamber, when I say that we felt from the beginning-and experience has confirmed our original impression-that in your hands, not only the interests of the Opposition, but those of all members, and the honor of the House itself, were safe. I heartily join in the encomiums which have been passed upon all the other officers of Parliament. With the Government and their supporters, we have, of course, had many disputations and some battles. We do not regret them, but we are pleased that they were conducted in a good humour and an honourable manner upon both sides. On behalf of the Opposition, I thank honourable members opposite for many courtesies, and I would especially thank those who were good enough to occasionally cross to this side of the Chamber, and thus assist us to achieve some of what I regard as very well, deserved victories. I shall content myself with adding that though we have had our differences, on the other hand we have had much pleasant intercourse, and have learned to appreciate some, who, at the beginning of the session, were strangers to us. I sympathize with those representatives of the different States who have been so long absent from their homes, and I hope that they may now enjoy a lengthy sojourn there-if they are able fco find them after this long interval. I trust that the good spirit which has distinguished the first session of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth will be present to a still larger degree in its future sessions.",22
