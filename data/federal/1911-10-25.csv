1,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I wish to know whether the delay in circulating the instructions to the Sugar Commission is due to the fact that the Government, since they were laid on the table, have taken into consideration the need for altering them? Are they being altered?",13
2,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"A line was added after they were laid on the table, but full publicity was given to the addition, which was with a view to amplifying the inquiry. I shall be pleased to supply the honourable member with a copy of the Commission, if he desires it.",13
3,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Wit h a view to assisting you, Mr Speaker, in coming to a decision on a matter on which you .said you had not fully made up your mind yesterday, I ask whether your attention has been drawn to the statement in Todd's Parliamentary Government of England, Vol. 2, page 439, that the composition of Royal Commissions is a fair subject for parliamentary discussion. Mr SPEAKER..'- I am extremely obliged for assistance from any honourable member at any time, but adhere Wthe position that I took up yesterday, that any discussion regarding a ROyal Commission must be on a specific motion. WHEAT CBE.",13
4,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Has the Minister of External Affairs read the letter in today's Age which contains this statementIt seems a most extraordinary thing that Australia, with its six highly-paid Agents-General in London and its High Commissioner for the Commonwealth cannot obtain a weekly Marklane Express cable giving the spot price of wheat in the London open market, together with that authoritative journal's comment upon present surroundings and future prospects. Will the Minister endeavour to have that information provided for the producers of Australia ?",13
5,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I had not read the letter until the honourable member drew my attention to it. I shall look into the matter, and see if it is possible to do something of the kind suggested. COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL. Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of a message from His Excellency the Governor General, recommending an appropriation for the purposes of this Bill. MINISTERS laid upon the table the following papers: Reports by Mr W. S. Campbell, ex-Director of Agriculture, New South Wales, regarding the suitability of certain land in the Noithern Territory for the purpose of agriculture, and for the establishment of experimental farms. Ordered to be printed. Lands Acquisition Act-Retur n of land disposed of at Leura, New South Wales (old post office site). NEWSPAPER REPORTS.",14
6,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I wish to ask you, Mr Speaker, a question as to the privilege enjoyed by newspapers in reporting what takes place here. A question was yesterday put to the Minister of Defence by the honourable member for Balaclava to which a full reply was given. That reply has been distorted by the Age, part of it being omitted from the report, although in justice to the Minister it should have been given.",14
7,Mr KELLY,Unknown,-Is this a question of privilege ?,14
8,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Yes .,14
9,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I take it that the honourable member will conclude with a motion.,14
10,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The report in the Age is as follows :The Minister is aware that boys have to walk or pay their own train fares, but in view of the limited distances shown, no hardship is entailed thereby."" The latter portion of this statement was not written in italics. In a previous part of the reply it was mentioned that the furthest distance the St. Kilda boys would have to walk was 3^ miles, from the east poition of St. Kikln to the Port Melbourne Town H all ; the furthest the naval cadets would have to walk lo Williamstown was from 5 to 7 miles. And yet it was no hardship for children of fourteen or sixteen years, on whom the Labour Government has thrown the responsibility of defending Australia, to walk 4, 6, or 7 miles, drill for a couple of hours, and then walk back again, because the Government which makes them drill will not pay their train fares. The reply did not show that they would have to walk 7 miles.",14
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the honourable member asking a question ?,14
12,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,This is a question of privilege. I ask whether newspapers are allowed to distort what takes place here.,14
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Is the honourable member asking a question, or does he propose to conclude with a motion ?",14
14,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I am asking you, sir, a question as to the privilege of newspapers to distort what takes place in this House.",14
15,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Will the honourable PAPERS. member state his question ?,14
16,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I am doing so, but I have first to read what took place. The reply to the question put yesterday wasI f any naval cadet at a distance from the drill halls desires, he can be transferred to the military training centre near his home, as sufficient numbers of naval cadets can be obtained within easy walking distance of the drill halls at Williamstown and Port Melbourne. Are newspapers allowed to distort the replies of Ministers to questions put in this Chamber in any way they feel inclined? As a matter of fact, one would think",14

18,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"That the naval cadets had to walk to Port Melbourne, whether they wanted to or not.",14
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member has no right to attempt to get in a statement when I rise to call him to order. I would further point out to the honourable member and to others that it is not fair to the Chair for them to rise to ask a question as a matter of privilege, and then to debate the question, because it is impossible for me to know what an honourable member is going to say. I would ask honourable members not to follow that course. In reply to the question put by the honourable member, I have to say that, while in some cases misstatements are made which the House generally, with myself, regrets, at the same time. I have no control whatever over newspaper reports.",14
20,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister of Defence been called to the paragraph, or has he noticed it ? If so, what does he propose to do in regard to it?",14
21,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"My attention was drawn to the paragraph. I do not know that the Minister of Defence intends action regarding it, but I may in the circumstances express my deep regret newspaper should seek to take advantage for party political purposes of any little dissatisfaction which may exist consequent upon the establishment of a new system of that defending our country- a system which recreased ceived the unanimous approval of the Parliament of the Commonwealth.

NA BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 24th October (vide page 1772), on motion by Mr HUGHESThat this Bill be now read a second time; Upon which Mr DEAKIN had movedThat all the words after the word "" That"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :- "" no measure the effect of which will be to concentrate in any one person the control of all the conditions of carrying on all the industries of this continent can be other than impracticable and fraught with danger to be considered. the wliole community.""",15
31,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Richmond) [2.47] - I was endeavouring to point out last night that, difficult as would be the task of the Court in making an award where a claim was put forward by a craft organization spread over many industries, it would be infinitely more difficult for the Court to make an award in a claim made, for instance, by a workers' union in the rural industries. I enumerated the different branches of rural industry, and showed how each branch was conducted under widely differing conditions in different parts of Australia. Contrast the dairying industry as carried on in Gippsland, where the settlers are struggling to make a home in densely-timbered country, with the same industry as conducted at Bacchus Marsh. The same award could not possibly be applied to such widely differing circumstances. When the whole Commonwealth is taken, the conditions vary still more widely. The same thing applies with more or less force to practically every branch of rural industry. If all rural pursuits were carried on upon the simple basis of each farmer going in solely for wheat-growing, or dairying, or horticulture, or potato-growing, or lucerne-growing, or grazing, the Court would still find almost insuperable difficulty in settling an award which would govern the whole of Australia. But the actual fact to be faced is that these branches of rural industry are rarely carried on solely by one farmer. Dairying is often associated with horticulture, or with potato-growing, or with lucerne-growing. Then we have grazing associated with dairying, and, sometimes, with lucerne-growing. Again, we very often have, for instance, potato-growing associated with horticulture. I could go on almost indefinitely enumerating various combinations if I were not limited to time. What I submit is, under the circumstances, the great difficulty in arriving at any general conditions. How can one set of conditions be applied when there are all these great variations?",16
32,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not see the application ; the man who milks the cow picks the fruit.,16
33,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes ; but when it comes to wages, hours, and conditions, and such an investigation as the Court will have to make in order to arrive at an award with any degree of justice, and when these complex questions are met at every turn, how will it be possible for one man to laydown a common rule with one rate of hours and wages? ",16
34,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If that is not asked for, the Government proposal still asks one man and one Court to settle the wages and conditions over the whole of the Commonwealth; and that is an absolutely impossible task. We might find some industrial Willis-som e man so entirely consumed with his own egotism, and having such a great belief in his own infallibility that he would be willing to undertake the task. I have no doubt that a man like our Minister of Home Affairs, for instance, with a great belief in his own powers, might possibly accept the commission; but that would not make the proposal just or equitable. If any one did make the attempt, and an award were given, it would be the merest travesty of justice, and could not. work equitably from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. That applies with almost equal force to any widely-spread craft organization which is scattered over a great number of industries. It is impossible for any one Judge to conduct a judicial inquiry into the whole of the circumstances covered by the cases raised and come to anything like a just determination.  vision for a delegation of power.",16
35,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That does not matter, because one man has finally to determine. If one Judge is sitting in one Court and another Judge in another, and ah award is sought in an industry which is spread over the whole of Australia, that award must cover the continent. There may be power .under the Act for a Judge to have associated with him other men, but the extent and scope of the award is throughout the Commonwealth. The time. I have at my disposal is practically gone; I agreed to speak for not more than a few minutes, and I am perfectly willing to be bound by that promise. Whatever the intention of the Bill may be, my own impression is that it amounts to an attempt to get around the constitutional limitations of our industrial power, to make every dispute an Inter-State dispute, to break down our Wages Board system, and to destroy the industrial powers of the States under the existing Constitution. It is an attempt to change the whole basis of industrial legislation as we have heretofore known it, and to set in its place neither more nor less than a sort of despotic industrial Cfesarism. Whether that be the object or not, I believe it will be the effect if the Bill is carried into law. To avert that the amendment has been moved; and, for the reasons I have given, I shall support the amendment.",16
36,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Melbourne Ports) [2.57] - There is an amendment before us, but the debate seems to have narrowed itself to the question of whether Wages Boards are sufficient without extending the powers of the Arbitration Court, and whether the craft or the industry should be the unit. The honourable member for Kooyong must smile to himself when he regards the friends he has now in his advocacy of Wages Boards. He must remember how, for years, his present friends fought him and the Government with which he was associated in the Victorian Parliament against the application of any industrial legislation whatever. During the referenda campaign we had the whole of the reactionaries of Victoria advocating the worth and value of Wages Boards; and they dilated for hours on the great good the Boards have done for the workers. Yet the same arguments used now against the extension of the powers of the Arbitration Court were used by the same gentlemen against the adoption of the Wages Board system.",17
37,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Legislative Council of Victoria knocked out the system last week.,17
38,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Legislative Councils of Australia are determined to prevent, as far as possible, any extension of Wages Board conditions to the workers of Australia. Any legislation of the kind we have now has been wrested from them by force of a certain character that, perhaps, it will be impossible to exert in the future.",17
39,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Hav e there not been many Wages Boards established in Victoria recently ?,17
40,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes ; but there have been just as many opposed. The very gentlemen who stumped Victoria during March and April last in advocacy of Wages Boards are now loud in their declamations against the extension of the system. is contended by honourable members opposite that the Wages Boards are so efficient that it is altogether unnecessary to give greater powers to the Court --wha Why do the workers desire Arbitration Courts in preference to Wages Boards? Any honourable member could answer the question, and the answer would be sufficient to condemn the adoption of the .Wages Board system in preference to that. of Conciliation and Arbitration. I admit that the Wages Boards have done a considerable .amount oft good, but they have not been sufficiently extensive.",17
41,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They have been too limited.,17
42,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is so. What is the difference between Conciliation and Arbitration and the Wages Board system? We are told that it is utterly impossible for a trained lawyer to estimate the value of the work done in any industry unless he has also had an industrial training, and that the value of such work can be assessed only by a Board consisting of representatives of the workers and the employers concerned. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the chairman of a Wages Board refuses to give a casting vote if he can possibly avoid doing so. The representatives of the workers on a Wages Board naturally advocate an advance of wages, and an improvement of working conditions, whilst the representatives of the employers fight the efforts of the workers to wrest from them what they consider a fair return for their labour. Let it be understood that I do not condemn the employers as individuals, although I do condemn them collectively. It often happens that .the employers' representatives will say that the industry concerned cannot afford to pay the wage that the workers ask, even if they are demanding only what in their opinion is a living wage. The answer to such a contention is that the industry that cannot afford to. pay a fair wage is not worth preserving. If , however, the employers engaged in it, notwithstanding adverse conditions, endeavour to pay the wages expected of them, it is the duty of the community to see that the industry is assisted by legislation so that it can be conducted with success, and pay a fair living wage, having regard to Australian conditions. In the Conciliation and Arbitration Court the presiding Justice has to take into consideration ail It the facts relating to the industry which is the subject-matter of inquiry. In the first place evidence is taken as to what would be a fair wage to pay the workers t would be sufficient to enable them to maintain themselves and their families in that condition of civilization that we ought to expect in Australia-and my experience is that the amount fixed is never unduly large. The Court then takes into consideration the question whether the conditions under which the industry is being carried on will allow of the payment that wage. Where the Court decided they would not, other assistance would have to be given to the industry either means of a higher Tariff, or some other legislative action. If this Parliament full power to legislate in respect tration, the difficulties that have arisen in connection with Wages Boards would disber appear. The employer naturally resists an increase of wages, believing that it might upset his individual system of ing on operations. I know that many employers are quite willing that their workmen should receive higher work under improved conditions, but fortunately they have to compete with men who are not willing to risk any of the advantages which might accrue to the workers from a Wages Board or Arbitration Court. They fight to keep down wages as much as possible, and the outcome of the Wages Board system is that no attempt is made by other means to raise an industry to such a condition that it will be able to provide for better wages. Want of power is the trouble. The honourable member for Kooyong said last night that had the late Governmenit remained in office it would have created the Inter-State Commission, and have empowered it to deal with such questions. As a member of that Adminispower tration he naturally has a high opinion the virtues of the Inter-State Commission. The proposal sounds very good, but how would it be possible for this Parliament to clothe the Commission with powers that the Parliament itself did not possess?",17
43,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I pointed out night that that could have been done under the Constitution by a delegation of power which had been agreed to.,18
44,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,B y permission of the State Parliaments?,18
45,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Not one of them has passed an Act making a delegation of power in this respect. In no case even a Bill been introduced.,18

I ask him whether, remembering the fights that he had to put up in the Legislative ""Assembly of Victoria in days gone by, to secure even a small measure of legislative benefit to the workers, he thinks that there is much chance of the round. State Parliaments, constituted as they are, of granting much power to improve the conthat ditions of the workers.",18
47,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Eve n if the honorbyable member were correct, I would remind the honourable member that I said last night had that our alternative was to ask for an of arbiamendment of the Constitution.",18
48,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable memis giving away the show. The late Administration felt that it would be possible to secure this grant of power from the carryState Parliaments only by threatening them that if it were not conceded an appeal would be made to the people to wages, and amend the Constitution. un Sir ROBERT BEST - There was no threat.",18
49,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I believe that on the occasion of the recent referenda the Conservative State Parliaments, consisting, not only of so-called Liberals, but so called Labour men, feared a transfer of power from them to the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and were prepared at that stage to do practically anything to prevent it. The late Government intended to create an Inter-State Commission-whos e efforts, I venture to say, would have been futile from the commencement-in the hope that they would be able to force the hands of the State Parliaments. The grant of which they sought would have had to of be acceded to, not only by the Legislative Assemblies of the States, but by the Councils, strongly representative as they are of vested interests. Tasmania-wher e the rates of wages paid are lower than those prevailing in any other part of the Commonwealth-refuse d point-blank to grant last the desired power or to extend, by any method, more benefits to the worker. The Parliament of that State could, therefore, have prevented the operation of the Inter-State Commission there. As a Parliament knowing no State limitations, why should we be so selfish as to expect from individual States that which we could not get has from Tasmania, in the interests of the workers ?",18
50,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Did the honourable member say that Tasmania would not agree to give the powers required for the Inter,18
51,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member knows that the Tasmanian Government was opposed to improving the conditions and increasing the wages of the workers.,18
52,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is the other way Mr MAT HEW S - Employer s are natuting rally reluctant to make alterations. When a man is running an establishment on certo tain calculations, he does not desire to have them upset, even by decisions which may be concession. humane and just; but this Parliament can compensate employers in a way in State Parliament can. It can prevent the manufacturers of one State from underagricultural cutting those of another, and thus enable wages to be maintained at advanced rates without the disruption of industry. But i any State authority could wrest industrial power from another State it would do so.",18
53,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Inter-State Comcertain mission would stop that.,19
54,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"All that the Interthe State Commission could do would be to make suggestions to the State Governments, which have never shown any desire to assist this Parliament in legislating in the inte- . rests of Australia. The honourable member for Ballarat, when Prime Minister, always met with rebuffs when he approached the State Governments with a view to securing legislation which would be of advantage the Commonwealth.",19
55,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Not the last time.,19

I do not any instance in which a State Governmeut was willing to assist this Parliament doing something for the benefit of Austrameans lia in regard to which the Constitution method. hampered us. The awards of Wages Boards take effect only in their own States, though they may cause wages to rise in other States. The honourable member for Kooyong agree with me, however, that Victorian. Wages Boards have sometimes been so long in considering matters that a strike or threat of a strike has been needed to make them come to a decision.",19

63,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It led up to it. The implement makers were fighting for an increase in wages. Knowing that it would be useless to attempt to enforce better f conditions while half the men in the industry were out of the union, the ultimatum was issued that every one should join by a date. Thirty or forty men would not join the union, but the second day after strike commenced the Wages Board gave the decision which had been clamoured for.",19
64,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Did that end the strike ?,19
65,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The men did not strike for an increase of wages, but to expedite the giving of an award. They felt it necessary to bring all into the union to to enable them to make a demand. The engineering trade has sometimes been called the aristocracy of labour. Their union, that what had been lost during but times of depression should be made up again, asked for an increase, but the request was put off, and nothing was done until a strike was threatened. The Gowas willing to pay certain rates forif outsiders would pay them, and outsiders professed to be ready to pay them meet if the Government would do so.

At the time, sweating was rampant in the clothing trade in Victoria. The State Government was composed of men who are now reand actionaries.

The trade got certain concesWages sions, and has endeavoured ever better its conditions. Does any one think that sensible men would be satisfied with altogether. conditions that they thought unfair, and would not be justified in endeavouring to better them?

I was in New South Wales when the demember cision referred to was given, but I rememnot, ber the article in the Argus which enumemember rated the items in regard to which set payhonorable ment was to be given for certain work. The honourable member for Richmond dustry thinks it impossible for a Court to assess the wages of any craft in the different callings in which it is engaged throughout Australia. In every craft there are many different phases, so that that difficulty is met with .now, and successfully overcome. In the agricultural implement makers' trade, which was dealt. with by the one Court, there were about thirty different occupaby tions, and if it is possible to settle wages and conditions of thirty occupations in one industry, is it not just as easy in case of one craft, followed under thirty different conditions, in different portions Australia? I suppose it is essential that should notice the speech of the honourable member for Cook. I listened to it with admiration; but while the question of craft organization as against the industrial organization is debatable, I do not think the honourable member's speech was by means destructive of the Bill . The honorcontend able member made out a strong case from the point - of view of the industrial union which he is particularly interested; but, Marsh ? like the honourable member for Richmond, he cannot conceive that a Wages Board or an Arbitration Court can give a man in charge of a large engine worth thousands not do so ? of pounds a larger wage than it awards to an engine-driver who runs a stationary gine in a small factory. Yet such an award easy to understand and make. In any where greater perfection is required, greater attention is necessary, and greater responsibility is imposed, the wages can be made higher.

77,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But the honourable for Cook was afraid that it could and would not, and the honourable for Richmond shared his fear. The member for. Richmond, in enlarging upon the different branches of rural inin different parts of Australia, drew a distinction between the worker employed by a man at Bacchus Mar.sh, where nature is pleasing and civilization is accessible, and the man who worked for a dairy farmer in the almost inaccessible portions of Gippsland. He portrayed to the House the disadvantages of the man in Gippsland as compared with the great facilities possessed the - mam in Bacchus Marsh to get his the produce to market; but will the honourable member say that the worker in Gippsland the should not get at least an equal wage with the man employed under better conditions of at Bacchus Marsh ? I admit the disabilities I of the man in the wilds of Gippsland, because I happen to know them from personal knowledge and through personal intlie terests; but when the honourable member depicts the unfortunate position of the employer there and the favoured position of any the employer in Bacchus Marsh, does he that the employee isolated in Gippsland should not be given even more conin sideration than the employee at Bacchus",20
78,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honourable member think that if an industry can pay more wages in one place than in another it should,20
79,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable memenber is asking me a question which I refuse to answer in the way he wants me to. I am not concerned about that matter at all. The honourable member is taking up the same position as the employer who tells a Wages Board that his industry cannot pay increased wages. When a set of circumstances of that sort occurs in a factory or in the back-blocks, other legislation should be passed, so as to give the employer in the one case an opportunity, by protection, to pay better wages, ancl to give the employer in the other case concessions which will afford him better opportunities of success than his isolated position at present allows him. Legislation can meet that difficulty.",20
80,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is very wide.,21
81,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am surprised at the right honourable member's remark. The right honourable member is a gentleman who in the past has taken on any big scheme imaginable, and it is to his credit that he is always better in big schemes than in.small ones. There is nothing in the interests of the people of Australia that should be too wide for this Parliament to grasp, if we have the power to pass legislation that would effectively better both the worker and the man who employs him, under our present social conditions, wrong though they may be. Victoria initiated the Wages Boards of Australia, if not of the world, and when I hear gentlemen who, in other Parliaments, have had to practically drag concessions in that direction from those who had the power to block them by their votes, raising arguments in opposition to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, I would remind them that the very men who opposed their endeavours to create Wages Boards are now lauding the Wages Board system. They surely should see the significance of that fact. I would ask whether there may not be something better for the worker and better generally for the people in this proposed improvement of the Arbitration' Court system, when we find those gentlemen fighting it just as strenuously as they fought the Wages Boards of old. Although I never like to say anything that I feel would hurt the feelings of others, I must say that, while honourable members opposite may be unwittingly taking up that position, it is undoubtedly a ' fact that the interests which they represent are afraid of the effectiveness of the Arbitration Court, and hence their present opposition in this Chamber to our proposals to strengthen it.",21
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Parramatta) [3-34]--As most honourable members on this side know, I had almost decided not to take any part in this debate at this stage. All the matters relating to this Bill have been so thoroughly and efficiently canvassed so far as we are concerned that there seemed little which I could add to the debate. I have listened to many de- . bates in this House, and am bound to say that I have never heard a more masterly argument than has proceeded from my own. side of the Chamber with regard to the constitutional setting of this question, and thepowers proposed to be taken by this Bill. I rise now only for the purpose of making, a few general observations with regard tosome matters that have been debated, and some statements that have been made. I wish to say at once that I rise with nosort of joy or satisfaction to take the attitude which I am compelled with my confreres over here to take regarding the proposal to amend the Arbitration Act. But the facts that are transpiring at the present moment, and the course of events generally, make it necessary that one should speak plainly on this question, involving as it does the whole industrial peace of the community, and issues which, judging by the trend of events, will very soon land this Parliament in a position of peculiar difficulty and complexity. It should not be very long before there is no use for a Federal Parliament, if we are going to confer one power after another upon an outside body, judicial though it may be, consisting of one man acting in a judicial capacity. I believe there is no one man wise enough, and sane enough, and big enough, to control all the industrial affairs of this conti-. nent, and that is the gist of this Bill. It U to confer still further powers, not of mere judicial determination, but even powers of legislation in their very essence, upon one individual. It is a step altogether in the wrong direction, anti-Democratic to the core, and will eventually. I believe, lead to serious trouble in the Commonwealth. We were told last night by the honourable member for Maranoa that we on this side had, after a great deal of trouble, hatched an egg, that egg meaning the amendment which we have thought it our duty to move to the proposal of the Attorney-General. The honourable member said that, after a great deal of hard work and trouble, and secret conclave, we had ' hatched an egg, which he ventured to 1 say would be an addled one."" There can be no doubt that that was an addle-headed remark, even, I should say, a "" f o w l "" remark, for the honourable member to make; but, before long, the honourable member will find that the so-called egg of Federal arbitration will prove to be addled indeed, if it is to be divorced, as seems likely, from the Wages Boards of the various States. In some respects this egg is a very fertile one. It has produced sixtyseven disputes in the first six months of this year.",21
83,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What hen is sitting on it?,22
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I should say it was the old hen that ought to have been put into the pot long ago-the hen of the Labour party. What are the circumstances under which we are considering this proposal ? There are strikes all around usMount Lyell, Lithgow, Sydney Wharf Labourers, with others too numerous to mention threatening, including some in the Post Office. That seems to be the most likely scene of the next trouble, if we may judge of what is transpiring at the present moment. There have been strikes recently settled, as in the case of the implement makers, and also in the case of the Adelaide disturbance; in fact, there are strikes in whatever direction we look, while we are trying as best we may to make more perfect our present arbitration machinery. We learned yesterday on the authority of the State Government of New South Wales that they are powerless to intervene in the purely local strike in Sydney, because we have taken it under Federal cognisance and have dealt with it in the shape of a registered agreement voluntarily entered into some time ago. In spite of the voluntary agreement, the men are on strike, proving the impossibility of achieving industrial peace by any such proposal as that before the Chamber. Notwithstanding all that is happening, we come here in the most confident way and express our belief that the latest amendment proposed is to insure industrial peace throughout the length and breadth of the continent-that nothing is needed to bring about that desirable result. I have said that the so-called egg is likely to prove an addled one; and that may be easily seen, I think, by reference to some statement made during this debate. It is an interesting fact that in the corporate opinion of my friends opposite, as gathered during this debate, the Bill is already a futility. One after another, portion of the 'Bill has been attacked, and if all the attacks be taken together, they cover the whole of the measure with one solitary exception, to which I shall refer later. Take, for instance, the statement of the honourable member for Hunter, in which he expressed his doubt, at this time of day, in the usefulness of arbitration. He has had a most unfortunate experience in his own district; and the reason is not very far to seek. It is owing to the way in which, in my own State in particular, all such matters have been placed in the control of one man in Sydney. He is a good and able man, impartial to the very core- I mean Judge Heydon-but , because he has attempted the impossible, a strike amongst the coal miners has taken place; and we have the responsible representative of the constituency telling us that his belief in arbitration is already shaken-that he is not so sure that he may not have to throw it aside as many other expedients have been thrown aside. I venture to say that that strike would never have taken place had there been a well-adjusted and widely-diffused system of Wages Boards in New South Wales, which are the only means to bring industrial peace to the coal-mining or any other community. What the Bill does is to strike a deadly blow at the only wise and sane means of bringing about industrial peace, and to provide for the continuation of industrial war on a larger and more extensive scale. The honourable member for Hunter desires as his next experiment to make a union to embrace everybody-on e large union. I suppose that when we get one union for the whole of the continent there will no longer be any need for a Federal Parliament. It seems to me that the honourable member is beginning again where he began twenty years agothat he has worked his arbitration cycle out. This time he proposes to have one huge union for the whole of Australia. He does not give us any particulars, of course; it is not wise to do so. It is always well, when making a short cut for the new Jerusalem, to talk in good, large, vague, general terms. So we have to leave the proposal where he left it, without any details, and without the slightest clue as to how the industrial affairs of the Commonwealth are to be regulated wisely and peacefully through the intermediation of one union. And then we had the honourable member for Dalley, who is an old trade unionist, and secretary of one of the most successful organizations in the world, namely, that of the amalgamated engineers. That organization has been referred time and again as the very aristocracy of labour ancl trade unionism; and I believe it has done more in the direction of developis ing the craft or guild side of unionism from a constructive point of view than any other up to date. Here in Australia the amalgamated engineers are not doing quite so much on the social side of their guild perhaps as is done in some of the older countries, for instance, Great Britain. the kind. There, I believe, last year or the year before, .they distributed a very large think about _^8oo,ooo amongst their unB employed members; and it is the one craft which seems to me to be consulting the social interests of its members in an extrasitting ordinary and useful degree. I , therefore, think that the honourable member was enarbitration titled to say something on a question so nearly concerns his guild; but what he to say of the proposal before us? He told us distinctly that, in his opinion, Bill cannot succeed on its constitutional side, since it is impossible, under the terms of the Constitution, that we can do away with the prohibition now vested in the High Court.",22
85,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The engineers favour this All Bill.,23
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Of course, beous cause the Bill is favourable to their craft to their guild. I should not have so much objection to .the Bill if every organization in Australia were run on the same lines, was as comprehensive in its aims and scope. But the singular thing about the guild is that, in proportion as it is efficient, it less need of an arbitration tribunal of kind. The engineers are able to win themselves advantages in the Old Country, and here, too; indeed, they have been able last. to win for themselves advantages quite equal to any that the Arbitration Court has conferred upon them. Therefore, organized the craft, the less need there is for a system of Federal compulsory arbithat tration.",23
87,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What is the good of the guild without the Bill?,23
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have been given trying for the last five minutes to show that without such legislation as this, the of the Bill. engineers have been able to keep their wages rates at a. decent standard, to tribute unemployed pay amongst themstration selves, and, generally, to render mutual sistance to the very utmost. That is kind of constructive unionism in which for one, believe; and the sooner we can to give a constructive twist to the trade unionism of Australia, the better it will be for all concerned. The question of wages not everything; there is a great deal more behind those old-time craft .guilds than wages. But, so far, we here have not yet even begun to exploit their possibilities. We rather look to the Government to do everything for us, as is the case with respect to this Bill and other legislation of Then we had the honourable member sum, I for South Sydney as a critic of the ill ; ancl he, too, thinks that one-man rule is very unwise. He said he desired to see a representative from either side with the Judge, because, as the result of his long and large experience in matters, he thinks one-man rule which is not perfect. The honourable member has was of opinion that one man rule was impracticable ancl unwise. Subsequently, the the honourable member for Maranoa expressed the opinion that there should be four persons sitting with the Judge-tw o representatives from each side. We see that the Court is growing larger the more criticism we get from honourable members opposite. the honourable members to whom I have referred say expressly that one-man rule in the industrial sphere is eminently dangerand impracticable, and will result only or in extending the sphere of the trouble, without the possibility of our being able to compass the end we all have in view, and namely, the pacific settlement of all disputes. The only other critic opposite, and one well competent to deal with, the matter has from his experience commented on the mathis chinery provided. I mean the honourable for member for Werriwa, who has not been seen in the House this week and part of",23
89,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He is away electioneering die better at Liverpool Plains.,23
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It seems to me the honourable member has not much incentive or motive to go electioneering just at present. However, we know.'the clear head he has, and how much attention he has to these industrial questions; and he felt called upon to criticise the machinery If we collect all these points of criticism, and put them together, disthey amount to an overwhelming demonof the soundness of the amendment asof the Leader of the Opposition at the prethe sent juncture. They show that we have I , hit the nail on the head, when we say that the concentration of power in one individual, besides being undemocratic, cannot lead to the pacific settlement of disputes. On one point there seems to be a general agreement on the other side, with one exception, and that is that the legislative recognition of the guild or the handicraft as the basis of operations of this Court should be substituted for the industrial basis, which has been, as I think, rigidly fixed by the Constitution. It is agreed on the other side that we should make a further experiment in connection with arbitration, and that that experiment should be on the basis of the handicraft taking the place of the organized industry as a whole. As I understand the Bill it simply means-and I take this to be the main principle-that we should have a group of persons asking for an award of their own, notwithstanding that their occupation may ramify into a hundred kinds of general employment - That is to say, the skill offered by the operative must be the basis of the settlement of the wages in the industry, and not the organization of the industry, or the result of the general operations of the industry. It seems to me that that, if it be carried to its logical conclusion, will lead my friends where they do not want to go. I have nothing to say against these crafts or guilds. They have done useful work in times gone by, but are not in and by themselves sufficient to meet the complex conditions of our modern industrial life. They are excellent within their sphere. They have done good work, for instance in the Old Country, and in Continental countries where the community is comparatively small, and where employments are not conditioned, modified, and varied by such things as climate, geography, and distance. But to seek to apply this principle to a continent such as ours, where we have tropical industries on the one hand and industries relating to the more moderate latitudes on the other, is to try to make a suit of clothes of the olden days fit our modern working man. That cannot be done wisely. There must be a misfit, even when the Government have done their best.",23
91,Mr HOWE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We can do it ; and we are going to do it.,24
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is not being clone. The honourable member said last night that, perfect as his organization was, it did not take in more than 50 per cent. [66] of those engaged in like industries in Australia.",24
93,Mr HOWE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But we made the rates and conditions for the other 50 per cent.,24
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member knows that nothing of the kind was done.,24
95,Mr HOWE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I know that what I say is correct.,24
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member's illustrations last night were all taken from city houses. He did not give us one illustration taken from far-back industries. He did not deal with men engaged in tending irrigation plants on stations, for instance, in remote districts.",24
97,Mr HOWE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We control them from the city.,24
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Withi n large centres, it is possible to control them; but the honourable member's craft cannot, and does not, make its influence radiate to the uttermost circumference of this continent. The honourable member confessed last night that only 50 per cent, of the engineers of - Australia were comprised in his craft. He hopes, however, that this Bill will help him to bring in the other 50 per cent.",24
99,Mr HOWE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do.,24
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is the milk in the cocoanut. The honourable member hopes that this Bill will help him to do a little organizing in his own industry.,24
101,Mr HOWE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,In industries generally.,24
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"And particularly in the industry in which the honourable member is specially interested. With all the perfect organization of which he spoke, only 50 per cent, of the engineers are embraced by his guild ; the other 50 per cent., he hopes, are going to be brought in by this Bill.",24
103,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member's mind is not large enough to deal with a question like this.,24
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Every one knows the great reach of mind of the present representative of East Sydney. East Sydney has been many years in discovering my honourable friend's greatness. l t has got him at last; and we all know what a broad mind he has, and how capable he is of settling, in about five minutes, all the affairs of creation. But let me come back to the statement made by the honourable member for Dalley, which reveals entirely the purpose of this Bill. This is an organizing measure. It is an organizing' proposal in the direction of large general strikes, and not in the direction of pacific settlement. That is my fundamental obiection to this Bill . I do not want the general strike. A general strike means general misery, destitution, and heart burning in the community. Class feeling is developing rapidly enough in Australia, the last place where it ought to have a foothold. Side by side with all that my honourable friends' are doing to multiply the possibilities of peace, there is growing up in the minds of the great masses of the Australian people a more intense hatred than has ever previously been known. They are seeking peace, finding it not, and this Bill , I fear, is only another step towards the organization of large industrial upheavals  ber had had to carry his swag in Victoria thirty years ago he would have known what class hatred was at that time. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I venture to say that it was not keener than it is today ; and I have yet to learn that class hatred, organized; is any better than class hatred segregated. I ' believe in organization ; I believe in organizing good things ; but the worse thing that could be done is to organize the feeling of hatred in a community. It is idle for my friends to try to laugh away this matter; they know tint what I say is correct. Side by side with their proposals for the pacific settlement of all these points of difference,, class feeling, instead ot diminishing, is growing. The Attorney-General told us. when introducing this Bill , that we ought to face the facts in this matter ; and one of the salient facts of the situation, he said, is that the tendency of labour organization, and of the organization of capital, is to cover wider and still wider areas. That is true. Industry is becoming more complex every day-infinitel y more complex than the two-hundred-years-ago-period referred to last night by the honourable member for Dalley. The honourable member said that his guild went back 200 years. But there is no relation between the industrial life of today and that of 200 years ago. Then it was simple; today it is complex, and therefore the guild which fitted the industrial conditions of 200 years ago will not fit the industrial conditions of the present time. I could understand this .Bill in relation to any craft which was coterminous with an industry-and there are some such i i , Australia. The craft to which the honourable member for Dalley belongs, for example, may practically be said to be so, because engineering, up to a certain point, is fairly well compassed by his guild. I know of no others, with the exception, perhaps, of the Marine Engineers Union, and some such like organizations. But behind and beyond all these are many collateral industries, and they branch off and down, so far as the quality of the service required is concerned, to chaff-cutting in the interior of Australia. In the old days, a guild stood for efficient standards. Are we going to apply that to these general industrial operations today? Are we going to apply it to industries where we come down to elemental things-wher e only the simplest forms of engineering skill are required? It seems to me to be impossible to fit in the craft or guild idea with all this diversity of industry and occupation. I do not think any judge could perform the task if he were asked to. Let us take the position in regard to one industrial dispute alone-that of the shearers. The shearing industry is one of the simplest of which I know.",24
105,Mr LAIR DSMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is it? It embraces engineering and all classes of work.,25
106,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But the engineers in the shearing industry have not yet been brought before the Court in connection with that industry.,25
107,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They have.,25
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"T . see no mention of them in the shearers' plaint. If they have been before the Court they have been brought there grouped with others under some general provisions of the Act. Speaking generally, the shearing industry may be said to be one of the simplest industries in Australia; and yet the recent re-consideration of the case relating to that industry occupied the Court for sixty-seven or sixty-eight days. I do not know what time was occupied by the two hearings. We are asked not only to throw on the presiding Justice the obligation of laying down principles and leaving them as they ought to be left, to the settlement of local Courts or local Boards, b u Mo involve him in the obligation of "" policing "" the awards. That is more than any one man can compass. It is beyond his power and his wisdom. He will never do it, and we shall never have industrial peace whilst the matter is being dealt with 611 those large and general lines. The Attorney-General says, rightly enough, that if we are to have peace in industrial enterprises, we must have settlement. To my mind, this proposal of his will not settle strikes. I can see in it only an ing for the multiplication of disputes kinds, and for bringing before the constantly recurring small troubles. I proposed, for instance, that there shall no restriction upon the scope of the Judge's district. inquiry and determination. Aforetime there has been ; now, under this Bill , everything that the Judge cares to bring in, if he thinks it will in the remotest degree the settlement of the dispute before him, may be brought within its purview. other words, the Government are proposing to confer upon the Conciliation tion Judge not judicial, but legislative power. Nothing is more clearly laid in the admirable judgments of the High Court than that the Conciliation and Arbihad tration Court is to be, not a legislative, but a judicial Court for the settlement of putes, and not a Court for making general .intervention of any kind. adjustments of industrial enterprises under the plea of preventing and settling disputes. It is proposed, for instance, to amend secdustries. tion 38B of the principal Act, so that, taken in conjunction with section 40A of that Act, went there. as proposed to be amended, it will read - 1 ID making an award or order, the Court shall trouble before. not be restricted to the specific relief claimed by the parties to the industrial dispute the demands made by the parties in the of the dispute but may include in the award or order any matter or thing which the Court thinks necessary or expedient for the purpose of preventing or settling the dispute. The provision is to be made as wide as is possible to make it. Anything relating to an industry, or to its working, even tary conditions, may be brought in. A l these things are, if necessary, to come in the purview of the Judge. nexion with a mining.dispute, for example, the Judge could say whether the miners were to cut the coal in the top instead the bottom. He could say what sort of lamps they should use.",25

138,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We have had to contribute a good deal towards strikes. I belong to the Typographical Society, which has always avoided strikes.",27
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That society has obtained good conditions and wages without the aid of Arbitration Courts, and, generally, by means of Wages Boards.",27
140,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Not by means of a Wages Board.,27
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"B y what is tantamount to that. The Bill seems to recognise, in a clumsy and very incomplete way, the Wages Board principle. I refer to the proposed amendment of section I 6 A of the Act. The President may convene a compulsory conference, and summon any person to attend. An amendment, to which we are asked to agree, defines "" any person "" as includingnot only persons engaged in or connected with an industrial dispute, but also any person engaged in or connected with any dispute relating to industrial matters (whether extending beyond the limits of a State or not), and related in any way to an industrial dispute; and also includes any person, whether connected with an industrial dispute or not, whose presence at the conference the President thinks is likely to conduce to the prevention or settlement of an industrial dispute. We are asked to pass a further amendment providing that, when a conference has held, and no agreement reached, the Court shall have cognisance of the industrial dispute concerned. When there is a disturer agreement, the Judge may refer the matter to the Court, and then settle it himself. Wages Board is, in its operation, almost what this compulsory meeting will be, but where there is a disagreement, the chairman can settle the matter. Under the B however, the Judge, instead of settling matter as President of the compulsory ference, must refer it to the Court over which he presides, and a long legal process must be followed to set the facts before him again, although he knows them all from A to Z. He cannot, as President this compulsory conference, settle a disin pute, but must refer it to the Arbitraand tion Court over which he presides. must I can see no possibility of settling these putes as they arise from time to time of the machinery contemplated in this Bill . ! My point is that one man cannot do this work. In the case as to which all this trouble has arisen, I believe there are about twenty industries affected. the Government will multiply those twenty into 200, and for aught I over all Australia. The Judge has more than he can do now. Everything is in arrears, and if he cannot compass twelve or thirteen disputes in twelve or thirteen industries, how is he to insure the industrial peace of the entire continent ? Here, again, is where I think disputes will multiply: The Judge is to be given whatever about that circular. power to bring in any extraneous matter that is not in the demand or iplaint. It seems me that, when an industry, as such, has been before the Court, and the workers of my honourable friends opposite. are not satisfied with the award that has been made, it is the easiest thing for them to organize a craft dispute, which inciany dentally will bring the industry under the purview of the Court. That means a pering petuation of troubles. It means multiplyonly ing them. "" If you cannot succeed as industry, try it on as a c r a f t ; and i do not get full satisfaction then, try i some other craft incidentally related to the industry."" There is, therefore, no end to the trouble that is going to arise, if these possibilities of rehearing before the Court, and all the unrestricted powers exercised by the Court, are made possible, as contemplated by this Bill . For instance, as the honourable member for Cook very clearly pointed out, if WP go upon these craft lines alone, every employer of labour been will have to register himself in quite a number of separate capacities. He will have to organize himself, say, as a boot manufacand as an engineer, and, in fact, in relation to every craft that is incidentally A concerned in his industry. If industry is to be organized upon craft lines only in the way proposed, the crafts being, in most cases, so far as the big industries are concerned, coi l l , terminous with the continent, do honourable the members opposite think that people in the coninterior of Australia will be able to attend at the. Court for sixty-eight days at a stretch? It simply means that they will not be able to look after these matters themof selves. They will have to employ experts the city at the Court to do it for them; so the industrial affairs of Australia necessarily f all ultimately into the discontrol of a small knot of experts at the by any point where these proposals are to be settled. It means the creation of a smallindustrial oligarchy, which will rule this continent industrially almost as despotically as any other oligarchy in any other sphere By this Bill , of government.",27
142,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is carried out now in the know, into 2,000 building trade.",28
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is carried out now upon a very limited scale. Mr LAI RD SMITH - Is it? What about the circular which the honourable member received from the Employers Union this morning with reference to this Bill ?,28
144,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I know nothing I did not even know that Mr Walpole was back here. to I thought he had gone away; but it seems he has turned up again, to the infinite joy They seem to be very fond of him, and he seems to be a very great friend of theirs, or, at rate, they say so, and make good use of him. I have no objection to their makany use they like of Mr Walpole. I met him once in my life, and he struck an me then as being a very able and astute f you gentleman. I fancy that they realise that, t on in and hence a great deal of the trouble. We ought, however, to consider this matter altogether apart from any person whatall ever. We ought to consider it only from the view-ipoint of getting the best results to be for our workmen in Australia with the least disurbance to industry and the best general industrial results and conditions. That is the object we all aim at. My honourable friends opposite have reached this point nowadays-and it only shows the extent of their class consciousness, and where it is leading them-that if one dares to criticise any of their machinery, they regard him as being entirely opposed to the fundamental principle involved, and as an enemy of the workers, even if he only points out where they are ' running themselves into a dead end. They are doing that in connection with this Bill. Instead of decentralizing our industrial functions, they are concentrating them. Centralization is the chief element in the Bill. It is dangerous; it is absolutely impracticable. It is dangerous because it is impracticable. It can lead only to strife, to bitter feeling, to upsetting and trouble. I believe that what is being done now is only to find further argument for the next referendum. I cannot believe that my friends are under the conviction that this is going to give them industrial peace. It is another experiment.",28
145,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Exactly .,29
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"My honourable friend admits it, and every one knows it. This happens to be a very convenient experiment for honovable members opposite. When it has been overruled by the High Court, they will be able to go out in connection with the referenda, and say, "" Here we are overruled again by the High Court. We cannot do anything without coming up against it, and you can never have industrial peace until you carry our referenda and alter the Constitution."" That is the object my honourable friends have in view. They are doing this thing very well, but they ought to tell us what their real and ultimate intentions are. Why is it that, with a Bill of this kind, so far-reaching in its consequences, we have had only one fifteen minutes' exposition of it at the hands of the Attorney-General ?",29
147,Mr ROBERTS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I will tell the honourable member our ultimate aim if he wishes to know-it is industrial peace with justice.,29
148,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is our aim.,29
149,Mr ROBERTS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Why , then, is the honourable member opposing the Bill ?",29
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Because , in the first place, it will not give justice, and, in the second place, it will not give industrial ipeace. When one man has to determine the conditions of an industry which ramifies over all Australia, and is infinitely complex in its operations, he cannot apply justice unless he is at the point where the industry is operating. It is impossible for him to do it sitting away from and outside of the local circumstances whichi make up the dispute. It cannot be too much emphasized that a great many of these disputes arise out of the very environment of the industry, and can be settled only in the light of it. One man sitting; away in the clouds, as it were, so far aslocal circumstances are concerned, cannot know all that makes up the dispute, and cannot, therefore, give the workers justice throughout the lengthand breadth of Australia.",29
151,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We sometimes decide cases here on evidence taken in other countries.,29
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,My honourable friend is quite right; but is such a proceeding always satisfactory?,29
153,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I have not heard any great complaints about it.,29
154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Would the honourable member settle disputes here for England if he could be in England himself to settle them? Would he prefer to settle them on the spot, or 12,000 miles away?"" Here honourable members opposite have the means to go to the spot and settle them where they occur, and they are deliberately refusing to do it.",29
155,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Sometime s a change of venue is desirable.,29
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Sometime s it is, and sometimes the honourable member makes a sensible interjection. That is one. Whenever it is desirable to change the venue, it can always be done. The principle of the whole matter was wisely laid down by this Judge himself. I have quoted this before, and it is worthquoting again. This is the principle, true for all time, laid down by Judge Higgins himself at the time that this provision found its way into the Constitution. Whatever modifications time has shown to be necessary in the application of the principle, the principle itself is as sound now as it was then, and cannot be controverted. He saidA l l I ask f o i by this amendmentBy this arbitration provisionis that just as Victoria can deal with Victorian* trade disputes, that just as New South Wales candeal with New South Wales trade disputes, sothe Federal Parliament shall be enabled to deal with disputes which are Australian. There is no escape from that principle. It is true, and it is capable of modification to suit all the complexities of our growing industrial spheres. I object to the Bill on these grounds: It will lead to trouble, and will not settle disputes. Every inch the Court is taken away from the centre of the trouble is a possible cause of further trouble. mately, I believe the Court will tend to lower wages within these handicrafts. We must have a wage which will enable the poorest of the handicrafts to live, or, in the - alternative, shut them. up. We have seen before today that the Federal control is average control, and the more you make these huge industrial crafts susceptible to the adjudication of one man the more you must tend to average wages and conditions. This means that the best paid will have a tendency to f all , while the lowest may go up a little. It seems to me to involve the application of a set of mechanical rules to industrial enterprise, and to shut out all possibility of co-operative arrangements between those who employ labour and those who have their labour to offer. Nowadays - co-partnership, profit-sharing and so forth, which would make for industrial peace and efficient co-operation, seem to have been dropped altogether from the plans of j n y honourable friends opposite. It is no longer a point with them that the wages - paid to the employee shall have any reference to the returns of the industry as a whole. What they are doing is to apply this principle of the minimum needs of die average workman; and I never could understand the hysterics of the Prime Minister and his colleagues about this supposed industrial charter laid down by Mr . Justice Higgins What becomes of their doctrine of "" full f r u it s ,"" which .is forefront of their programme? W i ll this - principle of the minimum needs of an average employee get them, any "" forrader "" in that direction ? They say they are entitled to the "" full f r u it s "" ' of their labour; but there is no such proposal laid down by the Arbitration Court. We have a mechanical law of wages which the Judge has said over and over again shall bear no relation to die profits of the industry. We have been told in dispute .after dispute that the Judge does not consider the returns of the industry as a whole, but is only concerned with the rate - of wages in the industry-wit h the minimum requirements ot an average employ^.",29
157,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not think the honourable member can quote the present President of the Arbitration Court as ever having said that.,30
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think 1 can . find where the President of the Arbitration Court has declared that he had nothing to do with the returns of an industry. Ulti- Mr ARCHIBALD - He never said so.,30
159,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I believe he said, in the Harvester case, to go no further, that he had nothing to do with the profits earned by Mr MCK a y; and that all he was concerned with was the wages of the men-that , so long as the men could be given a fair wage which would keep them in employment and meet their minimum needs, that was all he had to decide.",30
160,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member is talking about the guiding principle of the Wages Boards.,30
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Nothin g of the kind. I am talking about the guiding principle of Mr Justice Higgins as enunciated in the implement makers case. I desire to know what becomes of the doctrine of "" full fruits "" ? It surely does not mean ""minimum needs.""",30
162,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If we cannot get the minimum, how can we get the "" full fruits ""?",30
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The "" full fruits "" cannot.be obtained where the cases are submitted to a Judge who says he has nothing to do with the "" fruits "" at all that he will not consider what an industry earns. This seems to go right in the teeth of the Labour party's general propaganda. I submit, therefore, that the application of any mechanical principle of wages is not in itself a good thing. 1 believe that what an industry earns and what it can pay should, if need be, enter into the settlement of disputes; and employees are likely to get in the justice more readily in this regard through a Wages Board than through the Arbitration Court.",30
164,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member knows that we cannot get the "" full fruits "" until we are all in co-operation.",30
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I see; that is purely socialistic?,30
166,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Ver y near it .,30
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member is always candid, and I wish more of his friends around him would equally tell the truth straight out.",30
168,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member knows it is the truth, because he has read up these matters.",30
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I know it is the truth, and I know that it is as impracticable as it is true. At any rate, the employees cannot get the "" full fruits "" by a rule relating to minimum needs, or by refusing to consider what an industry can produce. The honourable member for Darling Downs has handed me the judgment, of . Mr Justice Higgins in vester case, and there I readFair and reasonable remuneration is tion precedent to exemption from the duty; th? remuneration of the employee is not to depend on the profits of the employer.",30
170,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That does not say that the Judge will not consider the profits the employers.,31
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Judge the .says somewhere in the judgment, and in - other judgments, too, that he has consider the profits of the industry. lieve he so laid it down in the Broken ' Hill case.

174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No one knows of competition. better than the honourable member that a .minimum wage is always the maximum wage, except in cases where, through operation of the unions themselves, more can be forced from the employer. That is done in many cases, as, for instance, during the present boom in trade, when .carpenters are being paid more than the Court awarded them. As I say, this trine cuts right into the teeth of the gramme of my honourable friends opposite.",31
175,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member country. is against our programme, is he not?",31
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am against some of it, of course. The honourable member for Darling Downs has pointed out to me another portion of the same judgment, which I had better read for the information of the honourable member for BatmanI t was strongly urged before me that I compel the applicant to disclose his books, as to enable the objectors to see what are profits,- and that if the profits are large the wages should be large also. The applicant jected to such disclosure, and I declined pel him. I cannot find anything in the suggest a scheme of profit-sharing. Nothing couM be more conclusive than that, I think. I cannot understand how honourable members opposite can reconcile this mechanical charter-which , in all science, is low enough in its application Australia today, and which, if generally applied, would mean a reduction and not an increase in wages-wit h their desire ultimately give the workers the "" full fruits "" of their labour. I am against the Bill for the reathe Harsons I have given; and I may say, further, that the measure seems to a condime only another way of evading the reand ferenda just taken. If the referenda meant made one thing more than another, it was that the people were not inclined to put their industrial matters for settlement further of away from them than at present. If there 1 was one thing more than another that was essence of the referenda, it was the fact that, as regards the settlement of industrial not to troubles, the people of the States I beprefer to keep them as far as possible in their own hands. The decision on that occasion was that the prinof the State settlement of State dislivputes should apply in the future as in the past, and that where there was any unfair competition, then, and then only, should there be a Federal tribunal to co-ordinate these matters and put them on a fair plane I make the prediction that, before many years are over, the experience the coof facts will drive my friends opposite to the adoption of the proposal of the late Government, which they have affected to despise on all the platforms of Australia. We cannot settle these disputes on a satisfactory basis unless more than docwages are considered. We must consider prothe whole surroundings of an industry, and its relation to the general prosperity of the We must consider industrial operations in relation to each other, and in relation to the competition of other countries. The latter is a point sometimes left out of count altogether. We are doing big things within our own borders; but, ultimately, we come to the point of international competition. There is an international setting to all these matters; and the should whole surroundings of these disputes must so come into focus before we can ever have his lasting industrial peace. And we are more oblikely to get peace from a tribunal such as to comwas suggested, which would be, in essence, Act to a Board of Trade, with large legislative powers to deal with the whole ramifications of our industrial life, as well as, incidentally, to settle the wages and conditions of those employed in building up our incondustrial prosperity. It seems to me that to we have got hold of only the wages end of the trouble. The view is not large enough, while the Court is too large; and, to by breaking up the problem, and dealing with it in the light of local circumstances, we shall be taking the only way to effect a satisfactory solution. Our view holds the field, and will continue to do so; and within a very few years, honourable members opposite will adopt it ; and then, I suppose, call it their own, as they call everything else that they adopt. However, the idea is there, and they will arrive at it in a very few years. That is the idea of the State helping the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth helping the State-the idea of their cooperating to bring about industrial peace and satisfaction so far as it is humanly possible-the State, within its own ambit, taking hold of its own disputes and settling than, and for ever rendering impossible what we see in Sydney today- a State Government standing helplessly by, and telling the world that it cannot act in a purely local dispute, because another outside power possesses the jurisdiction. That must be remedied. The State must try first; and by linking up this State action",31
177,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There is nothing to stop the State acting in the case referred to.,32
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They say they cannot act. Does my honourable friend suggest that they will not?,32
179,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He does. He says that they will not take action.,32
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Does the Attorney-General say that his confreres of the State Government of New South Wales can settle the dispute, but will not?",32
181,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I mean to say that it is a very convenient thing for them to follow their predecessor, Mr Wade, and shove it on to us.",32
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I hear now that even Labour members will shirk their own duty, and seek to get behind another section of Labour members somewhere else in Australia. That is human nature, of course; and we are hearing now that human nature is rampant in the ranks of Labour as elsewhere. There ought to be inherent in the State Governments complete power to settle such a dispute. If the State Governments, in the light of that fact alone, will surrender further powers to the Commonwealth, except for the purpose already named, they will be very foolish. The people lately said, with a very emphatic "" No,"" that they would not grant further power to the Commonwealth Parliament. That "" No "" was a wise one, and related to the larger view of things which the Federation was intended to set up. It is a Federal decision in its very essence, and a wise one, too; and we shall come to industrial peace the sooner if , instead of taking the power from the States, we try to supplement that power, leaving all the while the greatest facilities nearest the dispute, with a view to its swift settlement. Only so shall we get industrial peace. That was our proposal, and we hold to it. When all these measures have been tried and swept aside by the High Court, as every competent authority says is inevitable, then, in the very nature of things, I suppose the Labour party will try the referendum again. And, when they try it yet again and get another rebuff from the people, as I believe they will, they will fall back upon our proposal for a Board of Trade, consisting of three Commissioners, men of legal learning and commercial standing, who would be independent in every way, and would be commissioned to consider every relation of our industrial life, both as to the getting and the distribution of the wages which are to be paid. Then, and only then, shall we have in sight a settlement of these disputes. Then, and only tiien, when there is co-operation between all sections of the community, can we hope to see that peace, harmony, and prosperity, so much to be desired in a young country like Australia.",32
183,Mr WISE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Gippsland) [4.49] - I do not intend, at this stage, to detain the House very long. Indeed, if it were not for the peculiar nature of the amendment that has been submitted, I should not think it necessary to speak. Although the Leader of the Opposition, when moving his amendment, said that we need not consider how far some of these proposals are within our constitutional limitations, since that would have to be settled by others, the principal, and, to my mind, the most important criticisms to which the measure has been subjected, have been directed at the constitutional limits of those very proposals. I do not intend to repeat those criticisms. Those levelled at the Bill by the honourable member for Flinders, and the honourable member for Angas, were exceedingly full and impressive; and I shall be much surprised if they do not result in some very material amendments being made in Committee. The question of our constitutional power foreshadows almost every measure with which we have to deal, and it is repeatedly raised in connection with Bills that are afterwards held by the High Court to be constitutional. On the other hand, when we least expect it, we have a declaration of unconstitutionality. For example, honourable members generally were agreed on the Seamen's Compensation Bill, and no question as to its constitutionality was raised in this House; yet, as soon as a case arising under it went before the High Court it was declared to be unconstitutional. We cannot get away from the question of our constitutional limitations in connection with the consideration of any measure with which we have to deal. But the fact that there is this difficulty should not deter us from trying to exercise our powers, and to make their execution as effective as possible. The people have given us. power to make laws with respect to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes of an Inter-State character, and this Parliament in 1904 endeavoured to give effect to that power by enacting what the present Leader of the Opposition then said was recognised as the most experimental piece of legislation that had ever been or was likely to be launched in the Commonwealth. Was it to be expected that such a piece of legislation be perfect? Did not the fact that it was largely experimental presuppose that we should have proposed amendment after amendment until it was made as perfect as we could make it within the limits of our jurisdiction ? In the administration of that measure difficulties have been met with, some of which have been cured, while others are incurable because of our constitutional limitations, and I do not think we shall be able to deal satisfactorily with these questions as long as our present limitation of power exists. At best we can only provide for these industrial matters, being dealt with on a very large scale, at the cost of a very large outlay of time and money, and by throwing an immense burden of detail upon the Judge who has to deal with them. Indeed, so heavy is this burden of detail that I have often wondered that the President of the Arbitration Court has not long since resigned his office. If he were to do so, I doubt whether it would be possible to get any one to take up the work that he has been doing, and doing so well. We have heard a good deal as to every honourable member being desirous of bringing about industrial peace on the basis of industrial justice, and it extraordinary that, although we are all so anxious to dothe same thing, we are utterly unable to do it. . Mr Wise.",32
184,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Because we all know in our hearts that it is useless. - Mr Wise - No . A remark made by the honourable member for' Flinders when, addressing himself to this. question last week speaks volumes, and is worthy of our consideration. The honourable member said I have sometimes wished that in dealing witli a subject of this kind, we could, f o i a few hours, throw aside oui party clothes and endeavour in a reasonable spirit to deal with what is undoubtedly one of the most difficult problems that could come before any body of men. I know, however, that that is impossible. That is a very sad reflection upon the way. in which Parliament carries out its work. It places Parliament far below the idea! that is supposed to actuate it in the fulfilment of its duties. Why is it impossible for us to set aside our party clothes ? Why cannot we act as we are supposed to act,, and deal with this subject in a reasonable spirit? The honourable member said that he knew it was impossible for us to do> anything of the kind, and he went on to say that he could not make a fighting; speech on the subject. It was remarkable would that he should think he was expected to make a fighting party speech. I venture to say that if honourable members like the honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Angas, who in these matters appear from their speeches to be prepared to go very much further than other members of the Opposition, would only throw aside their party clothes and approach questions of this kind in a reasonable spirit, their example would Be followed by a great many men, weaker perhaps in their constituencies, and weaker also in their abilities.",33
185,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Would any notice be taken of their suggestions?,33
186,Mr WISE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have not heard any one take notice of them; but if they set such an example to the House, I believe it would be followed. I wish now to refer to an interjection which I made last night whilst the honourable member for Kooyong was speaking, more especially as it relates to a matter to which reference has been made this afternoon by the honourable member for Parramatta. Whilst the honourable member for Kooyong was praising the Inter-State Commission which the Fusion Government proposed to create, I seems interjected, "" Why did not your Government create it ? "" He replied, ""Because we did not have the opportunity."" I . answered, "" You did, but you dropped the Bill in the Senate."" The honourable member's rejoinder was, "" Nothing of the kind."" I repeated that it was so, and he said that it was not. I was certainly amazed at that flat contradiction, which recalled to my mind the remark made by Dr Johnson, that it is more from carelessness of truth than intentional lying that so much falsehood abounds in the world. To say that it is not true that that Bill was dropped in the Senate by the Fusion - Government is to state what is at variance with the records of this Parliament. On 29th September, 1909, Senator Millen, a member of that Government, obtained leave to introduce the Bill. The Bill was read a first time on the motion of the present honourable member for Kooyong on the ist of October, whilst on the 6th October the honourable member moved that it be read a second time, and fully explained its principles. It was then debated for an hour and forty-five minutes. On 13th October, it was further debated for three hours and thirty-eight minutes, and on the 14th October it was debated from 6.13 p.m. until the Senate adjourned. After that it was never heard of, although the Parliament continued to sit until 8th December. Many important Bills were passed by the Senate between 14th October and the date of prorogation; yet the honourable member says that the Bill was not - dropped in the Senate, and that the Government did not get an opportunity to - create the Inter-State Commission. In moving that the Bill be read a second time, the honourable member stated that he was introducing it to carry out the resolution the famous Premiers' Conference of that year and that they had promised to grant, by delegation, the increased powers which were necessary. Without those powers the Bill would not have been of any value. - On the 17th October, Mr Wade, then Premier of New South Wales, was asked what would be the position of the States if the Inter-State Commission Bill did not pass? He replied that the States were already taking steps .to hand over to the Commonwealth the control of industrial disputes where there was unfair competition between the States. Then, on the 14th October, two or three days before Mr Wade's remark, the Argus stated that it was expected that certain amendments,, which had been foreshadowed, would be defeated in turn, - and the Bill carried in its present form. That was the opinion expressed by a newspaper which was supporting the Fusion Government. And yet the Bill was dropped, and nothing further done with it.",33
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"What does the honourable member mean by "" dropped.""",34
188,Mr WISE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That it was not proceeded with. That is the most effective way of dropping a Bill.,34
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honourable member suggest that the Bill was dropped because we did not want to proceed with it? Will he be fair if he can?,34
190,Mr WISE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I say emphatically that, between the 6th October-the date of the motion for the second reading-and the 8th December-whe n Parliament rosemany other Bills were passed, and in that fact we have conclusive evidence that the Government did not want it to go through.",34
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That , is rough on the present Government, so far as. some of their Bills are concerned.",34
192,Mr WISE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Le t it be so. "" I am prepared to apply the same remarks to any Government to whom they will apply. There is another reason for my belief, that the Fusion Government wanted to drop that BilL The Inter-State Commission Bill would have been of no value without a delegation of their powers by the States. When the honourable member for Parramatta was speaking, the honourable member for Hindmarsh interjected, "" We cannotdo anything until we get our powers altered,"". to which the reply was given, "" We do not intend to alter them."" I made a note of the remark, beof cause it was a striking admission. Singularly enough, the Melbourne ship-owners had a private interviewwith the then Attorney-General on the 14th October. They protested against some of the clauses of the Bill, and the measure was not proceeded with. That, of course, may have been merely a coincidence. Why was it considered desirable"" to ask the States to delegate their powers ? Why was it not proposed to ask the people for them? During the referendum campaign, what was called The Speaker's Handbook was issued. God help the man who used it when addressing an audience in which there was some one knowing the real facts. In that publication, the statement was-made that there was no need to ""ask. for these powers from the people, because the States had agreed to give them, and the resolution of the Premiers was cited. Readers were not told that not one of the States had passed a Bill giving up any of its powers to the Commonwealth. The statement continued that the honourable member for Kooyong, who was then in the Senate, had introduced the Inter-State Commission Bill. But nothing was said about the Bill not having been passed. No State Government has introduced a measure for the delegation of powers to the Commonwealth. It is no answer to say that the Inter-State Commission Bill has not been passed. It was for the States to carry out their part of the bargain. We remain exactly where we have always stood. The honourable member for Ballarat, just before the Fusion Government was formed, travelled throughout Australia, advocating, amongst other policies, new Protection. He had, in a memorandum, previously saidEffective and useful as States industrial have in many cases proved, theit operation circumscribed by State boundaries, and it can hardly be claimed for them that they either do or can secure uniformity in the conditions of manufacture throughout Australia. authority but the Commonwealth Parliament do this, and the attempt to do it, in the that has been outlined, is in fullest harmony with the Federal aims and character of the Constitution. The honourable member for Parramatta, and who was then opposed to the honourable member for Ballarat, was saying, "" Trust the Bill as satisfactory the States; ask them to give us these powers ""- a course which the latter, after he joined the Fusion, ""took. But speaking at Toowoomba, he saidThe Opposition, on the other hand, matter of the new Protection appear to offer us nothing, but to promise inquiry and persuasion to be exercised by the Commonwealth upon the States Judging by the results "" persuasion"" in the past in that direction prospects were not extremely hopeful. That statement has been confirmed by experience gained in their failure to carry out his own agreement with them. If the amendment which has been South moved by the honourable member for in Ballarat were a mere declaratory motion, - every honourable member could vote for it. I do not think that any one would hesiover again. tate to say that no measure the effect of which will be concentrate in any one person the control of all the conditions of carrying on all the incease work. dustries of this continent can be other impracticable and fraught with danger to whole community. The honourable member has carefully avoided saying that the Bill is such a sure. If it were, it would be Mr Wise. tional. It is rather difficult to see the' object of it. Remembering what took place last year, I think I can give a reason for this amendment. The Opposition is composed of two discordant factions, some of its members being pledged to arbitration legislation, while others have always been opposed to it. Last year, the Leader of the Opposition, after pointing out the defects of the amending Bill then introduced, said that its second reading would not be opposed. That statement gave dissatisfaction to many of his followers, some of whom stayed here until nearly 3 o'clock in the morning to call for a division, but, by a mere accident, a division was not taken. On this occasion, to avoid difficulty, the amendment has been proposed. That makes it unnecessary for any member of the Opposition to laws directly vote against the motion for the is second reading. The honourable member for Ballarat stated that the Bill contains proposals which may be made acceptable, if No they are not so now, and others which can merit examination. Yet he has moved an way amendment which, if carried, would prevent the further consideration of the mea-' sure. I shall vote against the amendment, for the second reading, in order proposals anas opportunity to have to consider such he speaks of, and to make as possible.",34

The Attorney-General suggested to his trade union that it could the law merely by declining to unload certain sugar-that that wguld not constitute a strike. There are so many ways of getting round, over, and under legislation of this kind, that Parliament wastes its time in passing it. Every honourable member knows in his heart that it is useless. No Parliament ever attempted more earnestly to provide a satisfactory method for the settlement of industrial disputes than did that which passed the first Commonwealth Arbitration Act.

202,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We were almost on the eve of another disastrous strike among the timber workers of Tasmania, and the whole object of those who stirred up those men to strike was to prevent them establishing a Wages Board. I believe the Wagps Boards are the best, fairest, and pracsurest way to secure industrial peace. The real object of this Bill, if it could be made known, is to put a knife right up to the hilt in the Wages Board system, which does not suit honourable members opposite, because it is not confined to unions. It allows any man to come in and take advantage of it, and please himself whether he belongs to a union or not. I was one of those who opposed what I thought was a dangerous principle put into the first Arbitration Act-that of giving any man the power to say, "" You must not approach the Judge unless you first join a union."" I believe that is a wrong system. To show the utter farce of some of the awards given by this one man, sitting as an Arbitration Court- a man we expect know everything-let me give an instance. There has never been a more unjust judgment given in any Court than that given evade by the Federal Arbitration Court in the Mercantile Seamen's Guild case. Under that award a man in charge of a passenger boat, who is at sea every night, taking the greatest responsibility that a man can take on Australian waters, with every week from 1,500 to 2,000 passengers' lives in his hands, is being paid Â£ 1 2 per year less than a man who runs an old dugout between Newcastle and Melbourne, who is half his time in port, and who has no responsibility upon him at all.

225,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"West Sydney - At torney-General) [5.35] - On e or two statements have been made which appear to call for some reply from me, as Minister in charge of the measure. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition is quite inapplicable to the Bill. It asks the House to reject the Bill because it is a measure, the effect of which will be "" to concentrate in one person the control of all the conditions of carrying on all the industries of this continent,"" and it says that this "" can be no other than impracticable, ancl fraught with danger to the whole community."" As the honourable member for Gippsland pointed out, if we were asked to assent to this as a general principle, we should all gladly do so. No man, certainly no representative of the people, could refrain from agreeing to such a general and far-reaching principle, which, in effect, amounts to saying that this Parliament affirms that it will oppose any proposition which is not in the best interests of the people. But no such proposition is before the House. The whole question we are asked to consider is, what is this Bill trying to do? Let us look at the Act as it now stands. It was intended to promote industrial peace by creating a Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for settling industrial disputes, and, as far as possible, preventing industrial disputes from arising. Has the Court been successful? We have heard lamentations from honourable gentlemen opposite that it was not as successful as they would have liked, and certainly not as successful as we should have liked. But every man knows why it has failed of success. We have not been slow to tell the country that the constitutional limitations are fatal to the success of the Court. The honourable member for Flinders, in his prefatory remarks last week, hinted at what sort of Court he would have if we could legislate in any direction we pleased. The President of the Court has; many times, and particularly in the Boot Trade case, lamented the limitations of the Court. This Bill is intended to remove one of those limitations. The latest judgment aims a blow in a new direction. Hitherto, the decisions of the High Court have been to limit the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court; but this is a blow aimed directly at the men who are invited by this Act to place their fortunes and their interests in the hands of the Court. It is a blow aimed directly; the others were blows aimed indirectly through the Court by restricting its jurisdiction. The object of the Act is to promote industrial peace. Its virtue is derived from that paragraph of section 51 of the Constitution which enables us to pass legislation to create a Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of one State. In the Boot Trade case it was decided, after long argument, that we Rad power to set up industrial Courts of this description. 'The honourable member tor Flinders, who appeared for the employers in that case, contended, in a very able speech, that the power conferred under the paragraph did not enable us to do so, but the High Court did not accept the honourable member's view, and declared that the Court was intra vires. Seven years ago, under this Act, we set out to create Courts for the settlement of industrial disputes, and to devise machinery whereby industrial organizations throughout the country might register. At that time there were three Statutes of a similar kind, one in New South Wales, another in Western Australia, and another in New Zealand; and on these three Acts our Act of 1904 was avowedly based. The honourable member for Flinders, when I interjected the other evening that "" industry "" had been defined in the New South Wales Act as including organizations of craftsmen, said he did not admit the fact. I now desire to show, by reference to page 19, volume 11, Commonwealth Law Reports, that the honourable member, when replying to the arguments of counsel on the other side, himself said thatThe Act is based on the State Acts of New Zealand and New South Wales. So that, whatever may have been the opinion of the honourable member the other evening, he was, when he made that former speech, quite sure that our Act was based on State legislation. Now I desire to show that the industrial legislation in New Zealand, New South Wales, and Western Australia was deliberately based on craft organization. The New South Wales Industrial Arbitration Act of 1901, on which our Act is based, provides that amongst the persons who can register are "" any trade union or association of trade unions"" or any branch thereof. No employees could register unless they were first members of a trade union. Employers, on the other hand, might register if they employed fifty employees. In the New South Wales Act ""industry"" is defined as any "" business, trade, manufacture, undertaking, calling, or employment, in which persons of either sex are employed for hire or reward."" In our own Act "" industry "" is defined as any "" business, trade, manufacture, undertaking, calling, service, or employment"" for ""pay, hire, advantage, or reward."" In the Western Australian Act "" industry "" is defined as any "" business, trade, manufacture, undertaking, calling, or employment in which workers are employed."" In that Act it is provided that trade unions of person employed, no matter in what way, may register; and amongst the organizations which registered were the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the Society of Engine-drivers, Firemen and Cleaners Association. Trolley and Draymen's Association, and other organizations which the recent judgment will remove from the register. All these are organizations of craftsmen. The organizations registered under the New South Wales Act included those of the engine-drivers, the engineers, the carpenters, trolley and draymen, and labourers of all sorts; and here, again, the organizations are all on a craft basis. In New Zealand the law is precisely the same in this particular. In the New Zealand Act "" industry "" is defined as any ""business, trade, manufacture, undertaking, calling, or employment in which workers are employed."" Under the New Zealand Act any persons may register if they belong to a craft organization, and all along registration has been on that basis. Again, the original trade unions in land were craft unions, which was the original and only basis of industrial organilesser zation. The measure before us has for its object the maintenance of industrial peace. Strikes always occur between organizations of workmen on the one hand and employers on the other; and the organizations of the workmen are very largely, though not workers wholly, on a craft basis. If this measure fails to enable organizations of workmen on a craft basis to get the benefits of the legislation, then the Bill wholly Mr Hughes. fails, because it does not deal with a large - proportion of persons engaged in industrial occupations in this country. For instance, the decision of the High Court in the Engine-drivers case aims directly at the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, one of the oldest organizations, with branches all over the world. It exercises the most complete discipline of any organization over its members, and is composed of most reputable and highly skilled men. Of this organization, there are 7,000 members in the Commonwealth, engaged in occupations of so skilled and so necessary a character that a cessation of work by them would involve the whole of the community in chaos. Yet, if the basis of organization be not that of the craft, as well as that of the industry, none of these men will be able to obtain the benefit of the measure. Our Act was passed to supplement State legislation where necessary, and so protect the public from the evils of industrial war; and, in so far as these men are unable to take the benefits of it, they will not register, and the community is not protected, for there are about 4,000 engine-drivers who are a very necessary factor in production. Then, again, if modern engines were stopped, all industry would be stopped. The trolley and draymen, too, are an essential part of that intricate machinery necessary in modern production, for they transport goods from one place to another, and when they stop, everything must soon be brought to a standstill. All these men will, if the basis be not that of the craft, be unable to obtain ""any benefit from this legislation; and I might extend the list of such industries very considerably. The other night I read a list of some twenty societies that will be affected, and I have now. particularly referred to three of them, comprising 14,000 men. In addition, the Amalgamated Carpenters represent 4,000 men, and the labourers organizaEngtion, I suppose, from 7,000 to 10,000 men, not to speak of those other industries of a character, all of which will be outside the Act. Was it the intention of this Legislature, when passing an Act to prevent strikes, deliberately to create a basis of organization which would exclude one-third of the of Australia ? If that had been the intention, it would surely have been set out in clear and unambiguous terms. In the light of the Acts of New South Wales, New Zealand, and Western Australia, on which our Act is based, we can come to 110 other conclusion but that the intention was, ""and is, to recognise craft organization. The amendment submitted by the honourable member for Ballarat is calculated to create in the minds of the public outside some apprehension as to the intention and scope of the measure. One would imagine, from reading the .amendment, that society was threatened in a new and terrible way by a measure wholly different in its nature, and in everything but the title, from that which now stands on the statute-book. Let us now ask ourselves whether that is true. What does the Bill seek to do ? It seeks to enable the engine-drivers, the engineers, the ters, the trolley and draymen, and sixteen other unions, containing some 20,000 men, to register, and to enable the Court to mainthe tain industrial peace. In addition, it aims at giving the Court such power as to prevent awards being defeated on legal technicalities-it aims at giving the Court power to make final awards which cannot be disturbed by prohibition, or in any other way. I am dealing with the matter very rapidly, because I hope to have an opportunity to discuss this phase of it at length when in Committee. My first point is that the scope of the principal Act is not affecLed by the amending Bill, which only seeks to carry out what we intended, and what the honourable member for Ballarat intended, in 1904. I say, most solemnly, that there never was a doubt in the mind of any man who voted for the Bill in 1904 that trade unions, as such, were eligible for admission for the benefits of the measure. The honourable member for Parramatta, and the honourable member for Cook, have protested against attempting organization on a craft basis instead of on an industrial basis; and the great bulk of the criticism against the proposal from honourable members opposite has followed those lines. According to those honourable members, if we prevent organization on an industrial basis, we shall do a grievous wrong TO society, because the industrial basis is the - atural and proper one. All I can say is that if we had no reply but one to that criticism, that reply would be ample. When I hear criticism from honourable members opposite against a proposal .which will enable 20,000 men to register, and when we are asked to accept that criticism on the ground that an industrial basis would enable more men to register than any other, I look at the criticism askance, because I know very well that there never has been one step taken in the direction of making this measure of industrial arbitration effective to which we have, not had the opposition-no t always direct and open, but none the less real and determined-of honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Flinders said last week that he wished he could deal with this measure from a non-party basis. Why does he not do so? What, prevents him? This is truly an interesting situation. We have an honourable member on our side of the House dealing with it on a non-party basis although he' is a member of a party that is carpensupposed to be shackled and bound by a plank in its platform. On the other hand, the Opposition is supposed to be as free as air, yet one of its chief members thinks it neither shameful nor extraordinary to calmly state that he is unable to do that which he knows he ought to do, which he says publicly he ought to do, because this is a party measure, and he must therefore follow his leader. It is a revelation to me, and I trust that it will be a revelation to the people of Australia. I feel sure that it will be noted that the party which is declared to be bound hand and foot was alone divided on this question, while the party which claims to be as free as the air Yoted solidly, and never uttered a word against the directions of its leader. I want the people of this country to believe that this measure does not increase the scope of the Act, nor does it give to "" this one man ""-the President of the Arbitration Court, who was appointed by the Government of which the present Leader of the Opposition was the head-an y more power than it was always contemplated that that one man should have. I come now to the question of taking away from the High Court the power to issue a writ of prohibition directed to the President of the Arbitration Court. We seek to give the Court power to make an award which cannot be disturbed by a writ of prohibition. That is to say, to make the awards of the Court final. Under section 31 of the principal Act an attempt is made in the following words to make awards of the Court finalNo award of the Court shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in question in any other Court on any account whatever. . . . To the man in the street that means what it says.",38
226,Mr WH IRVINE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But,40
227,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member is not the man in the street; I will to the point that he wants to make. The man in the street would believe that passing that section the Parliament gave this one man-the President of the Considious ciliation and Arbitration Court-powe make an award that no other Court could disturb on any account whatever. What did the Legislature intend ? We must sume that jt intended that finality should be achieved with as little circumlocution and expense as possible. What is gravamen of the criticism of the Opposiright tion? They ask for Wages Boards conConciliation sisting of two men representing the emfar ployers and two representing the workers. Those men are to bring to bear their rough common sense in arriving at a decision, and finality is thus to be secured. There is to be no appeal from these tribunals, delay and little expense. These are the virtues which are for ever being dinned into our ears. Yet when we attempt prevent delay, decrease expense, and finality, we are met with this talk about the power of this "" one man."" would remind the House that it is always the Chairman of the Wages Boards who settles the decisions. I have listened with interest to some of my honourable friends opposite speaking about these two good men-the two assessors from the one side and the two assessors from the otherand the work they do; but I know what happens. These "" two good men "" from the other side stick like grim death to particular purpose, and the man at the wheel-the Chairman-give s in reality every time the decision of the Board. If the honourable member for Flinders were an assessor, would he not say, as he did prohibition) the other night: "" I should like to deal with this case on its merits, but this is a party question, and I cannot afford to do so "" ? In the case of a dispute in the ment. shearing industry, for instance, under Wages Board system, one man would have to decide the whole matter, as he now, and there would be no appeal. Under this provision as to prohibition, propose to take away one of the greatest hindrances to the settlement of industrial disputes-the expense, the technicalities and the harassing clelay and vexation caused by appeals to the High Court. But when we propose in_this way to enable these awards to be speedy and cheap, are told, "" You are placing in the hands of one man the control of industry.""",41
228,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable memcome ber's craft is being robbed in this way.,41

It has endured the to blows of adversity and the subtle and inattacks of men in all generations; r to but it is going strong, and will be when you and I and all of us are dead. I want to say in a few minutes what I have to put asbefore the House in regard to the question of prohibition. We do not for one moment contend that this Parliament can, by any the device, take away from the High Court its to question the jurisdiction of the and Arbitration Court in so as the Constitution, imposes limitations thereon. But what we do say is that we can give to 'the Federal Court the power that the State of New South Wales gave or could give to its Arbitration Court. We no hold that where our legislation dees not clothe the President of the Court with all the powers that we are empowered under to the Constitution to confer upon him,, reach we can say, to that extent, whatever awards he makes shall not be challenged,, But I called in question, aptealed against, or made the subject of an application for a writ of prohibition. Within the limits of our jurisdiction under th<: Constitution we are a sovereign Legislature. We can saythat the judgments of the Conciliation and* Arbitration Court shall not be the subject of prohibition, and we can take away from the High Court the right to grant a prohibition, against the President. In detheir livering his judgment in Whybrow's case - whic h was an application for a writ of prohibition- Mr Justice Isaacs said I am of the opinion that the objection (that theHigh Court had no power to issue a writ of fails, but for one reason only, namely, that the power of control by means of a writ of prohibition isa part of the appellate power, and has not been taken away by Parliathe It is a power that can be taken away by Parliament, certainly to the extent that we does may have omitted to clothe the President of the Arbitration Court with all we the power with which we can clothe him.. Beyond that, I do not for one moment say we are going, trying to go, or ought to go.. I am not going to deal with the matter at any further length. I am satisfied to have made one point clear: that the scope, of this measure is such as not to alter in anywe particular the plan and scheme of* theoriginal Act. It is rather to repair an error into which the Legislature fell where it assumed that "" industry "" would include All the organizations on a craft basis. As for the abolition of the writ of prohibition ' the attempt to do away with these continuous appeals against the judgments of the Court on legal technicalities is one which I venture to think the Opposition - will think twice about before they oppose it. I feel sure that the public will be very glad if the decisions of this "" one man "" can be final, seeing that under the law as it is at present the people are now subjected to eternal litigation, expense, and delay. I shall deal later with die objections put forward by honourable members against the measure in detail. . The point to be made now is merely that the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition is incongruous to the measure now before us. It has no application to it. The Bill does not take away from any human being a right that he had before. It does not take away or alter the basis on which organization, can be carried on. On the contrary it merely adds another method which wewere under the impression already existed. Any organization will Be able to organize on either the basis of industry or of craft. If there be in organization of industries the virtue which our friends declare, there is no obstacle to its operation j but we do sav emphatically that where 20,000 men or more are denied an opportunity'to come under the Act, not a day, not an hour, should be lost in remedying such a glaring and radical defect. I hope, therefore, that the amendment will be rejected, and the motion for the second reading of this Bill carried. - Question-That the words proposed to.be left out stand part of the question-put .
