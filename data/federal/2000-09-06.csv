However, a year or so to it, that Tasmar should be withdrawn on what they have identified as being an for me to gainsay the professional deliberations of purposes.

It has As a consequence, the guidelines and the able to be introduced. These guidelines and for quite some time, and it would have been far Australians who are dependent on these access we been able to consider this matter in the the legislation: essentially, what is alive in the and, I am advised, the associated guidelines of the administrative procedures which NA Wednesday, 6 September 2000 govern the operation of the access regime regulations and guidelines was looked at in many users of those guidelines-which have that they are excessively bureaucratic and complex. they were developed in 1991, they were plainly when it comes to their current use and the experience think it has been the feeling among many, including those guidelines have been excessively cumbersome, patients. The substantive provisions of the bill do change, I am advised, will be reflected in the guidelines on ‘access to unapproved products' specific set of sub-guidelines which go to access and authorised providers. Firstly, on those guidelines which relate individual patients can have access to pharmaceuticals of personal importation. Under those circumstances, pharmaceutical treatment they will do so at excessive way of obtaining the particular pharmaceutical available. When Tasmar was unilaterally withdrawn the only course of action available to many personal importation-at huge financial penalty that under those circumstances we began to particular treatment for a most serious condition life differed substantially accordingly. Many A second set of guidelines relates to the trials. Improvements in clarification of procedures welcomed and supported, as outlined in the act The third set of guidelines relates to procedures guidelines will deal principally with access individual doctor-individual patient basis. Basically, patient, by name, has a particular condition currently approved by the TGA, then that doctor individual access permit for that particular patient under those particular circumstances subcategories which relate to the availability access regime-those which relate to life threatening non-life threatening conditions-with the criteria they are at the moment. The fourth set of guidelinesand I believe emerge from these legislative and governmentrelates to the so-called ‘authorised contrast to the special access regime for treatment'. If you have a particular doctor condition-let us again take the example of that, given the particular circumstances, condition a particular drug-again, in this case, Tasmar-is that treating specialist can now make direct MAIN COMMITTEE 20341 for unapproved pharmaceuticals.

The real regulations and guidelines which will ensue. The constitute a generic document which covers a the categories of personal importation, special to personal importation, under these circumstances unapproved by the TGA on the basis if patients do need a particular cost.

There are of pharmaceuticals under this individual special conditions and those which relate to in the guidelines to be much simpler than the most important set of guidelines which will regulatory changes foreshadowed by the prescriber system'. Here we have, in individuals, what we would describe as a ‘class who has a range of patients with a particular Parkinson's diseasewhere the doctor can argue or advanced state of the disease in question, the only effective treatment available, then application to either of two bodies: his or her NA 20342 relevant hospital ethics committee or the Surgeons. In the past, the system was as follows. The patient was and whether or not the patient was ethics committee or to the college ethics committee of those bodies. They, in turn, would provide would then make a determination. As I understand clearly in the guidelines governing the authorised these lines: the treating specialist will now application to his or her local hospital ethics committee.

Under the new system, to make an application to the hospital ethics turn, will or will not endorse that application an enormous administrative simplification for lot approval for 20 or 25 patients who exhibit specialist is treating which is not appropriate TGA regime.
