This will allow a number of unable to travel to Australia to come into Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, which has nevertheless, it allows them to come into Australia domestic services. The debate has been raging for some time policy. One side of the debate says to the worry about whether we've got rights to your so important for international tourism.'

25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"--Order! The committee stands adjourned until a day Wednesday, 30 June 1999 of the nation in their participation in the 1999 The time allowed for debate has expired. and hour to be fixed by the Deputy Speaker. Main Committee adjourned at 10.45 a.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Home and Community Care Funding: . (Question No. 181) Mr MCClellimd asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: (1) What processes were established to ensure that organisations tendering for round 13 of Home and Community Care (HACC) funding had consulted with other HACC and similar providers. (2) How do tenderers demonstrate that they have consulted other providers. (3) What checks does the Department of Family and Community Services make to ensure the requirement has been met. (4) Is the Commonwealth reducing HACC funding to New South Wales by $3 million in 1 998-99. (5) Is the Commonwealth insisting HACC client user-pay levels be raised to 20 per cent of the program budget; is so, how will the client fee be collected from dementia sufferers. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop---The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Background-Questions 1 to 3 In New South Wales, to which ""Round 13"" applies, the Home and Community Care Program is administered by the Ageing and Disability Department of the New South Wales Government. (1) The New South Wales Ageing and Disability Department has indicated that it ran a series of industry briefing sessions for organisations interested in tendering for HACC growth funds in Round 13. There were 16 sessions, one for each of the 16 HACC regions, and a further 7 Aboriginal specific sessions. Organisations tendering for HACC growth funds in Round 13 were required in their application form to indicate how their service cooperated and coordinated with other HACC and HACC-like funded services. Knowledge of the HACC and HACC-like service system was also required. (2) Individual providers are required to demonstrate in their tender submissions how they have coordinated with the rest of the community service system. NA (3) Applications are considered by a number of Tenders panels each consisting of three members with representation from the Ageing and Disability Department, the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care and an independent member drawn from the service provider sector to encourage objectivity and diversity in the selection process Selection panel members meet to discuss the selection process. In Round 14, benchmarks against which the quality of the applications can be measured were agreed In this way all panels apply consistent values when considering applications. (4) The Commonwealth has not reduced the level of HACC funding provided for New South Wales in the 1998-99 Budget by $3 million. Indeed Commonwealth HACC funding for New South Wales in 1998-99 has increased by $5.7 million to a total of $155.9 million, representing 60% of HACC funding for New South Wales (5) The Commonwealth has allocated funding in the expectation that revenue to HACC funded total services amounting to 20% of governments' funding would be achieved by the end of the year 1999-2000. Any changes to fees policy and their implementation are matters for the States and Territories. Aged Care Providers: Subsidies (Question No. 414) Mr Wilkie asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 15 February 1999: (1) Have the daily subsidies paid to aged care providers to cover the cost of providing care to residents been increased since the introduction of the Resident Classification Scale (RCS); if so, (a) what increases have been made and (b) what percentage of the initial subsidy under the RCS do the increases represent. (2) Have the increases referred to in part (1) been provided uniformly across States and RCS levels; if not, what increases have been made in respect of each State and RCS level. (3) What was the cumulative percentage increase in (a) the CPI, (b) average weeklyeamings and (c) nursing salaries in each State public hospital system since the introduction of the RCS. (4) What is the difference between nursing wage rates in the acute and aged care sectors in each State. (5) Has she received representations from the private nursing home industry in Western Australia about the increases in subsidies paid to providers; if so, (a) what was the basis of the representations and (b) will the Government change existing funding levels for providers in Western Australia or the overall funding mechanism following the representations. (6) Does the funding mechanism for aged care providers recognise increased costs incurred by providers in order to comply with (a) Commonwealth and State legislative changes and (b) arbitrated decisions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in terminating a bargaining period and making an order under section 170MX of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. (7) Is it a fact that residential aged care providers are finding it increasingly difficult to attract and (b)NSW RCS 1 RCS 2 RCS 3 RCS4 RCS 5 RCS 6 RCS 7 RCS 8 Vic RCS 1 RCS 2 RCS 3 RCS4 RCS 5 RCS 6 RCS 7 RCS 8 Qld RCS 1 RCS 2 RCS 3 RCS4 RCS 5 RCS 6 RCS 7 retain qualified nursing staff because of a lack of Commonwealth funding and the difference between wage rates in the acute and aged care sectors. (8) Is it a fact that aged care providers are not being provided sufficient resources to enable them to achieve accreditation; if not, why not. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) When Labor left office they were spending $2.5 billion on residential care. In the 1999/2000 budget this Government is spending $3.5 billion. This is an increase of $1 billion or 42%. (3) The coalesced indexation increases expressed as a percentage are set out in the schedule below. Such increases are those made on 1 July 1998. A further increase will of course be made in accordance with the Aged Care Act 1997 on 1 July 1999. Percentage Increase 1.9% 1.9% 2.0% 2.3% 3.0% 3.3% 3.9% 0.0% Percentage Increase 1.8% 1.8% 1.9% 2.2% 3.0%Â· 3.3% 3.9% 0.0% Percentage Increase 2.3% 2.3% 2.5% 2.8% 3.0% 3.3% 3.9% Qld RCS 8 WA RCS 1 RCS 2 RCS 3 RCS4 RCS 5 RCS 6 RCS 7 RCS 8 SA RCS 1 RCS 2 RCS 3 RCS 4 RCS 5 RCS 6 RCS 7 RCS 8 Tas RCS 1 RCS 2 RCS 3 RCS 4 RCS 5 RCS 6 RCS 7 RCS 8 ACT RCS 1 RCS 2 RCS 3 RCS4 RCS 5 RCS 6 RCS 7 RCS 8 NT RCS 1 Percentage Increase 0.0% Percentage Increase 2.0% 2.0% 2.1% 2.4% 3.0% 3-3% 3.9% 0.0% Percentage Increase 2.0% 2.1% 2.2% 2.4% 3.0% 3.3% 3.9% _0.0% Percentage Increase 1.7% 1.8% 1.8% 2.1% 3.0% 3.3% 3.9% 0.0% Percentage Increase 2.0% 2.0% 2.1% 2.3% 3.0% 3.3% 3.9% 0.0% Percentage Increase 1.8% NT RCS 2 RCS 3 RCS 4 RCS 5 RCS 6 RCS 7 RCS 8 (2) Low level care subsidies are paid on a unifonn national rate. High level care subsidies are paid in accordance with the tables set out above. The coalescence adjustment was 2% of the difference between the relevant State rate and the national average. This has meant that some States have been indexed faster and some States have been indexed slower but all states received indexation increases in accordance with coalescence. (3) The CPI and average weekly earnings are available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the CPI is catalogue number 6401.0 and average weekly earnings is catalogue 6301.0. In the 1995 Budget, new wage cost indexation arrangements for Commonwealth Own Purpose Outlays (COPO) and Specific Purpose Payments to the States were introduced. These arrangements are known as COPO indexation and apply to programs with substantial wage costs. The residential care subsidies are indexed under this arrangement and therefore the Department of Health and Aged Care no longer maintains information on nursing salaries in the States. (4) See (3). (5) I receive representations on various aged issues on a regular basis. The Productivity Commission report on Nursing Home Subsidies tabled in Parliament on 31 March 1999 investigated the issue of subsidy levels in each State and agreed with the Government's policy of moving to a single national subsidy for high level (nursing home) care. Percentage Increase 1.9% 2.0% 2.2% 3.0% 3.3% 3.9% 0.0% The Government is undertaking a series of consultations with industry and other stakeholders before a whole of government response is made. (6) The system of cost reimbursement that applied under the previous nursing home arrangements has ceased. The rates for residential care subsidies are indexed on 1 July each year to reflect increases in the underlying rate of inflation and to provide funding for Safety Net Decisions made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. These arrangements date to a decision made by the Labor Government in the 1995-96 Budget and apply to all Government programs with significant wage costs .. (7) See (1). Federal Government funding for residential aged care has been increased by this Government by 42%. The subsidy paid for residential care since the Coalition came to office has risen from $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. Increases have been made to ensure individuals in need of residential care receive quality care in accordance with the Aged Care Principles. (8) Residential Aged Care Facilities are being provided with a substantially increased income stream for capital expenditure from accommodation care charges plus increased recurrent funding through the RCS and supplements such as the Concessional Resident Supplement. The Government also made available $28m to assist with industry restructuring. For example, the graph below shows the increased capital stream provided for nursing homes by this government. 200 '110 -- 100 '0 o------------------------1.... 18117..aa UIO.eo 1891.fZ .Old - lnG Homa CIIPI- IIT-1!d CIop'II\I A.ulAtAIWI Office of the Employment Advocate: Registered Clubs Association of New (Question No. 609) Mr Mardn Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 12 May 1999: (1) Did he refer in a speech on 20 April 1999 to the Area Consultative Committees Chairs National Forum to an employer organisation which is acting with the Office of the Employment Advocate (OEA) to develop a series of seminars and build template Australian Workplace Agreement; if so, AWAs. to which employer organisation did he refer.

A number of OEA officers have been involved in this exercise--some assisting in the delivery of information sessions, others in preparing the publications. Costs associated with salary and travel incurred by OEA staff relating to the information sessions and the development of the two publications amount to approximately $6,500. To date, $8,065 has been spent by the OEA in producing the publications. These costs relate to design, artwork and printing. In total, an amount of approximately $14,565 has been spent on this exercise. (3) The OEA has been conducting seminars in regional and rural New South Wales for some time now either independently, in conjunction with the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business or with industry associations such as the ""Registered Clubs Association of NSW"".

Jubilee 2000 Debt (Question No. 622) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 31 May 1999: (1) What is the Government's official position on the issue of third world debt highlighted by groups like the Jubilee 2000 Coalition International. (2) Are third world countries in debt to Australia; if so, in each case, (a) which country is indebted (b) what sum is involved, (c) when was the debt incurred and (d) on what terms was it incurred. (3) Will the Government consider cancelling debts of third world countries; if not, why not; if so, which debts. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government acknowledges the good intentions behind the campaign by the Jubilee 2000 Coalition. The devastating effects on very poor countries of unmanageable debt are wen known. The Government does not support the call by Jubilee 2000 for cancellation of debt, free of conditions by creditors. A key part of the solution to the debt problem-and, indeed, to achieving long term sustainable growth-is the pursuit of sound economic and social policies. Debt write-off has the potential to shield governments from their responsibilities to pursue sound policies, and to send confusing signals to those poor countries managing their economies (and debts) well and in a sustainable fashion. It is important therefore that debt relief is provided in a way which supports the pursuit of sound policies and good governance--especially if the accumulation of unsustainable debts in the future is to be avoided. Australia has supported strongly the World BankIMF Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative both financially and by encouraging the World Bank and IMF to continue progress on its effective implementation. The Initiative aims to reduce the debt of the world's poorest countries to sustainable levels, subject to the pursuit of sound economic and social policies. The Government believes that it is the most credible way to provide sustainable debt relief because it seeks to achieve a lasting solution to the debt problem. Unlike previous mechanisms, the RIPC Initiative deals with debt in a comprehensive way by involving all creditors, including multilateral development institutions. The Initiative has so far committed US$6.1 billion in nominal debt service relief. In June 1998 the Treasurer, the Hon Peter Costello MP, announced Australia's contribution of A$30.5 million. Australia also supports the comprehensive review of the Initiative being undertaken by the World Bank and IMF with significant input from governments, civil society and international organisations. At the April meetings of the Bank and IMF, Ministers reiterated the importance of ensuring a clear link between debt relief and sustainable development and poverty reduction, and endorsed the examination of options to provide broader, deeper and faster debt relief. Ministers also supported the continuing link between debt relief and sound economic and social policies and good governance to ensure that debt relief is not wasted. The review's conclusions and recommendations are expected to be considered at the 1999 Bank and IMF annual meetings in September.

Australia does, however, strongly support the negotiation of debt rescheduling and, in some cases, write-downs on government-to-government debts within established multilateral frameworks such as the Paris Club and the HIPC Initiative. Australia encourages debt relief to be undertaken within these frameworks. The RIPC Initiative particularly deals with debt in a comprehensive way by involving all creditors, including multilateral development institutions.

Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: Pilot Study (Question No. 680) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 2 June 1999: (1) Who conducted the pilot study, referred to in his Department's discussion paper entitled ""The hidden workforce: Illegal workers in Australia and those that would join them"", which led to Centrelink finding a small number of a sample group, whose visitor visas had expired, drawing social welfare payments. (2) How many persons were included in the sample group. (3) How many of the sample group were found to be drawing social welfare payments. (4) What total sum in welfare payments had the persons referred to in part (3) obtained fraudulently. (5) Does the Crime Act provide penalties for employers employing persons without work rights; if so, (a) what is the nature of the penalties and (b) when were the penalties last reviewed. (6) Is he able to say what civil and criminal penalties may be imposed on employers in the USA who knowingly recruit persons without work rights and continue to employ them. (7) Is the possession of a tax file number satisfactory evidence of the right to work in Australia; if not, why not. (8) How often is an employer required to notify the Australian Taxation Office of the tax file numbers of new employees. (9) Is the requirement referred to in part (8) adequate to prevent unscrupulous employers and illegal workers being detected. (10) Has his Department considered removing the right of Australian relatives to sponsor migration or visits from overseas if the relatives have previously sponsored persons who failed to depart Australia lawfully. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Some of the questions asked by the Honourable Member touch upon matters that are the responsibility of the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink. The following answers draw upon information provided by those two authorities. (1) The study to which the Honourable Member refers was jointly conducted by the then Department of Social Security (DSS) and my department in 1996-97. The study involved matching overstayers data, which is generated by the movement records kept by my department, against retords held by DSS. (2) The data match identified 555 persons who were both recorded as overstayers and in receipt of social security benefits. Subsequent checks carried out by my department revealed that most of the persons identified by the data match had either been granted visas or were eligible for visas, or were Australian citizens, New Zealand citizens or permanent residents. (3) Fourteen cases were selected for further .investigation. Seven of these cases were found to have social security overpayments. Of these, four persons, two married couples, were prosecuted by the DSS and convicted for social security fraud. (4) The overpayment totalled $189,000. (5) Prosecution of employers who knowingly employ people with no work rights is possible under section 5 of the Crimes Act. That section stipulates that it is an offence to aid, abet, procure or be directly or indirectly concerned with commission of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth. (a) The penalty for offences concerning unauthorised employment is prescribed in section 235 of the Migration Act, which imposes a maximum penalty of $10,000. By way of operation of the Crimes Act, this penalty can also apply to employers convicted of an offence under section 5 of that Act for employing non-citizens with no work rights. (b) Section 5 of the Crimes Act was amended in 1926, 1960 and 1987. (6) Since 1986, it has been illegal in the USA for employers to knowingly employ, or continue to employ, unauthorisedaIiens. The penalties prescribed by USA legislation range from fines between US$250 arid US$lO,OOO, to criminal penalties. The latter are applicable to repeat offenders. Further fmes from US$lOO to US$1 000 can be imposed for not abiding by processing requirements, depending on whether it is a first or subsequent offence. (7) The possession of a tax file number does not necessarily indicate that the owner has the right to work in Australia. The entitlement to work is determined by the citizenship or immigration status of the individual. As a general rule, only Australian and New Zealand citizens and permanent residents have an automatic right to work in Australia. All other foreign nationals are not authorised to work unless they have a visa that allows employment. A foreign national on a temporary visa in Australia may require a tax file number to meet an Australian taxation obligation, such as lodging a return to reveal rental income from an investment property, but may not be authorised to engage in employment. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is assisting my department in ensuring that non resident foreign citizens comply with conditions of their visas by requiring them to show evidence of permission to work when they apply for a tax file number for employment purposes. A foreign national to whom a tax file number has been issued must show an employer a current visa showing permission to work. Work authorised on a visa may be limited to a particular employer or for a limited period. These details are not shown on the tax file number record. As a result a person may have a tax file number, but this does not indicate that he/she has unlimited or unrestricted access to the labour market. Foreign citizens who have been issued tax file numbers and who, at the expiry of their visas, remain unlawfully in Australia have no right to employment, but they still have a tax file number. It is essential, therefore, that visa details are checked to ensure work rights. (8) Under current legislation, employers are required to notify ATO of the TFN of an employee: (a) within 28 days from the time the employee provides the completed employment declaration (b) at the end of each financial year in the form of a copy of the employee's group certificate. (9) The primary function of the employment declaration is to provide information that will enable employers to calculate the appropriate rate of tax to be withheld from the employee's salary or wages, not to deter illegal workers or to identify unscrupulous employers. The declaration form enables the ATO to monitor compliance with the TFN legislation and to assist Centrelink to verify the statements regarding employment made by benefit recipients. The data captured by the ATO from employment declarations is currently utilised for the datamatching program that has been operating between my department and the Australian Taxation Office since 1994. Under this program the list of foreign citizens unlawfully in Australia is matched against taxation records to identify and locate unlawful non-citizens from their employment records. (10) There is no sponsorship requirement for visitors and consequently no mechanism to prevent Australian citizens or permanent residents from sponsoring visitors from overseas. Foreign citizens who apply overseas for visitor visas are assessed on their own merits against visitor visa regulations. Letters supporting visit applications from Australian citizens or permanent residents are sometimes received and considered along with other information on the individual cases. The External Reference group currently working on the Review of Illegal Workers in Australia, of which the Honourable Member is aware from my answer to a previous question, will examine, among other things, the issue of whether it would be feasible or practical to introduce a bond system for visitors considered 'a high risk'. The migration regulations for the current sponsored migrant visa classes do not contain a clause precluding further sponsorships by persons who may have previously sponsored someone who had been unlawfully in Australia. Sponsored migrant visa applicants on arrival become permanent residents of Australia. The issue of overstaying the validity of a visa and remaining in Australia unlawfully for this category of people does not arise. Statute of the International Criminal Court (Question No. 683) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for the Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 3 June 1999: (1) Which states have signed the Statute of the International Criminal Court adopted in Rome on 17 July 1998. (2) When and where did each state sign the Statute. (3) Which signatory states have ratified, accepted or approved the Statute. (4) When did each state deposit its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval. (5) Which states have acceded to the Statute. (6) When did each state deposit its instrument of accession. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (lH6) The information sought is made publicly available by the United Nations Secretariat, New York, on its website at <http://www.un.org/Depts/ Treaty> Indonesian Government: Arming Milita (Question No. 687) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 7 June 1999: (1) Has the Australian Government taken steps to (a) prevent the Indonesian m!litary armin- para militias in East Timor and (b) disarm para mIlItary groups in East Timor; if so, what steps. (2) Is he satisfied that the undert-kings on disarming militia given by the Indones-as at the recent Bali meeting are being honoured; If not, why not. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Government ha- repeatedly registered its concern with the IndoneSIan Government about the security situation in East Timor, including at Head of Government level, most notably during the Prime Minister's meet!ng with President Habibie in Bali in April. Smce the paramilitary groups emerged as a prominent. feature of the security environment in East Timor m early 1999, Australian officials have made over 50 representations to Indonesian Governme-t representatives in Jakarta and East Timor, rangmg from the Chief of the Armed Forces and the Foreign Minister to local government officials and military commanders in the field. Our representations have routinely included references the matter - f. the Indonesian Government's support for paramIlItary groups, the need to rein in paramilitaries, and the need for disarmament. (2) At the Bali Summit, the Indonesian Government did not make specific undertakings on the matter of disarming militia. President Habibie did announce publicly that Indonesia was prepared to commit itself to the agreements then under negotiation in New York. These agreements include in the Agreement Regarding Security a paragraph t--t states ""... (the Commission on Peace and StabIlIty) in cooperation with the United Nations, will elaborate a code of conduct, by which all parties should abide, for a period prior to and following the consultation, ensure the laying down of arms and take the necessary steps to achieve disarmament"". It is disappointing to note that so far the Commission on Peace and Stability has had difficulty becoming fully operational, and has not made progress on the question of disarmament. We are further concerned that not enough has been done by the Indonesian Government to address the question of disarmament, and that the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) has not been playing the neutral role called for by the 5 May agreement. Deportation Groups (Question No. 718) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 8 June 1999: (1) Has his attention been drawn to recent allegations in Senate Estimates hearings concerning the deportation of an eight and a half month pregnant woman to China; if so, is he able to say what (a) are her whereabouts and (b) is her condition. (2) Has the woman had contact with officers of his Department since her deportation; and if so, (a) what was the nature of the contact, (b) when did the contact occur and (c) are there letters, notes, memoranda or other correspondence concerning the contact; if so, will he provide copies of the correspondence; and if he will not, why not. (3) Has he or his Department had contact with the relevant officials of the People's Republic of China concerning the matter before and since the deportation; if so, (a) what was the nature of the contact, (b) when did the contact occur and (c) are there letters, notes, memoranda or other correspondence concerning the contact; if s-, will - e provide copies of the correspondence; If he WIll not, why not. (4) Did the Government undertake to protect and preserve the woman's physical safety before she was deported; if so, what measures has his department taken to fulfil the undertaking. (5) Was the woman sedated at or about the time she was deported; if so (a) by whom, (b) with what medication, (c) what dose was administered, (d) did officers of his department forcibly restrain her to enable sedation to be administered; if so, who were they and (e) will he take steps to prevent a recurrence; if so, what steps. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (lH5) I am aware of the allegations concerning the woman, which are the subject of an indepertdent Inquiry which I announced on 10 May 1999. This Inquiry is being undertaken - y Mr Tony Ayers AC, a distinguished former publIc servant. Und-r the Inquiry's terms of reference, Mr Ayers WIll ""examine, assess, and make fmdings and recommendations as appropriate, on all processes and procedures of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DlMA) relating to (the woman's) case;"". The allegations will .as,? be examined by the Senate Legal and ConstItutIonal References Committee inquiry into Australia's refugee and humanitarian program. I underst-that the woman in question has returned to BeIhaI where she has relatives, and that she and her small daughter are in good health. However, it would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt the findings of either inquiry by responding on other matters raised.",210
