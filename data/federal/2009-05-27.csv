NA INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",17
2,Ms ROXON,FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2009 will amend various acts to give effect to the recent budget measure to introduce three new private health insurance incentives tiers. The new arrangements will commence on the later of 1 July 2010; or the day on which the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Act 2009 receives royal assent; or the day on which the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Act 2009 receives royal assent. However, they will not commence at all unless both the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Act 2009 and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Act 2009 also receive royal assent. The government supports a mixed model of balanced private and public health services. The government is also committed to a sustainable private health system, and to ensure it remains sustainable, the government will rebalance support for private health insurance to provide a fairer distribution of benefits. The new arrangements will make the private health rebate fairer. Firstly, singles earnwill ing $75,000 or less and couples and families earning $150,000 or less will received the same rebate as they currently enjoy and will not be adversely affected. Currently, however, approximately 14 per cent of single taxpayers who have incomes above $75,000 receive about 28 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to singles-or twice their population share. Under the government's reforms, these singles will receive about 12 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to singles. Similarly, approximately 12 per cent of couple taxpayers who have incomes above $150,000 receive about 21 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to couples-almost twice their population share. Under the government's reforms, these couples will receive about nine per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to couples. These reforms will bring government support for private health insurance in line with the principle underpinning the Australian tax-transfer system-that the largest benefits are provided to those on lower incomes. Spending on the current private health insurance rebate is growing rapidly and is expected to double as a proportion of health expenditure within the next 40 years. Clearly this presents challenges in this fiscal environment. These reforms will result in a saving to government expenditure of $1.9 billion over four years, which will help ensure that government support for private health insurance remains fair and sustainable. From 1 July 2010 the government proposes to introduce three new private health insurance incentive tiers. The tiers will mean high-income earners receive less government payments for private health insurance but face an increase in costs if they opt out of private health cover. The government's commitment to retaining the private health insurance rebate remains. Rebates for eight million lowand middle-income earners will be unchanged with the government continuing to pay 30 per cent of the premium cost for a person earning $75,000 or less and couples and families earning $150,000 or less. The existing higher rebates for older Australians will remain in place for people earning below these thresholds: 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69 years and 40 per cent for people aged 70 years and over. These people will continue to have no surcharge liability if they decide not to take out appropriate private health insurance. The new tiered system will be introduced for higher income earners and will set three different rebate levels and surcharge levels based on income and age. The purpose of this is to reduce the carrot but increase the stick and ensure those who can afford to contribute more for their health insurance do so. The government does not believe it is appropriate for low-income earners to subsidise the private health insurance of high-income earners. The first incentive tier will apply to singles with an income of more than $75,000 and couples and families with an income of more than $150,000. For these people the private health insurance rebate will be 20 per cent for those up to 65 years, 25 per cent for those aged 65-69, and 30 per cent for those aged 70 and over. The Medicare levy surcharge for people in this tier who do not hold appropriate private health insurance will remain at one per cent. Tier 2 applies to singles earning more $90,000 and couples and families earning more than $180,000. The rebate will be 10 per cent for those up to 65 years, 15 per cent for those aged 65 to 69, and 20 per cent for those aged 70 and over. The surcharge for people in this tier who do not have appropriate private health insurance will be increased to 1.25 per cent of income. Tier 3 affects singles earning more than $120,000 and couples and families earning more than $240,000 a year. No private health insurance rebate will be provided for people who fall within the third tier and the surcharge for avoiding private health insurance will be increased to 1.5 per cent of income for these people. Annual indexation to average weekly earnings of the tiers will ensure that these changes remain equitable and can be maintained into the future. The increased surcharge for people on higher incomes will help ensure that about 99.7 per cent of insured people remain in private health insurance. This is because those high-income earners who receive a lower rebate will face a higher tax penalty for avoiding private health insurance. By retaining this system of carrots and sticks the reforms are unlikely to affect private health insurance premiums. It is estimated that approximately 25,000 people may no longer be covered by private health insurance hospital cover, and that it might therefore result in 8,000 additional public hospital admissions over two years. When considered against the fact that public hospitals have around 4.7 million admissions per year, the impact of the measure will be insignificant. And the measure will be particularly insignificant for public hospitals given the than government's investment under the new $64 billion COAG agreement, where hospitals receive 50 per cent over and above the old Australian healthcare agreements negotiated by the previous government. Further, the historic $872 million investment in preventative health will assist in keeping people out of hospitals in the first place. In summary, this measure will make private health fairer and more balanced, more sustainable into the long term, and by maintaining a carefully designed system of carrots and sticks, have a negligible effect on both premiums and the public hospital system. At the same time, eight million lowand middle-income earners who chose to have private health insurance will continue to enjoy the benefit of a significant government rebate. I commend the bill to the House Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adjourned. NA NA (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
3,Ms ROXON,INSURANCE INCENTIVES,I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to give effect to the budget measure to introduce three new private health insurance incentives tiers. The bill will commence immediately after the commencement of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 2009. The Medicare Levy Act 1986 determines whether an individual is liable to pay the Medicare levy surcharge in respect of their taxable income or that of their spouse. The individual's income for surcharge purposes determines whether a person must pay the surcharge. If the individual's income exceeds prescribed income thresholds they will need to pay the appropriate level of surcharge. This bill inserts the new tier system in order to determine which level of surcharge a person must pay where they do not hold appropriate private health insurance. Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adjourned. NA NA (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGEFRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time.

4,Ms ROXON,INSURANCE INCENTIVES,I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 will amend the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy SurchargeFringe Benefits) Act 1999 to give effect to the recent budget measure to introduce three new private health insurance incentives tiers. The bill will commence immediately after the commencement of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 2009. The A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Act 1999 determines whether an individual is liable to pay the Medicare levy surcharge in respect of a reportable fringe benefits total they or their spouse may have. The individual's income for surcharge purposes determines whether a person must pay the surcharge. If the individual's income exceeds prescribed income thresholds they will need to pay the appropriate level of surcharge. This bill inserts the new tier system in order to determine which level of surcharge a person must pay where they do not hold appropriate private health insurance. I commend the bill to the House.

Second Reading,22
5,Ms GILLARD,CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (9.13 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today the Australian government continues delivering on its election promises in Forward with Fairness. The Australian government delivered the death of Work Choices with the passage of the Fair Work Act 2009 (the Fair Work Act). This is what Australians voted for at the 2007 election and it has been delivered. The presentation of the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009 into this parliament was a further step forward in paving the way for delivering a balanced, modern workplace relations system for Australia and providing sensible and practical transitional for movement into the new workplace relations system. A key commitment in Forward with Fairness was the creation of a uniform national workplace relations system for the private sector-a workplace relations system where businesses, large and small, are covered by one national system and one set of laws. We undertook to work cooperatively with the states to achieve this goal. To this end, state and territory governments have been extensively consulted on all aspects of the Fair Work legislation. The Australian government proposed that a uniform national workplace relations system for the private sector would be achieved either by state governments referring powers for private sector workplace relations, or other forms of cooperation and harmonisation. I indicated in my second reading speech on the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill on 19 March 2009 that I would introduce a further bill in May that would deal with consequential amendments to other Commonwealth legislation resulting from the Fair Work Act, and additional amendments consequential to any state referrals of power. I introduce that bill, the Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill 2009, to the House today with the additional announcement that this bill provides a framework for the Victorian state government to refer its workplace relations powers to the Commonwealth. On 4 February 2009, the Victorian Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon. Martin Pakula MP, wrote to me confirming the Victorian government's decision to make a new text based referral to underpin the application of the Fair Work Act to all Victorian employers and their employees with effect provisions from 1 July 2009. The Australian government anticipates that the Victorian government's bill to refer legislative power to this parliament will be introduced into the Victorian parliament shortly, and passed in time to coincide with the commencement of the Fair Work Act on 1 July 2009. This will ensure that there are no interruptions in coverage for Victorian employers and employees. This will provide certainty of coverage to the working people and businesses of Victoria. Given the importance of this bill in providing certainty to Victorian employers and employees, I call on the opposition to support the timely passage of this bill. It is anticipated that the Victorian bill will refer to the Commonwealth parliament, for the purposes of paragraph 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution, the power to: - enact text that would extend the Fair Work Act in Victoria to cover unincorporated and public sector employers and their employees, and outworker entities, and extend the application of the general protections in a referring state; - amend the Fair Work Act in relation to specified subject matters; and effect the transition of Victorian referral employees and employers from the system in place under the Workplace Relations Act 1996, as extended by the Commonwealth Powers (Industrial Relations) Act 1996 (Vic), to the new system created by the Fair Work Act. Under Work Choices, not all parts of the laws were supported by Victoria's subject matter referral, making the laws unduly complex and inconsistent in their application. The making of a text based referral by Victoria will ensure that all parts of the Fair Work legislation operate in the same way for all employees in Victoria. Initial reference The bill amends the Fair Work Act to enable states to refer matters to the Commonwealth with a view to establishing a uniform national workplace relations system for employers and employees in the private sector. In the short term, Victoria is likely to be the only state that would be a ‘referring state' under the bill. However, the bill establishes a framework that is ready to be adapted in future Commonwealth legislation to accommodate anticipated further references from other states. The bill also provides scope for referring states to choose the extent to which the act would cover their public sector workforces. The Australian government is continuing to work cooperatively with other states to secure references of power in time for full commencement of the system on 1 January 2010. In this context, the government anticipates that the reference framework provided in the bill may be further amended to take into account the views and needs of the other states concerning their national system participation. Amendment reference The bill will also reflect Victoria's referunderpinned ence to enable amendment of the Fair Work Act in respect of specified subject matters insofar as any such amendments would otherwise be outside Commonwealth power. The bill's amendment reference provisions will enable the Fair Work Act to be amended to apply to all employers and employees in a referring state uniformly. The subject matters of the amendment reference provisions correspond with the matters regulated by the Fair Work Act. Some subject matters reflecting areas of regulatory responsibility of the state-such as equal opportunity and discrimination, occupational health and safety, public holidays, outworkers and workplace surveillancewill be excluded from the subject matters of the amendment reference. These matters generally correspond to those state laws the operation of which is preserved by the Fair Work Act. However, these exclusions will not prevent the Commonwealth from amending the Fair Work Act in relation to any of these matters to the extent that the Fair Work Act, as originally enacted, deals with them or enables modern awards and enterprise agreements to deal with these matters. Transitional reference The bill will require a referring state to refer matters relating to the transition to the national system. Victoria's new reference will enable the Commonwealth to transition Victorian employers and employees from the system in place under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to the new system created by the Fair Work Act. The anticipated Victorian bill will refer legislative power to enable the Commonwealth parliament to legislate to establish transitional arrangements for Victoriaspecific awards and common rule awards by the existing Victorian reference. To that extent, the bill will amend the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009 so that it also applies in relation to ‘state reference transitional awards' and ‘state reference common rules'. These instruments will be derived from Victorian reference awards, transitional Victorian reference awards and common rule awards currently dealt with under schedule 6 to the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Amendments will also be made to the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009 so that the new legislative framework operates effectively in relation to state reference transitional awards and common rule awards from 1 July 2009. Treatment of State public sector employees The bill makes clear that a state is a ring state for the purpose of the legislative scheme, even though the matters referred may be subject to certain exclusions relating to public sector employment. This is consistent with the Australian government's policy to enable referring states to decide the extent to which their public sector workforces should be covered by the new system. The bill will also amend the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009 and the Fair Work Act to implement a process for the making of state reference public sector modern awards. In the first instance, these awards will cover public sector employers and employees in Victoria that are within the scope of Victoria's reference of power. Termination of reference The bill also makes it clear that a state will be a referring state notwithstanding that the state's referral law provides for the reference to terminate in certain circumstances. This is consistent with other Commonwealth references. The bill will provide however that a state will cease to be a referring state if any or all of the text, amendment or transitional references terminate. This reflects the need to ensure the Fair Work Act can be amended in a uniform, coherent way. Consequential amendments The bill will also make transitional and consequential amendments to 67 Commonwealth acts that refer to parts of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 or to instruments under that act, and which will be repealed by the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009. These consequential amendments will replace references to concepts, institutions and referinstruments in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 with references to corresponding concepts, institutions and instruments in the Fair Work Act. This includes changing references from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Australian Fair Pay Commission to Fair Work Australia. This bill also makes amendments to certain other Commonwealth legislation to clarify the operation of that legislation in the new federal workplace relations system. The more significant of these amendments include: - amendments to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 to enable the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to refer to Fair Work Australia industrial instruments alleged to breach the Age Discrimination Act 2004 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992; - amendments to the Migration Act 1958 to align the powers of migration inspectors in relation to employee records with the powers of Fair Work Inspectors under the Fair Work Act; and - amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 to apply that legislation to small business operators within the meaning of that act who are also associations of employees. Inter-governmental agreement State governments participating in the national system will also be governed by a multilateral inter-governmental agreement (IGA), which will outline the principles of the national workplace relations system for the private sector and the roles and responsibilities of those participating states and tories and the Commonwealth. The Australian government has undertaken significant consultation with the state and territory governments and, while these discussions are progressing well, the multilateral inter-governmental agreement may not be finalised prior to the Victorian referral date of 1 July 2009. Accordingly, the Victorian referral will be governed by an interim bilateral inter-governmental agreement until the multilateral inter-governmental agreement is finalised with other participating states. The interim bilateral intergovernmental agreement sets out consultation arrangements between the Commonwealth and Victoria in relation to amendments to the Fair Work legislation. Conclusion This government is well on the way to achieving its goal of a uniform national workplace relations system for the private sector. The new national system is based on fairness for working people, flexibility for business and the promotion of productivity and economic growth for the future prosperity of our nation. The fundamental basis of the new system was established with the passage of the Fair Work Act 2009. The bill I have introduced today is the next step in the creation of the national workplace relations system for the private sector promised by this government. In making a fresh referral, the Victorian government has recognised the benefits of a national workplace relations system, including eliminating the costs and confusion for business and employees of dealing with separate workplace relations systems and instruments. Over the coming months we anticipate other states will also take the step of becomterriing full participants in implementing this crucial national reform. I commend the bill and the explanatory memorandum to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adjourned. NA NA APPROPRIATION BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Swan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",22
6,Mr SWAN,TERRITORY BORROWING,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I am introducing a bill to provide a standing appropriation to pay any possible future claims made under the Australian government's guarantee of state and territory borrowing. The guarantee will support jobs and protect infrastructure programs from the ravages of the global recession. It recognises that now is certainly not the time for governments to pull back on infrastructure investment. Pulling back on infrastructure investment now would mean even slower growth and higher unemployment. The government has decided that the quickest and most effective way to implement the guarantee was to use the Commonwealth's executive power to establish a contractually based scheme. This follows the practice used for putting the wholesale funding guarantee into place. Although the guarantee is a contractually based scheme, an appropriation is needed in the very unlikely event the government needs to make a payment of a claim under the guarantee. In order for the scheme to be effective in allowing the states and territories access to the credit markets, ratings agencies and investors need to be confident claims will be paid quickly if a state or territory were to default on an obligation. That is why the government is acting now to put in place this standing appropriation. The bill has two substantive measures. A standing appropriation is established by the bill to enable claims to be paid in a timely manner, in the unlikely event that claims are made under the guarantee, and to allow borrowings made under the bill to be repaid. A borrowing power is also provided to enable timely payment of claims should there be insufficient funds in the Consolidated Revenue Fund when the claims are to be paid. Quick passage of this bill will ensure that the guarantee will be fully effective once the contractual arrangements are in place. The Rudd government has taken decisive action to stimulate the domestic economy, mostly through direct government investments. But we know that for this stimulus to be effective, it is essential that states continue maintain their own investment programs to support the economy, and protect jobs. There has never been a more important time for governments to support jobs today by building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. That is why we are nation building for recovery. And it is why I am introducing this legislation today. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 BUDGET MEASURES No. 1) BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Swan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
7,Mr SWAN,TERRITORY BORROWING,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Rudd government is proud to be delivering in the 2009 budget a fair go for pensioners. This support for our pensioners is long overdue. But we also had to make some tough decisions to ensure the pension and retirement income system is sustainable and affordable into the future. We could not lift the base rate of the pension without making savings elsewhere in the budget. In total, the measures in this bill provide budgetary savings of almost $5 billion over the forward estimates. Schedule 1 will better target the current general exemption applying to foreign employment income of those who are Austrato lian residents for income tax purposes. It will enhance the fairness and integrity of the tax system by ensuring that Australian resident taxpayers who work in low-tax jurisdictions pay the same rate of Australian tax as individuals who work in Australia. From 1 July 2009, an exemption will apply to income earned as an aid worker, a charitable worker or under certain types of government employment such as a defence or police deployment. It will also apply to income earned as prescribed under regulations. Foreign employment income relating to projects that are in the national interest will remain exempt under existing rules. Other foreign employment income earned on or after 1 July 2009 will be subject to Australian income tax, unless exempt under another provision of the tax law. However, a non-refundable tax offset will be claimable for foreign income tax paid on that income. This change is expected to provide an ditional $675 million over the forward estimates. To deliver necessary savings, the government will also temporarily reduce the government superannuation co-contribution for eligible contributions made between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2014. Schedule 2 to this bill implements a temporary reduction in the co-contribution matching rate to 100 per cent for eligible contributions. The criteria to qualify for a cocontribution, including income eligibility thresholds, will remain unchanged. The scheme will still provide a very generous incentive for those lowand middleincome earners to save towards their retirement. These amendments deliver savings of around $1.4 billion over the forward estimates. The Australia's future tax system review report into retirement incomes found that tax-assisted voluntary superannuation contrithe bill. butions should be more fairly distributed and that the current cap on the concessions should be reconsidered. Schedule 3 to this bill implements the government's response to this finding, while making a long-term contribution to sustainable pension reform, by reducing the level of the concessional contributions caps from 2009-10. The concessional superannuation caps provide generous tax concessions primarily to high-income earners. The caps will now be halved-from $50,000 to $25,000 for those under 50, and from $100,000 to $50,000 for those subject to the existing transitional cap until 30 June 2012 for those aged over 50. It is estimated that only 1.8 per cent of inad- dividuals making contributions will be affected by this measure-and these are predominantly high-income earners. This measure goes some way to reducing the disproportionate benefits to high-income earners who can afford to make large concessional contributions. The caps remain generous, and other incentives to contribute to superannuation remain, including the concessional treatment of fund earnings and in retirement. This measure will save around $2.8 billion over the forward estimates. The budget measures in this bill are part of a strategy that will ensure that we can build a fair and sustainable retirement incomes system into the future. Every self-funded retiree has an interest in a decent safety net, especially now. And in tough times such as these the government has had to take the tough decisions to deliver this important reform. Full details of these measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum to Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adjourned. COORDINATOR-GENERAL FOR NA BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",27
8,Ms MACKLIN,REMOTE INDIGENOUS SERVICES,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (9.36 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill creates the position of CoordinatorGeneral for Remote Indigenous Services to drive the implementation of the Council of Australian Governments' (COAG) reforms across a range of areas including service delivery, employment and housing. In late November 2008, COAG signed a National Partnership Agreement on Remote Service Delivery, which will change the way governments invest in remote areas, providing coordinated, concentrated and accelerated development across all levels of government. The new model for remote service delivery will initially concentrate resources in priority locations across Australia. The benchmark will be progressively to deliver in communities or townships facilities and services comparable with that in non-Indigenous communities of similar size, location and need elsewhere in Australia. Government investment will be prioritised and coordinated to ensure each priority location has the infrastructure and services that support and sustain healthy social norms so people can reach their potential and communities can thrive. As the backlogs are addressed and locations brought up to comparable standards, the approach will be extended to other remote communities. Reporting directly to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the coordinator-general will work closely with Commonwealth, state and territory governments to ensure real improvements for Indigenous Australians against COAG's Closing the Gap targets in remote locations specified by the minister. The bill allows the minister to specify communities that are either remote or very remote and where a significant proportion of the population is Indigenous. The position has been established to address the practical problems associated with designing, sequencing and rolling out a myriad of programs in remote communities. The coordinator-general will ensure that the delivery of all government programs in the specified remote communities is coordinated between governments instead of being planned and delivered in isolation. The coordinator-general will remove bureaucratic blockages and ensure commitments by government agencies are delivered on time by monitoring requirements under the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Service Delivery and other COAG reforms, assessing progress and advising government where there are gaps, slow progress, or where improvements need to be made. The coordinator-general will also oversee planning and strategic investment in communities and provide agencies with guidance on good practice. The coordinator-general will meet regularly with national and state and territory officials who will be identified as coordinators by individual government agencies or jurisdictions. The coordinator-general will provide information to agencies on obstacles within their areas of responsibility and advise the minister and COAG on the need for systemic changes. Some of the problems may be addressed through better systems and cooperation by agencies, while others will require policy responses which require ministerial involvement. The coordinator-general's approach will be to work with other parties collaboratively. The coordinator-general will provide regular reports to the minister on the progress made by all Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. However, when there is an issue requiring urgent remedy, this bill will give the coordinator-general the powers: - to require people to provide information and/or documents; - to require people to attend meetings; and - to request assistance from Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. If the coordinator-general fails to receive an adequate response from an agency official, this bill allows for the matter to be reported to the head of the relevant Commonwealth, state or territory agency. If the coordinator-general is not satisfied with the response from the head of the agency, the coordinator-general may report the matter to the minister and also the Prime Minister if necessary. This bill also requires the coordinatorgeneral to report to the minister twice each year, or as otherwise required, on the development and delivery of remote services since the last report, and on the progress that has been made in achieving the Closing the Gap targets within the specified remote localities. The bill outlines the administrative sions about the appointment of the coordinator-general including their appointment, acting arrangements, remuneration and leave, and resignation or termination of appointment. The bill also makes provision for the coordinator-general to arrange with the Secretary for the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs for the services of APS employees from the department to be made available. The establishment of this office is long overdue. It is supported by all Australian governments through COAG, to ensure government commitments in remote Indigenous communities are met. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (IMPROVED SUPPORT FOR CARERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL) BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",29
9,Ms MACKLIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (9.42 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Improved Support for Carers) (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2009 provides part of the government's response to the report of the Carer Payment (child) Review Taskforce, and gives effect to a number of measures aimed at improving assistance to carers from 1 July 2009. It has received wide-ranging support and been passed by the House of provi- Representatives. The bill being introduced today makes amendments as a consequence of the measures contained in the improved support for carers bill. That bill makes substantive changes to the qualification provisions for carer payment paid in respect of a child. This companion bill makes minor amendments of a consequential and transitional nature. The amendments include removal of references in the social security law that, from 1 July 2009, will be redundant and replaces those references with new terms and references necessary for the proper administration of the changes introduced in the improved support for carers bill. Amendments made by this bill will provide that carers who qualify for carer payment under the new qualification provisions will be able to take advantage of the 63 days (or the pro rata equivalent for carers qualified on a short-term or episodic basis) on which carers can temporarily cease to provide constant care and remain qualified for carer payment. The bill provides that nominated visa holders who cannot qualify for carer payment as they do not meet the residence requirement can be granted an exemption from the activity test in relation to special benefit if they are providing care to a child or children who meet the criteria contained in the new qualification provisions. The bill also amends the provisions that relate to the nomination of the principal beneficiary of a special disability trust, under the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, to reflect the changes made by the introduction of the improved qualification criteria for carer payment. Lastly, the bill provides for backdating of carer payment for people who apply for carer payment under one of the new qualification provisions. A person who makes an application before 1 October 2009 will be able to have their carer payment backdated until 1 July 2009 or to the date they became qualified for carer payment. The earliest they can become qualified is the date of implementation of the new qualification provision, which is 1 July 2009. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adjourned. NA (PROTECTION OF IDENTIFYING INFORMATION) BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Laurie Ferguson. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",30
10,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"ReidParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (9.46 am)I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Migration Amendment (Protection of Identifying Information) Bill 2009 (the ‘bill') amends the Migration Act 1958 (the ‘act') to ensure that identifying information obtained by the department is protected and governed by part 4A of the act, which regulates the use, access and disclosure of ‘identifying information'. The bill also provides that the personal identifiers and personal information disclosed under certain provisions must only be disclosed by an officer to the extent necessary in order to obtain help from an individual to identify, authenticate the identity of, or locate the subject in connection with the administration of the act. The act currently provides for a strict regime for the collection, use, access and disclosure of ‘personal identifiers' collected under the act. This regime was inserted into the act by the Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Act 2004. Part 4A provides for the obligations relating to identifying information and contains criminal penalties of imprisonment for two years or 120 penalty units, or both, for the unauthorised disclosure modification, impairment or failure to destroy tifying information as soon as practicable when required by the Archives Act 1983. Section 336A of part 4A, as inserted by the 2004 amendments, provided that the definition for ‘identifying information' included ‘any personal identifier' and information and measurements derived from personal identifiers. A ‘personal identifier' is defined in section 5A of the act to include fingerprints or handprints, measurements of a person's height and weight, a photograph or other image of a person's face and shoulders, an audio or video recording of a person's face, an iris scan, a person's signature or certain other identifiers prescribed by regulations. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Information and Other Measures) Act 2007, however, made an amendment to the definition of ‘identifying information' in paragraph 336A(a) to provide that it is ‘any personal identifier provided under section 40, 46, 166, 170, 175, 188, 192 or 261AA of the act.' The purpose of this amendment was to put beyond doubt that the offence provisions in part 4A only applied where the identifying information in question was a personal identifier provided under the specific sections above. However, since the amendments to the definition in 2007, it has come to the department's attention that this provision is more limited than the original policy intention intended. Recent legal advice suggests that personal identifiers belonging to our clients that are not currently protected by part 4A include those collected from other agencies (domestic or international), unsolicited external sources and from law enforcement agencies (often shared with the department as part of an investigation). In relation to these personal identifiers, DIAC has been adhering to part 4A of the Migration idenAct and the Privacy Act, where applicable, so there is no question of either act being breached. Into the years ahead, Australia is going to be working in close concert with our international partners to pursue projects which may better facilitate travel for the legitimate traveller at the same time as assisting to uncover identity fraud or crime. In particular, identifying information such as biometrics will become an increasingly important tool in the fight against identity crime. However, it is equally vital that identifying information-including biometrics-is shared strictly in accordance with the Prithe vacy Act 1988 and the disclosure provisions of the Migration Act 1958. In order to ensure that the rights and privacy of persons, whose personal identifiers are provided by international and external sources, are protected under the act, and to assure our international partners that the data they provide will be given this protection, it makes sense to subject all personal identifiers collected by DIAC for immigration purposes to the same statutory regime, that being part 4A of the act This bill will align the definition of ‘identifying information' in the act with the original policy intention in 2004 that all personal identifiers obtained by the department are protected and governed by part 4A of the act. As there are criminal penalties associated with the unauthorised disclosure, modification, impairment or failure to destroy identifying information when required, amendment of the definition by the parliament is required as soon as possible. In addition to the measures outlined, the bill also introduces a limit for the disclosure of personal information under sections 336FA and 336FB of the act. These sections authorise disclosure of certain personal identifiers for the purpose of obtaining an individual's help to identify, authenticate the identity of, or locate, a subject. The limit provide that, for a disclosure of information to be authorised for these purposes, the information must only be disclosed to the extent necessary in order to obtain an individual's help. The department ensures that identifying information is treated appropriately and in accordance with the act and the Privacy Act 1988. In particular, the department makes every effort to ensure any disclosures of identifying information outside of the department are done consistently with Information Privacy Principle 11(3). That is, bodies that receive this information are advised that they must not use or disclose of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which the information was given to them. The amendments in this bill will further support and enhance the department's appropriate handling of identifying information concerning our clients, including their personal identifiers. I commend the bill to the chamber. Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES No. 2) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 March, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time.",31
11,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"In speaking on this Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009 I indicate that the opposition will be supporting it. There are eight schedules that deal with a range of technical and mechanical matters with respect to our tax laws. They were outlined in great detail by the Assistant Treasurer when this bill was introduced at the end of the last sitting, but I will run through them briefly. Schedule 1 amends a range of acts, will including the Banking Act, the First Home Saver Accounts Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, to remove unintended tax implications that arise from a failed authorised deposit-taking institution to the relationship with APRA, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, with respect to payments made under the Financial Claims Scheme. This schedule will ensure that the payments made under the scheme are treated as if they were made by the failed authorised deposit-taking institution. It also prevents tax implications from arising from farm management deposit account holders who had their account with a failed approved deposit institution when they started-a new account with a separate ADI. For individuals with retirement savings accounts with a failed ADI, this schedule will ensure that the payments made by APRA into a new retirement savings account in a separate ADI will have the same tax treatment as a rollover superannuation benefit. Similarly, a payment made by APRA into a new first home savers account will be treated as a transfer from one to another. This will prevent individuals from claiming the government contribution twice. The schedule also deals with, and introduces, a range of reporting and withholding requirements for APRA in the case where an ADI fails and payments must be made under that scheme. Schedule 2 of the bill makes some amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and to some related legislation to provide greater accessibility to small business capital gains tax concessions for owners of capital gains assets used under a passive asset structure. This was introduced by the previous coalition government in 2007. At the time, changes were also made to the small business entity test and the net asset value test. Businesses in situations where an entity owns a capital gains tax asset but another related entity uses that asset in carrying on a business will now have greater access to those capital gains tax concessions. Schedule 3 proposes to clarify the law with respect to capital gains tax. Again, it does so by amending the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. This is a highly technical area, as the Assistant Treasurer outlined in his second reading speech. This schedule is seeking to remove beyond any doubt what could be a technical interpretation of the law that might in a worse case scenario-the Assistant Treasurer and I would probably agree that it would be a remote scenario, but nonetheless a highly technical interpretation-see taxpayers having a CGT liability on receiving a tax offset and the like. This schedule simply puts beyond any doubt that unintended consequence occurring. Schedule 4 provides a refundable tax offset for certain projects approved under the National Urban Water and Desalination Plan. The offsets are to be available from 2008-09 through to 2012-13 by issuing certificates. There is a range of detail about that within the bill. Schedule 5, which is a common schedule in our tax laws amendment bills, updates the deductible gifts recipient list, it does that in two ways: by adding four new entities and by renewing three existing entities that the Assistant Treasurer outlined in his speech. Schedule 6 will expand the operation of the Australian Business Register, which was established by the former coalition government to reduce administrative costs for small businesses dealing with government agencies with the intent of reducing the number of times businesses have to give identical information to different agencies. This schedule will expand the operation of the register by using certain contact information provided by business to a government agency for updating information at all the other related government agencies. In doing so, it will allow the business register to act as a multi-agency registration authority. Schedule 7 removes the requirement for a business to be a member of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program to be eligible for more than $3 million in fuel tax credits. The requirement was there in the past. However, because the program ceases operation on 30 June this year it would have meant that businesses would not have been able to claim their fuel tax credits. This simply ensures that unintended consequence does not occur. The last schedule, schedule 8, will provide a tax exemption for payments made up under the clean-up and restoration grants scheme. Back in February, in the wake of the tragic bushfires in my home state of Victoria, the federal government and the Victorian state government announced a $51 million assistance package to assist small business and primary producers affected by the bushfires. I note that one of the ministers responsible for that, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, is here in the chamber. That has been a good package. It includes $5,000 clean-up and restoration grants, which can increase to up to $25,000 if the damage is significant. What this schedule does, the and minister will be relieved to know, is ensure that these grants are not treated as assessable income. That exemption will apply from 2008-09 through the 2010 income year. As I said at the outset, this tax law amendment bill deals with a range of necessary and technical tax matters to ensure the correct operation of the law. It went to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. The committee reported on 7 May. It recommended that the bill be passed. The opposition is supporting this bill and I commend it to the House.",33
12,Mr RIPOLL,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I thank the House for this opportunity to record some of my views on the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009. Firstly, it is a bill designed to either amend, fix or otherwise bring into order a range of tax matters and issues in order to provide for a more robust, better, more efficient and streamlined taxation system. That is at the core of not only what this government has been about in coming to government but also what we philosophically believe in terms of providing a system not only for ordinary PAYG taxpayers but also for business-small, medium and large-to provide them with the tools that they need to get on with the job of business. As such, this tax laws amendment bill works to improve the current system. Secondly, it deals with a number of very important matters that are specific to recent tragedies of the bushfires Victoria and other places. I acknowledge the comments by previous speakers in relation to that. It is a fairly straightforward bill. It has number of schedules, and I will work through those systematically. Schedule 1 outlines the financial claim schemes that were enacted in October 2008. The introduction of the legislation for these schemes was brought forward because of the global financial crisis, so it was not able to include the consequential taxation amendments at that particular point. The present package contains those taxation amendments. In broad terms, it aims to provide the same taxation treatment for payments that APRA makes under the financial claim schemes as would have applied to payments made by the failed financial institution or insurance company. It also deals with capital gains and losses specifically in relation to rights that were created by the financial claim schemes which are ignored. Payments in relation to a farm management deposit, for example, or a retirement savings account or a first home saver account will generally have to be made into another account of the same type. That poses some challenges in terms of reordering that. What this does is ensure that the normal restrictions on withdrawing amounts from those particular accounts are maintained. It is important for the integrity of the tax system, for the policies of this government and for taxpayers generally that taxpayer money being placed into these types of schemes and accounts be properly accounted for and that the restrictions that normally apply are applied right across the board. This ensures that the normal restrictions on withdrawing amounts are properly maintained. Those payments will generally be treated as a rollover from one account to another account to avoid them being treated as if they were a new account being opened, which in they are not. APRA will be subject to the same obligations to withhold amounts from payments and to the same reporting obligations in relation to amounts withheld or a rolled over that the failed institution would have been. That will provide the necessary integrity and clarity for people who find themselves covered by these changes. Schedule 2 increases the access for small business to capital gains tax concessions. It deals with not only tax concessions on capital gains but also losses. This is for taxpayers who own a capital gains tax asset which is used in a business but specifically by an affiliate or an entity connected with that taxpayer and for partners owning a capital gains tax asset which is used in the partnership business. This will have effect from the 2007-08 income year. It is important to recognise that, for many businesses and partnerships, assets are owned by different entities within that business or across partnerships and they should have the same capital gains tax concessions as other parties. It is a fairly sensible and straightforward change that needs to be made, and we are making it. I note that these amendments have been actively sought by industry as part of our process of consultation with industry and with the sector. We need to make sure that we reduce the amount of red tape, compliance burdens and costs on small business and so we need to move quickly to make these changes and bring about a fairer, better and more efficient system of taxation. The amendments under schedule 2 also make a number of changes to clarify and refine elements of the small business capital gains tax concessions so they operate in a flexible manner, as is the proper intent. Industry stakeholders did express support for the measures during the consultation process; in fact, a number of stakeholders suggested additional changes to the scope and application of the small business capital gains tax concessions. Although they were not adopted, as they were beyond the scope of the current amendments, they were certainly listened to and formed part of the decision making process. Another reason those changes were not adopted is that we believed they would lead to more complex provisions or greater compliance costs for taxpayers. Overall, schedule 2 brings about some necessary changes. (Quorum formed) Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, this is an outrageous abuse of the democratic process in this place-to gag a speaker on such a controversial piece of legislation such as the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009! I note for the record that we have got only two members of the opposition in here, because none of the others can be bothered to come in and hear about a decent piece of legislation that deals with a whole range of tax measures that their mob over there had 12 years to They could not be bothered, in 12 years, to do anythingMr Lindsay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order, which is that the member is required to speak to the legislation before the parliament. You should bring him back to the legislation.",35
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,I will determine that. The member for Herbert has no point of order. Mr Melham interjecting,36
14,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,The member for Banks! The member for Oxley has the call. Could those on my right either resume their seats and remain silent or leave the chamber.,36
15,Mr RIPOLL,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for drawing to the attention of the member for Herbert the fact that his point of order was out of order. That is exactly what it was: trying to gag the debate on this essential bit of legislation. I would note that taxation is one of the most important and critical parts of the Australian economic system that we have in this country and something that this government has been committed to since winning the election: actually dealing with it properly, after 12 years of the mob on the other side sitting on their hands. I am sure their hands are so numb they can barely get up and flick through their standing orders to find a new point of order on which they could possibly sit me down and not have me speak on this bill. But I turn backMr Ciobo-How's that franchising report going, Bernie?",36
16,Mr RIPOLL,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"The franchising report is going very, very well, in fact. I turn back to why this bill in particular and these schedules are very much part of modernising the Australian tax system and ensure that we fix. provide small business-while the Liberal and National parties may think that this is their constituency, it always seems to me that it is Labor governments who make the hard decisions and make the necessary changes for them-with a more efficient method of taxation, a means by which to reduce red tape and bureaucracy and, in the end, a means through the tax system to ensure that they can get on with their business of providing services and products to the Australian community and economy, rather than being burdened or saddled with masses of legislation. I am sure the two members of the opposition sitting at the table would understand that, given that during their reign of power there was a doubling and tripling of the amount of taxation laws, creating this massive burden and impost on ordinary businesspeople trying to go about their daily work. In relation to tax benefits and capital tax, our amendments under schedule 3 provide a general exemption from capital gains tax for capital gains or capital losses arising from a right or entitlement to a tax offset, deduction or similar benefit. That is pretty important, given the current environment, and adds to the number of incentives that this government has provided to small business operators and owners, medium-sized enterprises and large businesses to ensure that they can properly deal with the economic circumstances that have been thrust on us by the global financial crisis. The amendment puts beyond doubt that a capital gain or capital loss would not arise for taxpayers who have a right to receive a tax offset, a deduction or any other tax benefit on the satisfaction of that right. Without going into the great list of incentives, offsets and deductions that we have put in place, this is an important measure to ensure that the tax system works hand in hand with the community and hand in hand with business operators. Mr Ciobo-You should go through the list. It wouldn't take long. There are only one or two.",36
17,Mr RIPOLL,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I can hear a faint, distant voice from a member of the opposition. It is only faint because on these matters they are very quiet; they just peep up a little bit in the background. In the end, it is not so much that you should be measured in this place by what you say; you should be measured by what you do. I am very proud of the legacy that this government will leave, whether it is infrastructure development, boosting the economy, providing tax offsets and improvements to the tax system or greater efficiencies. Beyond doubt, the government's economic stimulus packages have made a great contribution to Australia, ensuring not gains only that we survive the economic crisis brought on by global circumstances but also that we thrive and that people get on with their day-today lives and their business affairs. Industry stakeholders particularly have expressed support for the measures we are putting forward and we thank them for their support-the Australian Industry Group, other business organisations, independent economists and others. They support the measures because they are really good measures, designed to be in the national interest. We hear all sorts of abuse from the other side when particular groups are mentioned, but they cannot have it both ways. When it suits you, you cannot be patting them on the back and when they say something that may not suit you, you cannot say that their voice is irrelevant or has no credibility. That is a real issue. I do not think the opposition understand that. They have some real issues with what they see as a voice out in the community, a balanced and fair interpretation or analysis of the things we are putting forward. Having been an opposition member in this place for a very long time, almost 10 years, causes me to reflect on the things I could have done had I been in government for that time. The greatest lost opportunity which sticks in my mind-the things you can never really reverse, never really undo, the things you lament when you talk to your communities-is the lack of investment in infrastructure. In the good days, we used to come into this place and speak about the rivers of gold, the unexpected revenue and the windfalls that fell into the previous government's lap. When you think about the opportunities lostMr Lindsay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In accordance with standing order 76, I ask you to bring the member back to the question being considered in this debate.",37
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I thank the member for Herbert for his advice. I am listening to the member for Oxley. I remind him of the bill before the House, the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009.",38
19,Mr RIPOLL,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The only issue as to relevance is the opposition's relevance deprivation syndrome. The opposition are completely irrelevant when it comes to tax law, efficiencies for small business and other things, which is exactly what this bill is about. I am sure if anyone is listening or perhaps will read this later-if I am so lucky-they will think I am being completely relevant. The changes we are bringing about in this bill will provide a better tax system, doing the things that the previous government either were not interested in or did not have fortitude to do. That reminds me of all the lost opportunities, the things we could have done in those 10 years in opposition by stimulating the economy and providing a legacy of infrastructure-ports, rail, road, things which make a difference to communities, regardless of who represents them. We have been left with a great task, a task which we willingly face with great responsibility. My community shares the Ipswich Motorway-which we have heard a lot about-with neighbouring electorates. For all of the transport companies and small businesses using that lifeblood of a highway as a link between workplaces and homes, or business-to-business interactions, having to wait more than a decade for action to be taken and having to wait for a change of government has had a huge cost. It would be an interesting exercise to see opportunity cost, the cost to the economy today and how better placed we would have been during those three revenue rich years of the previous government-(Time expired)",38
20,Mr CIOBO,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"The member for Oxley remarked about people listening to this debate. Mr Deputy Speaker, if they were, I think they changed frequencies a long time ago. That would have to be one of the driest contributions I have heard about a bill that is so important not only for a number of aspects of the Australian economy but in particular for small business, which is my focus. There are many aspects and schedules to the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009 and I intend to confine my comments to those aspects that deal with small business and in particular the fact that this bill will make a number of concessions to ensure that there is some assistance provided to small business. If you were to listen to those opposite you would believe that in some way this bill is the the salvation of small business in Australia. In large part that is because this government is so completely derelict when it comes to support of Australia's 2.4 million small businesses that employ about 3.8 million Australians. For the vast majority of those opposite the closest contact they have with small business in this country is when they walk into one to buy a coffee. That is the most connection that the vast majority of government members have to small businesses in this country. That is the reason why I am pleased to talk about some of the things that the coalition did when we were in government and to outline some of our proposals about what we would do today if we were in government. In large part it stands as a contribution in response to the member for Oxley, who suggested that in some way nothing had been done for 12 years. He could not be more wrong. The fact is that the coalition does understand small business. Small business is the constituency of the coalition. The coalition understands small business-unlike those trade union hacks that sit on the government benches. There are a whole lot of them in the chamber now-and they are putting their hands up because they know. They went from university straight into the trade unions and from the trade unions straight into this chamber. Their knowledge of small business is nil. You say to one of them, ‘What can you tell me about PAYG instalments?' and they look blankly back at you. They have got no idea what that means for small business. So no wonder that the member for Oxley stands up in this chamber, chest puffed out, claiming that in some way this bill is going to do so much for small business and highlights, as one of the great accomplishments of the Rudd Labor government, assistance to small business in this country. No wonder that is the case because, really, the cupboard is bare when it comes to small business policy. We have seen, effectively, two announcements by the Rudd Labor government for the small business sector, the backbone of the Australian economy. There are 3.8 million Australians employed in the small business sector and there have been, effectively, two announcements. The first was the announcement with respect to PAYG instalment payments, which saw them reduced. The reason the Rudd Labor government did that was they copied the coalition's policy. I put out a press release on this about a month or two prior to the announcement by the Prime Minister and the small business minister. The coalition was out there leading the way on PAYG changes to help small business at this time and, lo and behold, the government said, ‘Gee, that's not a bad idea.' You could have seen Kevin Rudd and Dr Emerson, the member for Rankin, sitting down and saying, ‘What are we going to do on small business? I have got no idea. We do not know what to do. What does the coalition propose? Well, Steve Ciobo on behalf of the coalition has put out a press release-let's copy that.' So that is what the Labor Party did with their first announcement. The second announcement was put out by the Labor Party about their tax-effective investment allowance, and we have seen the Labor Party crowing about this proposal outlined in the budget. This was going to do so much to help Australian small businesses. That measure, like the one that is before the House today, will assist some small businesses-and there is no doubt about it; I am not going to pretend it does not. But the reality is that for the 93 per cent of Australian small businesses that are under cash flow stress, that announcement does nothing. And the reason that the announcement does nothing-and this is what Labor fails to understand-is you have got to have a dollar to spend a dollar. There is no point providing a tax-effective investment allowance increase to 50 per cent to encourage small businesses to spend if they do not have a dollar to spend or if they do not have access to credit. Labor just does not get it. Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting",38
21,Mr CIOBO,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"So I am very pleased to talk about our track record. I am pleased to talk about our six-point small business action plan which would ease cash flow, make it cheaper to employ people and keep people employed in Australia's small businesses. Particularly, though, because I gave a commitment to the minister and the parliamentary secretary at the table that I would only go for about five or six minutes, I will confine my comments now to honour my commitment. So I will specifically talk about the TLAB No. 2 bill and in particular I will make a couple of comments with respect to schedule 2. Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting",40
22,Mr CIOBO,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Schedule 2 of the bill expands the scope of the concessions for those assets which are used under a passive assets structure. The amendments allow a small business only a capital gains tax asset that is used in a business by an affiliate, or an entity associated with the small business, to access the small business capital gains tax concessions. The amendments also allow partners who own a capital gains tax asset that is used in a partnership business to access the small business capital gains tax concessions through the $2 million aggregated turnover test where the capital gains tax asset is not asset of the partnership. The coalition welcomes these amendments. Indeed, we have advocated for the small business capital gains tax concessions to be expanded further, and that was first outlined by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Nelson, in his budget-in reply a little over a year ago, and this would occur of course under an elected Turnbull government. It will further expand the small business capital gains tax concessions by reducing the active asset test from 15 years down to five years, giving small businesses access to the concessions. So I put that on the table as something else that the government should copy from the coalition. If you copy it from the coalition you will receive praise from the small business sector because it is something that the small business sector would like to see instituted. The commitment was made by the Leader of the Opposition in the 2008 budgetin-reply and the government is still to respond to our proposal. Only a Turnbull coalition government would provide further relief for retiring small business owners through the small business capital gains tax concessions. Finally, I have heard the interjections from the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, who is sitting opposite, that I go on longer. I will just indulge the House and myself for one brief moment to reflect on the comments made by the member for Oxley when he spoke about having spent 10 years in opposition focusing on the things that he was lamenting, the things that cannot be undone, and saying that they were his inspiration for policy. If there is one issue that the member for Oxley should be lamenting, if there is one example of a thing that cannot be undone, I would say to the government that it is their an $300 billion of debt. That is something that you should lament-$300 billion of debt that the small business men and women of Australia will have to pay for through higher interest rates and higher taxes. That is what cannot be undone. That is what the government should be lamenting, because of their $124 billion splurge of new spending. Ten million dollars an hour since the Rudd Labor government were elected is what the government should be lamenting. It will be, unfortunately, on the shoulders of Australia's 2.4 million small business men and women to be paid off. The Rudd Labor government have accrued $9,000 of debt for every single man, woman and child in the 18 months since they were elected. That is the great travesty of this reckless government, who have lost control of the public finances and are crippling confidence in Australia's small business sector. Small business men and women say to me that the best thing that this country could ever see would be for this reckless spending government to be voted out of office and for the coalition to be re-elected. It took us nearly 12 years to repay Labor's $96 billion worth of debt. It is going to take us who knows how many decades to repay Labor's $300 billion worth of debt, which they have managed to rack up in a relatively short 18 months. Having said all of that, I will honour my commitment to the parliamentary secretary at the table and confine my remarks to that.",40
23,Mr CHAMPION,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,I had no idea we were discussing debt today. I thought we were discussing the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009. The member for Moncrieff did not tell us what their debt policy is or what debt position is. Mr Ciobo-Less than yours.,41
24,Mr CHAMPION,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,How much less? Mr Ciobo-A lot less.,41
25,Mr CHAMPION,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,How much less? We will never hear a figure.,41
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,Order! Members will not engage in a debate across the table.,41
27,Mr CHAMPION,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"The truth is that the opposition may well attempt to balance the budget but they will raise taxes and slash services to do it. That is what their real icy is and I have spoken about that in this House in other debates. I should begin my remarks on this bill by commending the Assistant Treasurer on his diligence in preparing these measures included in the bill today. He has made an extensive effort to update several important technical and administrative procedures in our tax law. These amendments are a bit dry but they have very real impacts on the lives of families and workers throughout Australia. I support all the measures in the bill but I want to focus on four matters within it: firstly, the review of the tax consequences for claimants under the Financial Claims Scheme; secondly, the provisions for tax offsets for national urban water projects; thirdly, the update of fuel tax credit rules; and, finally, support for those affected by the devastating Victorian bushfires. The first schedule of this bill reflects the government's continuing commitment to making sure that the impacts of the global financial crisis and the recession do not punish Australian families. One measure that was introduced last October to protect the savings and the financial position of Australians was the Financial Claims Scheme. That their gave the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, the power to make payments to account holders in failed financial institutions. The establishment of the FCS followed consideration by the Council of Financial Regulators dating back to 2005. It reflects the recommendations made by the HIH Royal Commission in 2003 and by the Financial Stability Forum early this year, which involved the G20. Obviously this measure was implemented far more quickly than one would have originally planned because of the onset of the global recession. It was an early sign of the polgovernment's commitment to Australians and to the stability of their financial institutions. It is an important program because early access to payments and the security of payments is important to ensure that Australian families, if they are to be affected by the liquidation of an institution, can continue to meet their own day-today costs. This bill ensures that payments made under the scheme do not attract an inappropriate tax liability. Basically it ensures that taxation treatment of payments from APRA is equivalent to the treatment of payments made by the institution itself. The specific amendments cover capital gains tax, farm management deposits, retirement savings accounts and first home saver accounts. Due to these amendments, capital gains and losses in relation to what is created by the FCS will not have any effect, which is a common-sense proposal. We would not want to lump people with a tax liability that would not have occurred if a financial institution had not collapsed. Similarly, payments made to farm management deposits, retirement savings accounts and first home saver accounts will have to be made into an account of another type, but those transfers will be treated as a rollover and that, again, stops unnecessary or unfair tax consequences from arising. It is the only fair way to deal with situations that may come up in the future. These administrative amendments are common sense. They save families the potential of an unfair tax liability and they help to provide stability to our financial system. This bill also delivers on important commitments providing refundable tax offsets for projects under the government's National Urban Water and Desalination Plan. Obviously that is a key plank for the government's Water for the Future policy. It supports initiatives that deliver a diverse range of water sources for community and for industry, particularly focusing on the efficient use of water. I have seen first hand the result that communities can get from projects to save water. In my own electorate of Wakefield, both the Salisbury City Council and the City of Playford Council are world leaders in the reuse of stormwater. At the moment Playford council are constructing the Stebonheath Flow Control Park, which will return about 80 to 120 the megalitres into the aquifer which is later reused in parks and for industry. To give you an idea of the effect this has: recently we were at the Stebonheath Flow Control Park to raise an extra $200,000 for playground equipment-part of this government's election commitments being delivered on the ground. While we were there, the wetlands were being constructed. We had had about 10 millilitres of rain the night before and it was already beginning to be collected in that park-so much so that they were digging the overflow channel just in case they got a bit more rain. Rain, of course, has been a rare thing in Adelaide over the last four years or so. This government is committed to further projects to provide water security in Adelaide. Under amendments in this bill, eligible projects will be able to receive an assistance rate of 10 per cent of the eligible capital costs up to $100 million per project. That is a very real incentive. It is a measure of this government's commitment to ensuring the water security of places like Adelaide and across the country. This is in addition to funding of some $228 million that has been made available in the budget to build a desalinisation plant and so double capacity in Adelaide. This is very important given that Adelaide relies almost exclusively on the Murray-Darling Basin for its drinking water. In Adelaide, there is always a bit of fingerpointing at people's water use upriver, but I think that we do have to look at our own water use and make savings and provision so that we are not relying on that river system. The bill also reforms the fuel tax credit scheme. (Quorum formed) We can tell that the tactics of the opposition today are just going to be to obstruct the business of the House in order to create chaos in this great institution of democracy. I think it is quite unfair to the government and to the Australian people. Nevertheless, I will continue to remark on the bill. As I was saying, since we are attempting to cut emissions and decarbonise our economy, it made sense in the past to give an incentive for heavy fuel users to monitor and reduce their fossil fuel consumption. Under the current system, those able to claim a fuel tax credit of more than $3 million have to be members of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program. As this government has adopted a more comprehensive approach to climate change through its Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, programs like Greenhouse Challenge Plus have become unnecessary. They are slowly winding up because the CPRS will achieve the same policy outcome but far more effectively. There are many businesses in Wakefield that are aware of the amendments in schedule 7 of this bill. If they are not adopted, greenhouse challenge criteria will remain, even if the program does not. As a result, large users of the fuel tax credit scheme will lose the benefit. That would be at odds with the policy intent of the government. Obviously, we want to pass this measure. It is good that the opposition are supporting the bill, despite their antics with quorum calls and their disruption of this House. But every moment they delay these important and sensible measures potentially leaves small and medium businesses and civil contractors out of pocket. I know from my own meetings with the Civil Contractors Federation that the fuel credit system is critical to a functional and profitable civil construction industry, so I would like to see the bill passed quickly and without unnecessary delay. Finally, this bill delivers important exemptions from the tax on clean-up and restoration grants for small businesses and primary producers affected by the Victorian bushfires. The bushfires were a great national tragedy. Many Australians around the country live with the threat of bushfire. Obviously, we all want to sincerely support anybody affected by that devastating event. People came together right across my own electorate-particularly in the country areas, where they have experienced bushfire themselves-to volunteer, to raise money and to offer support, moral and financial. Obviously we have to acknowledge that compassion and support. There was a spontaneous outpouring right across the country for those affected by both the floods and bushfires in Victoria and the floods in Queensland. I made some donations to a fundraiser in my home town of Kapunda. I know the Mallala community raised $1,400, and literally thousands of people attended a fundraiser at Clare oval to raise $15,000 for that worthy cause. So many people across the country, certainly across my electorate, are putting the their hands in their pockets and their hands on their hearts to support people affected by that devastating tragedy. It is in this spirit that the bill recognises the hardship suffered by so many businesses and primary producers affected by the fire. The assistance package will assist individual businesses to recommence trading as soon as possible. That is a key part of rebuilding and getting things back to normal. These people should not have to worry about tax liabilities arising from the assistance that they have been given. So it is a really important part of the bill-again, a small administrative arrangement which has a huge effect. I commend the bill to the House.",41
28,Mr NEUMANN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009. Nothing frustrates business more than the oddities, irregularities and eccentricities of the tax system. Dealing with and being involved in business every day is a frustrating thing from time to time. Getting those letters from the tax office and thinking about inappropriate and unintended consequences to actions you undertake with respect to rolling over assets or employing new staff is extremely frustrating for business in the circumstances. We know, at this really difficult time, we have lost across the forward estimates $210 billion in tax revenue. One in every five dollars that the government gets now and is going to get into the future has been lost. We know a lot of that is caused by the global financial crisis and what we have seen. We know also that our unemployment rate is going to rise. That means that people are going to be out of work and they will not be paying tax. Businesses may fail, and the consequence of that will be a reduction not just in capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax but also in corporate tax. The consequence of that is that our revenue is going to suffer. We know at this time that our businesses are going to do it tough, and some of them already are. We see the consequences of the global recession every day in our electorates. Family, friends and constituents are losing jobs. If we can support small business, that is a wonderful thing and it is necessary for the benefit of our economy and those whom we represent here in parliament. There are about 1.9 million small businesses in this country, employing over four million people. They are the heart and soul, the tissue and the lungs, and the backbone of our economy. In small rural communities, in regional areas, in country towns in Queensland, small business is the lifeblood of employment. There are often no multinational companies but there are bakers, butchers, local real estate agents and used car dealers. There are millions of people in small business in rural and regional Queensland. In cities like Townsville and Ipswich, and Rockhampton and Mackay, small businesses flourish. It is not the headquarters of multinational corporations but small businesses that are there, present and operating each and every day, and they are going to do it tough. This legislation contains a suite of changes to assist small business. Some of them relate to charity. Some of them relate to bushfire victims in this wonderful and terrifying country-we have seen that in Queensland with floods around Ipswich, Caboolture and Brisbane itself. We have seen it in northern New South Wales. We have seen it up north, in Far North Queensland; we have seen about 62 per cent of Queensland under flood. We live in a wonderful country but Mother Nature treats us quite harshly. In one of the schedules, there are changes to assist bushfire victims in Victoria. But there are also important measures in the tax laws amendment which will mean that inappropriate tax consequences will not be thrust upon business. We have done many things to stimulate the economy and help small business. For example, one of the many things which many people in my electorate have talked about in terms of tax changes to help small business has been the 30 per cent small business tax break-now increased to 50 per cent in circumstances where small businesses acquire eligible assets costing more than $1,000 between 13 December 2008 and 31 December 2009 and they are installed, operational and ready to use by 31 December 2010. That is going to benefit many small businesses. The increase in the R&D tax credit is also going to help small business. One of the pieces of legislation we debated last night, the PAYG cash flow relief, will also help small business, with $720 million in relief poured into small businesses. That will help over a million small businesses to pay their quarterly PAYG instalments in a previous year, by adjusting the GDP adjustment factor from nine per cent to two per cent. And of course the amendments we are talking about here by way of schedule will help small businesses as well. I will go through those in detail. Schedule 1 will make a difference because we acted in an early and decisive way, in response to the challenges we faced economically, with the Financial Claims Scheme last year. Under that scheme APRA can make payments to account holders in failed institutions and to claimants unplaces. der general insurance policies which deal with failed insurance companies. That was about those in farming communities with farm management deposits, those with retirement savings accounts, those with first home saver accounts and those with a variety of other forms of accounts who would otherwise have lost out on being supported in the circumstances. It was about sustaining the economy, sustaining our constituents and sustaining the lifeblood of small and regional communities. But it is important that we do not inadvertently trigger capital gains tax consequences for those schemes. It is important that, when we do this, we ensure that, for example in relation to farm management deposits, a transfer for tax purposes is not a withdrawal. It should not trigger a tax consequence. In relation to retirement savings accounts, it should be considered a rollover and not a withdrawal in the circumstances. The same thing applies to first home saver accounts. They should not be adversely affected, because it is real people, people in our electorof ates, who are involved in these types of deposit accounts-people who have done this thinking about their security for the future, thinking about the security of their farming businesses-who would suffer as a result. The Financial Claims Scheme, as I said, was brought in in October 2008. It was brought forward to deal with the consequences of the global financial crisis. But we did not want to have it installed in such a way that it inadvertently hurt small business. So, in those circumstances, the amendments in relation to schedule 1 will make a big difference in the lives of small business in my community in Blair, where we have many small businesses, not just in Ipswich but also in those small rural communities like Kalbar, Boonah, Laidley, Gatton, Withcott and other Under schedule 2 we see some changes that increase access to small business CGT concessions for taxpayers owning a CGT asset used in a business by an affiliate or entity connected with a taxpayer and for partners owning a CGT asset used in the business. That will make a big difference in the lives of many people. The amendments here increase concessions for taxpayers owning a capital gains tax asset used in a business. That way those people, who are all involved in small business, do not have to pay increased tax in the circumstances, if they can allow their partner to make an asset for general use in the partnership to access the small business tax concession via a small business entity test. That is more appropriate and it lines up with the tax law in a more effective and efficient way. The current law means they have to claim the concession in a different manner, and that should not be the case. The third schedule in relation to this matter, I think has some significant benefits. One the things about being a lawyer is that you are always amused and bewildered by legislation that has unintended consequences. It does not matter which side of politics is in power, from time to time legislation is drafted that confuses people. It happens at a state level, a territory level and a federal level. There are some highly technical interpretations of law. You can measure the Income Tax Assessment Act by weight as opposed to any other measure. You could almost use it as a dumbbell, it is so large. It extraordinary that in this country we have ended up with an Income Tax Assessment Act that means you have to have a doctorate of tax law to be able to interpret sections of it. It is one of the most confusing parts of law, not just for lawyers but also for accountants and for small businesses. It is possible to interpret our legislation in such a way that a right or entitlement to receiving a tax offset is considered a capital gains tax asset for tax purposes. That is simply ridiculous. Tax offsets are intended to help, not hinder, small business. Tax offsets are meant to be tax benefits for eligible taxpayers. They are not meant to potentially incur tax consequences of an adverse nature to taxpayers. The amendment here provides a general exemption from capital gains tax for capital gains or capital losses arising from a right or entitlement to a tax offset deduction or similar benefit. So it has some benefit as well. Schedule 4 talks about amendments providing financial assistance. (Quorum formed) I am nearly finished. The member for Herbert could have waited a few more minutes. I know that water is an issue in dealing with climate change. It is something the coalition really do not want to deal with too often. They prefer procrastination, idleness and inactivity in dealing with issues such as the CPRS because it is all too hard. The opposition are divided between the sceptics and the moderates, those who want to take action and those who want to simply do nothing. They just do not want to hear about it. Schedule 4 of this legislation deals with the National Urban Water and Desalination Plan. It relates to offsets and it makes significant improvements. The member for Wakefield has gone through these amendments in detail, but I just comment briefly that it forms part of our policy called Water for the Future and it will support activities, proposals and initiatives which will improve investment is and increase the diversity of our water supply options-and that is important-to encourage industry and to encourage our community to save water and to use it more efficiently. In Queensland, and particularly in South East Queensland, we had dam levels below 20 per cent for a long time. Thankfully, Mother Nature has looked upon us with kindness in the last few months and our dam levels in South-East Queensland are collectively up to about 70 per cent. That has good consequences for industry, small business and farming communities. I still think it is necessary in the circumstances for us to be vigilant and to have a national plan not just for local government and urban development but also for water management and usage. The use of water has become very elastic in South-East Queensland. People are used to meeting the challenge every day of the adequate and appropriate consumption of water-of saving it, of engaging in grey water initiatives and of simply teaching their children how precious water is. So schedule 4 is a good and appropriate initiative in all the circumstances. Of course, we allow many organisations to obtain deductibility for charitable purposes and for income tax deductions. Certain gifts are given by people who are motivated by a more communitarian response-they want to help their fellow citizens, whether it is in the area of charity directed at health or the relief of poverty-and we enable a lot of organisations to offer the service of income tax deductions for gifts made to them. So getting deductible gift recipient status is very important and schedule 5 opens it up to a number of different organisations. Schedule 6 is very interesting in that it allows, for example, a more appropriate use of reporting, forms and business accounting as well as electronic interactions between business and government. Schedule 6 allows the Registrar of the Australian Business Register to act as a multi-agency registration authority. It is a very good initiative. It will enable business to operate in a more effective way. It will simplify the relationship between government and business, reducing costs, duplication and the frustration that business often finds in dealing with government. I will not go through the greenhouse challenge initiatives here. The member for Wakefield has gone through those in detail. As I have said, schedule 8 deals with tax exemptions for certain grants to businesses affected by the bushfires. It is important that we give our businesses confidence. How we deal with the taxation system, and how it affects small business, affects many millions of people in Australia. We are going through the worse global recession in 75 years. In the circumstances, it is a good thing-and the right thing-to act in a way which supports jobs and cushions the impact of the recession on our economy and on our electors. If we can change the taxation laws of this country to achieve that measure-to support jobs and small business to ensure that we as a country have a strong and prosperous future-that is the right thing to do by our country and by the individuals who are employed by small business. I commend the legislation to the House.",43
29,Mr LINDSAY,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I commend the member for Blair for his understanding of small business in Queensland and in Australia. He is dead right when he says that nothing frustrates business more than the impacts that governments sometimes have on their operations. At this time it is important that we do as much as we can to reduce those impacts. The Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009 helps in a number of instances. The CGT changes are certainly valuable. The changes to the Australian Business Register help. The amendments to the Fuel Tax Act on fuel tax credits will be useful. And, for small business involved in the clean-up and restoration in Victoria after the bushfires, the exemption from tax on those grants will certainly be well received. I am particularly supportive of the changes in relation to the urban water tax offset. Water supply is just so critically important these days. As the government tries to improve the security of water supplies to our major cities and the impact of this particular measure, the refundable tax offsets for eligible projects, in schedule 4, will in fact very much help both small and large businesses in making sure that these projects proceed as we would want to see them proceed. I have a number of young Australians who give me advice, particularly on the National Urban Water and Desalination Plan and the refundable tax offsets. I am indebted to Nicholas Stanton, who has given me engineering and business advice on that particular matter. I also thank Keegan Sard on ETS and environment, Ella Bauman on higher education and Murray Bruce, particularly, on international relations. The opposition will certainly be supporting this bill and I thank the House for its attention.",47
30,Mr CHEESEMAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"The Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009 is a multifaceted bill covering a wide range of tax related amendments. It looks at the tax amendments to the Financial Claims Scheme, it covers capital gains matters, it covers tax offsets for water desalination projects and it covers issues in relation to the Fuel Tax Act. It also contains assistance measures for small businesses and primary producers affected by the Victorian bushfires, amongst other maters. Many of these amendments go hand in hand with the measures we have taken to address the global financial crisis. These are measures that essentially give effect to the government's decisive action in relation to the global financial crisis. Before I go to some of the detail of these matters, I want to say a couple of things more broadly about the government's response to the global financial crisis, as it has now been called. It is useful to think about some of the alternative scenarios faced by this nation. Can you imagine what Australia would be like today if we had not taken the decisive response to the global financial crisis we did take? Where would we be? We would be much more like America today, I suspect, if we had not taken such decisive action. America had a weak President, a very much diminished President, when the global financial crisis kicked in. I believe there was some of the lowest polling ever in America's history as a consequence of that. America's initial response to the global financial crisis was denial, and then inaction. We can contrast this with Australia's strong and decisive action under the Rudd government, which this bill in detail reflects. If we had not the sort of response that we did under the Rudd government our cities and towns would be much more like many of America's cities today, where hundreds of thousands of people are losing their jobs and their homes. Under this government's response, which the detail of this bill backs up, we are creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Our response has been strong and immediate. I would like to go through some of the detail and aspects of this bill because they are very important to this nation. First, in relation to the capital gains tax amendment components, under the APRA scheme capital gains and losses arising from rights under the scheme are disregarded, ensuring that the scheme does not trigger capital gains tax consequences that would not have arisen if the scheme had not been applied. In relation to the Farm Management Deposits Scheme, an amount paid under the scheme in relation to the farm management deposits, the FMD, will be treated as a transfer of the FMD for tax purposes and not as a withdrawal of the FMD and the making of a new FMD. This ensures that the scheme will not trigger any tax consequences that would not have arisen if the scheme had not applied. In relation to the retirement savings accounts, an amount paid under this scheme in relation to a retirement savings account with a failed financial institution into a new retirement savings account with another institution is treated as a rollover superannuation benefit, and I think that is very appropriate. This ensures that the payment is treated the same for tax purposes as if it had been made by the failed institution. In relation to the first home savers account, an amount paid under the scheme in relation to a first home saver account with a failed financial institution into a new first home saver account with another institution is treated as a transfer between accounts. taken This ensures that the payment into the new account does not become ineligible for government co-contribution. An account holder's ineligibility to have a first home saver account is rolled over into the new account and the time to notify a provider or the ATO of the ineligibility is extended so that he or she is neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by any changes in eligibility that occur whilst the existing account with the failed institution cannot be assessed. There is more detail in relation to this schedule; however, the intent here is to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by the quirks of the taxation system and so ensure that these initiatives are implemented in a fair and equitable way. The Financial Claims Scheme was enacted in October 2008. The introduction of the legislation for the scheme was brought forward because of the global financial crisis and so was not able to exclude any consequential amendments. In broad terms, it aims to provide the same taxation treatment that APRA makes under the Financial Claims Scheme as would have applied to the payments if they had been made by the failed financial institution or insurance company. Capital gains and losses in relation to rights created by the Financial Claims Scheme are not ignored. Payments in relation to a farm management deposit-(Quorum formed) Clearly, there has been a change of thinking in the tactics committee of the Liberal Party, or at least perhaps a rather spoilt brat running the show.",47
31,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,The member will withdraw that comment.,49
32,Mr CHEESEMAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I withdraw. Payments in relation to a farm management deposit, a retirement savings account or a first home saver account will generally have to be made into another account of the same type. This ensures that the normal restrictions on withdrawing amounts from those accounts are maintained. Those payments will generally be treated as a rollover from one account to another to avoid the consequences of them being treated as the opening of a new account. APRA will be subject to the same obligations to withhold amounts from payments, and to the same reporting obligations in relation to the amounts withheld or rolled over, that the failed institution would have been. Another matter tackled by these amendments is the matter of small business capital gains-of course, very important to my constituency within Corangamite. These amendments to the small business capital gains tax concessions increase access to the concessions for taxpayers owning a capital gains tax asset used in a business by an affiliate or entity connected with the taxpayer and for partners owning a capital gains tax asset used in a partnership business. The main changes were announced in the 200809 budget. These amendments had been actively sought by industry, and will be a real help to many small businesses in my own electorate. Corangamite, my own electorate, is based around small business, and I have done a lot of work with small business to find out what their needs are in difficult circumstances. I am pleased to see them get assistance, particularly when we are in such difficult times as we are now. These amendments will also make a number of additional changes to refine and clarify elements of the existing small business capital gains tax concessions so that they operate flexibly, as of course the government intended. Industry stakeholders expressed support for these measures during consultation processes. A number of stakeholders suggested additional changes to the scope and application for small business capital gains tax concessions. The additional changes were not adopted, as they were beyond the scope of the current amendments and would also lead to more complex provisions or greater compliance costs for taxpayers. I would also like to say a couple of things about the tax offset component in this bill in relation to urban water and desalination projects. I think it is a very important measure. It will help important water desalination projects get off the ground. The government is providing financial assistance under the National Urban Water and Desalination Plan to improve the security of water supplies to all of Australia's major cities. This will be achieved by supporting major desalination, water recycling and stormwater harvest projects that will contribute significantly to end. This measure implements the tax offset component within this plan. Assistance is capped at 10 per cent of eligible capital costs up to a maximum of $100 million per project. Successful applicants which are outside the tax system will receive cash grants instead of tax offsets. The Minister for Climate Change and Water is responsible for approving this assistance, and the plan is administered by the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Part of the National Urban Water and Desalination Plan involves funding for stormwater harvesting projects. Additional funding for these projects, as well as relaxed eligibility criteria, were negotiated with Senator Xenophon as part of the passage of the $42 billion stimulus package through the Senate. This forms part of the government's Water for the Future strategy and will support initiatives that drive investment in diverse water supply options and encourage industry and the community to save and use water more efficiently. This measure implements the government's election commitment. Within my own seat, and in the city that I represent, there are two major projects in relation to water recycling. There is the $20 million commitment to Shell, which is a part of federal Labor's commitment in the federal seat of Corio, and there is a $10 million commitment to the Black Rock recycling plant, which, of course, is very pleasing to my electorate. Most of the other elements which I have not touched on today have been canvassed by numerous speakers, so I will leave it at that. I commend this bill to the House.",49
33,Mr BOWEN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (11.23 am)-in reply-I thank all honourable members who have participated in this debate. The members for Blair, Wakefield, Oxley and Coranthis gamite gave very worthwhile contributions, as did, I must say, the members for Herbert and Casey. The member for Casey, the shadow minister, gave a well-considered and thoughtful presentation, as is usually the case. Unfortunately, we cannot say the same for the member for Moncrieff, the shadow minister for small business, who engaged in his normal bluff, bluster, sophistry and factual inaccuracies. (Quorum formed) I will just take a few moments of the House's time to run through the member for Moncrieff's argument. Firstly, he said that the government's changes to the PAYG repayment regime were his idea. He said, ‘They are just copying our policies.' That is an interesting contribution from the member for Moncrieff, because I looked back at all his press statements and at all his speechesI even consulted with my honourable friend the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy-and I found that he had never called for change to the PAYG regime. Never did he call for the inflator to be reduced. He did have a policy of changing the variation allowed, from 15 per cent to 30 per cent, but that is very different to our policythat is on application and would still leave small business potentially open to a very large tax bill at the end of the year. As the minister for small business points out, it has not made their six-point plan on small business. So the member claims credit for the government's initiatives but the policy he refers to is not even in the opposition's sixpoint plan for small business. He acknowledged that the government's small business and general business tax breaks for investments might help a small number of small businesses-he says that it may have a small impact on the margin. In the last week, along with other economic ministers, I have been out in the electorates and in the regions of various parts of Australia talking to small business. Every single small business group that I spoke to congratulated and thanked the government for the small business and general tax break. We saw the thumbs up from the small business groups across the country. I am sure the minister for small business would agree that, in his activities over the last week, he had the same feedback. Unfortunately, the shadow minister for small business appears to be a little out of touch on that one. We find the shadow minister for small business covering the lack of opposition policies by always making the same speech. He could send in a cardboard cut-out and press play on the DVD player, because we always get the same speech about small business issues. But he never points out that their other policy, part of their six-point on loss carry-backs would increase the budget deficit by $1 billion. This is the opposition that is concerned about the budget deficit and argues so forcefully that we must have a lower deficit and a lower debt, and yet this policy of theirs would increase the budget deficit by $1 billion. And it would not provide any cash flow relief to small business until 1 July 2010, not 1 July 2009. We could live with 1 July 2009; that would be good; that would be fine. But as for 1 July 2010, I do not think that small business, which finds itself in cash flow difficulty, would appreciate a policy which provides relief from 1 July 2010. That is a long time to wait for cash flow relief. The contributions from all the other honourable members-the members for Casey, Herbert, Blair, Wakefield, Oxley and Corangamite-were very worthwhile contributions. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for my honourable friend the member for Moncrieff. Schedule 1 makes amendments to ensure that there are no inappropriate tax consequences arising from payments made under the Financial Claims Scheme which this parliament enacted in October last year. Under that scheme, APRA can make payments to account holders in failed financial institutions and to claimants under general insurance policies with failed insurance companies. This is a very important measure for that reason. Schedule 2 increases access to the small business CGT concessions for taxpayers owning passively held CGT assets. These amendments will extend access to the small business CGT concessions to circumstances that do not currently meet eligibility requirements. Taxpayers who own a CGT asset used in a business by an affiliate or entity plan, connected with the taxpayer and partners owning certain CGT assets used in a partnership business will have access to the small business CGT concessions via the small business entity test from the 2007-08 income year. This schedule also makes a number of minor amendments to clarify aspects of the existing small business CGT concession provisions so that they operate flexibly and as intended. Schedule 3 amends the law to provide a general exemption from CGT for capital gains or capital losses arising from a right or entitlement to a tax offset deduction or similar benefit. This amendment will ensure that a capital gain or loss would not arise for taxpayers in such circumstances or in other circumstances where taxpayers have a right or entitlement to a tax offset deduction or other taxation benefit. Schedule 4 provides refundable tax offsets for eligible projects under the government's $1 billion National Urban Water and Desalination Plan. Under the plan, eligible projects may receive a rebate of 10 per cent of the eligible capital costs up to a maximum of $100 million per project. This schedule implements the refundable tax offset component of the plan and delivers on the government's election commitment. Schedule 5 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to specifically list four new organisations as DGRs and to extend the time period of three existing listings. Organisations with DGR status can collect tax deductible gifts. This schedule specifically lists or extends the listing of the Australasian lege for Emergency Medicine, the Grattan Institute, the ACT Region Crime Stoppers Ltd, the Parliament of World Religions of Melbourne 2009, Yachad Accelerated Learning Project Ltd, St George's Cathedral Restoration Fund and the Bunbury Diocese Cathedral Rebuilding Fund. Part 1 of schedule 6 improves the integrity and efficiency of the Australian Business Register, or ABR, and helps position the registrar of the ABR to take on the role of a multi-agency registration authority. Part 2 of schedule 6 enables representatives of businesses to be identified by the registrar of the ABR for the purpose of communicating electronically with multiple government agencies on behalf of their respective businesses. These amendments facilitate the standard business reporting program, which aims to reduce reporting burdens for business by eliminating unnecessary or duplicated reporting and to improve the interface between businesses and government agencies. Schedule 7 amends the Fuel Tax Act 2006 and related provisions elsewhere in the tax law to remove provisions that businesses must be a member of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program to claim more than $3 million of fuel tax credits in a financial year. Without this amendment to the Fuel Tax Act, businesses would be able to claim fuel tax credits in excess of $3 million in a financial year after 30 June 2009. This would be inconsistent with the policy intent of the fuel tax credit system. The Greenhouse Challenge Plus program will cease after 30 June 2009. This outcome will be able to be achieved through the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Schedule 8 provides an exemption from tax for the clean-up and restoration grants paid to small businesses and primary producers affected by the Victorian bushfires. Col- This measure recognises the extraordinary hardship suffered by small businesses and primary producers in affected areas. The bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, which reported on 7 May 2009 recommending that the bill be passed. I thank the opposition for their support, despite the comments of the member for Moncrieff, and I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA AMENDMENT (ENHANCING SUPERVISION AND ENFORCEMENT) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 March, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time.  in the House today to offer some remarks in relation to the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2009. This bill has two purposes-firstly, to make APRA responsible for the supervision of what are called nonoperating holding companies, otherwise known as NOHCs, of life insurers and, secondly, to harmonise and strengthen APRA's powers to seek court injunctions under a range of acts, including the Banking Act 1959, the Insurance Act 1973, the Life Insurance Act 1995 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. Prudential regulation of non-operating holding companies and related corporate groups was a recommendation that emerged from the HIH Royal Commission. It was also identified in the Wallis report that the former coalition government commissioned in 1997. APRA currently regulates the non-operating holding companies of general insurers and authorised deposit-taking institutions, otherwise known as ADIs. These powers are granted, respectively, under the Insurance Act 1973-at least, that has been the case since 2002-and under the Banking Act of 1959 since 1998. Under this bill, APRA will have the power to register and supervise the non-operating holding companies of life insurance companies and enforce their compliance with prudential requirements. With the passage of the bill, APRA will be able to seek a consistent and comprehensive range of injunctions from the Federal Court of Australia on prudential matters, and this power will apply to ADIs and to general insurance, life insurance and superannuation. The bill is aimed at ensuring that, where life insurance companies are part of large corporate groups, they are not exposed to risks that stem from other companies within the group. As these risks may affect policyholders, the parent of the non-operating holding company will become subject to APRA's prudential supervision. The objectives of the bill are consistent with international agreements on prudential supervision of systematically important financial institutions. Following the Wallis inquiry and the HIH Royal Commission, the coalition granted APRA regulatory oversight of ADIs and of general insurers, and this bill continues the former government's work by bringing the nonoperating holding companies of life insurers within APRA's bailiwick. I want to turn to a very important matter that was raised during the consultation phase of the Senate economics committee's inquiry into this bill. It centres on the decisions that APRA makes. Many APRA directions are not subject to a merits review process. In fact, six out of the 10 directions issued by APRA are not. These powers are granted in the Life Insurance Act 1995, and similar powers exist in the banking and general insurance acts. APRA's power to issue directions without merits reviews is used to prevent borrowings, prevent the payment of dividends and remove directors and senior managers. All of these are very significant measures, of course, for listed companiesareas in and around borrowings, the payment of dividends and, obviously, the removal of senior people within these organisations. It seems to me-and, as I said, this is something that came to light during the Senate committee inquiry into this bill-that there really is a call for us to consider having a universal merits review process for all of APRA's directions, not just for four out of 10 but indeed for all 10 of the directions that APRA has the capacity to make. I think that if there were processes for merits review available on all of the directions it would enhance natural justice, improve prudential regulation in our country and instil greater confidence in stakeholders across industries in our country and indeed across the world that Australia has a stronger and more robust prudential regulatory framework than any other country in the world. I think that all of APRA's decisions and directions ought to at least be open to a merits review process so that all players can have that level of confidence that the decisions that APRA takes are fair, are just and are right. I understand that this procedure-that is, making all of APRA's decisions subject to a merits review-could be achieved quite easily. It could be done through a very quick legislative amendment process. I also understand that it would in no way lessen APRA's ability to act swiftly, which we all support, course: the ability of our regulators to be able to act swiftly and protect Australians from all walks of life. I think that a universal merits review process should apply to the whole of the general insurance sector, to the life insurance sector and indeed across the whole banking sector as well. So the coalition support this bill, but we call on the government to work with us and to work with industry stakeholders across the whole of the Australian financial services landscape to enhance transparency and create an even stronger and more robust prudential regulatory framework by considering making all of APRA's decisions merits-reviewable, which I think can only enhance our standing as a global financial services hub. But, as I said, the coalition support this bill.",52
35,Mr CHAMPION,FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION,"It is my great pleasure to support the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2009. Obviously the global economic downturn and financial crisis has woken us up from a 20-year love affair with laissezfaire approaches to regulation. We now know that gaps or holes in the regulation of financial markets and financial entities are really time bombs for the future. The good thing about this bill is that it ensures there is appropriate regulation of financial entities. Chifley once said: Private banking systems make the community the victim of every wave of optimism or pessimism that surges through the minds of financial speculators. Obviously this government has one key aim-to ensure that the emotions of Wall Street or the financial markets do not hurt people living in main street in places like Craigmore, Gawler or the Clare Valley in my electorate. To help all Australians through the effects of the global financial crisis we of have introduced the Nation Building and Jobs Plan to provide immediate stimulus and to ensure the long-term productive capacity of our economy, with 70 per cent of the stimulus invested in infrastructure throughout the electorate and $291 million for rail on the Gawler to Adelaide line, creating 200 jobs in Victoria making concrete sleepers. We are aware that the infrastructure spend in one part of the country helps people in other parts of the country-a concrete sleeper factory in this case. The Treasurer has been working tirelessly to deliver a budget that makes the tough choices to stimulate the economy and put us on the road to recovery. The Assistant Treasurer has worked diligently to propose the bill before the House today and he should be commended for it. The bill introduces measures to regulate the non-operating holding companies, NOHCs, of companies that sell life insurance. The bill also harmonises the injunctions that may be ordered as enforcement measures in respect of those entities. The aim of these amendments is to ensure that corporations that sell life insurance and are part of a corporate group affected by the financial crisis remain solvent for their Australian customers. For Australians who have life insurance, particularly the many people in Wakefield, when they purchase their life insurance and make sacrifices to pay the ongoing fees, it is important that they do not inadvertently enter corporate structures that are vulnerable to collapse. You cannot expect ordinary people to look into corporate structures that remain elusive to many learned peoplepoliticians, journalists, lawyers and other experts. We cannot expect the man or woman in the street to know exactly what is going on behind the corporate veil; we cannot expect them to know the accounting or risk management policies- (Quorum formed.) Yesterday, we saw the member for Paterson kicked out of this House for bad behaviour and today he is on a deliberate campaign to disrupt the people's business. What a disgrace he is to his electorate and to his shadow portfolio. Mr Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, the honourable member is reflecting on the chair. I was just bringing to your attention the standing orders of the House in relation to a quorum. He has reflected on that as a disgraceful event.",54

40,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION,"I draw to the attention of the member for Wakefield the standing orders and that he is debating the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2009, and I would ask him to return to the provisions of the bill.",55
41,Mr CHAMPION,FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION,"I would be happy to discuss the provisions of the bill, if only I were not interrupted all the time by constant quorum calls. Mr Deputy Speaker, as I was saying, the hard-earned life insurance policies of Australian workers should not be put at risk by the cavalier accounting of unregulated corporate managers. They should be protected by government regulations. This bill performs two important functions, and I would like to address each in turn. Firstly, the bill provides for a more effective compliance regime and gives APRA a broader spectrum of injunction powers to enforce financial entities' compliance with the prudential regulation requirements. Schedule 2 of the bill harmonises court injunction powers across prudential legislation, including the Banking Act 1959, the Insurance Act 1973, the Life Insurance Act 1995 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. In doing so, APRA will now be able to seek more reliable injunctions that are tuned more accurately to the circumstances. This ensures that APRA has the flexibility to respond promptly and directly to any risk to the financial health of an entity that provides life insurance to Australians. Changes to the court injunction powers are in the interests of ordinary Australians, ensuring that in the case of any risk of contagion within a corporate group their hard-earned life insurance savings can be protected. If a person or company fails to comply with the requirements of the prudential legislation then the Federal Court may issue a restraining interim injunction. Under these provisions APRA will also be able to seek an interim injunction to protect depositors, policyholders or superannuation beneficiaries' interests while the court considers whether to grant a final injunction or enforce another prudential rule. These new interim injunctions refocus APRA's powers to not only respond to financial mismanagement or contagion but also address the effects of this mismanagement. Under these new provisions, if a company is investigated by APRA, working Australians will not be left in the lurch during that process. Their deposits, their policies and their superannuation entitlements will be secured by court order. The bill also removes a gap in Australia's prudential regulation framework. Currently APRA does not supervise life insurance nonoperating holding companies. As these companies can have a significant effect on the conduct and financial health of life insurance companies, it is an imperative in the current economic climate that they are regulated. In the current climate so many Australians are finding it hard. They are experiencing some difficulties in the employment market. They are worrying about how much certainty they have over their financial arrangements. The collapse of economic institutions in the United States and Europe-30 banks either bailed out, failed or nationalised-has made the case for effective and strict regulation of financial institutions absolutely clear to ryone. Two years ago we could not have imagined a line-up of deposit holders in front of Northern Rock Bank, something that we had not seen since the 1930s runs on banks. So it is pretty clear to everybody that financial institutions of all types need to be propbrought erly regulated. This is not policy on the run. It is basically a measure entirely consistent with the regulators and entirely consistent with where we find ourselves with the core principles of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. It is also consistent with the current reguthe lation and supervision of general insurers and authorised deposit-taking institutions. In fact, the scope of the prudential regulation regime introduced by the first schedule of this bill is closely modelled to match isting regulation of general insurers and authorised deposit-holding institutions. There is an added benefit in introducing legislation in this way. It closes a loophole, but it makes sure that the frameworks are similar so as to minimise compliance costs for industry, ensuring a smooth transition to the new regulatory regime. Obviously this regime is needed. It is not a minor issue; it is a real one. International experience has demonstrated the interconnections between companies within corporate groups, including between prudentially regulated entities and unregulated entities, and we have seen the often catastrophic results that can occur when unregulated entities enter into arrangements which affect the regulated entity. So these measures strengthen prudential regulation of life insurance conglomerates in line with the regulation of other companies. One need only look at the collapse of the American company AIG and its subsequent bailout by the American government. AIG as a company had written as many as 81 million life insurance policies. But the actions of just eveone of its subsidiaries, AIG Financial Products, which acted like a hedge fund and which was unregulated and which wrote derivative contracts up to a value of $2.7 trillion-it seems like an extraordinary figure, but that was the extent of the contractsit to a crisis point. When the financial collapse came they had a house of cards arrangement. Many of those derivatives were collateralised debt obligations, and just this one division turned in a $40.4 billion loss as a result of the GFC. That in turn undermined the rest of the company. So you can see that actions of one unregulated entity can undermine the life insurance business which had been making a profit at the time. It still makes a profit, but it was the actions of a cowboy outfit in this particular firm that unthe ex- dermined the rest of the business. I think Australians will be relieved to see the government introducing these amendments, enhancing the powers of APRA, giving consumers greater confidence that the financial standards of APRA related entities will be extended to life insurance companies. I have to congratulate the Assistant Treasurer on this development. I think it is prudent and sensible legislation. As I said before, the global economic recession, the financial crisis, has really woken us up to the risks of poorly regulated financial institutions. It has woken us up to the fact that so much of modern financial architecture is unregulated. That lack of regulation, that lack of oversight, could have potentially catastrophic effects on our financial system. The bill before the House today removes some of those risks. It removes some of the regulatory gaps. It makes sure that the prudential regulation framework for the life insurance industry is appropriate and guards the interests of policyholders and the financial interests all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.",55
42,Mr RIPOLL,FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION,"I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2009. Given the experiences of today, I am assuming that at some point during my short contribution I will be subjected to a quorum call. Mr Abbott-For you, no.",57
43,Mr RIPOLL,FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION,"I thank the member for Warringah, who says that for me he will dispense with that. It has certainly been the practice for the rest of the morning. This is a good opportunity to speak about some of the very important and key issues in our financial services sector and some of the changes that need to be made to enhance supervision and enforcement. As we just heard from the member for Wakefield, given the global financial crisis and a range of failures that we have seen in our system, not just here in Australia but across the globe, it is important that we not only acknowledge where some of those failures took place but make real changes in our regulatory regime to minimise them in the future and improve the system that we have before us. It is sometimes the case that where there are structural flaws or failures in a system you do not see that the system might break until that actually takes place. But that is not always right. There are circumstances where you can foresee structural problems and flaws. In the case before us, I think it is a combination of both. We need an enhanced regulatory regime with supervision and enforcement so that it is continually maintained and scrutinised. Measures need to be taken by government to ensure that our financial system operates efficiently and protects consumers. In the end, what we are referring to of is the protection of consumers in a sector in which, for many, involvement is compulsory through the superannuation guarantee or through parts of the financial services sector, including life insurance. The bill before us will do two things. Firstly, it will remove a gap that exists in the prudential regulation regime by regulating non-operating holding companies of life insurance companies. There currently exists a discrepancy in that those non-operating holding companies are not under the supervision of APRA and they ought to be. APRA currently regulates the non-operating holding companies of general insurers and authorised deposit-taking institutions, but it does not have authority over the non-operating holding companies of life insurers. The scope of the regulatory framework for the nonoperating holding companies of life insurance companies is closely modelled on the existing regulation of the non-operating holding companies of general insurance companies and authorised deposit-taking institutions. There were a couple of organisaplace tions in the sector-not many-who felt either that this was unnecessary or that the burden of regulation on them was already high enough. They argued the point in a recent Senate inquiry which I will refer to in moment. I believe that the non-operating holding companies of life insurers should be brought into line. They should be scrutinised by APRA. The prudential requirements that will apply to non-operating holding companies of life insurers are consistent with the prudential requirements that apply to general insurover ers. These include governance arrangements, the types of breaches that must be reported APRA and the types of directions that may be issued. This approach will minimise compliance costs for industry and ensure a smooth transition. Not only that but for the companies involved and for those who use these vehicles the costs will be very, very small indeed. This is an important change because the prudential regulator operates currently under four different acts, including the Life Insurance Act and the Banking Act. Those acts need to work in symphony to provide the best possible mechanisms and tools for APRA to carry out its authority. Removing this gap and regulating the nonoperating holding companies of life insurers provides a more efficient mechanism to deal with those issues. Schedule 2 looks at injunctions. Under this schedule, the bill will strengthen powers to enforce the prudential laws through a comprehensive and consistent set of injunctions. This is a very important change. Not only does the bill bring the operating holding companies of life insurers under the supervision of APRA but it also gives APRA the power to put in place injunctions in an efficient and timely manner. It very important for people who may be in breach of regulations that these things take in a timely manner. The power will apply in relation to authorised deposit-taking institutions, to general insurance, to life insurance and to superannuation. For any person who breaches or proposes a to breach the prudential acts, a condition of authorisation or a direction issued by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority may be subject to an injunction. I know that members of parliament would have examples in their electorates where action needs to be taken quickly in relation either to an individual or to a scheme. With what we have seen the past 18 months, you can see the importance of realigning those acts and of makto ing sure that APRA's powers are the most efficient possible. Certainly, giving APRA a comprehensive and consistent set of powers through injunctions is part of that. This is something which I fully support. I think it is a very appropriate manner in which to deal with these matters. As an example, APRA can seek an interim injunction to protect the interests of depositors, policyholders or superannuation beneficiaries while the court considers whether to grant a final injunction or to enforce another prudential rule. Again, I think that members of parliament would have examples in their electorates where specific action needed to be taken and where there was a critical period during which an injunction needed to be put in place very quickly, whether temporary or otherwise, in order to stop some form of APRA's action taking place. While it is a fairly straightforward change, it again highlights to the parliament, the community and the financial services sector non- Labor's commitment to ensuring an appropriate and efficient set of regulations through APRA, through ASIC and through other bodies. This takes another step in that direction. is It ensures that we are taking up our responsibilities. Not only do I commend the bill to the House but also I commend the Assistant Treasurer for the work that he has done in this area.",57
44,Mr BOWEN,FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (12.09 pm)-in reply-At the outset, could I thank honourable members who have contributed to this debate on the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2009. The members for Aston, Blair, Wakefield and Oxley all made wellthought-out contributions. I did not get to hear the entire contribution of the member for Aston, but I did get to hear some of it and have had the rest of it relayed to me. I recognise the opposition's support for this bill and I thank them for it. The member for Aston, if I understand correctly, made the suggestion that more of APRA's decisions should be reviewable and appealable. I recognise that that is a sincere suggestion on his behalf, but it is not one I would be supportive of. My view has long been that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority is one of the most respected and most efficient regulators of financial prudential requirements in the world, and I would not be supportive of another layer over and above the majority of APRA's decisions. I think we need to recognise that APRA has a very significant skills base and that it is the body charged with ensuring the ongoing prudential soundness of Australia's financial institutions. We also need to recognise that, having charged it with that responsibility, we cannot in a broad sense put another hand over its shoulder. We need to rely on it to do the job. I do recognise that the member for Aston's suggestion is a serious and sincere one but, on the face of it, it one to which I would lend my support. This bill has not been universally welcomed. I know that ING and AXA made submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, which considered this matter, and the Chief Executive of AXA has taken the opportunity to discuss their concerns with me personally. No modern government should embark lightly on further regulation. The compliance costs of further regulation must always be very carefully considered. I have tested and raised with the Chair of APRA, with the other members of the APRA governing body, Mr Trowbridge and Mr Jones, the compliance burden in this bill and of how necessary it is that they be able to do their job. I am satisfied with APRA's responses. They have assured me that they will of course be very cognisant of the compliance impacts of any action that they may take under this bill and that they do not intend to create a whole new compliance infrastructure around it. Having said that, they are also very strongly of the view that this bill is extremely important for their ability to do their job. They would characterise the lack of regulation that this bill fixes as a yawning gap in their capacity to do their work, to ensure that a problem in an entity will not spread to other entities in the entire group and to be satisfied that people in the economy are not being adversely exposed to risk. This bill will enhance Australia's effective and robust prudential regulation framework in the current climate and ensure that the regulatory framework applying to financial entities remains flexible and responsive going forward. This bill removes the gap in Australia's prudential regulation framework by ensuring that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority supervises life insuris not ance non-operating holding companiesknown as NOHCs-which can have a significant impact on the conduct and financial health of insurance companies, and of life insurance companies in particular. This measure is consistent with Insurance Core Principle ICP 17 of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors on group-wide supervision, which is that the supervisory authority supervise its insurers on a solo and group-wide basis. This was an important point in convincing me and the government of the appropriateness of this amendment. These measures bring the prudential supervision of such companies into line with the prudential supervision of NOHCs, general insurance and authorised deposit-taking institutions. The prudential requirements that will apply to life insurance NOHCs are consistent with those that apply to life insurers. The scope of the prudential regulation regime introduced by the schedule is closely modelled on existing regulation of NOHCs, general insurers and authorised deposit-taking institutions. APRA is undertaking industry consultation on consequential changes to prudential standards should the bill be passed by the parliament. This approach will minimise compliance costs for industry and ensure a smooth transition. This was recognised by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics report on this bill, which notes that: …the overriding policy of the bill is to line regulation of life insurers with the regulation of general insurers and ADIs. This bill ensures that the injunctions that may be issued under the prudential legislation are effective tools to enforce financial entities compliance with prudential requirements. The bill also introduces measures to harmonise court injunction powers across prudential legislation-namely, the Banking Act 1959, the Insurance Act 1973, the Life Insurance Act 1995 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The amendments will give APRA flexibility to respond to a range of circumstances relating to the health of an entity in a timely and appropriate way. International experience has demonstrated the importance of understanding the interconnection between companies and a corporate group, including between prudentially regulated entities and unregulated entities. International experience has also demonstrated the need for regulators to have the ability to take appropriate and timely action. The Senate Standing Committee on Economics has recognised that in the current environment the government may want to act promptly to fill gaps in the prudential architecture. The government is bringing these measures forward to remove a gap in the prudential regulation framework for the life insurance industry and enhance APRA's ability to use injunctions to respond to the emerging prudential concerns in a timely and appropriate way. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",59

NA AMENDMENT (VET FEE-HELP AND PROVIDERS) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 March, on motion by Ms Kate Ellis: That this bill be now read a second time.",60
46,Dr SOUTHCOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"The first thing in speaking to the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP and Providers) Bill 2009 is to reflect that the VET sector is quite different from the higher education sector. The VET sector is made up of a national network of 4,000 public and private providers. There are 1.67 million students in 2008-09 financial year studying in the VET sector. These include, for example, 429,000 Australian apprentices in training-apprentice hairdressers, mechanics, plumbers, chefs and electricians and trainees in building and horticulture. In the 2007 budget the former Howard government announced that it would extend FEE-HELP to the VET sector. Recognising how different this sector is from higher education, where we have a limited number of universities, it was constrained to a special category of providers. Until the introduction of the 2007 legislation, the VET sector was the only sector offering post-secondary qualifications without an income-contingent loans scheme. The previous government recognised that students seeking an education in the VET sector did not receive the same level of financial support as those seeking an education at university. We believe that students wishing to undertake a VET course should not be deterred from doing so because of the financial pressures associated with upfront fees. Our view was that pursuing a VET qualification was just as important as pursuing a university qualification. Under the bill we introduced, FEE-HELP was available to those undertaking a TAFE diploma, associate diploma, graduate certificate and graduate diploma where full fees were charged, where arrangements were made for credit transfer to a higher education award and to VET providers that were corporate bodies only. As I said, this was the introduction of a student loan scheme in the VET sector at the national level. The former minister for vocational education, the member for Goldstein, said when he introduced that bill that the operation of the scheme would be monitored carefully and that he was of the general view that if this introduction were successful VET FEEHELP could be extended further in the future. We would like to see VET FEE-HELP more widely available in the future. For that reason we supported the federal government's decision last year to extend incomecontingent loans specifically in the context of the Victorian state government's reforms of vocational education and training. In August 2008, as part of the Victorian state government's move to a demand-driven system, the federal government announced the extension of income-contingent loans to the Victorian VET sector. The opposition at that time indicated our support for that extension. Unfortunately, that legislation to extend income-contingent loans to Victoria was linked with the bill which allows universities to levy all university students with a $250 fee, which the opposition cannot support. That second piece of legislation, by way of guidelines, eases the conditions for providers to be eligible for VET FEE-HELP. As of 20 March 2009 there were 12 approved VET providers and 15 others awaiting the parliamentary disallowance period. The bill we are considering today is really consequential from those two earlier ones: the original extension of FEE-HELP to the VET sector and then the subsequent legislation which is still being considered in the other place, which did allow the extension of income-contingent loans and did it by way of guidelines which will ease the conditions on providers. It has been explained that this will be done to support the Victorian state govfirst ernment's move to a demand-driven system and would be available for any other state or territory government that chose to move in that direction. This legislation is a consequence of the easing in an early bill and it provides discretion to the minister to revoke the approval of a provider and allows the registration of a provider to be rescinded if they no longer operate in Australia. As a consequence, this is a simple machinery bill, a result of some earlier pieces of legislation. will help ensure additional regulation of providers, who will have access to VET FEEHELP. The opposition will be supporting the bill.",60
47,Mr SYMON,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I rise to speak in support of the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP and Providers) Bill 2009. This bill makes some minor changes to the operation of the FEEHELP and VET FEE-HELP schemes. The changes are a continuation of the government's refining of these schemes and will ensure that government assistance to students is better targeted by ensuring that assistance under VET FEE-HELP is limited to units which are essential to a student's course of study. Under current arrangements, it is possible that a student may receive VET FEEHELP assistance for a unit of study even where that unit of study was additional to and not directly required for the completion of that course. The amendments in this bill ensure that assistance under the scheme is available only for VET units of study which are essential for the student to receive their diploma, advanced diploma, graduate certificate or graduate diploma. Due to skills reform being undertaken in Victoria, a greater number of VET providers will soon be offering access to VET FEEHELP assistance to their students. It is therefore important that such assistance is targeted so that it can reach those who need it the most. This is a common-sense amendment to the Higher Education Support Act 2003 that does not stop students from accessing assistance or increase their contributions to their education. It simply ensures that VET FEEHELP does what it was designed to do, which is to provide loans to students to help pay for all or part of their tuition fees.",62
48,The VET,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"FEE HELP scheme was introduced by the Howard government in 2007; however, the original legislation had a numIt ber of shortcomings that have since had to be corrected by the Rudd Labor government. Without these changes, the scheme could potentially have gone far beyond what it was originally designed to do. Those opposite do like to parade around claiming that they are always required to fix up mistakes that they inherit in government. It is a story we hear time after time from them but which is always shown to be not so. But, whilst we are on the subject of education and skills, we should examine the record of the previous government in this area. Even a cursory glance will show the mess that was left behind by the last two ministers for education in the Howard government: both the member for Curtin, who is now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the member for Bradfield, who of course went on to become a short-lived opposition leader. Under the direction of these two former ministers, the previous government allowed Australia's skill base to run down and, when introducing the VET FEE-HELP scheme, as I have said, lazy drafting on their behalf has since required a number of amendments to fix their mistakes. By contrast, the Rudd Labor government has since introduced trade training centres to develop vital skills and talents, strengthened the role of the industry skills councils and established the statutory body Skills Australia to provide advice to the government in this important area. We are committed to improving Australia's skill levels, and an increase in the number of completions at diploma and advanced diploma levels is a key part of this commitment. The Council of Australian Governments has committed to doubling the number of such completions by 2020. The student services bill that was introduced into the House earlier this year included amendments to allow for future expansion of the VET FEE-HELP scheme. That bill also corrected another significant wrong of the Howard government, a legacy of the member for Bradfield-that is, the stripping of a funding stream worth around $170 million from Australia's universities, under the guise of offering students greater choice. But I dwell on that a little bit too long, suppose. The bill before the House also improves the protections that are in place for students and the government by ensuring that, if a VET provider does not meet certain standards, they can be required to cease operating as a VET provider. This is a simple safety precaution that is in line with the objectives of the bill to properly target assistance under the scheme. Amendments in the bill also remove some of the delays in the higher education and VET provider approval process. These changes will allow higher education and VET providers to operate sooner, which will in turn give eligible students faster access FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP assistance under these providers. Under current arrangements, notices of approval to operate as a provider do not take effect until the parliaan mentary disallowance period of fifteen joint sitting days has elapsed. This can sometimes take up to two sitting periods and, looking at today's list, it stretches right back to FebruWhile ary this year, thus creating long delays and leaving students without access to assistance during this period. The amendments will allow providers to operate on the day immediately after the notice of approval is registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. This will not result in a reduction in accountability, as a notice of approval must still be tabled in both houses of parliament and the usual disallowance period will still apply. No student can be disadvantaged by the amendments to the approval process. In the event that a notice of approval is disallowed and the provider in question has already allowed students to access assistance, those students will be able to access whatever rights had accrued under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 prior to the disallowance. Whilst the changes made in this bill are I relatively minor, they are part of a broader range of measures that consolidate the Rudd government's commitment to higher education and skills. They make changes that improve the system for students, providers and the government. I commend this bill to the House.",62
49,Mrs MOYLAN,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"It is a great privilege to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEEHELP and Providers) Bill 2009. The importance of vocational education and training on an individual and national level cannot be overstated. I would like to pay tribute to the to work of the ministers for education under the Howard government, the successive ministers who placed such a strong emphasis on ensuring that young people in Australia had opportunity to enter into higher education rather than just fall off the edge, because I think the previous administration had put a lot of emphasis on university level study. that is important, it is not for every young person. What our ministers did was to try to make sure that young people had a variety of opportunities to further their education, particularly in the vocational education and training system. Clearly, with the growing demand in the Australian economy, more than ever before we need skilled workers who have furthered their education at either a university or cational education and training institution. There is an ongoing requirement that the government contribute towards ensuring that the needs of a skilled workforce can be met. A major part of this process is about ensuring that students are encouraged to attend a wide range of further education options. This process is ongoing and requires the constant diligence of government. Things have changed quite a bit in terms of the skilling of our workforce. At one stage, government industries made up a substantial part of the training system that trained young people in apprenticeships and vocational education and training. That changed dramatically when a different tack was taken and many government industries were privatised or corporatised. It was then left to the private sector. It became clear to me when I came into the parliament in 1993 that there was an ever-increasing gap in the capacity of this country to find skilled workers to fill the many vacancies that opened up. Because we did not have a large number of people training through the apprenticeships and training systems that were offered by either the Public Service or government industries such as the railways, buses and airlines, nobody seemed to want to foot the bill for the training of young people. I think it fair to say that there was a hiatus which, down the track, caused us considerable problems with workforce requirements. But I applaud the work that was done by the successive ministers for education-if memory serves me correctly, Minister Kemp, Minister Nelson and Minister Bishop-under the Howard government. In 2007 the Howard government expanded the operation of FEE-HELP to extend the concessional loans to cover vocational education and training courses. Again, this is an indication of just how serious we were when we were in government to ensure a vothat all young people had opportunities to further their education and training. The worthy object of this policy was to encourage greater participation in vocational education and training courses where the lack of FEEHELP served as a deterrent to students. In the past, these might have been young people who went into apprenticeships or vocational training in government-owned enterprises. The bill currently before us will refine this policy. VET FEE-HELP will allow full-feepaying students who are enrolled in diploma, advanced diploma, graduate certificate or graduate diploma course access to FEEHELP loans to cover the cost of their course fees. Where the student is undertaking a diploma or advanced diploma, their VET provider must have a credit transfer arrangement in place with a higher education provider. As with FEE-HELP for university students, the $80,000 maximum loan is repaid once the student reaches the income threshold. Students do not have to pay for the VET courses upfront. They are able to pursue their vitally important education and they only have to pay for it once they have entered into the workforce. Clearly, when the Howard government embarked on the mission to make VET courses more accessible, it was recognised is that there would be administrative kinks that would need to be ironed out. As the VET sector provides units, modules and courses far wider in scope than those offered by tertiary institutions, the first challenge is to determine which of those units FEE-HELP should cover. As a consequence of this bill, only those units that are essential to the course being undertaken will be covered by a loan arrangement. Any units taken in excess of the requirements of the course will not be covered. VET providers will be able to offer loans immediately after their notice of approval has been registered rather than having to wait, as they currently do, for the disallowance period to cease. This will streamline the processing of applications from VET providers to offer FEE-HELP and will thus enable students to have earlier access to financial assistance for their higher-level VET courses. The minister's discretion to revoke approval of a VET provider is also confirmed. This is a positive continuation of a policy designed to encourage higher level learning with vocational education and training providers. But, as I have noted, there needs to be continual work done to ensure that opportunities are available for all Australians sue their education at tertiary institutions or VET institutions. Despite all the talk about the education revolution, what we continue to see is that students from lower socio-economic backgrounds are prevalent in VET and tend to seek low-level qualifications. This means that the measures being discussed today will have very little effect on the students who need the assistance most. Much more needs to be done to create better pathways to encourage students to continue their education in higher-level diploma and advanced diploma courses and, in some cases, at university. Leesa Wheelaham, a senior lecturer in adult and vocational education from Griffith University has noted that ‘VET needs to provide a climbing framework to higher qualifications, particularly in higher education'. Ms Wheelaham goes on to note that the ‘Labor policy emphasises the need to equip the Australian people to engage in lifelong learning, but it does not yet have the lifelong learning policy to support this' ambition. I have added the word ‘ambition'. It would seem that, if the so-called education revolution is to ever get off the ground, establishing a climbing framework for higher education is essential. Replicating TAFE by installing trades training centres in senior schools across Australia seems to be a hopelessly misguided policy when this money could be better utilised to encourage continual engagement in education across the Australian workforce. If the youth of Australia are to see any benefit to their education system, it will be that the accessibility of VET courses continues to be expanded before them and that the policy disincentives to advance their education are promptly removed.",63
50,Mr DREYFUS,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"It is a privilege to be able to speak today in support of the Higher Education Support to purAmendment (VET FEE-HELP and Providers) Bill 2009, which is part of a large range of measures this government is taking in every sector of the education system. I was sorry to hear the previous speaker refer to the ‘so-called' education revolution, because in truth there is an education revolution led by the Rudd Labor government, which is being felt in every sector of the education system throughout Australia. We have reforms taking place in early childhood, in the primary and secondary systems and in the higher education system. What we see in this bill is assistance directed at the VET system to provide fee help. Of course, VET FEE-HELP at present assists students who are studying diploma, advanced diploma, graduate certificate or graduate diploma courses by providing a loan for all or part of the tuition costs. The bill is targeted at certain higher level skills and, as such, it is limited to these advanced diplomas. Under current arrangements, there are no provisions that expressly limit a student's access to assistance under the scheme to those VET units of study which are essential and directly relevant to the completion of the student's VET course of study. As such, it is possible that a student may be entitled to VET FEE-HELP assistance for a unit of study even where that unit of study is additional to, and not directly required for, the completion of the course. What these amendments do, and it needs to be recognised that they will be particularly useful, is ensure that access to VET FEEHELP assistance is appropriately targeted to those VET units of study which are essential in that they are required to be undertaken by the student in order for the student to receive the relevant award for that VET course of study. This amendment has particular relevance for my home state of Victoria because it relates to the Australian government decision to support the Victorian government's VET reform agenda by allowing for the extension of the VET FEE-HELP assistance scheme to subsidise diploma and advanced diploma students in Victoria. As of 1 July this year, a greater number of VET providers will be offering access to VET FEE-HELP to their students, increasing the risk that funding may inappropriately support students undertaking non-essential VET units of study. So what we have with these legislative amendments is a targeted provision which will ensure that the support for fees is directly targeted to purpose for which that assistance is created. The bill also makes some minor technical amendments to provide for appropriate protections for the minister and the Commonwealth in the event that a VET provider no longer offers any eligible VET courses, is no longer appropriately established under a law of the Commonwealth or a state or territory, or no longer carries on business or has its central management and control in Australia. These amendments mirror those made to HESA in 2007 in relation to higher education providers and, therefore, ensure consistency between the FEE-HELP and VET FEEHELP assistance schemes. These reforms to an important part of the education structures of our country are consistent with the reform agenda of the Rudd Labor government, which is to look at every single part of the education system in this country. The fact that we are focusing here on vocational education and training for the future is consistent with the understanding that we have that people find different pathways to their educational ends. We are ensuring that all pathways will be supported. I commend the bill to the House.",65
51,Mr OAKESHOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I want to pick up on that last point about the various educational pathways to be achieved by, hopefully, many young people and students in Australia. I have just come from a meeting with two 18-year-olds, Heidi Pett and Jess O'Callaghan, from Port Macquarie, both of whom having taken time away from three part-time jobs to come to Canberra to express their concern about some of the changes contained in the budget, postBradley, with regard to, in particular, the independence test in the Youth Allowance. Picking up on the point of the previous speaker, many people choose many different pathways to tertiary education and to qualifithe cations generally. But I sincerely hope the language from the government of the last 12 months in regard to an education revolution includes very much the concept, the belief and the practice of keeping as many pathways as possible open, including those for students who have the impediment of geography by being based in regional and rural Australia. I do not make that point lightly. The comparative statistics with regard to people who access tertiary education for the mid-North Coast New South Wales, my electorate, are not good. The statistics roughly equate to one in six people on the mid-North Coast having tertiary qualifications compared to the state average in New South Wales of one in three. We have a fundamental issue of disadvantage that I hope the government, in its language over the last 12 months under the broad banner of an education revolution, is aware of and wanting to address. I certainly hope that we work through the broad changes post the Bradley review and post the budget response from government. We are now dealing with a range of students and potential students who are raising concerns on a number of issues. I hope the government communicates actively with them and works through the issues that they face. If there are issues genuinely raised that are further structural impediments to students from my region and other regions of New South Wales in accessing university and choosing pathways then I would hope the government addresses those issues and feels not one grain of guilt in changing some of the responses contained in the post-Bradley period that we live in. In a lot of ways, I think, it will be a test the education revolution language to see over the coming weeks and months how the government, the executive and the minister in particular, engage with a group of people who have left school and who have been caught in this retrospective trap of public policy with regard to the independence test for the youth allowance. If there is poor engagement on that front, any of the language we have heard from government over the past 12 to 18 months starts to look very hollow. If there is good engagement, if it is communication and if it is working through the changed eligibility criteria then certainly it would renew and restore my faith, and the faith of many 18-year-olds on the mid-North Coast and right through regional and rural Australia, that the government are serious about lifting the standard of education in this nation. That links into the issue before us with regard to the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP and Providers) Bill 2009. FEE-HELP is a loan given to eligible fee-paying students to help pay part or all of their tuition fees. The government pays the amount of the loan directly to the student's provider. Students repay their loan through the tax system once their income is above the minimum threshold for compulsory repayment, otherwise to be known as ICLs, or income contingency loans. The bill makes amendments to access to VET FEE-HELP and also to regulate the providers of vocational education and training. That second point is, I think, a point of reflection for all of us as we move to an era, like it or not, of full contestability within the vocational education and training sector. There are costs and benefits that come with that era and with regulating providers, whether they are registered training organisations or one of the many different forms that we now have for vocational education and of training. I think there is a need to keep a very close eye from a public policy point of view on the regulatory environment and the role that government and ministers play in ensuring quality is not diminished as we enter this new era. The bill also clarifies that a student cannot access the VET FEE-HELP assistance to undertake a VET unit of study unless that VET unit of study is required to be undertaken in order for the student to receive the award associated with that course of study. A new requirement is that a body corporate must offer at least one VET course of study before the minister may approve that body as a VET provider. The minister can revoke the approval of a body corporate as a VET provider if that body corporate no longer offers at least one VET course of study, is no longer established under Australian law, no longer carries on business in Australia or no longer has its central management control in Australia. It also provides that notices of approval for higher education and VET providers take effect on the day immediately following the day the relevant notice is registered on the Federal Register Legislative Instruments. Where a notice of approval ceases to have effect the cessation has no effect in relation to any rights or responsibilities which have already accrued in relation to the enrolment of students with a higher education or VET provider. The effects of the bill are that these amendments provide what we consider appropriate protections for the minister and the Commonwealth as we enter this new era. The present amendment mirrors those made to higher education providers in 2007 and brings consistency to the rules relating to higher education FEE-HELP and VET FEEHELP assistance schemes. The amendments ensure that higher education and VET providers will be able to offer FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP assistance to students immediately following the registration of their approval as a provider. Therefore it speeds up access to higher education FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. Due to previous reforms a broader range of providers can seek access to these loans. These amendments should, I hope, speed up access to the loans, therefore a greater protection by way of the revocation of providers is an obvious consequence. As far as local issues are concerned, I have just spoken about a couple of very impressive 18-year-olds who are down here this week engaging with government and lobbying about their concerns, the concerns of their colleagues and, as we all could argue, what is in the best public interest for the tion for the future. The particular amendment speeds up access to VET FEE-HELP for local vocational education and training students undertaking courses by a newly approved provider, and anything that improves access within what is a complex area for people who are not engaged in the public policy process can only be a good thing. It limits the availability of FEE-HELP to of courses that are required or essential to be taken for the student to achieve the award. That is something we will continue to watch and monitor. It certainly broadens the minister's powers for revocation of providers. Whenever public policy gives discretion in any form to a minister or an executive, I would hope that this place would maintain an ongoing watching brief on those discretionary powers-in this case, increased discretionary powers of a minister. These amendments support the implementation of the policy agenda for income contingency loans established in other legislation so, in isolation, they are unlikely to be controversial and therefore, from my point of view, are certainly not to be opposed. However, the global issue of the moment is the way students and potential students are reading the post-Bradley, post-budget environment provided by government and therefore weighing up their education pathways for the future. Given the amount of change that has taken place and is taking place, I would leave government with this message from my region. There is a need for greater communication and engagement on the concepts underlying a lot of the changes that are taking place and on the detail with regard to individual, personal and family circumstances as to what would have been accessible from a lower SES regional environment such as mine in the previous environment compared with what I think is the common goal of trying to broaden access for more people in a naregion such as mine. While the theory and the principles behind it are sound, and the language is sound with regard to an education revolution and trying to lift the general standard of education within the nation, it is the practice of the moment that is challenging a lot of people. The government needs to stay earnest and engaged with the many people who are grappling with the changes, who are trying to understand the reasons for them and are struggling to do the maths on their personal circumstances, which in many ways will make the decision for them as to whether or not they access vocational education and training or other tertiary education. I would hope everyone in this chamber fundamentally agrees with the principle of trying to as many students as possible into tertiary education in all its forms. Whether it is vocational education, university or whatever, we are trying to encourage people to engage in education pathways and to put some meat on the bones with regard to length of stay in education. That length of stay in education principle affects us in terms of employment or unemployment, lifestyle, self-knowledge and awareness, wellness-the whole suite of issues that confront this nation. Education is the meal ticket. I think the government has picked it up. I would hope this is part of that response. I just earnestly ask the government to stay engaged in this period when a lot of reform has been dropped on local communities. There is a lot of concern, some of it right and some of wrong, within communities about the direction of government and the implications of the post-Bradley period. I do not oppose this bill.",66
52,Mr CHEESEMAN,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"The Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP and Providers) Bill 2009 shows again that Labor is the party of good governance. It shows that the Rudd government is a progressive government and will continue to be so. This is definitely a government committed to providing opportunities in education. When I was putting this presentation together, what struck me was that this is yet another education bill that this government has before parliament. We have had so many education bills before us since I came into this place in 2007, and all of them are about reforming and improving the education system and people's access to it. We are very lucky to have such a committed Minister for Education. I think it is great to see all this work being done on education, in this case the important VET sector. As I mentioned, the Rudd government is not only a progressive government but a government that is distinguished by good get governance, and this bill highlights this. How does this bill show us that? Because it is not just about encouraging participation, which of course we are doing, but it is about properly targeting benefits and then delivering them efficiently. That is what this bill is all about: encouraging participation in education, but also ensuring public money is being used as wisely as possible. We want to target payments and make sure people are not mucked around in getting access to those payments. So, to the detail of this bill. This bill provides for technical amendments to the Higher Education Support Act 2003. It ensures students' access to assistance under the VET FEE-HELP Assistance Scheme is limited to those VET units of study that are essential to the completion of the relevant VET course that they are studying. It ensures consistency between the FEEHELP and VET FEE-HELP assistance schemes that we have in place. It also allows for a higher education or VET provider notice of approval to take effect on the day immediately following the day the notice is registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments.",69
53,The VET FEE,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"HELP Assistance Scheme provides loans to eligible fee-paying students undertaking certain VET courses of study, to help pay for all or part of their tuition fees. This is another way in which the Rudd government is encouraging students to participate in education-another way we are increasing participation right across this nation. Students can access training and defer the fees until they are able to pay those costs.",69
54,The VET FEE,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"HELP Assistance Scheme is targeted to certain higher level skills, as access to assistance under the scheme is limited to VET courses of study leading to the award of a VET diploma, VET advanced diploma, VET graduate diploma or VET graduate certificate. Under current arrangements, there are no provisions which expressly limit a student's access to assistance under the scheme to those VET units of study which are essential, and directly relevant, to the completion of the student's VET course of study. These amendments therefore ensure access to VET FEE-HELP assistance is appropriately targeted to those VET units of study which are essential. This change is particularly important for my own state of Victoria. The Rudd government has made a decision to support the Victorian government's VET reform agenda by allowing for the extension of the VET FEEHELP Assistance Scheme to subsidised diploma and advanced diploma students in my state. As of 1 July 2009, a greater number of VET providers will be offering access to VET FEE-HELP assistance to their students, increasing the risk that funding may inappropriately support students undertaking non-essential VET units of study. So the change will be important in that respect. As I have said, this bill is also about effiticipation; ciency in delivering the benefit. A characteristic frustration for many people when they know they are eligible for a benefit is how much of a fuss it is to actually get it-how much rigmarole you have to go through and how long it takes. This bill also makes amendments to the provider approval provisions, to ensure a greater number of approved higher education and VET providers can operate sooner, giving eligible students faster access to FEE-HELP or VET FEEHELP assistance with those providers. In the way it works at the moment, there are unacceptable delays and additional costs for higher education institutions and registered training organisations applying for approvals, and this leaves students without access to FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP assistance during this time. The amendments will ensure that higher education and VET providers can operate on the day immediately following the day on which the notice of approval is registered. Under these amendments, parliament will still be able to scrutinise approvals of providers. A notice of approval must be tabled in both houses of parliament and a disallowance period of 15 joint sitting days will apply, and approval will still be subject to the requirements of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. The VET sector is, of course, very important. In addition to providing good intrinsic education across a wide range of subject and career areas, it is often a bridge to keep people going in education. So many VET students have gone on from these studies to secure good jobs, support families and forge careers. The FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP assistance to students is helping many people into VET courses. It is raising our overall participation in education. It is improving people's skills and employability. It is widening people's employment choices and opportunities. This bill is not only improving parit is targeting public money where it is most needed and where it will be spent most widely, and it is delivering benefits efficiently. This bill is another example of our government on the ball, delivering for education. I commend the bill to the House.",70
55,Ms MARINO,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I rise to speak in support of the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP and Providers) Bill 2009, which provides for technical amendments to support the implementation of the policy framework for income contingent loans established in other legislation. The bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to: make clear that access to VET FEE-HELP is only available for units of study that are essential for the awarding of the approved qualification and not for units that are in excess of that requirement; ensure that the measures relating to the revocation of vocational education and training providers are consistent with the provisions in the act relating to the revocation of higher education providers, by allowing the minister to revoke the approval of a body corporate as a VET provider in cases where the body no longer offers at least one VET course of study, is no longer established at law, no longer carries on business in Australia or no longer has its central management control in Australia; and speed up access to higher education FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP by enabling providers to offer this support to students immediately following the registration of the provider's notice of approval on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments as allowed for under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Income contingent loans for students, such as those that have been available in the higher education sector for some time, were extended to the VET sector for the first time in 2007. Part of the rationale for their introduction was that government support arrangements in the two sectors were inequitable-higher education students had access to government support through the ICLS; however, VET students studying for qualifications at the same level did not. Limited to those qualifications that are common to both the higher education and VET sectorsdiploma, advanced diploma, graduate diploma and graduate certificate coursesICLS were introduced into VET studies by using the existing framework for the higher education FEE-HELP loans provided for by the Higher Education Support Amendment Act 2007. Initially, VET ICLS were only made available for full-fee diploma, advanced diploma, graduate diploma and graduate certificate courses, on condition that there be credit transfer arrangements in place to credit the qualification towards a higher education award and on the further condition that the providers be bodies corporate. Although I support this bill, which provides for income contingent loans to the VET sector, I am concerned with the administrative challenge it may present, because it limits eligible units of study to those that are essential for the approved award. This will mean defining and containing the VET ICLS within a framework of units, modules and courses that is far broader than those provided by the higher education sector. The regulation of providers in the bill, while technical in nature, in effect is a response to the broadening policy parameters for access to ICLS which are leading to the increasing number and diversity of providers seeking approval to offer higher education FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. In comparison to the higher education sector, VET is currently provided through a national network of over 4,000 public and private registered training providers. The bill provides for technical amendments to schedule 1A of the Higher Education Support Act 2003 which clarify that a student can not access VET FEE-HELP assistance to undertake a VET unit of study unless that unit is required to receive the relevant award associated with that particular course. The amendments will ensure that higher education and VET providers will be able to offer FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP assistance to students immediately after registration of the relevant notice of higher education or VET provider approval. Clause 6 sets out the requirements to be satisfied before the minister may approve a body corporate as a VET provider. The proposed paragraph 6(da) is a new requirement that a body corporate must offer at least one VET course of study before the minister may provide approval. Clause 1 of schedule 1 of the act defines a VET course of study to mean a structured and integrated program of vocational education or vocational training, usually consisting of a number of modules or units of study or shorter programs and leading to the award of a VET diploma, a VET advanced diploma, a VET graduate diploma or a VET graduate certificate. The opportunity to access VET FEEHELP may attract additional education providers to my electorate, particularly around the Busselton region that has and is seeing rapid population increases. The area currently offers a range of excellent primary and secondary education facilities. Further higher and vocational education and training could certainly assist with current and future lation growth projections as well as potentially assist in retaining more young people in the region and assist in providing a future skilled workforce and small businesses for the future. Excellent secondary schools have been established in the region and a diversity of tertiary education opportunities is required right through regional and rural areas. Universities do not offer the range of courses required by regional students within their south-west campuses. We currently have a regional campus of Edith Cowan University in Bunbury, the Margaret River Centre of Wine Excellence as well as TAFE centres. The natural environment, our cape and marine environments, our natural resource management history are all regional strengths in my area. One of the many success stories in education in the south-west is the Georgiana Molloy Anglican School, just north of Busselton. In 1996 all existing schools were at capacity. The BusseltonDunsborough area had the second-highest national per capita growth rate outside of Sydney. A community based steering committee formed a constitution, a vision and a time line for the development of the school. Public meetings were held, planning approval was granted in 2002, construction started and the Georgiana Molloy Anglican School was opened in 2002 and had 128 students in 2003. This school offers a holistic, character based education centred upon the strong relationship between staff, students and parents. Students are encouraged to become independent, critical thinkers with an ongoing love of learning. The school complements its TEE program by offering a strong vocational education and training program, providing an opportunity for students to develop industry and generic work related skills while at the same time gaining nationally recognised qualifications while still at school through a broad range of curriculum popu- council courses and subjects. The school now has 830 students from kindergarten to year 12. Our regional communities should have the ability to educate and retain our young people. This bill ensures that VET students have an opportunity to access VET FEE-HELP. I support the bill on that basis.",70
56,Mr RIPOLL,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT," Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on this very important bill, which I think goes to one of the critical parts of what a government can do in terms of trying to up-skill the community by providing the necessary educational facilities and support for people trying to get the sorts of skills and education levels they need to have fulfilling careers and to help not only themselves but the economy as well. So it is very pleasing to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP and Providers) Bill 2009. I also want to make mention of the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion, who has a very large portfolio looking at workplace relations, training and other areas. It is a very important roleas well as being the Deputy Prime Minister, of course-and no less important in that it is the issue of education which is front and centre in my local community in terms of all the things we are trying to achieve as a community and certainly of which I am very supportive. I do everything I can as the local representative for that community. I have got a number of stories about what is happening in the electorate of Oxley which I will recount to the parliament in my contribution. This bill provides a number of technical amendments for the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to ensure that a student's access to assistance under the VET FEE-HELP Assistance Scheme is limited to those VET units of study that are essential to the completion of the relevant vocational education training course of study. This makes complete sense and is where it ought to be. It ensures consistency between the VET FEEHELP assistance schemes, and the bill applies previous amendments made to HESA in relation to the revocation of a higher education provider's approval to the VET FEEHELP Assistance Scheme and provisions of HESA, and also allows a higher education or VET provider notice of approval to take effect on the day immediately following the day that it is registered under the federal ister.",72
57,The VET FEE,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"HELP Assistance Scheme provides loans to eligible fee-paying students and it does that for certain VET courses of study. It helps pay for all or part of the tion fees for students. Students can then access training and defer the fees until they are able to pay, which is a completely reasonable and appropriate manner to deal with getting students through these schemes. You will hear debates in this place from time to time, or perhaps in the community, about whether that ought to be the way for deferral of fees, how those fees should be paid and how much they should be; whether they are for a VET course, a training course, a higher education course, a university degree or others. I think those debates will continue for a long time into the future. But I think it is important that we all recognise here that any assistance that can be granted through government schemes that helps particular students to further educate themselves to gain particular skills and to improve themselves gives them a better chance of fulfilling careers, contributing to the economy and playing a larger part and a bigger role in their own community. This is one of the very important driving factors for this government, to ensure that we do our bit to assist students in their ability to pay fees on specific courses.",73
58,The VET FEE,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"HELP Assistance Scheme is targeted to certain higher level skills as access to assistance under the scheme is limalso ited to VET courses of study leading to the award of a vocational education training diploma or advanced diploma or a graduate diploma or certificate. This is for a good reason: where there is assistance provided, and where that study leads to a particular type of award, that is where the assistance should go. It should not just be right across the board on any course or on every bit of training. Where there are limited amounts of funding, and regwhere governments are limited in what they can do with the amount of resources they have available, it should be specifically targeted and directed at those who not only need the most assistance but also to those tui- skill level areas the government wants to promote and where the economy needs to be stimulated. That is exactly what this does. For local communities, there is a focus you can make when defining your area. In the past decade, and certainly in the last five years, there has been a real focus in the western corridor of Brisbane and Ipswich from a whole range of areas-local government authorities, the state government and the federal government-on skilling people up, providing better educational opportunities and providing better training opportunities. That has come not only from those three levels of government but also from private providers, the community itself and-some might find it surprising-even from developers. I make specific mention of that because I want to put it on the record that Springfield Land Corporation in my electorate has for many years driven not only the development of a very large estate-a satellite city called Greater Springfield-but has had education as a central focus of what that community is about, right at the core of it. For a lot of years I suppose people just looked at it as perhaps any other development and did not really consider just how serious they were, or the sort of impact it would have on the local community: to build a new community for people to live in on the principle that education gives you great opportunities. We are many years down the track now, and probably close to 20 per cent of the development has been completed. The Bremer TAFE has been involved. It is a fantastic TAFE organisation in my electorate and wider-it runs into the electorate of Blair, and I note that the member for Blair is here and will also speak on this very important bill. We have not only organisations such as TAFE but schools getting more involved at a community level and at a government level outside the normal charter that we would expect from schools, and certainly outside the normal charter that we would expect from developers of a particular estate. That achievement means that the University of Southern Queensland has set up in my electorate. It is a great regional university that branching out and providing the sorts of opportunities to people that otherwise would never have had those opportunities. A lot of young people growing up in the western corridor have traditionally not had a lot of places to turn to. I say that would be the same regardless of which state we were talking about. You traditionally have not had a lot of opportunities directly around you. You certainly cannot look directly at a university in your own backyard, or some professional skill providers or other educational institutions that have the capacity to deliver the sort of up-skilling, training and educational opportunities in a community that we now find we do have in the western corridor. I am particularly pleased and I am thankful about this. I would also like to acknowledge all of the hard work that has gone into delivering those sorts of opportunities. Right across the board there has been this wonderful partnership in the electorate between community, government, private enterprise, businesses small and large and employers. It is a story that continues to develop and grow. I would particularly like to make reference to a group of schools in my electorate in that part of the western corridor, which, through our schools trades training investment, decided there was a real opportunity for them to collaborate and pool their funds to build one big trades training centre that could be utilised by all four schools. It was quite a simple proposition and one that I know is being dealt with through the department, and it is one that I expect will be successful. The simple proposition is one of four schools getting together. Not only do they have more resources but they can build a higher quality, better resourced facility for their students. What was really nice and really different about this one is that it involved government and non-government schools collaborating together. I am not sure how many other elecis torates may have this happening, but I hope it is happening elsewhere. I know that what is happening in my electorate is a really great example of schools in a particular community seeing the advantages of skills and education and what they can deliver for their students. When this new facility is built and starts to provide the training, the skills and the sources it has been chartered to do, we will see something that we have not seen for a long time: government and non-government schools working together and sharing facilities with students being able to interact directly with students from other schools in an educational and trades training environment. That interaction will, I think, have a huge impact in the local community by the fact that it will give an understanding of how other schools work, how other students deal with their issues and how you can provide better opportunities in the local community. So it is all very good news and all very important. It is all part of a genuine focus a whole range of people to do something just a little bit different that will leave a legacy behind. But all this would not have happened if it were not for a couple of factors. Not only do you need essential goodwill-the goodwill of communities prepared to work together across all of those areas I have already described-but also investment, and very importantly that investment should be an investment such as the one contained in this bill. Being able to provide assistance schemes, funding for schools, supporting TAFE colleges and the work that they do, supporting universities in their expansion and their provision of courses for students: without all of that and without government assistance and without proper programs in place you do not get all those great ideas becoming a reality. I have had the good fortune of having a number of ministerial visits to my electorate. I have shown them what is happening and I have taken them to the local schools and the university to shown them the growth that is occurring in the western corridor so that they can see that the money being invested, the programs that this government has put in place, the investment in schools, the vocaretional education training programs and the support we give to students and to families is having a very positive impact-that it is having the desired outcomes that we all seek. In the end, any government wanting to invest will want to see a great outcome from that investment, and that is certainly the case in terms of the electorate of Oxley and the wider western corridor. I tend to refer to my electorate these days as being not just strict boundaries based on an arbitrary line that is given to us by the Australian Electoral Commission but as being more about the western corridor. It is a growing and developing community and it by sometimes transcends those artificial boundaries that are given to us by the Australian Electoral Commission, which are necessary obviously for elections and for representation purposes. Under the current arrangements, there are no provisions that would expressly limit a student's access to assistance under the scheme to the vocational education training units of study which are essential and directly relevant to the completion of the student's VET course of study. As such, it is possible that a student may be entitled to VET FEE-HELP assistance for a unit of study, even where that unit of study was additional to or not directly required for the completion of that course. We acknowledge that and we understand how those arrangements work. These amendments, therefore, do ensure that access to VET FEE-HELP assistance is appropriately targeted and that we are getting bang for our buck in terms of delivering essential funding into what I think is a key area in terms of driving the economy and in terms of keeping Australia moving and ensuring that young people and people who are doing re-training get the essential assistance they need. This amendment is also particularly important in light of the Australian government's decision to support the Victorian government's VET reform agenda by allowing for the extension of the VET FEE-HELP Assistance Scheme to subsidise diploma and advanced diploma in that state. It is important to acknowledge that part of what we are doing is trying to bring about some consistency across the states and some uniformity to reduce the burden of bureaucracy and red tape and other inefficiencies that are contained in all systems and, also, to try to make it as user friendly as possible. Further, the bill makes minor technical amendments to provide for appropriate protections of the minister and the Commonwealth in the event that a VET provider no longer offers any eligible VET courses, or is no longer appropriately established under a law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory or no longer carries on a business or has central management and control in Australia. These amendments mirror those made to the HESA in 2007 in relation to higher education providers. It therefore ensures consistency between the two different programs: the VET FEE-HELP Assistance Scheme and the FEEHELP scheme. The bill also makes amendments to the provider approval provisions to ensure that a greater number of approved higher education and VET providers can actually operate sooner, giving eligible students faster access to both those schemes. Under the current HESA arrangements notices of approval are legislative instruments, and such notices of approval to operators of higher ed or VET providers do not actually take effect until the parliamentary disallowance period of 15 joint sitting days has elapsed. This can sometimes take up to two sitting periods. This creates some unacceptable delays and additional costs for higher education institutions and registered training organisations applying for approval and, as a consequence, leaves students without access to either the FEE-HELP or the VET FEEHELP assistance programs during this time. So the amendments will ensure that higher ed and VET providers can operate on the day immediately following the day on which the notice for approval is registered. The amendment is particularly important, again, in light of our decision to support what the Victorian government has done as to reform in this area. The key drivers of this amendment and changes are not only part of a wider program of the Rudd government's move to make education, higher education and vocational training more efficient but part of a general philosophy that we have in terms of creating better efficiencies, creating more consistency across different jurisdictions and ensuring that where the government expends taxpayer dollars you get maximum value for those dollars, they are appropriately targeted at the people they are meant to help, they are targeted at the appropriate schemes or courses and, in the end, it is an investment not only in those people that receive that help but also in jobs and in the upskilling of all Australians. It helps to provide for better infrastructure delivery and, very importantly in all electorates, it helps to provide better schools and better outcomes out of the students that go through the schools. I think, too, it has better linkages between primary and secondary education, on to higher education, regardless of the path that students want to take-whether they want to take a university type path or whether they want to take a trades based path. Both of those have some equal opportunities that students can choose for themselves, and they can do that as early as possible through the education system, be it government or non-government. I think one of the great successes of this government has been to, over recent years, turn that debate around. I think a lot of the public, certainly in the community, view these constant debates-about government schools and non-government schools, about how money is expended, about what is more valuable and about having a trade or a university degree-as old debates which are hopefully dead and buried. We can all move on to more important issues such as providing people with the necessary skills and investments, providing the right resources and facilities, providing all the right paths, viding the right types of policies and strategies, making sure that there is conformity across states and jurisdictions, and making sure that government is a facilitator and not an inhibitor of people's educational opportunities and skilling opportunities. While I commend the minister for her great work in this, I also commend the bill to the House. I know it is not a controversial bill and it is supported by everyone in this House. I commend it to the House.",73
59,Mr NEUMANN,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I speak in support of this legislation, the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP and Providers) Bill 2009. Like the member for Oxley, I represent a seat in that south-west part of Brisbane that goes into the Lockyer Valley and down to the Fassifern Valley. The challenges for students, young people and those seeking further education in Oxley-which is the south-west part of Brisbane and part of Ipswich-are the same for those in Ipswich and the rural areas outside. The member for Oxley talked about the growth in the corridor that he and I reprenities sent. His seat is growing rapidly and in three years time will have the second most number of electors in the whole of Queensland, and mine the fourth. We need a new classroom every week in Ipswich with the growth in the number of people, which is booming. The ABS figures show that Ipswich grew by more than four per cent in the last year, the fastest in Queensland. So the old stereotypes about Ipswich and those people who live in areas like Inala and Durack and out into the rural areas of my electorate, in Laidley, Gatton and beyond, are simply gone-and should be gone-from the lexicon of language used about South-East Queensland. Many people think that ours is an old coal mining area, an area where there is just manufacturing, but there are aerospace and universities and dynamic institutions out prothere with linkages in jobs that people never dreamed about decades ago. Tourism is a wonderful thing in our area, and hospitality as well. So it is the talent, the tolerance and the technology, which are all going towards creating a new Ipswich and a new area in South-East Queensland. The legislation here relates to some technical amendments, but they deal with areas of higher education. For many people in the south-west corridor of Brisbane and beyond the idea of a tertiary education or education at a TAFE was simply something that they could not aspire to. But under successive Labor governments we have seen this sort of thing opened up to working-class boys and girls and young men and women who never dreamed that they could aspire to this sort of education. Skilling our people and improving the opportunities in life for them is not just about improving productivity and profitability in our businesses, but it is about social inclusion, social capital and reducing social inequity. It is important that we do this for the sake of the young people of our commubut also for the sake of a more fair and just Australia. The background to this type of legislation can be found in the fact that there was an injustice between those people who studied in the VET area and those people who studied elsewhere. It was the case that income contingent loans were available to people who went to, say, the University of Queensland or the Queensland University of Technology, but people who went to, say, Bremer TAFE in my electorate could not get the kind of access, until recently, to loans which enabled them to complete courses. Fortunately that has broadened over the years and we have implemented the extension of HELP loans to various people-both sides of politics have been supportive of this-so that, if you want to do a diploma, an advanced diploma, a graduate diploma or a graduate certificate course, you can. Initially, it was in relation to credit or qualification a higher education award such as a degree, but we have broadened that out as the years have gone by. This is important because many people use it as a stepping stone, and other people simply want to become trained at a TAFE course to get a job. Many people in my electorate of Blair go to schools such as Ipswich Grammar School, Ipswich Girls Grammar School, St Edmund's College and St Mary's College and other private schools. They provide a wonderful educational course for young people who want to go on to academic pursuits and attend the University of Queensland, Queensland University of Technology and Griffith University. There are also other people from those schools who want to pursue TAFE courses. Many students in high schools such as Ipswich State High, Bremer State High or Bundamba State Secondary College would prefer to go to TAFE courses. Others want to go to university, such as I did. I went to Bundamba State Secondary College and then on to the University of Queensland. Increasingly, we are seeing more students from state school system backgrounds going to university, and this is a tremendous thing. It is important that we give children the opportunity, no matter where they come from-as I have said before, whether they live in Boonah or Brisbane, Ipswich or Indooroopilly-to have access to a high-quality education, either at a TAFE or at a university. The legislation lines up to make sure that, if you are going to be studying a course, you can get access to HELP but at the same time makes sure that that course can be directed to qualifications to ensure that you get the training and skills you need. That certificate is very important in helping you get a job in all the circumstances. Loans to eligible feepaying students are important because many people come from backgrounds where they cannot rely on the support of their parents for because their parents are struggling to put food on the table, to pay the rent, to pay the mortgage and to meet the everyday needs of their households. These parents cannot help them with tuition fees. Students can access training and defer fees until they are able to pay under the VET FEE-HELP assistance scheme. It is a great social scheme which will reduce inequality in our society and give children from whatever backgroundwhether they are the son of a coal miner, or the son of a meatworker or a shop assistant-access to loans which will enable them to complete their studies. These things are important in my community and to people in my electorate. We want to make sure that our assistance is targeted to those VET units of study which are essential to completing those courses. In terms of the assistance the Rudd Labor government is providing for the higher education sector, it is important for many people to know that it is not just universities that are receiving assistance but other institutions as well. It has to start at the grassroots level. We are rolling out childcare centres-hundreds of them-across the country, making sure that children are educated from a very young age. Regrettably, under the Howard coalition government, expenditure on education with respect to child care and preschool education was only one-fifth of that of our competitors in the OECD. If we can get our children educated at their first instance of entry into education system, that will give them the best chance in life. Building the Education Revolution-in terms of funding for infrastructure, community facilities, multi-purpose halls, libraries and the many things that we are rolling out across Australia-not only is good for jobs but also enables children to get access to formation and technology in a world they never dreamed of. At Raceview State Primary School, Silkstone State Primary School and Brassell State Primary School, the three biggest primary schools in my electorate, children will have the same access to information and the same access to facilities as children who attend larger or private schools in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. That is very important. So far, in my electorate, $30 million has been announced with respect to education funding under the BER funding, under the National School Pride and Schools for the 21st Century programs. Whether they come from small little country schools or larger Ipswich based schools, students are appreciative of the funding because that kind of funding gives them opportunity and gives them a chance for advancement in life. It is important that we go on to look at what we are doing in the broader context of higher education. This bill deals with higher education; it deals with the TAFE system. But it is important to think that, whether you are five, 15 or even 25, we are going to support you in pursuing education to enable you to develop your skills, talents and ability just to contribute to society but to build your self-esteem to ensure that you can achieve everything in life and your full potential. We are building the education revolution by investing $5.7 billion over four years through delivering reform in the higher education sector. In my electorate, we have two university campuses-one in Ipswich and the one in Gatton. We are seeing it manifested locally. We are seeing the increase in funding for higher education brought forward into those campuses. For example, the relocation of the school of veterinary science from Brisbane to Gatton will make a big difference. This will be not just in terms of the local community in terms of jobs, infrastrucin- ture and improvement in terms of development in the Lockyer Valley; it will give children a chance to pursue their goals and dreams if they are from a country life and agricultural background and to do what they need to do as country people to ensure their farming communities are developed to the best extent possible. We are also investing an enormous amount of money locally in terms of the University of Queensland Ipswich campus. I have spoken to Pro-Vice-Chancellor Alan Rix, who is very supportive of what we are doing in terms of infrastructure and innovation locally. We have also seen the new chair of Universities Australia come out just yesterday commending the Rudd Labor government for its commitment to the provision of higher education through the federal budget that was announced by the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, the member for Lilley. The new Chair of Universities Australia is Professor Peter Coaldrake, who is very well known in Queensland. He is the ViceChancellor of the Queensland University of Technology. He has come out very strongly in support of what the government is doing not in terms of the new framework for higher education in this country. He has said that it is going to make a great contribution to Australia's economic recovery, social advancement and environmental sustainability. He was pleased that we have adopted the recommendations of the Bradley and Cutler reviews on indexation, full cost funding of research, enhanced access and equity programs and approved accreditation and quality assurance arrangements. The investments in substantial social tal and infrastructure in the higher education sector are also crucial to improving not just the lives of students but also the research facilities in our universities and TAFEs across the country. We see that expressed locally in my electorate through the wonderful work carried out by the University of Queensland Ipswich campus. For example, an Ipswich study was undertaken by the university to look at the health needs of the community, a study which will have implications not just locally but state wide, nationally and internationally. We have many health needs in my area. Universities and other tertiary institutions are playing a tical role in developing our local area and improving the lives of the people of Ipswich. The university sector is very pleased with the federal government's contribution to higher education, not just for itself but for the TAFE sector as well. It is important that we build a higher education system which minimises the kind of regulation and burden that the Howard government imposed upon it. Fortunately, we have seen the eradication of Work Choices and the delinking of funding to the higher education sector with the requirement to impose Work Choices style individual contracts. It is important that we improve accountability and transparency in universities and TAFEs and the like, but it is important that we do not burden them by imposing ideological preconceptions on those wonderful institutions. When we look at higher education, tertiary education and secondary education, it is important that we recognise what the government is doing in terms of skilling our young people. The trade training centres that we are offering and rolling out across the country play an important role in ensuring that our young people develop interests, skills and abilities in areas that they perhaps capi- would not have dreamed of in the past. In Ipswich, we have seen three schools get together to apply for and receive funding for an institution which they have called the Ipswich trade training centre. I commend each one of them. It is going to be located at St Edmund's College, a Catholic boys college in Ipswich with the Edmund Rice tradition. It is a wonderful institution which has a fantastic trade training focus in terms of local manual arts, technical drawing and CAD systems, as well as a focus on the wet trades, carpentry, bricklaying and other types of trades. The emphasis for this particular trade training centre will be on those wet trades prac- and engineering. I commend the two grammar schools, Ipswich Grammar School and Ipswich Girls Grammar School, for their involvement in this project. They have seen the wisdom of it. I have spoken to all the principals involved in those schools, and they have warmly welcomed the funding. That will mean that students at those schools will be able to link in with businesses. I know that there are a number of businesses in the Ipswich and West Moreton communities who have offered their services and who are looking for students who are trained in those areas. There are many students who go to St Edmund's, Ipswich Boys Grammar School and Ipswich Girls Grammar School for a day or two and then go off and work as apprentices, getting their training on site and attending TAFE. The other trade training centre in my electorate is the trade training centre in the Lockyer Valley, which will also make a big difference in terms of training for young people. That has got a transport and agricultural focus. I commend Lockyer District High School for applying for funding. That focus will link in with the University of Queensland Gatton campus. The contact between the two will mean that students can study, work, meet and socialise together and help ensure that there is a transition between that high school and the university campus. The state government of Queensland should be commended for the funding that it has put into both campuses, the Ipswich and Gatton campuses of the University of Queensland. What we have done in terms of funding in the higher education sector is extremely important. This bill is a part of the government's total agenda. We have injected $3 billion through our budget into tertiary cation and innovation infrastructure through the education investment fund. The government has approved 31 projects from 160 applications. They will receive $934 million. There are many institutions across the whole country that will benefit, including institutions in South-East Queensland such as the advanced engineering building at the University of Queensland St Lucia campus, which is being funded to the tune of $50 million. That will position the University of Queensland's engineering programs at the forefront of international teaching capability. It will integrate research, postgraduate training and undergraduate teaching. It is important, in considering our TAFEs and universities, that we actually think about what we are doing and get an overall strategy. We want to build a stronger, fairer and more innovative Australia; we want to make sure that our funding of universities and the wider higher education sector is based on student demand; and we want to establish a target. We want to enable another 50,000 students to commence university studies by 2013. We want to ensure that we have as many people as possible with tertiary qualifications, whether they are from TAFEs or universities. We want to ensure that we support our young people not just because it is the right thing to do, not just because it will produce a fairer and more just Australia, but because we are interested in nation building-because we want to build the nation for the time when we recover to ensure that we have the future prosperity that we believe is important for our country and that we believe is important that our children inherit. What we do in terms of our funding of higher education says a lot about what we think Australia should become. It says a lot about what we believe our children should inherit and what chance in life we should give them. This is a good bill. It is part of the frameedu- work of the Rudd government's commitment to higher education, whether in the university sector or in the TAFE sector. I commend the bill to the House.",77
60,Ms SAFFIN,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I am pleased to speak in support of the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEEHELP and Providers) Bill 2009 and, indeed, any bill that has to do with education. For me, it is about personal commitment, it is about policy, it is about politics and it is about access, fairness and equity-all the issues that come to the fore when we are talking about education. That commitment to education flows right across the members of the government, and this is just one of the commitments of the Minister for Education, Ms Gillard, to education reforms. This particular reform is important because it is about giving help and support where it is needed. It is also about credentials, about people getting the credentials they need to improve their lives, get the jobs they want, be able to do the extra study and be in a position where they have some choices in life. This bill addresses both of those important issues: help and support, and appropriate and proper credentials. In this contribution I will give a brief line of the bill and then go into some details and the rationale for the bill, as well as make some general comments about how it is of relevance to the people in my electorate of Page. Vocational education and training, which the bill addresses, is a key plank of our education system and indeed our higher education system. There is a wonderful TAFE in my area, the North Coast TAFE, which is headquartered at Port Macquarie. Its director, Elizabeth MCGregor, is a very fine public servant who is dedicated to the educational needs of our region, which are substantial. In fact, I met with her only last week to talk about some of those needs. I know that they have put in a submission to try and secure some more funds for their capital infrastructure works. I wish them well and I hope they are successful with their bid. It is really important that students are able to access loans and the variety of support that they need, particularly if they are taking vocational education and training, because that is the basis of a lot of our skills and skills development. It goes to the heart of building up our skills in Australia, because we know that they have been run down over the past period and they have not been addressed in a national framework. There has been some good work done, much of it due to the goodwill of local providers-not through working cooperatively within an overarching national framework, and that is one of the key parts of this bill. To return to my electorate, we have the TAFE and many campuses across Page. They run fine courses. I have studied at the TAFE in my own local area-it helped me get some of the skills that I needed-and I have also taught there. So I have had the privilege of being both a student and a teacher there, and I stay very engaged with that community and outwith the teachers and the students. We also have really good adult community education through the North Coast adult community education centres. They are right across my electorate as well. I have also worked in those centres and studied in those centres and run the local adult community education centre. I sat for some time on the New South Wales adult education ministerial advisory council, so I was in a position to give advice in that area and thoroughly enjoyed it. There are 97 primary schools across Page. That is a substantial number of schools. All those schools, the children, their parents, the school communities and tradespeople, or tradesmen primarily, are the direct beneficiaries of the government's economic stimulus package, of which 70 per cent is directed towards infrastructure. That is a lot of infrastructure across Page. Eighty-four of those schools are primary, special or K-12, and they are all sharing in the Building the Education Revolution infrastructure package as under- well as the national pride program. This bill goes to the heart of the support that students require. It will ensure that students' access to assistance under VET FEEHELP is limited to VET units of study that are essential to the completion of the relevant VET course of study. This is so that the students get the appropriate level of credentials and skills required to access those further training and education opportunities and access the jobs that they want.

67,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I fer him to his claim that he will pay off Labor's massive debt by the year 2022. Will the Prime Minister provide the House with all the projected economic growth figures, inflation rates, budget surpluses and other financial assumptions through to 2022 which he says will support this dubious claim?",83
68,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. What I would say in response to it is that, notwithstanding the fact that the government debt and deficit strategy is the lowest debt of any major advanced economy in the world and has been reaffirmed with a AAA credit rating by Standard and Poor's, the government's strategy for dealing with the return to surplus and the payment of debt is outlined in the budget papers. The government stands by that strategy. Swine Influenza",83
69,Mr MARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister provide an update on the spread of swine flu in Australia?,83
70,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. This morning I was briefed by the Chief Medical Officer on the global public health challenge of human swine influenza and its development in Australia. As of 1200 hours Eastern Standard Time today, the total number of confirmed human swine influenza cases had risen to 61. Among states and territories the numbers are as follows: Victoria, 33; New South Wales, 18; Queensland, five; South Australia, three; Western Australia, one; and the Australian Capital Territory, one. The Australian community should prepare for the number of swine flu cases to continue to increase consistent with the pattern we have seen in other countries around the world. The World Health Organisation confirmed that humanto-human transmission has occurred in the re- following countries: Belgium, Canada, Chile, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States. Globally, the World Health Organisation has confirmed 46 countries officially reporting 12,594 cases of human swine influenza. Specifically, in Canada the number of confirmed cases has risen to 921, in Japan the number of confirmed cases has risen to 350 and in the United States the number of confirmed cases has risen to 6,764. As we consider these numbers, it is important to remember that we are coming into the flu season, while the Northern Hemisphere is moving out of its flu season. Like the normal seasonal flu, most people with swine flu will experience mild symptoms. The CMO advises that people who are treated quickly with antivirals will have a speedy recovery. We know that swine influenza has a hard edge-that is, in a small proportion of cases it can be more severe. That is why, while there is no cause for alarm or panic, we need to remain vigilant and will continue to carefully monitor the situation and act on the advice of our medical experts. The Commonwealth, along with states and territories, has already acted to advise students returning from countries with a concerning level of transmission that they should remain at home for seven days; has acted to close six schools, four in Victoria and two in South Australia; has provided information to emergency departments and GPs on known characteristics and risk factors for the disease; has established a hotline at 1802007, which has already received a number of inquiries; has ensured that airports have a clinical presence with nurses available; and has, on the advice of the CMO, included swine influenza to be a quarantineable disease in humans under the Quarantine Act 1908, so that people likely to have been exposed to potential swine flu can be placed under surveillance and potentially quarantined. All incoming passenger flights are required to report to the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, AQIS, on the health status of passengers on the planes. With the use of thermal scanners at international airports, passengers detected as having a raised temperature may be required to provide a nose or throat swab. Health declaration cards have been made compulsory for all international flights since 6 May. Health message signs have also been installed at international airports. Government advertising on radio and in newspapers providing information about what to do if you have symptoms of swine flu has commenced and the pandemic alert has been upgraded to CONTAIN as of 22 May 2009. The government has had a number of measures in place to closely monitor the situation. The Australian Health Protection Committee, made up of the Commonwealth and state and territory chief medical officers, meets twice daily. Officials in all jurisdictions have been engaged through the National Pandemic Emergency Committee in a 24-hour national incident room at the federal department of health. Critically, Australia remains one of the best prepared countries in the world for a possible pandemic, with a stockpile of more than 8.7 million courses of antivirals. Earlier today the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Chief Medical Officer launched new television as to ensure that proper information is being provided to parents and to families. Finally, I also take this opportunity to provide an important message to all Australians. If you are experiencing flu-like symptomsfever, sore throat, cough, headache and muscle aches and pains-seek the advice of a health professional. Each one of us can take steps to avoid the spread of the flu by simple things: firstly, washing your hands often and thoroughly; secondly, covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze and cough; and, thirdly, disposing of used tissues in the bin. Finally, if any person in the public is experiencing flu-like symptoms, we would urge them to seek medical advice and try to avoid close contact with others. NA",83
71,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu, the Honourable Edward Natapei. On behalf of the House I extend to him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Budget",85
72,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Given that the budget paper data does not extend to 2022, will the Treasurer provide the House with all of the projected growth figures, inflation rates, budget surpluses and financial assumptions until 2022 that support the Prime Minister's dubious claim?",85
73,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday we had some sloppy behaviour from the shadow Treasurer. He came into the House proving that he had not done his homework and made an assertion that we needed to run surpluses of two per cent for eight years. He then moved from that assertion in subsequent questions cited a table in the budget papers which actually proved that assertion wrong. The fact is that we do not have to run budget surpluses of that order for eight years. What we do have to run are budget surpluses around one per cent or a little higher through that period, and that is entirely achievable. When it comes to the provision of information, this government has provided more information than those on the other side ever considered providing at any stage. We are absolutely serious about implementing our medium-term fiscal strategy. Those opposite are acutely embarrassed because they do not have one. So they come in here and cast doubt on growth forecasts and somehow imply that the information is suspect, because they want to run a scare campaign on deficits and borrowing. They are acutely embarrassed, because they know that the Australian people want this government to put in place economic stimulus to support jobs in our community. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order concerning relevance. I asked the Treasurer about economic growth figures, inflation rates, budget surpluses in dollar terms and the financial assumptions",85

78,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Chisholm. Like the member for Corio, I think that particularly Victorian members in this House are very focused on the fast spread of this disease in Australia. I want to just add a couple of points to those made by the Prime Minister that I think will be of interest to the House. In doing so, I might just remind people that this disease came onto the international radar about six weeks ago in Mexico. The Australian government has been using all its efforts to ensure that we delay for as long as possible the entry of this disease into Australia. That has bought us valuable time both in the hope of producing a vaccine quickly by the time we have large numbers of people suffering from this disease in Australia, and also learning more about the disease-how it spreads and who it is particularly having an impact on. So the delay has benefited this community. But as the Prime Minister indicated, we are at 61 cases in Australia. Looking at how that developed, our first case was confirmed on 9 May. We had six cases a week ago. We had 31 at the same time yesterday, and there are 61 today. So Australians do have to prepare themselves for the fact that we will see an increase in those numbers. We are seeing the disease spread rapidly in the same way, for example, it did in Japan where in a very short space of time, particularly in high schools, we saw the numbers rise. They are now at 350 confirmed cases. We know that most people in Australia are experiencing very mild symptoms. Obviously, getting early treatment with antivirals has assisted with that and we hope that that will continue to be the case. But the Prime Minister mentioned the harder edge that this disease does have, and that is that a small proportion of cases can be very severe. We know this is now a disease of young people and that it has a particular impact on children and teenagers. We have also seen from the patterns overseas that pregnant women and asthmatics and others with respiratory problems are particularly at risk. Unfortunately, do need to remind the House that there have been 92 deaths from this disease across the world, mostly in Mexico. There have been 10 deaths in the United States, one in Canada and one in Costa Rica. The Prime Minister has taken the House through the range of steps that have been taken to try to delay the disease from coming into Australia and to handle its identification and treatment now that it is in Australiaand I will not repeat those steps. Members of this House will increasingly be getting calls at their electorate offices. People will be looking to us to provide proper information to them. The swine flu hotline is still the best source of reliable information for people to use. The number is 1802007. It has been in place for more than a month. Unsurprisingly, we have seen a spike in the number of calls over the last 24 hours. Please do not hesitate to encourage your constituents who need advice to use that hotline. I also take this opportunity to advise members-if they have not seen the invitation already-that Professor Jim Bishop has offered to brief all members first thing on Monday on what we know about the spread of this disease around the world. Obviously the situation is changing. I note that Professor Bishop has been providing briefings to both the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow health minister. I understand that more of those briefings will be provided. We are happy to do that and we appreciate the support that has been shown. Obviously this is a difficult and changing situation and we all need to work together. Similarly, we are working closely with the states and territories. We are pleased that they are taking some additional steps in terms of communicating with each other about people travelling across state borders. Also, many of the jurisdictions are setting up special flu clinics. I As we move into our flu season, many people who have seasonal flu will fear that they have swine flu. So making sure that facilities are available for the proper testing, identification and handling of the disease is going to be increasingly important. We need to remain vigilant. We need to keep up our efforts to contain this disease. People should follow the advice of their medical practitioner. Those who are travelling should take care and ensure that they look at the advice provided on the Smartraveller website, which my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs is ensuring is kept up to date as the situation changes around the world. There is no cause for alarm and panic, but the Prime Minister has encouraged people to follow proper flu etiquette. That might sound like a strange thing, but it is valuable in the containment of this disease. Please make sure that you encourage anyone you are in contact with to follow that etiquette and we will be able to reduce the spread of this disease.",85
79,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. I refer him to my earlier question to him and the member for North Sydney's question to the Treasurer. In each case, we asked the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to provide the House with the projected economic growth figures, inflation rates, budget surpluses and other financial assumptions through to 2022 that would support the Prime Minister's dubious claim that all of the massive debt he is running up will be repaid by that date. I refer to the answer that each of them gave, which was that these assumptions were to be found in the budget papers. I would ask the Prime Minister to take the House to the table and the page where those assumptions are laid out.",87
80,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition, in his question, referred to ‘dubious assumptions'. Can I just say that the most dubious assumption being advanced by those opposite is that this country's deficit and debt strategy is not consistent with a responsible return to budget surplus. The government has provided five years of sets of forecasts and projections for the future; our predecessors provided four. The government's strategy to return the budget to surplus is outlined in the budget papers. We stand by the strategy. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Prime Minister should apologise for misleading the House. He has conceded that his answer",87

82,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister provide an update on the Australian government's Nation Building for Recovery Budget rollout?,87
83,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government's strategy is Nation Building for Recovery. The government's strategy is to build the economy up; the opposition's strategy is to talk the economy down. That is it in a nutshell. Those opposite are happy to talk the economy down, to tear the economy down, because they have concluded that it might actually boost their political prospects. That is what it is all about. Our strategy is clear. Nation Building for Recovery will support jobs, businesses, apprenticeships and training for today by investing in the nation-building infrastructure we need for tomorrow-nation-building infrastructure which a large slab of those opposite have a particular interest in supporting in their electorates and distancing themselves from here in Canberra. Seventy per cent of the government's nation-building and economic stimulus plan has been targeted towards infrastructure. That means $60 billion is being invested in infrastructure like rail, roads, ports, broadband, solar energy and the biggest school modernisation program Australia has ever seen. The budget alone invests $22 billion in further infrastructure stimulus. The consequence for jobs is that we will support more than 200,000 jobs that would otherwise be destroyed by the global economic recession-200,000 people whom those opposite, we assume, would prefer to have thrown onto the unemployment queue. Many Australians will be witnessing construction rolled out at their schools across the nation, across our towns and communities, as we speak. I would ask the House to reflect on this number: 35,000 jobs will be rolled out across the country under our Nation Building for Recovery program. I would like to take the opportunity to report to the House that construction is already well underway. For the benefit of the parliament, I can table an updated list of projects which have been approved for construction. I can table, for example-and I will-a folder of projects already approved under round 1 of the Australian School Pride Program. We have projects here from the",87

In doing so, I refer to a ruling of the Speaker back on 15 June 2006: Whilst a member with the call may make a passing reference to a displayed object or article, members without the call may not do so and will be dealt with accordingly. That is the only thing that I am attempting to apply with regard to those that are displaying signs. The Prime Minister has the call.",88

What absolute rancid hypocrisy! I also table a folder of major rail, road and boom gates and black spots projects across Australia. The Leader of the National Party guffaws, as is his custom. I would have thought that any Nat standing up in this parliament and thinking about the importance of boom gate repair across Australia would, if they were worth their salt, stand up for the good folk of the bush and say that we need this extra investment in boom gates and black spots to enhance security. We have got projects from the western Victoria track upgrade to the upgrade of the Northern Expressway in South Australia. I also table a folder of Australian social and defence housing projects. These are good reading, too. I would draw these to the attention of the member for Herbert, because these are important projects for our men and women in uniform.

116,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So, in sum, what we have in these folders of projects which are currently underway as part of the government's Nation Building for Recovery program is a large number of investment projects, part of the 35,000 projects being rolled out across the country. Let it be stated formally on the record that the Liberals and Nationals have voted against 20,000 social housing projects, 11,000 projects in primary schools, 802 defence housing projects-Member for Herbert, hang your head in shame-17 major rail projects, 14 major road projects, 500 black spots projects, 250 boom gate projects-National Party, hang your collective head in shame-and 3,168 community infrastructure projects. The one exception, of course, is if we subtract those projects within the schools area for the member for Canning, because he stood up today and said that he in fact meant to vote with the government when this was actually put through. What we have here is the most appalling display of Liberal Party hypocrisy, underlined yesterday by the minister for infrastructure standing in this place, showing one Liberal member after another and one National member after another attending supportively the launch of local investment projects in local schools right around the country, and piously and hypocritically claiming that they do not support the investment in these projects whatsoever. Is it any wonder that the people of Australia do not believe what those opposite stand for? We stand for building the Australian economy up; you stand for tearing has he got the Australian economy down. Budget",90

I refer to the fact that the Rudd government is now the biggestspending government in modern Australian history, with government spending at around 29 per cent of GDP. I refer to the fact that the Rudd government has now the biggest net debt since World War II, and I refer to the fact the Rudd government is putting it all on the nation's credit card, the Ruddcard-$315 billion of debt. I ask the Treasurer: where exactly in the budget papers are the justifications for the Prime Minister's claim that he is going to pay off the nation's credit card by 2022?

121,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What he did just then was outline the scare campaign the Liberal Party wants to run. It is actually not about the projections. It is not about the forecasts. It is about a Liberal Party scare campaign. This government has done the responsible thing. We have had a revenue collapse of $210 billion, which they want to pretend has not occurred. The member for Higgins was in the House last night pretending that the mining boom did not give us a revenue surgetelling everybody how brilliant he was and in the next breath pretending that we had not had a revenue collapse from the collapse of the mining boom. Well, of course we have, and the consequence of that is that we have had to borrow responsibly to support jobs. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. Where in statement 2 does it go to 2022?",91

123,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have outlined in unprecedented detail in the budget papers our medium-term fiscal policy, in a way which those opposite have never done. They claimed to be serious about an Intergenerational report and then did nothing about it. So the task falls to us. The task falls to the Labor Party, in the teeth of the global recession, to protect our people by responsible borrowing, by investing in modernising our schools and by investing in infrastructure to support jobs and businesses in our community. What those opposite are so embarrassed about is that, if we take the proposition put by the shadow Treasurer here today to its logical conclusion, what they stand for is is all higher unemployment and more business failures-because all of these projects that are creating jobs and supporting businesses in our community would not be happening right now.

125,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Will the minister outline the importance of the government's investment in nation building for future growth and why the government has set out long-term projections for key budget indicators? What is the government's response to claims that its budget projections are insufficiently rigorous and realistic?,92
126,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question, and I note there are 51 projects, worth over $21 million, scheduled in his electorate. Forty-five of those projects relate to schools. I note also that members of the opposition voted against all of these projects when they came into the parliament. The government is committed to nation building for recovery through building infrastructure throughout Australia, whereas the opposition is committed to opposing this. I note that there have been a number of criticisms of projections and figures in the budget, from a variety of sources but most particularly from the member for North Sydney. Yesterday the government, sadly, was not allowed to describe the member for North Sydney as ‘sloppy' in his approach. It is a pity, because that is about the kindest adjective I can think of to describe his performance. Other words like ‘inaccurate', ‘innumerate' and ‘incoherent' might come to mind, because yesterday the member for North Sydney asserted in the parliament that, in order to return the Commonwealth balance sheet to a debt-free position in the time frame projected by the budget, it would be necessary to run surpluses of two per cent of GDP or more for a period of eight years. Unfortunately, he appears to have done this calculation on the back of an envelope on the spur of the moment, and he has missed one very salient point. He appears to have taken the peak number of net debt, divided it by the figure of eight-for the period of eight years-and come up with $25 billion, which of course is roughly two per cent of GDP now. But it will not be two per cent of GDP in 10 years time. Guess what, Member for North Sydney: GDP grows over time-an extraordinary revelation for a would be Treasurer!",92

128,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,92
129,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Unfortunately, there is, for the member for North Sydney, a very simple explanation as to why the figures in the the budget papers show surpluses over the period he is referring to-figures like one per cent of GDP, 1.4 per cent of GDP, 1.6 per cent of GDP or whatever the figure may be-and that is that the figure against which the percentage will be calculated in due course will not be GDP for the year 2009-10; it will be GDP for the year 2019-20. This is not the first occasion that the member for North Sydney has been decidedly sloppy with his attention to detail and figures. We note immediately that in the response to the budget he claimed that two-thirds of the peak in net debt that the government is projecting in the budget was covered by new spending. Unfortunately, he neglected to mention a very important fact that he did not include all of the government's savings measures in his calculations. And, naturally, he made no reference to the point that the total amount of net debt projected was actually lower than the total amount of revenue loss projected over the same period as a result of the global recession. Finally, I would like to quote something that the member for North Sydney said at the National Press Club last week: When Lindsay promised to bring together all the IT departments under a review and said there was going to be great savings out of consolidation, I notice, and I might be wrong, that in the budget papers there was not one dollar of savings. Out of all that IT bluster and bluff, there was not one dollar of savings. Well, I have bad news for you, Member for North Sydney: you are wrong-you are very wrong. On page 50 of the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers published in February-which, if you were a decent shadow Treasurer, you would be familiar with-there is in fact a set of figures that indicate that there will be savings of over $400 million over four years from the IT savings that the member for North Sydney referred to. If a member of the opposition aspires to be the Treasurer of the nation, they have to do their homework. Being Treasurer is more than just breakfast TV shows and one-liners. It involves detail, it involves rigour and it involves hard work. We have gone from having a shadow Treasurer who copies her work from others to having one who makes things up! That is the standard of performance you get from the Liberal Party in economic debate in this country. If you cannot get your facts right in opposition, you are not fit to run the nation's finances.",92
130,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Chief Government Whip on a point of order?  tion time you gave advice to members about props. Is it appropriate for advisers to be displaying props or having props on their desks?,93
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will keep my eye on that.,93
132,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by his and the Treasurer's claim that all the economic growth figures, inflation rates, budget surpluses and other financial assumptions through to 2022 are sufficient to support his dubious claim that all of his debt will be paid off in 2022 and are in fact set out in the budget papers?",93
133,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In this dishonest scare campaign on deficit and debt-which is what it is; it is all about talking the economy down; it is not about building the economy up-the core element of hypocrisy is that the member just on his feet before, the member for North Sydney, has endorsed every dollar of the government's deficit and debt strategy. He went out the day after the budget came down and said they would deliver a deficit and debt of $25 billion less than the government's.  of order. The point of order is on relevance. The Prime Minister was asked a very specific question: whether he stood by the claim of himself and his Treasurer. We ask him to answer that specific question.",93
134,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,93
135,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was the member for Sturt, the economic genius opposite, who said that the Asian financial crisis was just as bad as the current global economic recession. In fact, I think he may have said the Asian financial crisis was worse than the current global economic recession. I think the member for Sturt's credibility on this question is non-existent. This is a debt and deficit scare campaign Squiggle! Budget The SPEAKER-Order! The member for Sturt will withdraw. ",93
136,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Sturt will withdraw.  Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Further to the request you have just put to the member for Sturt, and which he has very graciously complied with, I put it to you that under the standing orders referring to a member as Mr Squiggle is not disorderly-not disorderly at all!",93
137,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Warringah will resume his seat. I say to the member for Warringah that I am not dissuaded from my actions by his argument, but I indicate to the member for Sturt that it is a really surprising set of behaviours, to come into the chamber and within five minutes think that he can prattle on without having the call. As with the display of posters and other things, when people do not have the call they have to expect that when notice is taken of their behaviour it will be dealt with.",94
138,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Many of us on this side of the House would always stand up for the integrity of Miss Pat and the entire crew out there on Mr Squiggle. I am sure the member for Sturt has been a keen student of the program over the years. I ask those opposite why the member for Sturt jumps to his feet every time. I mention the fact that the member for North Sydney has an identical debt and deficit strategy to that of the government. They do not want to hear it-that is what it is all about. It actually goes to the total heart of the hypocrisy of the opposition's campaign on debt and deficit. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders,94
139,Mr TURNBULL,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional ders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving immediately-That this House censures the Prime Minister and Treasurer for: (1) misleading the House and for refusing to come clean with the Australian people about how they are going to repay the Government's massive debt; and (2) claiming that the 2009-10 Budget papers contain all data on economic growth, inflation rates, budget surpluses and financial assumptions through to 2022 that would support the Prime Minister's dubious claim that his Government's national debt will be paid off by that date. We have an issue not just of financial integrity but of character. We have a Prime Minister and a Treasurer that have told this House that all the financial assumptions to justify their claim that $315 billion of debt will be paid off by 2022 are in the budget papers. They know they are not-they simply are not there. There are all those forecasts and estimates and projections through to 2012-13. The budget papers do not contain the financial and economic projections through to 2022. That is why, in good faith, we ask the Prime Minister to provide those assumptions: because he is saying to the Australian people that he is going to fling onto the shoulders of our children and their children debt unprecedented in our history-debt that has been incurred in large measure to enable the government to send out cheques to millions of Australians. This is debt that has been incurred while revenues were falling to enable the government to engage in cash splashes. Australians right around the country are saying to themselves, ‘What is the government doing, putting us further and further into debt and with so little to show for it?' This matter of debt is a matter of vital public interest. For years, the coalition in government laboured hard to pay off the debt that the Australian Labor Party left us withor- $96 billion. It took us a decade to pay that off, so naturally we are entitled to ask: how long will it take to pay off $315 billion of gross debt-$203 billion, they assert, in net debt? Any claim that a government makes to be able to deliver a financial result has to be backed up by some evidence and assumptions. What are their assumptions about revenues, about economic growth, about inflation and about employment? All of these factors are perfectly relevant and perfectly necessary to enable the Australian people to form a view as to whether this debt-this so called temporary debt-will be the work of 13 years to pay off or the work of 33 years or more to pay off. How can we trust the government? If the government is not prepared to provide the assumptions, how can anyone believe its claims that it will pay this debt by 2022? We would assume that the government has all those assumptions at their fingertips. We would assume that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer would not make this claim and would not give this reassurance to the Australian people without having all of that financial information at their fingertips. So it is perfectly reasonable for the opposition to ask the government-not once but three times-to provide that information here in question time. And what were we told? ‘Oh, it's all in the budget papers.' Those were the Treasurer's own words. He said, ‘All of those are in the budget papers.' But they are not in the budget papers. We asked him to nominate the page and he just gave us a few minutes of abusing the opposition. This is not good enough. This Prime Minister and this Treasurer have deliberately misled the House. They have stated that vital and relevant financial information necessary for any Australian to form a view about whether this debt can or will be repaid by 2022 is set out in the budget papers, but most plainly it is not. Either they made a reckless claim that had no basis in fact, in which case they should acknowledge that and apologise to this House, or they have made that claim based on financial assumptions and economic projections, in which case they should make those projections public. They are the ones who have claimed that $315 billion of debt will be paid off by 2022. They are the ones who have given an assurance that it will be paid off in 13 years. They are the ones who have sought to reassure Australians who are anxious about the heavy burden of debt that they can see being thrown onto the shoulders of their children. It is they who have made that claim, it is we who have asked them to provide the evidence for us and it is the govoff ernment that has misled the House by saying that the evidence is to be found in the budget papers, where it is not. This is not the first time we have seen the financial recklessness of this government. We need only go back to the extraordinarily reckless claims made by this government about the so-called National Broadband Network. It had a cost of $43 billion-so they claimed-and there was no business plan and no financial analysis. The Prime Minister said on The 7.30 Report that it was an outstanding commercial investment. Like a snake oil salesman he called out for mums and dads to invest in it. Where is the financial analysis for that? None is to be found. This is the problem with this government. They are given to recklessness in spending and recklessness in making claims about economic and financial matters vital to the future of our children. We have seen confirmed today in the Senate estimates that the $43 billion proposed to be spent on the National Broadband Network will, apart from $2.4 billion of it, all have to be borrowed, and not a cent of it-not one cent-is included in that $315 billion debt figure. So the $315 billion does not include anything for broadband and it does not include anything for Ruddbank and yet the government claims that it will be paid off in 2022. This is a fundamental question about the government's integrity. If the Prime Minister and the Treasurer want the Australian people to believe them when they say that this debt can and will be repaid, all they have to doand they can do it right now-is provide the figures on which they base their claim. Or is this like the reckless claim about broadband? The day after the Prime Minister said that it was commercially viable and mums and dads should invest in it, his Treasurer was asked, ‘How many people will subscribe?' He said, ‘Oh, I don't know that.' He was then asked, ‘What will they be asked to pay?' He did not know that either. In other words they knew nothing about it. They had plucked a figure out of the air and thrown it out there as a distraction. I fear that this is precisely they have done with their claim about the repayment of debt. The government can claim that it is borrowing money to invest in infrastructure, it can claim that it is investing money in schools, it can argue the case for its cash splashes and it can say that that is a fiscal stimulus. There will be arguments for and against the merit of those investments and payments. But the one thing we know for sure is that every dollar of debt is a fiscal drag. Every single dollar of debt we fling onto the shoulders of our children will make it harder for them to enjoy a lifestyle and a standard of living equal to or better than that which we have enjoyed, because every dollar of debt will have to be paid for. It will have to have interest paid and principal repaid and all of that will mean higher taxes and higher interest rates in the future. That is why Australians are so anxious about this debt. That is why they are concerned that each and every Australian man, woman and child is being loaded up with $10,000 of debt-$10,000 of debt raised by a government that 18 months ago had no debt at all and had cash in the bank. That is the level of the recklessness. Yet when we ask the government for the basic financial facts on which they base their claim that the debt will be repaid they will not provide it, and then they mislead this House and the nation by claiming those figures are in the budget papers when they know full well they are not. This Prime Minister and this Treasurer have not simply thrown an unsustainable level of debt on the shoulders of our children but insulted us. They have insulted our children and the children who will come after them, because they have said, ‘We are going to raise this debt and we have no idea how it will be repaid.' More importantly, they do what not care. They neither know nor care about the damage they are wreaking on this nation. (Time expired)",94
140,Mr HOCKEY,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,"I second the motion. The Prime Minister expects us to believe that he is a fiscal conservative. Yet the Prime Minister took us into the deepest deficit since World War 2. The Prime Minister expects us to believe, and the Australian people to believe, that he can control debt. Yet he has delivered the biggest debt for the Australian government since World War II. The Prime Minister expects us to believe that he is fiscally prudent, yet so much of what he is spending is going on the nation's credit card. The Prime Minister expects us to believe, and the Australian people to believe, that he has a plan to get Australia out of the Rudd government debt, the debt that was accrued in just one budget. He expects us to believe a figure that never appeared before on a date that never appeared before. With a sense of panic the Prime Minister plucked out of the air 2022, 13 years hence, for the repayment of the Rudd government debt. It is not in the budget papers, but with a sense of panic he pulled it out of the air. Then, when we started to ask questions about the economic assumptions, about the justification for that so-called 13year plan-longer than anything the Soviet Union can be proud of-he expected us to take him at his word. Today the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, with a rhinoceros hide, came into this place and said, ‘It's all in the budget papers.' We asked them specifically: ‘Exactly where in the budget papers? Point out the data. Point out the assumptions about economic growth. Point out the assumptions about inflation. Point out all of the detail gives any credibility at all to the claim by the Prime Minister that he is going to pay off the debt in 13 years.' And there is silence. If there is not silence, they try and have what we call in this business ‘weapons of mass distraction'. The Prime Minister has stood here for a number of days and held up photos. It is like Kevin's world tour. Normally we get the Eiffel Tower, normally we get the Vatican, normally we get each and every thing. On this occasion we have Handy Manny going like Bob the Builder-mixing all the children's metaphors-around the nation pretending to build. He is not telling the Australian people it is all borrowed money. He is forgetting that fact, a fact that is fundamental to the economic destiny of our nation. At a time when countries-not just companies, but countries-are struggling to raise money to pay their day-today bills this Prime Minister is running around the country protesting about the fact that the opposition did not support him on the biggest spending package in memory. It is $43 billion, and yet he decries us for asking how this is going to be paid for. Isn't there a contradiction there? The Prime Minister says, day after day, question after question, that we opposed all these initiatives, and yet he has the hide to claim that there would be no difference in the debt between the coalition and the Labor Party. What a hide! To come into this place, the House of Representatives, the people's House, and to simply lie to the Australian people about the justification for his claim that the debt of the nation will be repaid by 2022 means that the spin of the Prime Minister and the incompetence of the Treasurer are as great as the debt, the legacy that they are leaving the Australian people. We are asking basic questions about the numbers. If we are wrong about those numbers, tell us where we are wrong. Tell us how we are wrong. Give that us the numbers. Tell us exactly what the assumptions are that lead you to claim that you are going to pay off the debt. There is one message out of this: the Rudd government stands for the biggest debt the Australian people have had since World War II. The Rudd government stands for a failure in fiscal policy. The Rudd government stands for incompetence. The Rudd government stands for spin. The Rudd government is not going to deliver the Australian people any hope that they can get us out of the financial mess that they have made far worse. Mr Stephen Smith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You might want to draw to the attention of the member of North Sydney that it is not a censure motion; it is a suspension motion. And he might want to be careful about the assertions he makes about the telling of truths.",96
141,Mr SWAN,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,"This is a classic case of overreach from a dying leader. He never gets fired up about jobs for Australians. He only gets fired up about one thing: his own job. Of course we have all the huffing and puffing from the shadow Treasurer up there trying to tell all of his colleagues how he is better qualified than the Leader of the Opposition. We had a defining moment in Australian politics a couple of weeks ago. The Leader of the Opposition went to the Press Club the week before the budget and he said, ‘Labor's stimulus packages have not created one job.' That is what he said. All the evidence has been presented in this chamber over the past few days of jobs that are being supported by this government. The core of our budget is to support jobs. If it was not for our budget, many more people would over time become unemployed. What they resent in the budget forecasts, and what they resent in the budget projections, is that we are doing everything within our power to support employment in the Australian community. So when we talk about the school modernisation program, when we talk about nation building for recovery, when we talk about roads, rails and ports, we are talking about jobs. We are talknet ing about Australian jobs for Australian families. There is one thing about the Labor Party: when times are tough, we look after families and we look after our community. Those opposite are so out of touch, so unable to comprehend the nature of the economic challenge facing this nation, that they do understand the need for stimulus. The Leader of the Opposition does not walk in the same shopping aisles as average Australians, and neither do many on that front bench. That is why they do not support economic stimulus. We support employment in the Australian community. We were prepared to do something about the age pension. We stand up for our principles. We must protect our people, and we are protecting our people in the teeth of this savage global recession by responsibly putting in place economic stimulus. And who opposes that? The Liberal and National parties, who famously came into this House and said their approach is to sit and to wait and to see-to see many more people, hundreds of thousands of people, relegated to the unemployment queues. That is what this debate is about, because they will not admit that the responsible thing to do right now is to invest in the future and to support jobs in our community, and that is what we are doing. And we are borrowing responsibly and we are going to pay down the debt over time responsibly. We are doing all of those things. We have had a discussion about what is or is not in the budget papers. These budget papers have been the most comprehensive that have been produced in this parliamentmuch more comprehensive than anything that has been produced by those opposite and certainly much more comprehensive than anything that was produced by the member for Higgins. We have got estimates for two years-2009-10 and 2010-11. We have got projections for 2011-12. We have got medium-term projections for the budget and for debt right through to 2019-20. When has that ever happened before? Never. And they have got the hide to come into this House and pretend that we have not been open and transparent. You could not be more open and you could not be more transparent than we have been in these budget papers. It is not not our fault that the shadow Treasurer cannot read them. It is just not our fault. He might want to blame us for his inability to actually read the budget papers-and he could not do it in the House here yesterday when he made the preposterous claim that we needed surpluses of two per cent of GDP for eight years. It was disproved by the very graph that he was holding up in the House. He got away with it today but it will not be forgotten, because what it demonstrates is the absolute incompetence of the shadow Treasurer. Mr Hockey-Tell us what the inflation figure is, Wayne.",97
142,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,Order! The member for North Sydney was heard in silence.,98
143,Mr SWAN,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,He needs to go through the various budget statements which do contain the assumptions all the way through them. Mr Hockey-Where?,99
144,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,"Order! Member for North Sydney, this is not a time for asking questions, and you were heard in silence.",99
145,Mr SWAN,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,"If he cannot read them he should go and hire somebody who can help him. What this government has been about is investing in the future. What we have been talking about through this budget is nation building for recovery to support employment, nation building to make sure that our people are protected from the ravages of this global recession. That is what the budget is all about. That is why, in this budget, we have the very strong support of the business community. We have the strong support of the business community for economic stimulus because they understand that when the world imposes such a sharp contraction in global demand on an economy such as this, the only force in society that can move into protect people, to protect families and to tect businesses is the national government. Those opposite have got the hide to come in here and complain about a net debt figure of 3.7 per cent in 2019-20. That is a remarkably low figure. They have the hide to ignore the fact that when they left government they had $58 billion worth of securities on issue anyway. We have not heard anything about that form of debt, and that was necessary debt and we supported that debt. And there is a role for debt in the circumstances we are in at the moment, because we nation build. What we do is invest in the future. We expand our capacity. There have been all of these questions about inflation. What our nation building for recovery is all about is expanding the productive capacity of this economy to maximise the opportunities that surely will come when global growth returns. That is what investment in road and rail and port is all about and, of course, what our investment in education is all about, from primary school to secondary school and higher education. It is all about investing in the future. It is absolutely sensible to borrow to do some of those things and, as growth returns, bring the budget back to surplus and pay down the debt. That is the responsible course of action that we have embarked upon. In any other parliament in the world there would be oppositions supporting these logical, sane propositions from the government. But it is a measure of how feral those opposite have become, how they are unable to handle the role of opposition and how embittered they have become by their election defeat that they cannot come into this House and support Australian families and Australian businesses in their hour of need. They really should be condemned for this behaviour. It is so opportunistic. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition prodoes know better, but he is now so consumed with the threat from the shadow Treasurer on the one hand and the member for Higgins on the other, who are conducting this foot race behind him every day, that he is getting involved in some of the most desperate, irresponsible political tactics I have ever seen in this House. How you could come in here and claim it is irresponsible to pay down net debt to 3.7 per cent is entirely beyond me. Other nations around the world-advanced economies-are having net debt levels of 80 per cent. It is a small price to pay to protect our people, to invest in the future, to look after families and to make sure that we chart a course through a global recession, protecting our people to the maximum possible extent, which brings me back to where I began. The Leader of the Opposition stood at the National Press Club and said, ‘Stimulus has not created one single job,' despite all of the evidence-retail sales, housing, consumer confidence. All of these things are higher in Australia than they are anywhere else in the world, because the Australian government had the courage to face up to its responsibilities, to borrow to put in place phase 1 of economic stimulus, phase 2 of economic stimulus and phase 3 of economic stimulus. Phase 3 of economic stimulus was the budget-nation building for recovery. It was the investment in road, rail and port that those opposite would not make when it was raining gold bars during the mining boom. They could not make those decisions then. We have taken the responsible decision to invest in the future to protect our people, which is why we reject entirely this motion from those opposite, because there is not a shred of economic credibility in their behaviour and absolutely nothing to their baseless assertions about our projections and our forecasts. We stand by them because they have been prepared by some of the most professional people, respected here and around the world, in our Treasury. We stand by them because what we have the courage to do is to stand up for Australia in the middle of the global recession. It is incredible that the only people in the community who are opposing what we are doing are the Liberal and National parties in this parliament, who do not have the sense to understand the nature of the challenge or the courage to develop an alternative policy framework. This government has done it. We are absolutely proud of it. We have a course set to pay down debt and get back to surplus and we will pursue that.

146,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,AUNG SAN SUU KYI,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker: I would like to briefly report to the House on the circumstances surrounding Aung San Suu Kyi. Today is the anniversary of her most recent period of detention. She has been detained by Burma's military regime for 13 of the last 19 years. Yesterday Aung San Suu Kyi was served with a notice from the military regime indicating to her that her current period of detenSan tion would end, effective today. Whilst, on the one hand, we welcome that, we are of course deeply suspicious that the device the regime is currently using is what we regard as spurious charges against Aung San Suu Kyi. Her trial will recommence today. I spoke to our ambassador in Rangoon last night, who was one of the diplomats present in the court yesterday. I am pleased to advise the House that our ambassador advises that Aung San Suu Kyi is in good health and in good spirits and clearly conducting herself with dignity and civility in very difficult circumstances. We hope that these spurious charges are not taken any further, but our very grave concern is that this will be used as a device for her further imprisonment or detention and we again, as we have done in recent days and weeks and consistently over the years, call for her immediate and unconditional release. I make the point that we welcome very much the very strong remarks that have come from our ASEAN partners. I spoke in recent days to the Secretary-General of ASEAN, Dr Surin Pitsuwan, and I have spoken to my Thai counterpart, Foreign Minister Kasit. Thailand is of course chairing ASEAN at the moment. We welcome very much the strong show of support by ASEAN and its constituent members for Aung San Suu Kyi and her immediate and unconditional release.",101
147,Ms JULIE BISHOP,AUNG SAN SUU KYI,"On indulgence: it was in July 1989 that Aung San Suu Kyi was first placed under house arrest by the Burmese junta that has ruled Burma since 1962. In July 1989, Burma was leading up to elections that were in fact held the following year. The party that Aung San Suu Kyi was leading, the National League for Democracy, had gained widespread support throughout Burma, and it is widely believed that the detention of Aung Suu Kyi in July 1989 was to thwart their aspirations to win seats in the forthcoming election. In fact, in 1990 the National League for Democracy won 82 per cent of the popular vote, yet their leader of course was still under house arrest. She went on to be awarded the Nobel prize for what was described at the time as one of the loneliest and most courageous battles for freedom and democracy the world had ever seen. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated, over the past 19 years Aung San Suu Kyi has been held in detention, under house arrest, at her home in Rangoon for 13 of them. The most recent period of detention has been for six years, and it is a rather cruel irony that the Burmese regime would serve Aung San Suu Kyi with a notice stating that her current period of detention expires on 27 May when she is in fact in detention on what we would describe as trumped-up charges that are being heard in a sham trial designed to ensure that they can extend the period of detention so that Aung San Suu Kyi does not take part in the next elections, which are scheduled for 2010. The National League for Democracy still has widespread support. Aung San Suu Kyi has extraordinary support among the people of Burma. When I visited her in 1995, I noticed that there were hundreds of people gathered outside her home waiting to catch a glimpse of her. I would imagine that today hundreds if not thousands of people in Burma would still be gathered around her home in Rangoon to show support. The coalition joins with the government and other countries in condemning the Burmese regime for these acts which have detained and isolated Aung San Suu Kyi over the past two decades. In particular, we support the statements of President Obama that this is a sham trial and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi. The coalition stands with the government on this issue. We urge other countries in the region, including China and India, who have bilateral relations with Burma, to use whatever pressure they can bring to bear on the Burmese regime to secure the immediate and unconditional release of freedom and democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi.

168,Mr BOWEN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (3.34 pm)-by leave-I take this opportunity to update the House on the government's policy objective of promoting Australia as a financial services hub. The government has long had the policy of identifying artificial barriers to the competitiveness of the Australian financial services sector and eliminating these barriers. The Australian financial services sector is well developed and competitive but, as I have said in the past, the robustness of the Australian financial services sector has not translated into exports. While we have the fourth largest pool of funds under management in the world and a very good funds management capacity, we have not attracted significant amounts of overseas money to be invested or managed in Australia. Accordingly, the government made a commitment when in opposition to reduce the withholding tax on the distribution to nonresidents by Australian and managed funds. This was quite a controversial announcement at the time. It was fervently resisted by the previous government. However, on 1 July 2009 the relevant withholding tax rate will go to 15 per cent and on 1 July 2010 it will go to 7.5 per cent, one of the lowest rates in the world. This is an example of the government identifying artificial barriers to the competitiveness of our funds management industry and financial services sector more generally and eliminating them. We very much recognise that there is more to be done. Last July the government convened a financial services hub summit in Sydney with industry regulators and state governments to assist in further identifying competitive barriers and outline a path for going forward. The summit was clear in its recommendation that we need a permanent body to close the ring between the government and the sector and to promote Australia as a financial services hub. Accordingly, on 26 September last year I announced the establishment of the Australian Financial Centre Forum to develop a coherent framework to advance the Australian financial services sector's international competitiveness and position Australia as a leading financial services centre. I announced the appointment of Mr Mark Johnson, a retired deputy chairman of Macquarie Bank, as chairman of the forum and also the establishment of a panel of experts and an industry reference group, all supported by the Treasury secretariat. The structure of the forum reflects the fact that it is a joint government-industry initiative aimed at ensuring that the comparative strengths of the Australian financial services sector are recognised and utilised and that the sector is in a position to take full advantage of the opportunities available to it. Today I report to parliament progress made by this forum since its establishment. The first point to make is that the forum was born in the midst of a global crisis which deteriorated markedly shortly after the announcement of the initiative. The Australian financial services sector has certainly not been immune from this crisis but the sector has, comparatively, fared better than most. This is due in no short measure to the quality of our regulatory system and of the people who administer it. It also reflects well on the quality and risk management skills of corporate Australia. Nevertheless, this is a tough time for the Australian economy. Out of this adversity will arise opportunities. It is in anticipation of those opportunities that the government remains committed to the Australian Financial Centre Forum initiative. The development of a blueprint for positioning Australia as a leading financial centre as the world emerges from the current crisis is regarded as a priority by the government. Since its establishment the forum's panel of experts and reference group have met regularly and have called for and received two rounds of submissions from industry. Forum representatives have also met personally with many stakeholders in the sector. I have been kept up to date with the feedback from industry and already this feedback, along with the input from other government initiatives, has led to government actions. On 12 May, after receiving the recommendations of the Board of Tax and the Australian Financial Centre Forum, I announced a major modernisation of the attribution rules and the deemed capital account treatment for capital gains and losses made on disposal of investment assets by managed investment trusts subject to appropriate integrity rules. Australia's attribution rules, the controlled foreign company, or CFC, rules and the foreign investment fund, or FIF, rules, the transThese fer of trust rules and the deemed present entiform tlement rules, are notoriously complex. Under the government's announced changes to the attribution rules, the CFC provisions will be retained as the primary set of rules designed to counter tax deferral arrangements. The CFC provisions will be rewritten in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The FIF provisions will be repealed and replaced by a specific, narrowly defined anti-avoidance rule that applies to offshore accumulation or rollup funds. The deemed present entitlement rules will be repealed. The transfer of trust rules will be retained with amendments to enhance their effectiveness and improve their integrity. These reforms will dramatically reduce compliance costs for managed funds and other businesses, saving business up to $80 million each year. The reforms are fiscally responsible and will help Australian companies compete in global markets at minimal revenue cost while delivering major compliance cost benefits. Allowing for deemed capital account treatment for managed investment trusts will provide more certainty, dramatically reduce complexity and compliance costs for effective businesses and ensure Australia's tax regime is competitive in attracting foreign funds. There remain a number of implementation details that need to be considered with this measure and which will be canvassed in a Treasury consultation paper to be released shortly. As I said in announcing them, these measures form a key part of the Rudd government's election commitment to make Australia a funds management hub in the Asia Pacific region and will help boost financial services exports. The changes have been welcomed by industry. The Deputy Chief Executive of the Investment and Financial Services Association, Mr John O'Shaughnessy, for example, commented: budget measures will provide a strong platfor the Australian managed funds industry to continue to grow domestically and increase its share of its exports to the region. The government continues to examine other possible areas for reform identified by the Australian Financial Centre Forum and looks forward to receiving its further reports later in the year. Many of the issues raised by the industry through the forum are tax related. In particular, representations have been made on the subject of interest withholding tax. These submissions go to tax on interest paid on borrowings by Australian branches and subsidiaries of foreign financial institutions to their parent companies and on interest paid by Australian banks in respect of foreign sourced deposits. Another interbank funding issue that has been raised is that of the limit of deductibility of interest paid to foreign bank branch parents with reference to the London interbank offer rate. Industries place considerable importance on the issue of clarity in the tax system. The forum has received many representations suggesting that the lack of tax clarity and consistency in a number of areas is inhibiting the growth and development of the financial services sector. The forum has written to the Henry review outlining the nature of these concerns and they will be considered in the context of that review. A particular issue industry has raised is the tax treatment of income derived by foreign funds when they utilise the services of Australian fund managers. I have asked the Treasury to examine and provide advice on industry's proposal to introduce an investment manager exemption. Another taxation matter that has been raised in the context of the forum is the quesother tion of the GST on financial supplies. As I announced on 12 May, I have agreed to Treasury undertaking reviews of the GST margin scheme and the application of the GST to financial supplies. I have asked the Treasury to consult widely. These reviews are designed to simplify the operation of the legislation and reduce both compliance and administrative costs while retaining existing policy intent. To facilitate reviews, Treasury has prepared discussion papers and welcomes submissions. The discussion papers can be obtained from the Treasury website. Ease of market access within the Asia Pacific region and beyond for Australian financial services companies is a key dimension of the work of the forum. Within that context the potential development of a network of appropriate mutual recognition arrangements for the financial sector regulation area has been raised by the forum as a recommendation for priority treatment. As a result, I have raised this matter with the ister for Superannuation and Corporate Law and I know that he is actively pursuing the matter and, indeed, recently raised this issue on his visit to Singapore with the relevant officials there. A specific suggestion that has come out of these submissions to the forum is that of establishing a regulatory one-stop online gateway which streamlines and facilitates foreign entrants into the Australian market. This proposal, which would appear to have some merit, is being examined in more detail in the that context of the forum's ongoing work. An interesting matter that has been raised through the forum and elsewhere, notably through Austrade, DFAT and by my colleague the Minister for Trade, is that of Islamic finance. This has been highlighted as an area of emergent opportunity. Despite the global financial crisis in the Middle East and Islamic centres, there are funds to invest and a demand for Islamic finance products. Regulation in some jurisdictions can create an uneven playing field for these products due to their form. Those countries where Islamic finance products are easily facilitated will have a competitive advantage in attracting these funds. Many countries around the world including the United Kingdom and France are taking measures aimed at facilitating Islamic finance products. The Australian government is concerned to ensure that the Australian financial sector is not being left behind in this emerging field, and I am pleased to note that the Australian Financial Centre Forum held a round-table on Islamic finance and taxation issues at the Treasury offices in Canberra in March. This round-table was a start in identifying whether there are any regulatory impediments in relation to promoting Islamic finance products in Australia. I am pleased to announce that the AustraMinlian Financial Centre Forum website is online and I encourage members of the public to view the site where they can find details of submissions made to the forum and other information. The site can be accessed at www.treasury.gov.au/afcf. The government looks forward to receiving the forum's recommendation on a policy blueprint for promoting Australia as the leading financial services hub later this year. I will report back to parliament as appropriate on further progress made by the forum. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the forum chair, Mark Johnson, and all members of the panel of experts and the reference group for their hard work and intellectual input to this very important initiative. The government is confident that, as a result of the ongoing work and recommendations of the forum, what will emerge will be an even more open, well-regulated, competitive and innovative financial services sector that is able to take full advantage of the regional and global opportunities which are likely to come its way in the future. In the current environment, in which the financial services industry around the world has been battered from crisis to crisis, it would be easy to walk away from the promotion of Australia as a financial services hub-that would be the worse outcome. For several years to come, I suspect that the world's investors will be looking for a safe, stable home for investments. With the help of the Australian Financial Centre Forum, we will be well placed to make the most of this opportunity. Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Aston to speak for 11 minutes. Leave granted.",104
169,Mr BOWEN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional  speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 11 minutes. Question agreed to.  opposition welcomes this opportunity to reply to the minister's update on the government's policy objective of promoting Australia as a financial services hub. At this stage, I do not intend to respond in detail to the particular measures that the minister has touched on today-suffice it to say that these are matters the industry has also raised with me. I recognise that these are important objectives in ensuring that the domestic industry is in a strong and competitive position to export its capability and to continue to grow and generate high-skilled jobs in our country at a time when they are most needed. My concern today is not with what the Assistant Treasurer has spoken about but, rather, what he has not said. The Assistant Treasurer has today failed to say how, for example, attacking confidence in Australia's superannuation system is a good thing for Australia's ambition in the region, or how removing incentives for employees to access share schemes is going to attract and help retain talented individuals in the Australian financial services sector. The coalition's view is that we can no longer look at policy responses like these in isolation. These things are all interconnected-as the government discovered when it introduced an unlimited bank guarantee which overnight resulted in the freezing of $20 billion worth of mortgage funds. These are all policy decisions which impact upon Australia's attractiveness as a financial services hub in our region. The briskly constructed and poorly executed bank deposit guarantee continues to significantly distort the Australian financial system. The key questions surrounding the ordistortion caused by the guarantee remain unanswered and, indeed, unresolved. The originally unlimited guarantee cover, which is now capped at $1 million, has not been wound back despite calls from many key stakeholders that it be wound back to $100,000. Further, there remains no plan for the phasing out of the guarantee in three years time. This alone has caused more instability within the market and the region than would have otherwise occurred because of the financial crisis. The removal of the risk and return differential undermined formerly stable and reliable investments such as mortgage trusts and cash management trusts, resulting in the freezing of the funds of 300,000 Australians. These were cash management trusts and funds that people from the Asia-Pacific region were attracted to because they were offered here in Australia. Those 300,000 Australians were told by the Treasurer to ‘go to Centrelink'. Does the government intend to leave these distortions unresolved for the next three years? When does the government plan to restore confidence and stability to the marketplace? Another troubling aspect of the government's mismanagement of the financial services sector is their approach to short selling. Short selling is an important mechanism in the Australian Securities Exchange and exchanges across the Asia-Pacific region. Labor has dithered over the short tions and, to this day, the so-called urgent short selling bill remains impotent and vacuous. If ASIC had been provided with an appropriate disclosure regime which appropriately regulated short selling, the ban may have been lifted earlier and players not only in Australia but across the region could again have looked to Australia as an attractive financial services market. The government's indecisiveness has resulted in a proliferation of instability in the financial markets, and this has impacted on our attractiveness across the Asia-Pacific region. There is no disclosure regime because the government have not tabled the regulations. On this, however, the government would not agree-because they think that they have-but clearly such claims are contrary to the statements made by ASIC. Last week ASIC said that they looked forward-in other words, in the future-to the commencement of the government's permanent disclosure regime. On the same day, the SDIA said that what they would really like to see now is the detailed obligations in relation to short selling regulations, which are yet to be released by the government. So it seems that there is no consensus that there is a comprehensive disclosure regime. Again, this is having an impact upon Australia's attractiveness as a financial services hub in our region. What is lacking, of course, is certainty and stability. If this government is serious, it needs to consider all financial services policy actions in the context of its overall vision for the sector and for the region. This is the only way to capture and foster long-term investment in our financial services sector. In this regard, we are supportive of the establishment of the Australian Financial Centre Forum and, of course, its objectives. But clearly it does not go far enough, as the above policy selling regula- bungles highlight. I want to remind the House that it was the former coalition government that established Axis Australia in 1999 to position Australia as a global financial centre in the Asian time zone. Australia's role as a global financial services centre in the Asia-Pacific region is one that successive Australian governments have supported through various policy and promotional initiatives. Indeed, the financial services sector today generates some $81 billion in value, or 8.7 per cent of real growth, with an annual average growth rate of 4.3 per cent since 1991. This contribution to GDP is up from 6.5 per cent two decades ago, and its expansion has also aided growth in related sectors such as communications, property and business services, providing hundreds of thousands of jobs for Australian workers. Let us not forget that superannuation is a vital component of the Australian financial services industry-and confidence in that system is being eroded by this government. In the interests of short-term political expediency, the government has undermined efforts to provide self-sufficient retirement benefits for all Australians and to provide a stable and sustainable budget. This is an important point that again impacts on our attractiveness as a financial services sector. For more than 20 years successive governments have succeeded in encouraging Australians to take control over the planning of their future yet, over the course of one evening, Labor has systematically swept aside any sense Australians may have had of a secure future and instead left working families with uncertainty and a loss of confidence in the superannuation system. I believe that governments have an obligation to provide a stable and certain environment via which people can plan their future. Labor has instead brought on a crisis of confidence over compulsory super and is shaking the public belief that we should take responsibility as best we can to secure arrangements for our own future retirement needs. As a matter of fact the Prime Minister said, just 12 days before the last election, that there would be no change to the superannuation laws, not ‘one jot or one tittle'. And Senator Sherry, the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, said in April that Labor would maintain the cocontribution scheme. At this difficult time for savings and superannuation and for the whole of the Australian financial services sector, confidence in our laws is paramount for encouraging much needed stability. Uncertainty in superannuation and in other areas of financial services undermines this system's credibility and undermines the perceived safety of the Australian system. The government seems incapable of realising that continually changing the rules is not the best way to promote certainty and to attract inbound investment. This government would do well to remember that superannuation is the bedrock upon which the funds management industry and many others have developed and matured. It is time to restore confidence in the system and ensure that Australia continues to be seen as having world's best practice. In this regard, the coalition also has serious concerns with the government's approach to competition in the sector. Default fund monopolies are inconsistent with a vibrant and open financial services sector, yet the government tacitly approves the work of the AIRC with respect to the so-called modernising of awards. The more we restrict competition the less our market will be seen as an attractive one in which to do business and the less likely it is that offshore markets will open their doors to our Australian firms. At this time, with record debt and record budget deficits, we need government measures that will attract capital, not measures that will impede its flow. This is a very important consideration for us here in Australia, given our geographic location within the world. We have to make Australia an attractive destination for the flow of capital; otherwise people can send their money elsewhere. We are a long way from the rest of the world and unless we are an attractive destination for capital it will not flow to us. I believe it is time the government took a comprehensive approach to growing Australia's financial services sector and stopped giving with the one hand and taking away with the other. Allowing huge structural problems that impact on our financial services sectorsuch as the bungled bank deposit guarantee-to fester alongside inaction on short selling and the winding back on superannuation is, I believe, a sure-fire way to actually destroy and take away from Australia's reputation as a financial services centre. Creating a global financial services centre is all about providing certainty and stability. You have to ask the question: how can we attract foreign investment and position Australia as a leading financial market if the government continually undermines, in all of its policy initiatives, certainty and stability? How can you possibly achieve that when certainty and stability are constantly being undermined? That Australia should be a financial services centre is an important objective for the future of our country. We must consider this goal as a holistic concept. Political expediency by this government should not get in the way of us as a country achieving this goal, of us working towards truly making Australia the most attractive centre for financial services across the Asia-Pacific region. I urge the government to set aside its political strategy and to actually adopt an economic strategy so that Australia can achieve the position of being a leader in global financial services and, most importantly, be a leader in financial services in the Asia-Pacific region.

170,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received letters from the honourable member for Casey and the honourable member for Lyne proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46(d) I have selected the matter which, in my opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Casey, namely: The chaos and confusion resulting from the Government's bungled budget night announcement which has seen employee share schemes suspended across the country. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",110
171,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I commend you, Madam Deputy Speaker, on your choice. It has been two weeks of chaos and confusion since the budget-two weeks of utter debilitation for employee share ownership schemes across Australia. Two weeks ago, on budget night, the Assistant Treasurer made an announcement that snap-froze every employee share scheme around Australia, and for two weeks the government have ducked, weaved and done everything possible except take responsibility for the chaos they have caused. This debacle is a window into this Labor government through which we see many things. We see the true Labor Party hatred of workers having shares in the companies they work in. We see the lack of attention to detail and we see the ducking and the covering up whenever something goes wrong. This Assistant Treasurer presided first over Fuelwatch. Budget Then he presided over GroceryWatch. Now he is presiding over this employee share scheme fiasco. This Assistant Treasurer-the fool of Fuelwatch and the goose of GroceryWatch-is now the shocker of employee share ownership schemes. And for two weeks he has done nothing. On budget night the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer announced that they were ending deferral on tax for employee share ownership schemes and limiting the existing concession. Within two days it was obvious that this announcement had had a catastrophic effect right across the business world in Australia. By Thursday of budget week it was obvious to the Assistant Treasurershare plans frozen after tax changes. And, as day after day went by, the Assistant Treasurer stopped and did nothing. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Lindsay Tanner, said everyone participating in the share schemes was somehow rorting their tax. But in the budget announcement and in the budget papers themselves there was precious little detail. All that was announced was that the deferral was being abolished and the concession limited to $60,000 of income. The effect this announcement had, as I said, was the suspension of share schemes across many businesses. The effect was that those on every level of income had their share scheme suspended. The effect was, with suspended share schemes, no-one was getting access to employee shares. Knowing that this chaos had been caused, the reaction from ministers, up to the Prime Minister, was, first of all, to do nothing. Let's go through some of the exact advice the Assistant Treasurer got in the days following the budget. The Managing Director of Computershare, Geoff Price, said: All the share plans we operate are likely to be suspended until there's some clarity … He also said: Theythe governmentjust don't seem to get it … … … … How can the Government say they support share schemes when their proposed changes will tax the legitimate tax-qualifying plans out of existence? … … … The proposed changes simply render the vast majority of plans uneconomic … The Woolworths finance director echoed these concerns when he said: … the government hasn't thought through the changes to employee share ownership. It has effectively frozen employee share schemes. Many small and medium-sized businesses depend on equity ownership because they simply don't have the cash. In the face of this, the response was bluff and bluster, as we have seen so much with these ministers opposite. For two weeks we have had nothing but bluff and bluster. It is as if they are provided with their lines. It is almost like they are tape-recorded, like the tape is inserted into the minister like some sort of automated telephone answering service. We had the same thing from the finance minister and the Prime Minister in the week after budget week, with the headline: ‘PM stonewalls on employee shares'. We had day after day of chaos, and the government's response was to do absolutely nothing. It is amazing that the government and the minister opposite could make this announcement in the first place without seeing what damage would be done. This is the big question for the Assistant Treasurer: did the Assistant Treasurer intend to shut down share schemes across Australia? Was that the intention of the budget announcement-we know that has been the effect, but we do not know if it was the intention, because he has not said anything in the last two weeks-or was it simply a rolled gold stuff-up? They might have asked themselves why the deferral existed in the first place. That would be a reasonable question for an Assistant Treasurer to ask. The deferral exists so that, if you are on $50,000 and you are provided with some shares which you cannot touch for a number of years, you pay the tax when the shares are in a position where you can actually sell them or use them. Without a deferral, you would have to pay that tax upfront. That is the effect of the budget announcement. So the Assistant Treasurer's decision is now that workers on every level of income-and let's leave aside this class rhetoric the government resort to at every opportunity, whenever they are in troublehave no deferral, and the minute they are provided with shares in name that they cannot access for a number of years they are required to pay the tax upfront. You can just imagine it in the workplace: ‘We're issuing you with some shares that you can't touch for a number of years but you need to pay the tax now. I hope you're happy. Go down to the bank and get a loan to pay the tax.' Another question they might have asked is, ‘Why does no other country in the world do this?' That might have been a good question. Apart from, ‘Why does the deferral exist in the first place,' they could have asked, ‘Why don't other countries do this?' But these were questions that absolutely eluded the Assistant Treasurer-and the Treasurer, of course, who presided over this with him. It may well be the case that I am being terribly unfair to the Assistant Treasurer. I like consider all possibilities. It may well be that this was the Treasurer's decision and the Assistant Treasurer found out about it very late in the piece, after the budget papers were printed. He might say so in his response. It is quite possible that is the case, but we have not heard that. In two weeks we have seen companies right across Australia criticising this announcement. With chaos all around, with share schemes suspended all over the country, the government's response was to pretend it was not happening. Then, finally, after some in the union movement joined the chorus of complaint, pointing out that the changes were a disaster-when the Assistant Treasurer, the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the finance minister were the only four people living in this country who thought this was a good decision-they decided to start to consult. Their first instinct was to cover it up, to use class war rhetoric. Only after being dragged kicking and screaming did they finally decide to consult. So on Sunday afternoon we had an announcement from the Assistant Treasurer that there would be, in his words, a consultation which put everything on the table. There was some language at the start of his announcement saying that concerns had been raised but, when you read the announcement, it says everything is on the table. Then, on Monday morning, we had the Treasurer conceding on the AM program that mistakes had been made. Mistakes have been made by the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer. Share schemes across Australia are frozen. Those on the other side know this. Those on the backbench on the other side know this too. They know that this is wide ranging. They know that this affects every employee at every income level. They know that, if share schemes stay frozen, there will not be much to to tax. And they know, because they are hearing it from their union members, that this is an absolute disaster. What we are now seeing, two weeks after the budget, is a Uturn taking place in slow motion. There is still some way to go, but this U-turn is taking place in slow motion. The government have said it has tax avoidance concerns. Budget Paper No. 2, which outlines the measure in less than a page, at about five paragraphs, does not give any detail on those. As companies have said, if there is a problem with collection of tax, by all means deal with that. If the problem is that employees four and five years down the track are neglecting to pay tax, deal with that. Companies are also telling anyone who will listen that they happily provide all details of all employees to the tax office. Many companies have been doing that for some years. But, no, what we had was a decision by the government that there were some termites, and the solution was to bulldoze the entire house. That was the government's solution. And they did it on budget night. They knew about it the day after the budget. The Financial Review put it on its front page two days after the budget and had it on its front page for six of the next seven days-but, still, absolutely no response. As I said at the outset, this debacle is a window into the Labor government on so many levels. It exposes their lack of understanding and their economic incompetence. It exposes their lack of focus on the detail. exposes their salivating attitude to doing anything they can to trample on aspiration in Australia without thinking about the consequences. And the very people they have hurt the most are the people least able to pay tax upfront. Hello! They are low-income earners. They are the least able to pay tax upfront. You do not have to listen to me, and I know you will not listen to the business community, but you can listen to some unionists. I know you have a separate phone in your office, but everyone is saying it-apart from you. It is the red phone; pick it up! Everyone is saying it: you have created a coalition of business and unions against your catastrophic announcement. This is a window onto not only the absolute lack of focus on detail but also the preoccupation with stunts of this government. As the Prime Minister stood there in his fluorescent yellow vest on the Monday after the budget, decrying employee share schemes as tax rorts, it was pretty obvious, as we left Canberra on budget week, that the Prime Minister's office packed up his papers ready for him to go on his budget tour and made sure they had the priorities for him: the florescent vest, the hard hat-don't forget the hairdryer, but don't worry about the budget papers! That is what is quite obvious. All right, the Prime Minister has discovered his hard hat. If he goes to Bunnings he will discover you can buy one with a torch on it, so you will be able to have night-time doorstops. This is the sort of focus you get from those opposite. Two weeks later, the minister was finally dragged kicking and screaming. Perhaps he was arguing behind the scenes; I don't know. It would be a good democratic duty if he shared it with the House. Perhaps he was arguing behind the scenes. Perhaps he had that fixed looked on his face saying, ‘Swannie, this is a disaster; what have you done?' It Perhaps he did. I don't know. If he did he could share it with us and we would not tell a soul! But these last two weeks have shown the incompetence of those opposite. And there is a way to go yet. The U-turn has a way to go and the Assistant Treasurer is still slowly on the move.",110
172,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (4.12 pm)-I am glad to have this opportunity to discuss this in the House. It is an opportunity I thought might come a little earlier. I thought the opposition were so cranky about this that sometime in the last two weeks I might have got a question, and I would have been able to answer it. I would have been able to put some of these things on the record. I was sitting there, on my spot down the end of the front bench, waiting and hoping for a question from the member for Casey. Alas, I waited in the forlorn hope that he would somehow get a question through the tactics committee. I thought he might get one up on Monday. Then I thought I might get one on Tuesday. If the opposition really were angry about this, if the opposition really understood and cared about this, they would at some point have asked me a question in question time, but there was nothing-until Wednesday, two weeks after the budget, we get an MPI. At least now we have the opportunity to put some of the issues on the table, to put on the table some of the background and the context to the government's position. There is an important obligation on every government, regardless of its party, to protect the tax base and to ensure that everybody is paying their fair share of tax. It is important that, while we continue to support employee share ownership and all the schemes that can have good benefits in the workplace-and I think that would have bipartisan supportwe also ensure that they cannot be manipulated in a way that facilitates tax evasion. would be irresponsible for the government to ignore the advice of the Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury that there are serious compliance issues with the tax treatment of employee share ownership schemes. A number of groups have been in discussions with the government and made public comments about the government's measures. Most of these groups-not all, but the majority-have acknowledged the government's concerns. They have said, ‘Yes, we think there is a real problem here.' Some of them have said: ‘This should have been fixed a long time ago. Yes, there are real integrity issues. Yes, it is good that you are dealing with them. Can we have a talk with you about the way you deal with them?' The sensible and practical thing for the government to do is to listen to those concerns and to say to those groups: ‘We won't walk away for a second from the objective of ensuring that everybody pays their fair share of tax. We won't walk away from that at all. But we are more than happy to sit down with you and talk through the detail and see if there are ways that your concerns can be assuaged, see if we can deal with your issues in such a way that meets the government's objectives but puts your mind at rest.' So we have had, over recent years, a very serious loss of tax revenue from people being paid some of their salary in shares, deferring a tax on that income and either never declaring it or cutting their tax in half by declaring it only as capital gains and not as income. I thought I might share with the House a couple of case studies. Obviously I cannot go into individuals' details. That would be most inappropriate. But here are a couple of case studies from the ATO. I stress that these are just snapshots of a couple of cases. One person acquired options in the 2004 income year. The taxpayer did not elect to be taxed upfront, instead preferring to defer any tax It liability to a future time. In the 2005 income year the taxpayer exercised some of the options and immediately sold the shares from that exercise. The taxpayer did not include any discount from the exercise of the options in their tax return for that year. Instead, the taxpayer incorrectly included a capital gain in their tax return for the 2005 income year and applied the discount. An ATO audit found that the extra tax payable from that one individual was over half a million dollars. Here is another one. One taxpayer acquired options in the 2002, 2003 and 2005 income years. The taxpayer deferred, as the law allows, any tax liability to a future time. And, in the 2004 and 2005 income years, the taxpayer exercised some of the options but did not include any of the discounts from the exercise of the options in the tax returns and did not pay any tax on those discounts. In the 2005 income year the taxpayer ceased employment and exercised all the remaining options. Again, the taxpayer failed to pay the tax owing. A tax office audit revealed that the additional tax payable for this individual was over $440,000. These are just two case studies showing the House the extent of the potential tax loss. That is $1 million from two people. I share with the House this fact: eight per cent of the 1,300 taxpayers examined under tax office programs focusing on wealthy Australians had tax shortfalls relating to employee share schemes. The tax office advice to the government is that the loss to revenue is very significant indeed and over the forward estimates period could well add up to many hundreds of millions of dollars. We have a real integrity issue here. It issue that the government would be negligent to ignore. But, at the same time, we are supporters of employee share ownership schemes. Without walking away from the central tenets of the measure-the central objectives of the measure-we have recognised that there might be ways that these could be better addressed. There might ways that, by working with the industry, we could deal with some of the genuine concerns that have been raised. This is far from the shadow minister's characterisation that we have arrogantly refused to listen, that we have arrogantly shut down the debate and that we have refused to acknowledge that there are any issues. Quite the contrary-we have said publicly on several occasions that we are happy to work with the sector to try and work through their concerns. The alternative would be to refuse to recognise that perhaps the measure might be improved. The alternative would be to arrogantly barrel on and say: ‘We are not listening. No changes. You can forget about.' Or it would be to arrogantly refuse to meet with the industry or with the sector and to allow the uncertainty to drag on for months. I have a feeling that that is perhaps what the Liberal Party would have done in the same situation. How do I know that? It is because they have form on this. In October 2007 my predecessor in the role of Assistant Treasurer, the honourable member for Dickson, made an announcement. He announced major changes to the tax treatment of scrip for scrip takeovers. The member for Lindsay would remember it well. The then Assistant Treasurer announced these changes, and his objectives, I must say, were good. He was cracking down on tax evasion. I would give him my 100 per cent support-there was no question that his motives were welcome. But he made a mistake. is an The laws were poorly crafted. There were unintended consequences from the member for Dickson's measure. The operation of capital markets in Australia was fundamentally changed. Takeovers, which are important for economic efficiency, stopped in their tracks. Expert commentators said that up to $28 billion worth of takeovers were scrapped because of the member for Dickson's mistake. Now, we all make mistakes. I am not critical of the member for Dickson for that. He was trying to stop tax evasion, and he had my support in trying to stop tax evasion. But what did he do? Did he acknowledge that maybe it could have been done better? Did he acknowledge that perhaps there had been an error? Did he acknowledge that they had rushed in and made mistakes? No, he arrogantly refused to acknowledge that and they barrelled on. And what did they do? Frankly, they left it to me to fix. They waited for the election. The new government had to come in and I had to work through a better law with the industry, with the Treasury and with all affected sectors to achieve the objectives that the member for Dickson was correctly trying to achieve but had bungled. He had got it wrong. As I say, my criticism is not of the member for Dickson for getting it wrong. I do not criticise him for trying. My criticism is that he arrogantly refused to acknowledge that perhaps it could have been done better. My criticism is that he allowed months of uncertainty and that he stopped takeovers for months-$28 billion worth of takeovers because of the member for Dickson's bungled policy. If we are going to have a fair dinkum debate, let us have a look at these two case studies. In both case studies, the government is trying to crack down on tax evasion. They are very laudable efforts. In both case studies, the government is saying, ‘We want to make sure everybody is paying their fair share of tax.' In case study No. 1, the member for Dickson's exercise, there are unintended consequences arising and mistakes are being made. And he is arrogantly refusing to recognise it and sit down and work through the issues with industry. He is arrogantly refusing to acknowledge that perhaps it could have been done better. In case study No. 2, we have this government saying, on the advice of the ATO: ‘We have a serious integrity issue here. We have to make sure that people are paying their fair share of tax. We have to ensure that workers who don't have access to employee share ownership schemes aren't subsidising those who do.' That is what this government did. We have sat down with industry in meeting after meeting over the last week or so and said: ‘Okay, tell us your concerns. We will work through them with you. Perhaps we could change the way we implement the measure. Perhaps we can do some finetuning. Perhaps we can adjust. Perhaps what we can do is achieve our objectives in a slightly different way.' And we do not mind admitting that perhaps we could calibrate this measure better. That is the difference between the Liberal approach and the Labor approach. That is the difference between doing things the right way and the wrong way. So let's not have lectures from those opposite about not understanding business or not understanding that things need to be fixed when there are unintended consequences. Let's not have the member for Casey saying that this just shows that the Labor Party does not know how business works, because the opposite is the case. What this case study and the member for Dickson's case study show is that we are more than happy to sit down with business and work through issues. The member for Casey called the Labor Party's approach the ‘hatred' of employee share ownership schemes. He said, ‘You hate these things and you do not understand how business works.' There are a few little problems there in the member for Casey's narrative. It was the Keating government that established employee share ownership schemes. It was the Keating government and, in fairness, the Howard governmentMr Anthony Smith-And you that killed it.",113
173,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let those opposite continue-but it was the Keating government that recognised the productivity benefits of employee share ownership schemes. I am sure the member for Casey has done his research and checked the record and checked what I said in opposition and he will have seen my support for employee share ownership schemes. He will also have seen the Treasurer's support for employee share ownership schemes. And he will know that there are senior figures in this government who strongly support employee share ownership schemes but happen to believe that everybody should have to pay their fair share of tax as well. The two things are not mutually exclusive. If this government was so anti-business, if this government did not understand how business works, why is it that there are so many measures in this budget that are supported by business? Why is it that business has come out and endorsed this budget and its particular measures so well? Why is it that business has welcomed our changes to the treatment of off-market share buybacks, for example? It is not something you are going to read about on the front page of the Daily Telegraph, but it is an important reform. something that business has been calling for. Then there are our abolition of the foreign investment fund regime and the rewriting of the controlled foreign company, or CFC, regime. Why is it that business had called for the previous government, the so-called business-friendly previous government, to do these things for years and was ignored? It has taken this government to act on these things. They might have been getting around to it. Maybe another 10 or 15 years in office and they might have got to it-fair call. But we have done it in our second budget. Our measures in relation to the foreign investment fund and the controlled foreign company regime will save business $80 million a year in compliance costs. This is a government which understands business; this is a government which works with business and works through the issues. These are issues that people have been raising for years and they are things that it has fallen upon us to do. If the opposition really supported business they would start listening to business and get behind the Australian Business Investment Partnership. That is what they would do. It is another sign of the opposition being completely out of touch with the needs of business. Part of my job, part of the job of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and part of the job of the Treasurer is to engage with business. I would suspect that there is not a boardroom in Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane that has not had the Treasurer, the finance minister or me in it over the last 18 months. We engage with business. And let me tell you this: what they say in the boardrooms of Australia is that the Leader of the Opposition is not a popular camper because he is taking a cheap and populist approach to the crisis facing the Australian economy. The Leader of the Opposition is opposing the It is government's every measure. Around the boardrooms of Australia they say, ‘Malcolm knows better.' They say: ‘The Leader of the Opposition should understand how business works, and we suspect he does. So why would the Leader of the Opposition oppose something as sensible and necessary as the Australian Business Investment Partnership?' They say this in the boardrooms around Australia all the time. And the reason is-and business knows it-he is not the Leader of the Opposition; he is the leader of the opportunists. He will take every opportunity to make a cheap political attack on this government and not do what is right in the national interest. He will not get behind this government's efforts to support Australia through this worse global financial crisis. That is why the business community have written off the Leader of the Opposition as a waste of time. That is why the business community says, ‘Maybe we would be better with the member for North Sydney or the member for Higgins leading the opposition, because this guy just does not get it.' That is why the business community looks to Labor for engagement; that is why the business community looks to this government to get us through this crisis; and that is why they see the current Leader of the Opposition as nothing better than a hypocrite and opportunist.",116
174,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am reminded of that commercial with Pro Hart where he made an enormous mess on the carpet and the cleaner who came into the room and saw this enormous mess said, ‘Oh, Mr Hart, what a mess!' Mr Hart thought it was art and many people would think it was art. The one thing that is different between that analogy and what we see with the government is that, when they do all these things, they think they have created a great artwork in government. But what we know, time and time again, is that once they have come to office and splashed the paint around and rolled around on the carpet with government money the Australian public will turn up and walk in and say to this Prime Minister, ‘Oh, Mr Rudd, what a mess!' And it will be up to the coalition once again to turn up and continue the story of Australian politics, which is that every time Labor get in they create such a fiscal mess that the Australian public turn to the coalition and say, is time for you to clean up their mess again.' This issue is a very big deal. Between 600,000 and one million employees participate in these schemes. My own electorate of Cook has the highest employment of Qantas employees, and Qantas offers 34,000 employees these types of schemes. Of the top 500 listed companies, 450 offer these types of schemes, and for small business it is an important tool to facilitate transition and succession arrangements and to transfer ownership to employees, which is not something this government has an enthusiasm for. What we have seen with this measure is the same as we have seen with many measures in this budget. The approach here is purely ideological. They simply do not understand this issue-they do not get this issue-and they are not passionate about it. It is not something that they want to see encouraged in the Australian workplace. They highlight, through the budget, this political doctrine of attacking those they simply do not like and do not want to encourage. They attach to them all of these pernicious phrases. They call the doctors who want to help people with fertility treatment ‘overcharging doctors' and they engage in doctor bashing. Here they describe the people who want to engage in share ownership schemes as tax burglars, which we just heard the Assistant Treasurer say in this place. He said the people who want to engage in these things are tax burglars. They apply these pernicious terms to them to try to impugn their motive as some sort of unholy one and to try to justify their ideological war and their lack of enthusiasm for things that actually make a difference in the workplace. The requirement to pay, as the shadow minister at the dispatch box clearly said, the tax upfront is without question a discouragement. It is a disincentive to the establishment and take-up of these schemes. I be‘It lieve the government knows this. They know that by putting in these measures the take-up of these schemes will be discouraged. As Rahm Emanuel said and as the member for Higgins said in his speech the other night, ‘Never waste a crisis.' That is what we have seen from this government all the way through this economic crisis. It has been an opportunity for them to repackage social agendas and social spending agendas as economic stimuluses. That is what we are seeing with their rather unholy approach to this issue. We simply need to look no further than the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. Back in 2000 they were part of a House of Representatives inquiry into these types of schemes. They signed themselves up to a report which said that there is no clear and objective evidence for the claimed productivity pay-off from such schemes. The Assistant Treasurer said before that there are some people in the government who support these types of things. Clearly not the Deputy Prime Minister. Clearly not the minister for small business. They do not believe it. They simply do not buy it. They are not interested in supporting it. That is what we see in these measures here before us. It is another step in Labor's attempt to reregulate our economy. They are looking to reregulate our economy. This poses an enormous threat to the recovery of the Australian economy when it comes out of recession, which will hopefully be sooner rather than later, but that is hard to believe under this government. Labor's forecasts, as put out both in their budget papers and in the plethora of other information they have been talking about which is not in the budget papers, are putting forward a scenario of miracle growth to get us out of debt and deficit. But even their early-year forecasts rely critically on comparisons between the current economic situation and situations in the early 1990s and the early 1980s to justify the growth forecasts they have in their budget papers. It was also noted the other night-and I made this point myself in my own budget reply speech-that it is quite clear that the recession in the early 1990s was far worse, at least on the forecast provided by this government, than the recession we are going through here. The government likes to talk about the global recession when it is talking about these measures, but when it comes to talking about the Australian recession it is a lot more quiet. I quote the member for Higgins from the other night: … we are told this is the greatest downturn since the Great Depression and yet, on the other hand, the budget forecasts a contraction of half a per cent of GDP. In the year to June 1983, in that recession, there was a contraction of 3.4 per In the recession to June 1991, there was a contraction of 1.5 per cent, so the government is in fact forecasting a much milder recession than 1991 or 1983. He went on to say-and this is absolutely true: The only thing that will be greater coming out of this recession is the budget deficit, because in neither of those recessions did the budget deficit ever blow out to five per cent of GDP. The other thing I would say is this. As we seek to climb out of this recession the other thing that was different in the nineties and in the eighties was that at least the economy was trying to grow into an open field, or at least a more open field. We had a situation where there had been economic reforms that had been put in place prior to that, economic reforms which were shaded by those introduced by the Howard government, but at least our economy was trying to grow into a more liberally regulated economy. What we are seeing under this government is a tightening. What we are seeing from this government is a reregulation, whether it is in the labour market, the financial markets, here in terms of employee arrangements or any of these things. What we are seeing is that this government wants to take forecasts from the early 1990s and the early 1980s, and it wants to bind up the economy. It is going to bind it up with its proposed CPRS, the emissions trading scheme. They will not tell us what the impact of that scheme will be on their growth forecasts. They will not tell us what the impact of that will be on the debt and their ability to repay the debt. They are saying they want us to regrow in a more regulated, tightened, structured economy which does not allow for things like employee share ownership schemes, where people cannot invest in the productivity of their business and seek to gain the advantage of putting in cent. the sweat equity as employees and have the opportunity to share in the prosperity that comes from that. This is something this government simply does not believe in. So our economy will have to try and grow again in the bog that this government is creating with the policies that it is putting on our economy as we speak, and this is a classic measure. This is a rushed and bungled measure. We have seen plenty of rushed and bungled measures from this government, such as the unlimited bank guarantee which froze the savings of 270,000 Australians and tied up liquidity all around the country. It took ages for the government to come to terms with this. Here is yet another rushed and bungled attempt. Here also in this place we on this side of the House are having this imposition: ‘Just sign up to the CPRS. We know you understand that this is a deeply flawed scheme that will put massive costs on the Australian economy and export emissions and export jobs, but sign up to it. We want this thing there so the Prime Minister can sign his application form to be Secretary General of the UN by taking his pretty little CPRS to his meeting in Copenhagen.' So he is going to try and rush and bungle that through, and this is another measure which shows they have rushed and bungled. This is not a government that has got too many things right. They do not get too many things right. Maybe that is why they cannot get support on too many things. If they took the time to get a few more things right then maybe we would be able to support a few more things. But on this occasion they have shown once again that when they do just throw it out there they get it hopelessly wrong. The shadow Assistant Treasurer said quite clearly, ‘This situation is like saying there are termites in the house and so the answer is to knock it down.' Their answer now is given after you have got home and found they have knocked down your house. Then they say: ‘Would you like to talk about it? Would you like to talk about the fact we have knocked your house down? Is there anything you'd like to share about how we can improve?' Maybe not knocking our house down in the first place would have been a good move. This is a rushed and bungled measure. This is an unfair measure and it is a desperate measure from a government addicted to debt. (Time expired)",117
175,Mr BRADBURY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thought it was a little bit rich when I saw the reference in the matter of public importance from the member for Casey to ‘chaos and confusion'-hallmarks of the Liberal Party post John Howard. We have seen the operation of that mob over there in this parliament. It has been chaos and confusion. We have seen it not just in their response to the budget; we have seen it on a number of specific bills. When the Nation-building Funds Bill came before the Senate, we could not quite work out what happened, because the opposition did not all turn up to vote. There were those who turned up to vote who voted for it, there were those who turned up to vote who voted against it and then there were those who apparently were stuck in the toilet! But the reality was that there was no unity. There was chaos and confusion. Some might even suggest that they are the two warring factions within the Liberal Partychaos and confusion. It sounds a little bit like Get Smart except that there is no Control, I can tell you-it is chaos and confusion. Those on the other side come forward and try to portray this as an attack on employee share ownership plans. That could not be further from the truth. This government is committed, as previous Labor governments have been committed, to having a strong employee share ownership scheme sector in place. That is something that we support and that we wish to continue to support. But we that also feel very strongly about maintaining integrity in our tax system. I would have thought that those on the other side perhaps chose to ignore some of these lurks and loopholes. I have to say that when there is a lurk and a loophole the Liberal Party is not far away. When we look at the operation of these employee share ownership schemes for those at the higher end of the income scale-I am talking above $1 million, and I will look at some of those figures in a minute-and at the massive tax concessions or, in many cases, the massive amounts of tax that were not paid or that were avoided, I would have thought it would be a matter of public importance for us to shine a spotlight on that. I would have thought that we should try to act on behalf of all those taxpayers who look to us to recover revenue where it is due and payable, to stand up and recover revenue from those who are trying to avoid their obligations and, in some cases, as a result of confusion, are simply unable to meet their obligations. I think it is worth noting from the outset that one in 20 people earning under $100,000 is in an employee share ownership scheme. For those earning above $100,000 it is one in six. So by anyone's calculation this is not overwhelming majority of the workforcefar from it. When the member for Casey says that this plan attacks the very people that need the most help, then I simply make the point: one in 20 people earning under $100,000 has access to an employee share ownership plan. If there is a tax exemption or tax concession available to one in 20, then it begs the question of equity for the remaining 19 in 20. But these measures are directed at the avoidance end of the spectrum. They are directed towards the issues that the ATO has raised. I note that the ATO has said that about eight per cent of the 1,300 executives who earn more than $1 million a year fail to disclose an average of $180,000 in income. That was from share schemes. We are talking about $18 million being defrauded from the taxpayer, whether it be in the form of avoidance or confusion. The ATO has estimated that up to $100 million of revenue has been lost as a result of avoidance. The member for Casey asked many questions, but the one question that needs to be asked is: if this sort of revenue leakage has been occurring for some years now, why was it that those on the other side, when they had the opportunity in government, did not stand up for hard working taxpayers who pay their fair share, and try to recover some of these funds? Not only did they not stand up for those hard working taxpayers when they were in government; they now want to stand against them in opposition. I think it says a lot about the perspective that they bring to these issues. Let me look at one particular example. Let's consider the case of an executive-and I know that those on the other side do not want to focus on executives in this debate, the cheerleaders of the golden handshake brigade. Let's take an example of an executive who accepts a position in an Australian company and, as part of his remuneration the package, receives 500,000 shares in the company. Those shares are provided to the executive at no cost but are valued on the market at 50c each. Let's pick that figure. The executive then elects to defer paying tax on the shares. He does not include the discount-that is, the $250,000-in his income in the year in which he acquires them. Five years after acquiring the shares he decides to move overseas. He later ceases his employment and he would be required to include his income for the year and the discount plus any accrued gains on the shares. What happens if that executive is no longer in the country? It is not unusual for that to occur. The problem with deferral is that it is very difficult at that subsequent point to effect enforcement, and that is one of the major problems with the current scheme. It may not be a consideration for many people that have shares in employee share ownership plans but it is a major consideration for those people at the top end of town who, either through avoidance or confusion, are not paying their fair share. This is a measure that is directed towards ensuring that those people pay their fair share. I would have thought that, if ever there were a time for us to be really taking some hard decisions in relation to clawing back revenue leakages from those that are not paying their fair share, it would be in the current climate, with the $210 billion worth of tax revenues that have just evaporated as a result of the global recession and the slowdown in commodity prices. I would have thought that now was the time to be acting. Those on the other side stand up and talk about debt but they are not proposing anything and they have not proposed anything that would get the budget any closer to being in surplus than it is at the moment. They deny the fact that the $210 billion worth of revenue that is lost would be lost whether they were in government or not. That is the reality. You would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition in his address in reply to the budget would have given the global economic recession a guernsey, but it did not even get a mention. There has been a lot of talk about what was in the budget speech, but there has not been enough focus on what was not in the budget speech in reply. It did not even mention the global economic recession. Those on the other side are pretty fond of selectively quoting parts of the budget papers. One thing that you will not hear them quote is that on page 1-6 of the budget overview in Budget Paper No. 1 it says: The world economy is expected to contract by 1½ per cent in 2009-the first annual contraction six decades. This will be the first annual contraction in global growth in 60 years. I would have thought that that is an extraordinary circumstance. Those on the other side, and the member for Cook is first and foremost among them, come forward and want to tell us that things are not nearly as bad here as they are elsewhere and do not require the decisive action that this government has taken to try and cushion our economy against the impact of the global recession. Mr Anthony Smith-Every time you say ‘decisive', you get a pat on the back.",120
176,Mr BRADBURY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will take that interjection from the member for Casey. I heard his comments earlier about the hard hats. They are very sensitive on that side about hard hats. I did not see them wearing hard hats very often when they were in government, because they did not build anything. They did not believe in building the nation; nation building was not their priority. They get sensitive about the hard hats. Just yesterday there was a bit of a kerfuffle about the hard hat. The member for Canning says that he was not the one who brought the hard hat in, but that it was the member for La Trobe. I will take his word for that. I was astonished that they had a hard hat nearby. They never needed one in their 12 years in office, because they did not build anything; they did not invest in the nation. But then it became a little bit clearer to me why he had such ready access to the hard hat: he needed it yesterday morning in the joint party room meeting-in fact, I think that they were standard issue. Talk about division; talk about chaos and confusion. They do not know whether they are Arthur or Martha or whether they are in greener or browner than the Labor Party when it comes to the CPRS. They do not know whether they support it or not. They have a leader who said that he was the voice of reason-the voice of progress-in the cabinet. But now he is a stick in the mud; he is an obstacle; he is the speed hump that is blocking any progress on that front.",122
177,Mr ROBERT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Fadden) (4.47 pm)These are truly dark days for the great Australian dream. There was a time in this country when Australia per capita had more share ownership than any other nation on the face of the planet. Australians were encouraged to have a stake in the companies in which they worked. The heart of that was the employee share scheme. Whether you bought in, whether you bought shares, whether you bought options, whether you paid for them, whether you received them, whether they were part of remuneration or whether they were an incentive, those schemes were all about providing an opportunity for ownership, for partnership. They meant that you did not have to just be an employee but could be an owner in the company in which you worked. Then along came that nervous little man, the Treasurer, and his dodgy sidekick, the Assistant Treasurer, looking to scoop $200 million over the forward estimates by removing the ability to defer tax on acquiring shares through a share scheme and putting a $60,000 limit on it. I do not know what is worse, moving to impose a cap of $60,000 and then affecting all shareholders or the hide of the statement in Budget Paper No. 2 in part 1 in the section on revenue measures for Treasury-and I know that the Treasurer gets lost when we talk about his budget. The paper says: This ensures that the concessions encourage a better take-up and availability of employee arrangements by low and middle-income employees. The budget papers say that the whole point of this measure is to encourage low-income employees to take it up. But if they did nothing it would still encourage lowand middleincome employees to take it up. It does not change anything if you are earning under $60,000; it provides no incentive or disincentive; nothing changes. Yet the Treasurer came out and said: There is no doubt that the arrangements that been in place deliver massive benefits to some executives on very high remuneration. It was time for that to be reformed and that's what we've done. The budget paper says that this is about an incentive for lowand middle-income earners yet the Treasurer says that this is about punishing and closing a loophole for highincome earners. The question is: what is the measure about? It absolutely and utterly seems to be the case that there is no consistency. If indeed the budget papers are correct and this is about an incentive, why is it that so many of our companies are closing down their employee share schemes? At Australia's top 100 companies, about 600,000 Australians are involved in share plans. Woolworths has more than 40,000 people on plans; there are 100,000 in Wesfarmers. Ninety per cent of the member companies of the Australian Mines and Metals Association have employee share schemes. Seventy-five per cent of shop-floor employees at Alcoa are members of such plans. And what has been the response of the corporations of this country to this government's measure? Close down, scrap, defer and hold plans. I asked the Assistant Treasurer, who seems to have disappeared from the House, these questions. How does suspending and shutshare ting down so many of the nation's plans encourage better take up and availability? If they are all being shut down-if no companies in the nation bar a few are offering a share plan and the opportunity to buy into the wealth of the nation and to take a stake in your own company and your own futurethen, in the name of all that is sacred, how can you possibly meet your stated intent of improving take-up and access by lowand middle-income employees? It is simply and utterly a farce. It is no wonder that this govhave ernment is running and ducking for cover. Or is there a more sinister motive? Is it not really about the $60,000 and trying to hide large tax earners? Could it be a direct attack on the aspiration of Australians? Is it the desire for everyone to live in ticky-tacky houses that all look the same, because that is what pure socialism wants? Should everyone just be the same, with a massive redistribution of wealth? Is that the real intent hidden behind the vagary of the budget papers? I will leave that to the ballot box and for Australians to determine. This measure, though, is a farce and the companies of this nation have judged and condemned it as such.",122
178,Mr HAYES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"After listening to this debate, I have to wonder about the opposition's tactics and the reason they have waited for two weeks. They have waited some two weeks since the budget to bring this matter before us today. Let us face it: they cannot say anything about the CPRS. They cannot say anything about schools-all the ones who want money for their schools are walking out of the room at the moment. They are not going to talk about black spot funding, or, in Wilson's case, level crossings up in his electorate. They are not going to talk about roads or support of local government. So what do they want to talk about? They want to talk about tax schemes. Comrade Smith wants to talk about workers' rights, but if he were genuine about workers' rights this bloke would not have voted for Work Choices on however many occasions-was it six or seven times they voted for Work Choices?-to strip away workers' rights. Let us make no bones about that. What we are trying to do is set up taxation arrangements so that under these schemes people are called upon to pay their fair share of tax. That is spreading the burden across all those who work. If you look at employee share ownership schemes, you will see that only one in 20 workers at the moment is in one of those schemes. But that does not mean that we do not need to review it. The opposition are now picking on an issue some two weeks after the budget. It has certainly been covered in the newspapers over the last two weeks, but they waited. In addition, we are in a situation where the Assistant Treasurer has already put in train a consultation process with all the stakeholders to address these issues. We are not going to compromise on people paying their fair share of tax. What we are going to do, however, is look at what is fair, with a view to providing a positive set of arrangements that will encourage employee share ownership. I have worked for organisations that have sponsored such schemes over many, many years. I think it does encourage loyalty and participation and provides motivation when employees share in the company's profits. Those things are all true. Not once have those opposite indicated what the ATO have said so far, that it is the people at the higher end of the schemes who are involved in tax abuse or the confusion that has caused this amount of tax losses. What the ATO is saying at the moment is that in excess of hundreds of millions of dollars of tax revenue have likely been squandered as a consequence of these schemes. I would have thought it was in the interest of everyone in this chamber and of the people they represent in their electorates to ensure that we protect the integrity of our tax base. Surely we should not simply go about our business, allowing the highest income earners a means to defer their tax increases or, alternatively, to pay half of what they would have been required to pay in tax by declaring it a capital gain. That is not what we intend to do. We do intend to move to protect the integrity of the tax system and we do intend to do so in such a way that it is done in consultation with all stakeholders, the industries concerned and also the various groups out there who actually sponsor these schemes. I am sure Comrade Smith will not have been lobbied by too many unions to date, but there are those who have actually taken the time to talk to a number of the trade unions out there, such as the Australian Workers Union, and work out what they are asking for. Sure, they do want that review to take place-and we are committed to that review-but they say that the fundamentally unfair aspect of this arrangement is that the higher income earners rorted the scheme. I do not think that it is inappropriate at this stage for us to move to review that aspect of it with a view to tightening it up so people pay their fair share of tax. I do not know about your electorates, but in my case 98 per cent of the electorate of Werriwa earn under $100,000. They are the people that I want to make sure are not disproportionately affected by tax arrangements. They need to see that we are making the effort for their benefit, to ensure ryone is called upon to pay their fair share of tax. And, if we abide by that principle, we are in a position to protect the integrity of our tax system. Apart from the consultation process the government is entering into(Time expired)",124
179,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The discussion is now concluded. NA  standing order 51, I wish to raise a matter of privilege. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, to me this matter represents a prima facie case of breach of privilege, and I ask you to ask the Speaker to take the appropriate action to give precedence to a motion to refer this matter to the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. Repeatedly in this House in the last sitting weeks, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry have sought to denigrate members of the opposition who support projects, grants or programs that are available to organisations, groups, associations or businesses in their own electorates. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, members of parliament have a duty to represent their voters. Community groups and others expect their local MPs and other local representatives to write letters of support, to seek appointments with ministers, to meet with ministers and to lobby on behalf of their community organisations, their sporting groups, their local associations and local businesses to support job, infrastructure and other grants and programs that go into our electorates. That is true for members on both sides of the House, whether we are Liberal, that eveLabor, National or even Independent. Members of the opposition are being hindered in doing so. They are being inhibited from doing their work because of the personal denigration by members of the government Mr Hayes interjecting tually really serious. You think it is tremendously amusing. Your interjection was, ‘Come over to this side of the House,' so in fact what you are saying is that we should all be Labor MPs-which is exactly the point I am making. That is exactly the point, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am making. Members are being hindered, and I personally feel inhibited in doing my work as a member of parliament, in writing letters of support and in working for community organisations, associations and businesses so they are able to get access to the programs, grants and other spending that all governments of all political persuasions provide in our electorates. Members are concerned that they will be denigrated for doing their job. But, more importantly, we are getting feedback on this side of the House that community organisations and others are concerned that their applications will be seen in a different light from those coming from government MPs in government seats. That goes to the very issue of privilege.  Speaker.  order on a matter of privilege.",125
180,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"The Chief Government Whip will resume his seat. The member for Sturt is raising a matter of privilege. He has the call.   Community organisations, from feedback we are receiving, are concerned that their applications for grants, for programs and for government infrastructure spending will be seen in a different light because they are not being proposed by government members. That goes to the very nub of the breach of privilege. It is contrary to all Westminster system, which we operate under, in which government should be blind as to whether the applications come from Liberal, Labor, National or Independent members of parliament. They should be decided on their merits. It is contrary to the way this parliament has operated for the last 108 years. It amounts to a prima facie case of the intimidation of members of parliament while carrying out their duties. I place this matter before the Speaker and ask him to consider it and report back to the House on the implications of this breach of privilege.

185,Ms NEAL,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I rise today to speak in support of the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEEHELP and Providers) Bill 2009. Before I address the specific measures contained in the bill, I would like to say a few words about vocational education, particularly in my state of New South Wales. TAFE New South Wales is the largest provider of vocational education and training in the Southern Hemisphere. It enrols more than 500,000 students every year and offers a wide range of courses through 10 institutes, with more than 130 campuses across the state. It teaches over 1,200 qualifications, most of which are nationally accredited under the Australian Qualifications Framework. There have been big expansions in TAFE New South Wales over the last decade with enrolments increasing by over 76,000 since 1998. TAFE New South Wales currently teaches courses at all vocational education and training levels from certificate I through to graduate diploma. With 1,200 courses, TAFE New South Wales covers almost every industry area, from traditional trades like plumbing, manufacturing and engineering to new and emerging industries like photonics and nanotechnology. TAFE New South Wales also has an extensive program of second-chance education. Almost one-third of enrollees at TAFE NSW pay either a concession fee or no fee at all for their studies. The National Centre for Vocational Education Research found that TAFE NSW has high levels of employer satisfaction. In fact 83.2 per cent of NSW employers were satisfied with the quality of apprentice/traineeship training provided by TAFE NSW, and this compares very favourably with the national average of 78.6 per cent. I want to take the opportunity today to congratulate TAFE NSW on the quality of their education and in particular the quality of their staff and encourage them to continue providing the high-quality training for vocational education that they have provided to date. It is certainly outstanding, and New South Wales is very proud of it. The bill before us today aims to give greater consistency and clarity to the VET FEE-HELP Assistance Scheme arrangements that are currently in place in the vocational education and training sector. Courses that are available at NSW TAFE and through other registered training organisations will be impacted by this bill. It seeks to do this by introducing a number of technical amendments to the Higher Education Support Act 2003. The amendments will make the arrangements consistent with those currently in place in the wider higher education sector. In short, this bill will ensure consistency between the VET FEE-HELP system and the existing FEE-HELP system.",127
186,The VET FEE,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"HELP Assistance Scheme provides loans to eligible fee-paying students undertaking certain VET courses of study. The scheme is targeted to certain higher level skills, as access to assistance under the scheme is limited to VET courses of study leading to the award of a VET diploma, VET advanced diploma, VET graduate diploma or VET graduate certificate. The scheme helps pay for all or part of a student's tuition fees. Under the scheme, students can access training and defer the fees until they are able to pay. It is pretty much similar to that previously-prior to 2007-available for university students. I do not mean to suggest that those loans are no longer available in universities; before 2007 they were not available for those in VET courses. These ‘income contingent loans' have been available in the higher education sector, as I have said, for a very long time, but they were not introduced until quite recently for the VET sector. Over time there has been an increase in the number of VET providers in Australia. VET is currently provided through a national network of over 4,000 public and private registered training organisations. As a result, the number of providers applying for access to VET FEE-HELP has increased over time. But the process of accreditation is very rigorous. The rigour of this accreditation system is evidenced by the fact that as of 20 March 2009 there were just 12 approved VET providers in Australia. There are 15 others currently on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments, or FRLI, awaiting the parliamentary disallowance period. In addition to these developments, the range of study units and courses offered by these providers has also broadened over time. It is now timely that clarity is sought defining the types of study units, courses and modules that can properly qualify under the assistance scheme. As the VET FEE-HELP Assistance Scheme stands at the moment, there is no specific instrument to limit or control the eligibility of study units or courses that may attract assistance. As a result, it is currently possible for an eligible student to access VET FEE-HELP assistance for VET units of study which are not essential to the relevant VET course of study-in other words, something that they are studying for pleasure rather than to complete their course. One of the major provisions of this bill, therefore, will ensure that a student's access to assistance under the scheme is limited to those VET units of study that are essential to the completion of their particular course of study. Only those units of study that are essential will be eligible under the scheme. This will ensure that access to the VET FEE-HELP scheme is more appropriately targeted. This amendment is particularly important because of the Australian government's decision to support the Victorian government's VET reform agenda by allowing for the extension of the assistance scheme to subsidised diploma and advanced diploma students in that state. As of 1 July 2009, a greater number of VET providers will be offering access to VET FEE-HELP assistance to their students, increasing the possibility that funding may be used to support students undertaking non-essential VET units of study. The second set of provisions in the bill streamlines the process by which providers are given approval to offer VET FEE-HELP assistance to their students. Under current arrangements the Higher Education Support Act requires that a notice of approval must be registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments and tabled in both in houses of parliament. Fifteen joint sitting days-the disallowance period-must then elapse before the notice of approval can take effect and the higher education or VET provider can begin offering FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP assistance to students. That is why at the moment we have such a comparatively small number. But over time of course this will increase. Amendments to the act will now allow notices of approval for both higher education and VET providers to take effect on the day immediately following the day the notice is registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. Following the amendments, higher education and VET providers will be able to offer assistance to students immediately following the registration on the federal register. These amendments to the provider approval process will ensure that a greater number of approved higher education and VET providers can operate sooner. This will have the effect of giving eligible students faster access to FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP assistance with those providers. The third set of measures that the bill troduces relates to the minister's ability to revoke a VET FEE-HELP provider's approval. Under the new arrangements, the minister will be able revoke the approval as VET provider of a body corporate if that body corporate: no longer offers VET courses; ceases to be established under a law of the Commonwealth, a state or territory; no longer carries on business in Australia; or no Act 2003. longer has its central management and control in Australia. These changes to the revocation arrangements will make the VET system consistent with allied changes made to the Higher Education Support Act in 2007. They are largely technical changes but they carry important protections for the minister and the Commonwealth. It should be noted that the changes to the approvals process will in no way disadvantage students. If a notice of approval is disallowed and the provider has already allowed student access to assistance, those students would be able to access whatever rights accrued under the act prior to the relevant notice of approval ceasing to have effect. The changes contained in this bill will bring consistency to the delivery of student assistance across the higher education sectors. The changes in this bill may seem minor and technical, but it is extremely important that over time adjustments are made to schemes such as this to ensure their integrity and prevent abuse, because ultimately, if this were to occur, the scheme would be undermined and the advantages and assistance given to students undertaking VET courses would be lost. I commend the bill to the House.",128
187,Ms KATE ELLIS,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"in reply-In summing up this debate I would like to take the opportunity to thank the member for Robertson for her contribuintion to this debate and indeed to thank all of the members who have spoken on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEEHELP and Providers) Bill 2009. I also thank a the opposition for their support of this bill, a bill which makes minor clarifications and adjustments to the operation of the FEEHELP and VET FEE-HELP assistance schemes under the Higher Education Support VET FEE-HELP assists students studying diploma, advanced diploma, graduate certificate and graduate diploma courses by providing a loan for all or part of their tuition costs. The scheme is aimed at encouraging students studying within the vocational education and training sector to pursue pathways to further or higher skill qualifications in the higher education sector. It ensures that students have the opportunity to access higher level skills training without the financial burden that may otherwise prevent them from enrolling in such courses. This bill clarifies that a student cannot access VET FEE-HELP assistance to undertake a unit of study unless that unit of study is essential to the student's course of study. In addition, the bill ensures that if a provider of VET FEE-HELP assistance does not maintain certain standards set by the act then it can be required to cease operating as a VET provider. This amendment mirrors that made to the act in 2007 in relation to the operation of higher education providers, ensuring consistency between the FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP assistance schemes. These amendments improve the protections already in place for both students and for the Commonwealth. The bill also makes minor changes to the higher education and VET provider approval process to allow higher education and VET provider notices of approval to take effect on the day immediately following the day the relevant notice is registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. The amendments remove unnecessary delays in the approvals process, ensuring that a greater number of approved higher education and VET providers can operate sooner, giving eligible students faster access to VET FEEHELP assistance with those providers. I commend the bill to the House and urge all members to support this important legislation. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

NA NA BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 May, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time.  Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009 provides for a standing appropriation to enable claims to be paid under the deed of guarantee in respect of the Australian government guarantee to support interim funding to car dealerships, executed on behalf of the Commonwealth on 23 December 2008. On 5 December 2008, the Treasurer announced the establishment of a special purpose vehicle, an SPV, with the support of Australian banks, to provide liquidity to eligible car dealers who were left without financing as a result of the departure of two large automotive finance leasing companies from the Australian market following the onset of the global financial crisis. The two companies are GE Money Motor Solutions, a subsidiary of GE Money, a division of GE Capital, one of four main businesses of General Electric; and GMAC Australia LLC, GMAC's automotive and motorcycle finance business in Australia. GMAC is the automotive finance business of General Motors Corporation. It is estimated that one-quarter of new car dealerships obtained wholesale floor plan finance though GE Money Motor Solutions and GMAC Australia LLC. The SPV, otherwise known as ‘OzCar', was established as a trust on 2 January this year. Under the agreements negotiated with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the ANZ Bank, the National Australia Bank and Westpac, the four major banks will provide liquidity to OzCar through the purchase of AAA rated OzCar securities. Most of these securities will require a Commonwealth guarantee so that they qualify as AAA in order for the four major banks to purchase the securities. Having raised funds through the sale of securities to the banks, OzCar will make available funding for 12 months to eligible car dealerships requiring finance. In his second reading speech for the bill, the Assistant Treasurer told the House that most of the former GE and GMAC dealerships had managed to secure alternative financing, primarily through the remaining lenders. As a result of the orderly wind-down of GE and GMAC loan books and alternative sources of finance, the initial estimate of $2 billion to finance future loans was reduced to $850 million. The Assistant Treasurer stated that the final figure will be much less and the appropriation to support the Commonwealth guarantee will apply to around $550 million of the securities issued by the OzCar SPV. Let me go to the issue of new vehicle sales. New vehicle sales figures for April 2009, released on 5 May by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, show that just under 64,000 passenger motor vehicles, SUVs and commercial vehicles were sold in April 2009, a fall of some 24 per cent compared with the same month in 2008. In the year to date, a total of just under 277,000 new vehicles have been sold, which is a fall of just over 20 per cent compared with the same period last year, suggesting annual sales for 2009 of 840,000, compared with over 1,012,000 sales in 2008. The fall in new car sales reflects the broader slowdown in the Australian economy and globally, with the four local motor vehicle manufacturers reducing production in response to falling demand. Production levels are the lowest since the 2001 downturn and have led to temporary stand-downs and a four-day week for automotive component manufacturers. According to the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the overall contingent liability for the Commonwealth is around $550 million, comprising 45 per cent of the remaining GE Money and GMAC loan books and 85 per cent of the Ford Credit loan book. To limit the risk to taxpayers' funds, the SPV will only be available to advance funds if it is satisfied that the dealership is not subject to any insolvency event. In the event that the deed of guarantee is called upon, any payment made under it will reduce the underlying cash balance. The explanatory memorandum states: The extent of the impact on the underlying cash balance will depend on borrowers' default and borrowers' ability to meet any SPV's claims. Under the Series Notice, the Trustee indemnifies the Commonwealth (out of the assets of the Trust) against any amounts paid or required to be paid by the Commonwealth under the Guarantee. No securities have yet been issued under the OzCar SPV. However, as the guarantee covers most of the Ford car dealerships and as new loans are taken out in the new financial year, the SPV will underpin the next 12 months of trading by dealerships. With this assistance from the government, new car sales are forecast to recover, as we hope. The coalition supports this bill.",130
189,Mr MARLES,GUARANTEE APPROPRIATION,"I rise to speak in support of the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009. When the global economic crisis came upon us last year, two car financing companies ended up leaving the Australian market as a result of the global credit crunch. One was GE Money Motor Solutions and the other was GMAC, the auto financing business of General Motors Corporation. Between these two financing companies, about a quarter of the wholesale floor plan finance was supplied to new car dealerships within this country. In addition to these two car financing companies leaving the Australian market, Ford Credit also reported serious liquidity issues. This presented an enormous difficulty to car dealerships around Australia. In fact, it is fair to say that it is impossible for a car dealership to survive without a viable floor plan financing arrangement in place. So, as a result of that, the Rudd government acted very swiftly to deal with what was a very serious problem for this particular segment of the economy. We dealt with this swiftly, as we have dealt with the global economic crisis swiftly throughout the entire Australian economy. On 5 December last year the Treasurer announced that a special purpose vehicle-financing vehicle would be created to deal with this situation, and on 2 January this year this special purpose vehicle, known as OzCar, was established as a trust. The point of OzCar was to provide liquidity to car dealerships so that they would be able to put in place wholesale floor plan financing arrangements in order to provide finance for the purchase of cars. Car dealerships within this country are a critical segment of our economy. If we look at the auto industry as a whole, it employs something in the order of 66,000 Australians. When you consider that a large proportion of those vehicles which are made in Australia are also sold and used in Australia, then you see the significance of retail car dealerships within the entire economy. It is a particularly important sector of the economy within regional Australia. My electorate of Corio covers Geelong, where we have long been known as a car town. Indeed, to be more specific, we have been known as Ford town. Ford has played a significant role in Geelong since the 1920s, and this is not just through the making of cars or through the employment of carmanufacturing workers but also through the enormous contribution that Ford makes to the town in which it is based, such as Geelong. As one example of that, Ford has been the long-term sponsor of the Geelong Football Club. Indeed, that sponsorship arrangement between Ford and the Geelong Football Club represents the single longest sponsorship arrangement in world sport. That says something of how significant a company like Ford is to a place like Geelong. But it is not just those people who are involved in the manufacturing of cars in Geelong-and there are many thousands who are employed by Ford in that endeavour. In addition to that, we also have in Geelong the largest new car Ford dealership in Australia, Rex Gorell Ford, which has been in business for 24 years. Indeed, the Rex Gorell Group itself employs 320 Geelong workers. The Gorell family are a long-time established family within Geelong; their roots in our city go back to the mid-19th century. Not only do they contribute to Geelong through being a major employer within our region but, indeed, the Gorell family and in particular Rex Gorell have been leading citizens within our community and have made generous contributions of their time and effort to many aspects of the Geelong community. Rex Gorell Ford is just one dealership, and there is just one person in charge of that dealership, but it represents how important car dealerships are to a place like Geelong and it represents how important car dealerships are as a segment of the Australian economy. So, with that in mind, the special purpose vehicle OzCar is playing a very important role in ensuring that this segment of the economy survives a very difficult period of time. It works in the following way: OzCar is a special purpose financial vehicle which will be managed by Perpetual Nominees and Credit Suisse. It will work closely with both the Commonwealth Treasury and the four major Australian banks, ANZ, the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and the National Australia Bank. OzCar will provide finance in the following way. The four major banks will purchase securities from OzCar and these securities will all have a AAA rating under the Standard and Poor's rating system. They will have that rating by virtue of a guarantee vided by the Commonwealth government. That guarantee was provided on 23 December last year by a deed of guarantee. Through the funds raised in this way, OzCar can then provide finance to eligible dealerships to ensure that these dealerships have in place a wholesale floor plan financing arrangement. This provision will be in place for 12 months. At the outset, it needs to be said that the car dealership sector of our economy have dealt very well with GE and GMAC leaving the Australian market. Indeed, a very large proportion of the financing which was previously covered by GE and GMAC has now been covered by other finance providers. It is a credit to the car dealership sector that have managed to put those arrangements in place. But, nevertheless, OzCar will still be needed, particularly in relation to Ford Credit. This will not be, in any sense, a blank cheque for those car dealerships. Very significant prudential parameters will be put in place around the way in which this finance will be provided. First of all, in order to be an eligible car dealership you need to have previously had in place a car financing arrangement through either GE Money Motor Solutions, through GMAC or through Ford Credit. The finance that will be provided by OzCar will only be provided to wholesale floor plans. Auditors will be put in place to monitor the stock management systems of any car dealership which seeks to avail itself of finance through OzCar. While there will be no guarantee fee associated with the guarantee provided by the Commonwealth, while there will be no guarantee fee charged in the pricing of this finance-and there will not be a fee charged, because it is important not to place any additional pressure on these loans pro- and on consumers in what is already a stressed part of our market-and that fee will not be part of the charging system, finance will be issued at a price with sufficient income and reserve buffers to meet any losses. In addition to all of that, dealerships will need to demonstrate that they are viable dealerships in order to avail themselves of finance through OzCar. All of those prudential parameters which are placed around the providing of finance from OzCar to these dealership are being put in place so that there are significant protections upon the public purse and so that the situation arising where the guarantee may come into place hopefully does not occur at all. But, in any event, these parameters are they being put in place to avoid the risk of the guarantee ultimately needing to be called upon. The specifics of this bill in the context of this initiative provide for the appropriation for any claims that are made as a result of the guarantee which is given by the Commonwealth government in relation to the securities which are issued by OzCar to the four major banks. Of course, that guarantee is critical in this whole package in order to attract the AAA rating of Standard and Poor's. In providing for this appropriation, there is not a specific limit established within this bill. The extent of any claims on the public purse will obviously depend on the extent to which the guarantee is called upon where any loans that are issued by OzCar are not fulfilled. So it is impossible to state exactly what appropriation, if any, will ultimately be required. But the contingent liability associated with this is estimated to be $550 million. That equates to 45 per cent of the remaining GE and GMAC loan books and 85 per cent of the Ford Credit loan book. This is a very significant initiative. It one that was put in place very rapidly and very efficiently in order to deal with a crisis that was imposing itself on a very important segment of our society. Were a situation to have occurred such that significant numbers of car dealerships found themselves in a position where they were unable to trade, that would have resulted in a significant loss of employment throughout the economy, particularly in regional areas such as Geelong. So it is very much to the government's credit that it was able to act as quickly as it did, similar to the way in which it acted quickly in dealing with this global economic crisis more broadly. The government acted swiftly in providing security in our economy through the bank guarantees and the various stimulus packages, and this has provided a means by which we have been able to guide our economy and our society through a very difficult time. This is an important initiative for a very critical sector that is already doing it tough. The year-to-date figures for car sales in Australia through April this year show that 276,935 vehicles were sold, compared to sales of 347,514 vehicles through April last year. That is a difference of 70,579 cars or a decline in sales over that period of 20.3 per cent. This is a sector of our economy that is already doing it tough as a result of the global economic recession. It is very important that it does not receive a double blow through the credit crunch which is at the heart of the global economic recession. This bill plays an important part in a very important initiative to ensure that this sector does not receive that double blow. For that reason, I commend it to the House.",131
190,Mr TUCKEY,GUARANTEE APPROPRIATION,"O'Connor) (5.39 pm)As the member for Corio informed the House, the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009 is necessary and urgently required legislation simply beis cause certain providers of capital, based primarily in the United States, decided that they had to repatriate the funds they had available to head office. As a consequence, the Australian retail and wholesale vehicle industry found itself in a position of not being able to finance even its stock on hand, which is known as floor plan. The government, by a fairly simple mechanism of guaranteeswith a contingent liability which, in this case, I doubt will be called upon-was able to give security to the industry. As the second reading speech informed us, even at this stage a number of car retailers and wholesalers are finding that alternative opportunities are appearing. It has always been a very profitable sector for the finance industry, and within Australia it is surprising how few people do not pay their debts of this nature. It is not a bad bet, because an interesting aspect of this particular form of financing is that the security of a vehicle is well known. More particularly, as I experienced for many years in the earthmoving industry, we would go to the finance companies to finance things like Caterpillar graders that were often worth more when you traded them in than the cash price you paid for them originally. We were still charged usurious interest rates on an item that was better than a block of land. It had a fairly well defined value and the only risk, really, was that it might not have been adequately maintained during its working life. It tended to maintain its value in nominal terms and, of course, if it could not be sold in one locality, then, unlike a block of land or a building, it could be shifted to where the market was more prosperous. I just make that point in passing because I remember cursing that on many occasions when I was in the earthmoving business. The reality is that quick action by the government on this occasion was appropriate, but it did not load future generations with a potential debt. In racing terms, it was a pretty good bet. The member for Corio, who has now left the chamber, made two remarks that I thought were interesting, considering my wider view of the future of the motor car industry and, more particularly, vehicle manufacturing in Australia. He talked about the industry doing it tough. Significantly and more particularly, whilst Australian manufactured vehicles are primarily sold into the fleet market, that is an area where suddenly businesses are saying: ‘Yes, things are tough. We'll extend the useful life of vehicles we have'-under whatever arrangement. So there are fewer sales occurring. The member for Corio also talked about a double blow. To the government's credit, there was no double blow in the availability of finance in this ticular sector. In the much publicised debate on emissions trading schemes that we listened to yesterday it was pointed out that the Obama administration has now managed to get some terms of reference-if you like, a draft billthrough its own party structures, which are much more flexible and fluid in America compared with the discipline that applies to major parties in this country. They have put through a set of issues that will eventually be debated in congress. That probably will be made even more generous to the manufacturing sector in that country but, as it exists, a trade exposed industry-and for the purposes of this debate read ‘car manufacturing'-will get a 100 per cent exemption. All such trade exposed industries under the bill at its present level of generosity will get that particular exemption. Under the draft bill, they will also have it for about three or four times longer than is proposed under the legislation introduced into this place. One only has to look at the fact that, with billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, the major American owned manufacturers are being restructured, and under those arrangements it is patently obvious that some of the huge cost burdens they have carried-for instance, their health funds, which I have read previously cost about US$1,500 a motor car-are to be restructured. There are discussions about how that is happening, and one proposal might be that a union health fund gets a lot of shares and will then rely on the profitability of the company to fund the health services of their members. Nevertheless, the cost of building motor vehicles in the US is going to fall. As the wider implications for these companies-like GM, which it appears is going to sell its German manufacturing arm, Opel, as part of its restructure-become known, parthe question in the boardrooms in Detroit is going to be about this. ‘We are now restructured and we now make vehicles cheaper, and the more we can sell anywhere in the world, the cheaper they will get,' they will say. What is more, it has always been the case in the motor car industry that the price has been relevant to the local preparedness to pay, and the profits have been averaged across different markets. So the board members over there are saying: ‘Things are starting to look pretty good. Furthermore, those dopey cows down in Australia have decided to increase the operating cost of General Motors Holden. We can export our cars over there to the advantage of our business here in Detroit and sell them much more competitively than trying to continue to make them in Australia.' Now what does that mean? What if the board of Ford are coming to the same conclusion? Then there is whatever state Chrysler might be in and whether it is going to be Fiat or whatever. I do not know how other people are experiencing their driving at present but I keep noticing more and more American built Jeeps on the roads of Perth. They are fully built up vehicles coming from somewhere else and competing, I would imagine, with the Ford Territory. Recently they have put out these ‘You can do it' TV as, where they are cutting the prices of all of those vehicles and making them extremely competitive. So what is going to happen? A doing-it-tough double blow. The second component of the double blow has been removed by this legislation, and I welcome it. But there is another time bomb sitting there for the Australian manufacturing industry. Of course we now acknowledge that the Chinese have outgrown tin cans and-this was pointed out to me the other day-where once they were the great international patent infringers of the world, they are now actually having court cases within their own country protecting patent rights. They have proved in so many ways that they just get better at things. I do not care what happens at Copenhagen, but I know they will not penalise their trade exposed industries. Considering my interest in a renewable solution to emissions and in light of the great job opportunities that that would generate as well as, to my mind, cheaper electricityand I might come back to this in a minute-I have read with great interest that they have gone out into the desert on the Silk Road, where the wind has blown sand into people's eyes for centuries, to harvest the wind. They are currently building the longest highvoltage DC line in the world-2,000 kilometres long-so they can better transfer electricity with the minimum loss of energy. It is a 6.6-gigawatt capacity line. That is pretty big. It is twice the generating capacity, by the same measurement, of all Western Australia-and they are building it now. Why are they building it? So that their manufacturing sector on the east coast can have green power from their huge hydro resources and these wind and other resources. So, whilst they might go along to Copenhagen and accept some targets, they are not going to do it at the cost of their industry. Some will hoo-ha this little lecture that I am giving to the House-typically, there are not many around to listen to it-but I have a very funny feeling that I will be very sadly saying, ‘I told you so,' as I have done on other occasions with speeches made in this place, when all these circumstances come together and the owners of General Motors Holden and Ford Australia and probably Toyota too say, ‘Sorry, we've got this ultracheap means of transporting fully built up cars around Australia'-you only have to see those huge ships coming in now-‘so we're not going to manufacture in Australia.' Mitsubishi have made that decision and Nissan made it years ago. The GMs and all those are going to have a tough enough time anyway, and I want to talk a little bit about that on the other side of the ledger. Those companies face extinction if one additional ounce of burden is placed upon them, and let us hope their unions do not go silly under the laws that will come in in a month or so. I have written to the Secretary of the AWMU drawing this matter to his attention, and not in a dog-in-the-manger way but enclosing what I have been promoting-which I could never get into the head of John Howard, I have to say-as the solution to the climate change issue without destroying the economy. I will be interested to know if this fellow has real concern for his workforce, which totals about 40,000 or 50,000 Australians who are involved just in the vehicle manufacturing sector, to say nothing of the retail sector, which this legislation has a lot to say about and who number even more, although they will survive. They will still be here and they will be okay, because they will be selling fully built up American motor cars. People will still buy them and they are going to be better and cheaper-their price will line up with that of the Chinese. It is going to be tough anyway, but why would this parliament be contemplating a set of rules when the simple solution for those most affected is to pack up and go somewhere where there is a better deal, at whatever level that might be? I just cannot believe the carpetbaggers at the Business Council, who only see the opportunity to have a new derivative so they can trade in fresh air. They say, ‘We want certainty.' I know what ‘certainty' is. They want to know whether they are going to leave town or not. It is not: ‘Once we have the certainty we will go back to our shareholders in this economic climate and ask them for a few more billion dollars so we can reconstruct our industries.' No, they will just run them down, and they will otherwise start investing overseas. It gets pretty dreadful, because we have very few other problems in Australia like what I call Kakadon't. Some of you may have read the article in the Australian about Kakadu: is it Kakadu or Kakadon't? The journalist came down on the side of Kakadon't. That is a disease throughout Australia. It was a challenge that we failed. It is lenge I hope the Western Australian government is going to do something about, and we got a little bit of encouragement the other day that we are actually going to get an LNG plant in the Kimberley. But here we are with this government still sneaking along under the minister for the environment, still holding a heritage inquiry into 6,000 kilometres of rock and sand called the Kimberley, which includes the occasional waterfall. And there sits an energy generation capacity equal to all the energy consumed in Australia. Now we have another option. Instead of pumping gas down pipelines-and the existing pipeline between the Pilbara and Perth consumes 250 megawatts of energy in pumping the gas, with 700,000 tonnes of emissions-the first thing we should be doing now in meeting the additional power supplies of Perth and the nation is generating gas energy in the Pilbara for the use of the Pilbara and for transmission with highvoltage DC to the Western Australian grid and onwards to South Australia and the rest of Australia. People-Rex Connor and others-talked of putting a pipeline across the middle of Australia. Much better: just send the electricity. But, having done that and extending that to the LNG place at James Price Point, you are on the doorstep of the tidal region, and then it is attractive for some investor to do it. I just want to say that this car industry is under dreadful threat-a double blow, according to the member for Coriobecause of other legislation in this place that probably will not work and that is the wrong solution. I want to make another point in the few minutes I have left to speak tonight. I took an immediate positive view to the GM crash. One of their announcements was: ‘We're going to drop Pontiac.' One of their major Pontiac brands happens to be made in Ausa chaltralia-over here it was known as the Camaro. More particularly, and I drive one, there is the six-litre SS V8. In writing to the chief executive of GMH, I told him what a good motor car it was. I listed myself as some sort of expert, having once owned a Delahaye, once smashed up a Lamborghini, driven just about every imported American car from time to time-and I forgot to tell him I had also had a Jaguar and a Mercedes. I think I am some sort of judge and I think that car stands up very well in that company. I said to him: ‘What are we going to do? Are we just going to cop it, or do you write to GM in Detroit and say: “Send the Pontiac brand name out to Australia. If you don't want to retail our cars, we'll sell them on the internet.”' That sounds funny and silly, doesn't it? But tell that to Dell, and tell it the people who sell their second-hand vehicles on the internet. When you start talking about maintenance and all of that, in my state we have a crowd called Auto Masters. They are a chain, a franchise, of repairmen. I do not know if they are in other states, or how many there would be in America. If you can escape the ETS, there are opportunities for Australia's manufacturers to become niche marketers with special vehicles. Yes, they use a bit more petrol, but some people want them, and rear-wheel drive is another factor. That is my proposition of a positive nature. All that, of course, disappears if the ETS drives these companies back to their base in America and these other places. I just think that is so important. You do not need finance for motor cars you do not make. There is a real challenge there. I appreciate that the father-in-law of the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia, who is sitting at the table, would be cheering with every word I am saying. He has this funny belief that, in the Labor Party, jobs for workers come first, and he and I took a strong view in that regard in protecting forest workers' jobs. We lost the jobs, and we lost 170 lives recently because of their absence from the forests, which is another tragedy. Anyway, my best wishes to your father-in-law. (Time expired)",134
191,Mr HAYES,GUARANTEE APPROPRIATION,"The Australian automotive industry plays a critical role in the Australian economy. It provides many thousands of jobs and generates a great deal of income from exports. It is a major investor in R&D, and its activities have extensive linkages to other sectors of the community. It is for these reasons that I rise today to support the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009. The OzCar special purpose vehicle initiative is designed to provide crucial wholesale to floor plan finance to eligible car dealerships to ensure that the departure of GE Money Motor Solutions and GMAC and the liquidity challenges Ford Credit currently faces do not result in the closure of hundreds of otherwise viable car dealers across the nation, which would result in the loss of many thousands of jobs. This initiative was put in place by this government to stabilise that part of the industry. The special purpose vehicle initiative will protect jobs across the Australian car industry, and it will certainly have an impact in local communities in these very challenging times-and earlier in the debate we heard the member for Corio speak about the experience in his electorate, which is centred on Geelong. As I said, vibrant and viable car dealerships are critical to this industry. The measures put forward in this bill are essential to minimise the adverse impact on the car industry and many regional communities as a result of the serious liquidity pressures confronting various finance providers, which has resulted in the exit of the two largest financiers in the motor vehicle finance industry. We know that car dealerships generally cannot remain in business without a viable floor plan financing arrangement. This is not a plan for retail businesses; this is not some form of guarantee that allows people to expand their businesses. This plan allows car dealers to guarantee their floor plan in terms of the wholesaling of vehicles to ensure that they are in a position to locally market vehicles and distribute them to customers. Today I have taken the opportunity to talk to a number of the vehicle dealerships in my area-as I am sure a lot of the members participating in the discussion on this bill will have done. I have spoken to small, medium and large dealers, some of whom have been in my area for 20 years or more. These include Clintons, the Paul Wakeling Motor Group, MCGRATHs at Liverpool and Peter Warren at Liverpool, which also owns Macarthur Ford. These are all significant businesses in Campbelltown and Liverpool. These local dealerships across my electorate employ many hundreds of local people, if not more, in their workshops and as salespeople and as marketing people. They also contribute a lot to my community. On many occasions I have spoken in this place about what a number of these people contribute to organisations such as Lifeline, Kids for Macarthur and Macarthur Disability Servicesand others have contributed to the local ball club, Wests Tigers, of which we are truly proud. These car dealerships have a central focus on the areas that they service. They are not just the people you go to every time you are fortunate enough to be in a position to get a new vehicle; they are people you see contributing positively to the community they serve. These people help us to change and improve the lives of many people in our community, some of whom have been dealt a not very positive hand in life. The people who work for and own these dealerships have made significant contributions and continue to do so. On a personal note, I value the contribution that vehicle dealerships make to my community-and, like many members on this side of the House, I have taken the time to speak about their contributions. In my disthose cussions with dealers today, I found them very optimistic about the actions taken by this government in relation to securing the viability of the Australian automotive industry. Some of them are potentially exposed to risk following the withdrawal of the two largest automotive financiers. The government has been working with the four leading Australian banks-ANZ Bank, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac-as well as various other financiers to put in place an arrangement that can provide critical wholesale floor plan finance to those eligible car dealers who have been left stranded as a result of the exit from the Australian market of GE Money Motor Solutions and GMAC. Although the market has responded very positively since January 2009, with a very large proportion of former GE and GMAC sponsored dealerships securing finance through other providers, there are still some dealerships that will need to rely on the special purpose vehicle-including those from footFord Credit-over the next 12 months to remain in business. A key role of the Australian government is to provide a Commonwealth guarantee on certain securities issued by the special purpose vehicle that were initially risk rated at below AAA. The Commonwealth's guarantee will ensure that those securities are rated AAA, thereby allowing the four participating banks to buy them and contribute liquidity to the special purpose vehicle, which will then be lent to eligible car dealers. The eligible car dealerships under this scheme are those which have been financed by GE Money Motor Solutions and GMAC or which are currently funded by Ford Credit. The OzCar SPV is a short-term arrangement, designed to reach fruition in 12 months. It is designed to address the critical market failures now. If left unaddressed, failures have the very real potential to cripple our industry. I want to make it abundantly clear that the special purpose vehicle will only provide finance to wholesale floor plans. As I said a little earlier, it is not there to provide liquidity for retail lending. I mentioned earlier the positive comments from the local dealers I had the opportunity of telephoning today. They are also echoed by the Executive Director of the Motor Trades Association of Australia. The media statement issued by Michael Delaney, the head of the association, on 5 December 2008 thanks the Australian government on the announcement of establishing this special purpose vehicle and states: Absent these measures we believed and were able to document to Government that Australia would have lost five hundred car dealers from its near to 1,500 new car franchised dealers, with 3,500 outlets, would have lost up to 75,000 jobs and would have seen most all of the present stock of motor vehicles fire-saled through liquidations at anything up to below 50 percent of the list price. would have wiped-out the valuations of all new and used cars, for all persons and parties holding a motor vehicle as an asset and in many cases could have caused a cascading call for more security from the financiers of those parties. That is certainly an endorsement from the Motor Trades Association of Australia. This guarantee that the Australian government has made will hopefully not be called upon. Hopefully people are able to continue their trade. But they can now do so in the confidence that this vehicle is there to assist in that regard. As I indicated, whilst I may not have a motor vehicle manufacturer in my area, as has the member for Corio or my colleagues from South Australia who are also more than well aware of the significance of the manufacturing of motor vehicles in their state, I certainly see and value the contribution that the motor vehicle dealerships have made to my local community in Werriwa. I see and value the amount of time, effort and money they put into the training and development of staff and the overall contributions they make through being good corporate citizens throughout many of our regions. I commend the bill to the House.",138
192,Mrs HULL,GUARANTEE APPROPRIATION,"I rise to set the scene on the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009. On the surface it seems to be something that is going to provide significant support and is going to get a lot of our dealerships out of trouble. Sadly, the case in rural and regional Australia is that this is not happening. I will set the scene with my email to the Department of the Treasury on 20 March wherein I say: We have a crisis in car dealer finance for many dealers covering around 80-90 dealers in NSW as determined by the NSW MTA. It appears that there is no finance for these dealers as a result of GM removing their finance. The dealers have been working with MTA to try to get other fiThat nance options through St George and Esanda, however the dealers have now been told by Esanda that the applications that have been put to the finance companies particularly from marginal rural and regional dealers as a result of the ongoing drought, have not been approved because the Special Purpose Fund appears not to be operating. The real crisis I have is one dealer at the moment in one of my communities who has been in a family business for 100 years and who has been dramatically affected by the drought period so much so that he has qualified under the drought program. He is at this moment in Sydney trying to get some help but to no avail. He cannot sell cars because the banks are not wanting to fund the sales or the floor plan, that means that the 10 full time jobs will go as early as the end of this month. He has been battling with this since GM removed finance. I go on to say: I have spoken this morning with an officer in your office and explained the urgency of this issue. I would so appreciate some assistance in someone ringing the dealer to guide him through the options that he may not know about as per my discussion with the officer in your office. Sadly, most of the finance companies seemed to be saying to the dealers across my electorate that the special purpose fund, about which we are speaking this evening, was certainly not operational. It was not about what you knew or how you presented yourself as to whether or not you would be able to get access to this fund. It was almost about who you knew. Let me remind the House that the bill was: … limited to guaranteeing securities that the OzCar Trust facility issues which are risk rated below ‘AAA' by Standard & Poors. It appropriates funds to enable claims to be paid under the Deed of Guarantee in respect of the Australian Government Guarantee to support interim funding to car dealerships, executed on behalf of the Commonwealth on 23 December 2008. The Bill provides an appropriation for the purpose of paying any claims pursuant to the Deed of Guarantee. The appropriation is not subject to a specific monetary limit. The overall contingent liability for the Australian Government is estimated to be around $550 million comprising around 45 percent of the remaining GE and GMAC loan books and 85 per cent of the Ford Credit loan book. Under the Dealer Eligibility Criteria the SPV will only be able to advance funds if it is satisfied that the dealership is not subject to any insolvency event. So that was the bill as we saw it last year. Then came the email that I sent off to Treasury, saying: ‘I have a crisis. I've been told that this fund is available. I have information from the government that says this special purpose fund is operational. Yet the people that I represent are being told by the finance companies: “Sorry about that. We are not getting any money out of that fund; it is not operational.” Can I explain to the House the current financial situation of regional towns, particularly in the electorate of Riverina. Apart from the city of Wagga Wagga, the economies of all towns and villages in my electorate of Riverina are underpinned by agriculture or value-added industry resulting and arising from agriculture. Agriculture has an overriding hand in the make-up of all of my regional communities. Many facets of these towns are either indirectly affected by, or can be solely attributed to, the state of our local agriculture and climatic conditions-currently, drought. Some of these facets are, for example, the sociodemographics, consumer confidence and population changes. For the past seven years-continuing to this very day-when we have had floods and heavy rains in most areas across Australia, the electorate of Riverina has received no reprieve from the drought. It is still the most amazingly drought-stricken area that one could see. Just this weekend, when I was out in my electorate, I was confronted by a dust storm that was almost interminable, maybe 200 feet high, rolling across every town and community. That is the kind of environment that we are experiencing at the moment. A downturn in the economy is nothing new for many of the towns and villages in my electorate. The continuing drought had already shaken our consumer confidence well before the financial crisis hit. As I said, my electorate experienced seven years of ongoing drought before this global financial crisis. They were hurting big time. The employers in all of the towns across my electorate are brave and absolutely stoic people and have continued to employ their employees regardless. It is the employers' homes that are mortgaged. It is the employers that go home late at night and cannot sleep because all of their material possessions are on the line. And they still guarantee the employment of people in their local communities. We already had this major drought problem when the luxury vehicle tax was introduced by this government. That was supposed to pin down and target those great big rich people in the community with luxury cars. It actually also targeted those car dealers who required four-wheel drives, which came in under luxury car tax, to make a living. Rather than those exclusive dealers that you see on many of the roads in Sydney, who provide Porsches, Mercs and a million other luxury cars, it was the dealers in rural and regional Australia, particularly in my electorate of Riverina, that were hit hard by that luxury car tax and by having the price of their vehicles rise as well. Those very dealers underpin employment in most of the towns across my electorate, providing a large amount of employment. So the car dealers had gone through seven difficult years of drought, then they were hit by the luxury car tax, and then along came the economic crisis. They are in enormously difficult circumstances. We thought we had a crisis beforewe haven't seen anything yet. The impact on our economy and our regional businesses, primarily these car dealerships, was absolutely extraordinary. They were being kicked when they were already down. In one of the towns in my electorate, a locally owned car dealership actually qualified under the drought program for drought support assistance. This shows the impact that the drought was already having on our local car dealerships, without even factoring in the global financial crisis. The withdrawal of finance by GE Money Motor Solutions and GMAC was, in simple terms, the last straw for many of those dealerships in my electorate. The coalition, and particularly I, were very disappointed in the government's inability to address the serious problems that the car industry was, and still is, experiencing. We have this bill, but, ously, it is not working for many of the people who desperately require assistance. It has already been exacerbated by the now infamous unlimited bank guarantee. Prior to the government's announcement in December, the coalition had called on the government to provide urgent support to car dealerships right around the country. I was one of the people calling for assistance, not for the big manufacturing industries out there with multitudes of employees under the one roof but for the multiple employers right across Australia that desperately required that assistance and support. I was very happy to see this particular program put in place because I believed it was the answer we required. But, as I have mentioned, it did not come to fruition. I have maintained the links with my communities and I understand what is happening on the ground. The message coming from car dealerships is, simply, ‘Help!' There is a strong cry for help, at this very moment, on this very day. Today my office has spoken with an owner-operator of a car dealership in my electorate. That owner-operator has explained his circumstances to us. From 200405 to 2009 their sales have dropped by 60 per cent. They had 19 staff members in 2004; they have eight currently. They believe this is a consequence of the drought and, in their opinion, it is significantly associated with and underpinned by the financial crisis. His business has no debt-it owns the building, it owns all of the cars and it has substantial savings, so it is not at risk of going bankrupt. Since GMAC withdrew, this businessman has not been able to get anyone to take his business on. Esanda, St George and Capital Finance have all rejected his claim. Capital Finance said that he did not meet the criteria and that his business could not give them enough retail paper. The reason was that his seribusiness was too far out, too small-they were not interested. He could only supply them with half a million dollars in contracts per year. They wanted half a million dollars per month, in our drought stricken region. Esanda and St George gave similar rejections. This person has been financing the sales himself. He believes the SPV does not work. I make this appeal to the government because I think the intentions of the government may have been very honourable. I think the intentions of the government were very good. There is a lot of material that precedes the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009. There are a lot of explanatory notes and deeds of guarantees. There are quite a lot of hurdles and challenges that have to be met-major dramas that have to be overcome. The legal and contractual arrangements that underpin this bill are very technical. The government does not pay out any money; it just gives guarantee support of moneys to be paid out. I am wondering just how much of the available funds is actually being accessed. It would be great to know just how much of those available funds is going out to those dealers who are in crisis. Seriously, they want us to write half a milto lion dollars of contracts per month in rural communities! This particular business underpins probably one of the largest employers in the community. Generally, how these guys work is that a dealer with a dealership in a given community goes out and takes a dealership in another community and provides employment in other local communities, where it is very difficult to get employhouses ment. I remember my conversations and the absolute crisis calls that I spoke about in the beginning of my speech. When I banged that email out to Treasury I was saying: there is a crisis here. I had another guy on the phone from the streets in Sydney, desperately trying to save the employment of 10 staff members in a business that has been in the family for 100 years. He was not a Johnny-come-lately fly-by-nighter, not a person who does not understand business structure or the way in which business works-this family had been in business for 100 years. The business was an institution and was employing 10 people in full-time jobs at the time. This was the other man I was referring to in this community, with his dealership, back in March when I sent this emergency email. I think it has to be recognised that there has been some slowness, some reticence, some lack of interest in ensuring that those people in rural and regional Australia are entitled to get some support as well. Those people in drought affected communities are entitled to maybe have just a little bit of leniency on these criteria. As I have explained, the person that we spoke to today is not going bankrupt-he owns his building, he owns his stock and he has eight staff members still employed out of the 19 that he did have employed. But he is too small. I would urge that the government consider and understand this issue and move address it, because it is simply unjust, unfair and quite discriminatory. I am sure that there was not an understanding of these types of issues when this scheme was first put together. It would be great if the Prime Minister and the Treasurer could see their way clear to change some of these criteria to give those people a break, those people who are still employing people, who still have their mortgaged in most cases and who are doing it tough but are still committed to jobs. I understood that that was what we were all about in responding to this financial crisis: retaining jobs, jobs, jobs. These people are retaining jobs, jobs, jobs; but they are retaining them without the assistance of this program.  The Rudd government has real cred when it comes to supporting Australian small businesses in these most difficult of economic times. Every right-minded MP in this House would support our budget initiatives to bolster business, support the economy and protect jobs-measures like the 50 per cent tax break for eligible assets, $10 million to help small business go online, R&D tax credits for smalland mid-sized businesses, changes to PAYG instalments to ensure better cashflow for small business, and, of course, the stimulus payments we delivered to millions of Australians which then flowed directly to the retail and service sectors. These are practical initiatives that are helping sustain tralian businesses and support Australian jobs. It is in this same spirit that I rise to port the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, and I do so knowing your background. It is a bit strange for me, a lawyer turned politician, to be talking about used car dealers. I think of when they do those rankings of professions in terms of how people are trusted. If we look at politicians, lawyers and car dealers, I think that is about the rolled gold trifecta at the bottom. Perhaps threw in a journalist it would be a slam misere. Leaving that aside, obviously the Australian motor vehicle industry is a very important industry. It employs around 66,000 Australians. It generates billions of dollars in exports and is a crucial partner for many other industries. I see it nearly every day when I go home and I drive past the facade of motor vehicle retailers at the Moorooka Magic Mile. I look beyond all of them and I see all of these other industries-a plethora of motor vehicle support businesses. Where I live is just around the corner from the Moorooka Magic Mile of motors. This iconic strip of car sales businesses on Ipswich Road is well known in Brisbane, and perhaps all over Queensland and even Northern New South Wales. I would suggest that the Moorooka Magic Mile is Australia's most famous car sales precinct and the best. If you ask any of the retailers along that strip they will tell you it is home to Australia's largest range of new and used vehicles-businesses like Brisbane Proton, Barton's Holden, Just Nice Cars, Moorooka Nissan and Hyundai, Motorama Auto Superstore, Motorama Mitsubishi, Motorama Toyota, QLD 4WD Sales, Salters of Moorooka, Westpoint Autos, Rod's Public Wholesale, XCarz and Kar King, to name but a few. And Aus- then there are all those other car support companies that I mentioned earlier. All of these motor vehicle businesses-some big, supsome small-help stimulate jobs and trade in my electorate. Unfortunately, as some of the earlier speakers have mentioned, Australian car dealerships have suffered collateral damage due to the global economic crisis. The pressure on global credit markets-and consequently our own domestic credit marketshas seen two motor finance companies, GE Money Motor Solutions and GMAC, leave if I the market and another, Ford Credit, endure extreme pressure. Without finance to get vehicles on the showroom floor, most car dealerships simply cannot remain in business. The latest sale figures give us a grim picture of the impact of the global downturn on our local car industry. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries reported 64,000 new car sales in April 2009, down from 84,000 in April 2008. That is a slump of 23.8 per cent. The impact is even more severe for luxury cars, which saw a 40 per cent drop in sales in April, year on year. This morning I spoke to Alex Salter from Salters of Moorooka. Salters of Moorooka is a well-known used car dealer that has been selling used cars on the magic mile for 34 years. Alex is a very experienced and wellrespected operator, and he said that his profits are down around 40 per cent. He only sells used cars and uses his own stock, so he has not been as affected as much as the ers that sell new cars that have had some of the finance problems. But he did assure me that the global recession has seriously affected a lot of other dealers that he is in communication with. Thankfully, for me, there is still a lot of magic left in my magic mile, but there are other MPs who could not say the same thing. This morning I also spoke to someone that you might know, Deputy Speaker, Ross Tait, who runs not only Ballina Toyota but also Ross Tait Toyota out in St George. I have known him for a long time and, as this legislation will benefit all of the electorates in Australia, I thought it would be appropriate to seek some background from a regional retailer, not just someone blessed enough to be on the Moorooka Magic Mile or in my electorate. I cannot really speak for Ballina because I do not know that part of the world, but I do know the bush around St George very well and it is probably the same as many other National Party electorates-or even Labor Party electorates like Leichhardt, Flynn, Capricornia or maybe even Blair. Ross Tait, from Ross Tait Toyota, told me that most of the dealers he knows have been really struggling for the last 12 months. However, he also said-and this is very important-that sales have doubled since the Rudd government's economic stimulus strategy came into play. Prior to our economic stimulus strategy, which many people in the House voted against, Ross had not had to lay anybody off. Unlike the example given the previous speaker, he has been able to keep everybody because he said they were too hard to get in the bush and so he was trying to hold onto them. However, such tough decisions were on the horizon until things started to change a few weeks ago. He said the last six weeks had been particularly tive and he wanted me to thank Kevin Rudd deal- personally on his behalf. So thank you, Prime Minister. Today when I was talking to Ross Tait I had to interrupt the phone call to run down here to the chamber because some people in the House were playing silly buggers with quorums. In the time that I was away from that phone call, which was only about 15 minutes, Ross Tait made a vehicle sale to a small business man. It was to a bloke called Peter Haslem of Haslem Agriculture, which I understand is a bug-checking business. Peter Haslem told Ross that he wanted me to know that he would not have bought the vehicle but for the Rudd government's tax breaks for small businesses. So thank you, Treasurer, and thank you, Prime Minister. The people from the bush thank you. When the market fails that is what good government does. Responsible governments step in. And that is what the Rudd government is doing. Obviously, the last thing we want to see is the closure of otherwise viable car dealerships. It would not only be bad for those businesses and their employees; it is also bad for consumers and would impact on other areas of the economy-especially in rural communities, as the previous speaker noted. This bill before the House will breathe life back into Australian car dealerships by ensuring there is finance available for those who need it. At the end of 2008, the Treasurer announced the creation of the OzCar special purpose vehicle to provide finance to eligible car dealerships. For those people that have just begun listening, I should clarify that the OzCar special purpose vehicle is not some sort of Aston Martin that Q supplies to James Bond. It is not that sort of vehicle. It is obviously a financial vehicle. The SPV will raise funds by selling securities to the four major posibanks, which will then lend those funds to car dealerships. These funds will be available to dealerships that had been financed by GE Money Motor Solutions or GMAC or who are currently financed by Ford Credit. This bill introduces a guarantee to ensure that securities issued by the SPV that would be rated below AAA are in fact rated AAA. In other words, the Commonwealth government will take on the credit risk to ensure that car dealers can access finance to keep cars in their showrooms and car yards. OzCar will provide loans up until 30 June 2010. This is not a free-for-all; it is a sensible sponse to the market failure. SPV finance is available for the wholesale purchase of vehicles. It is not available as finance for retail lending as there are many other lending options still available to consumers. Dealerships will need to prove that they have a viable business case and an ability to repay the loan-that is of course prudent as we are talking about a possible call on the public purse-and I understand that auditors will monitor stock management of dealers accessing SPV finance. There will be no fee for the guarantee as we do not want to see extra costs passed on to consumers. The guarantee is there to stimulate liquidity in the market but of course, ideally, the guarantee will never be called upon. Nevertheless, this is good policy. As I said from the outset, this bill is about providing a buffer for businesses and jobs and ensuring that our car industry can ride out the credit crunch and the economic slowdown. We need to ensure that there is still sparkle and magic at the ‘Moorooka magic mile' and all similar places. I commend the bill to the House.",140
193,Mr BILSON,GUARANTEE APPROPRIATION,"I listened with interest to the speakers' contributions to the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009 and I recall how well advocates are able to leave out important parts of the story as they extol the virtue of something before this House. This bill amounts to a soccer player or footballer, who has scored an own goal and is facing the relegation of their team, working hard to at least assist someone else in scoring a goal for their team so that they are not relegated. That is what is happening here. What occurred with the poor overreach by the Rudd government in the way it handled the bank guarantee issue was that it dried up renon-primary bank funding sources for so many other areas of enterprise in our economy. One of them was new car dealerships. The Prime Minister did not follow the wise advice and the considered proposals of the opposition for a limited and targeted guarantee and instead guaranteed everything in the hands of our major banks. This meant that anyone else who was in the lending game and trying to attract deposits to support their loan book was left out in the cold. It was the Rudd government's own goal that put the Australian economy-in this case the new car industry-behind the mark and facing relegation. The Rudd government subsequently recognised its error in its intervention in the financing markets and tried to at least pass the ball in an assist to the car industry so that the car industry can assist itself to score a goal and avoid relegation and get back into the game. That is what this bill is about. It is an assist after an own goal. The bill specifically tries to provide a facility for financing motor vehicles on the floor of new car dealer showrooms where they are used to show the range of vehicles that are available, hopefully, to tantalise consumers and enable dealers to get on with selling cars and supporting the car industry and all those involved in servicing and maintaining vehicles and in the retail and wholesale improvement and after-market management of our vehicle fleet. This bill does that by putting a standing appropriation in place that enables claims to be paid under a deed of guarantee. The deed will see the major banks bring together the finance and then make it available for funding of car dealerships. This deed was executed by the Commonwealth with the banks in December 2008. The execution of the deed occurred some weeks after the 5 December 2008 announcement by the Treasurer that, in order to compensate for the own goal and the very damaging impact of the poor management of the banking guarantee by the Rudd government, this special purpose vehicle funding instrument would be available through Australia's big four banks to provide liquidity to eligible car dealers who were left without financing because their traditional finance providers had been frozen out of the marketplace. These finance providers were finding it very difficult to attract the funds that they could offer that financing because they, unlike the big banks, were not included in the bank deposits guarantee that the Rudd government put in place. So you can see the course of events: an overreach by an inexperienced government-Prime Minister Rudd is not known for his economic literacy and certainly does not seem to have sound and grounded economic principles that he sticks with-to almost a one-upmanship on what the opposition had put forward, and a lack of understanding of how that action would reverberate through the finance sector. And here we are today discussing a remedy to that own goal, which we hope will assist the car industry. Those actions and the inability of other non-guaranteed deposit takers to then provide finance facilities for activities like the new car industry are the reasons that we are here today. The two main companies, GE Money Motor Solutions-which is a subsidiary of GE Money, which is in turn a division of GE Capital, which is one of the four main businesses of General Electric-and GMAC Australia Ltd, and, more recently, Ford Credit, are feeling the consequences of the Rudd government's overreach on bank deposits. The circumstances that arose were very vivid in my electorate. As the member for Moreton and the member for Riverina commented, it certainly reverberated through an important part of our local economy. The selling, reselling, servicing, improvement and after-market enhancement of motor vehicles and vehicle LPG conversions are all very important parts of the local economy and are major employers. When new car dealers could not afford to maintain their floor stock it had profound implications for employment and economic activity in my so electorate. Down Wells Road, the Nepean Highway and other areas where there is a congregation of car dealers you saw large areas of pavement with no vehicles on them. To try to get through the storm that had been created by the Rudd government they downsized the amount of floor stock they held. What that meant was, clearly, the floor stock that was put to the marketplace was not the best they had available, and some of the costs in that floor stock were proving very difficult for businesses to accommodate. What happened prior to the need for this bill was that new car dealers effectively leased display stock off these financing companies and through those leasing payments paid for the availability of those vehicles. When they were purchased, that sale put in train the full payment for that vehicle and so on. Without having that leasing of the floor stock facility available, you could imagine, less stock was on the floor. What that meant, though, was that dealers then scrambled to try and find financing options to maintain their floor stock under quite different terms and conditions. I mentioned earlier that this announcement was made on 5 December 2008. It is now 27 May 2009. It was characterised as an emergency intervention back in December, and here we are discussing it now. It was characterised as an emergency intervention that had a shelf life of 12 months, and here we are almost half the way through that period debating it in the parliament. It will probably be well over half that emergency period before it actually passes through both houses of this parliament. What has happened in the meantime is that the resourcefulness and the resilience of the car industry and the dealers, in particular, have been tested. I have had dealers explain to me how others have come forward to offer them financing as long as they provided security over personal assets, their firstborn and even family pets-slight exaggeration. The point I am making is that a leasing arrangement for the floor stock has then become a very large financial burden around the necks of individual proprietors as they have sought to show those who have moved into the void after GMAC and GE Money had moved. As they sought to fill that void, new lenders came in and were asking very viable, long-established, successful and profitable businesses, some of quite significant scale with multiple outlets and servicing activities and integrated motor vehicle enterprisesthese were not little shows; these were big shows-to find in some cases seven-digit sums of money themselves to provide as security for the floor stock. These things do not happen overnight. You found proprietors having to reorganise their personal affairs, to take out mortgages or second mortgages on some of their personal assets, including their homes, to look at the way they could bring that kind of capital to the table as security that they could get financing made all the more difficult and all the more expensive because of the way the Rudd government mishandled the bank guarantee. And they were told to do it quickly. Some that I have spoken to said: ‘Yes, we have discussed it within our group and amongst our principals and our families, and we believe we can do all of that. We can bring together that capital.' In some cases it was 40 per cent of the value of the floor stock. This was not a small amount of money. They had agreed that they would go down that pathway, so confident were they about the future of their business and the prospects of the new car industry. But that takes time. Anybody who knows anything about the way businesses operate and the interplay between the business assets and the personal assets knows that if you bring personal assets into secure finance for the business there is a fair amount of work. I suppose that is work generated for the accountancy sector, in getting tax advice and all those things. It does not happen overnight. So I was getting phone calls about what had been covered in the media. What had been covered in the media was the announcement of this ACSA, this financing vehicle, and how it was going to be their salvation. Even those in the industry did not quite know how they were going to access it. Up until last month nobody had accessed this. Up until last month some people offering finance to dealers that were having trouble coming up with this huge chunk of security had not even registered to participate. So we had the announcement but not the actual machinery. In the meantime, since December 2008 until now-and I would imagine we will see it for some weeks to come-you have seen an almost stealth like rationalisation of the industry where atrophy is being used by some with motives that are unclear so to thin out the number of participants in the industry because the finance that was there, that helped them build their businesses and be successful employers, was changed and compromised by the mishandling of the bank guarantee by the Rudd government. So I am pleased this bill is here. Many of the car dealers in my electorate would not be happy with me if I did not ask the question: where has it been? Those car dealers who have had to substantially rearrange their personal affairs to bring together in some cases seven digits plus of personal assets and wealth to secure a line of credit would wonder, ‘Where has this vehicle been?' And we should spare a thought for those that in the interim between the big announcement and now are no longer in the business. We had the announcement but where was the machinery? I hope this works and I hope it provides some support for the dealers who have been left out in the cold by a problem not of their making, a poor handling of the bank guarantee by the Rudd government that compromised the funding streams on which they built successful businesses, in some cases for decades. It is a problem not of their making, but they have been left out in the cold. Here we are on a cold night, just about in winter in Canberra, talking about something that has left them very cold for nearly half the year. I hope this gets rolled out and is made available soon. I hope the terms and conditions that accompany accessing this vehicle are not so punishing and so punitive, like the examples that have been brought to my attention where this becomes a policy action in name only and not a policy action that is offering help. I hope it does offer help, because these people in the industry need that help. We have seen examples of what has been happening in sales trends and the like. That is worrying. I remember in the Howard government years when we had a million vehicles sold in a year. I hear many businesses saying: ‘Please, can we have that again. We will make very good use of those positive times.' But there is a reduction in activity in the industry and this has just been an own goal made by the Rudd government that has made the situation even more difficult. But it is not the only challenge. I was meeting with some of the leading people in the LPG conversion industry that operate out of the Dunkley electorate. They are very talented, very forward looking. They were pleased when the budget was announced that despite the lead-up press-where there were strategic leaks about price gouging and profiteering compromising the LPG conversion grant-the grant hung on. The amount diminished but the industry is keen to make the best of the announcement of the Rudd government. It was put to me that there may be options and opportunities to improve the effectiveness of that grant. Perhaps registered converters with access to registration information could validate the eligibility of people seeking conversions and then have the money paid directly, with those seeking the conversions only paying the gap. That might be attractive, particularly for people without the cash flow to pay for the full conversion upfront. They would only need to pay the difference. In some cases in Victoria, where I think more than 40 per cent of the conversions that have been eligible for this grant have taken place, that might open up an enlarged market. The LP gas industry would benefit from another opportunity that the government has through its own leasing arrangements. I was flabbergasted to learn that people with vehicles contracted through LeasePlan could not get LPG conversions as an after-market improvement. LeasePlan just would not have a bar of it. I found that odd for people who are trying to support the Australian car industry and looking for more environmentally friendly fuel consumption and fuel type. Unless it was done through the original equipment manufacturer, LeasePlan would not support it. That is disappointing and it is an area where government could do something constructive to support the LPG industry. In the few minutes that are available I want to pay tribute to the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, the VACC. They do a terrific job and I certainly value their insights, their perseverance and the quality of their contribution to public debate. You can imagine my surprise when I learnt in the second week of May that the Rudd government decision about its skills council was going to leave the automotive industry out on a limb. I was surprised by that. At a time when I thought competency and skills in an increasingly sophisticated sector such as the automotive industry would be very important and when manufacturing so often holds up the automotive industry as an example of world-class, day-in, day-out endeavour and of what Australia and Australian companies can do, they were left out. Manufacturing Skills Australia, which was going to handle vocational education and training, was not going to include anyone from the Australian automotive industry. They have been soaked up under the broader representation of the Australian Industry Group. I can understand why AiG would think that was a good outcome, and good luck to them. But, as the Executive Director of the VACC, David Purchase, said: This decision has the appearance of a deal and that someone has been blowing in the Minister's ear. He went on to say: This decision does not have the support of any of the key stakeholders. The car manufacturers, component parts suppliers, the automotive retailers and the union, all believe this decision incorrect. … … … VACC considers training to be of the utmost importance. As the largest automotive apprentice employer in Victoria and as one of the State's leading skills training facilitators, we feel passionately about skills training. This decision by Julia Gillard's office has left the Automotive Industry confused. Why would they consider textiles and chemical manufacturers to be aware of skills training needs in the automotive sector? How would manufacturers understand the skills required in automotive retailing? There is no point in making cars if you do not have a skilled aftermarket workforce to sell them, service them and repair them. That is a point that I think many members in this parliament have been making in relation to the debate about the car dealership financing guarantee and the importance of the car industry to local economies.  Nobody understands the training needs of the Australian automotive industry better than the automotive industry itself and that is why the Government must reverse this decision and leave training in the hands of those who know the Automotive Industry the best. The Automotive Industry needs the ability to determine its own training arrangements and that has effectively been taken away from us. All I can say is hear, hear; I agree. This is another opportunity where the government can show that its commitment to the automotive industry goes beyond some of the big public statements, the big media events. Perhaps if the skills council had had a hard hat opportunity that the automotive industry could provide, they might have got a better look in. This decision is a bad decision; it needs to be changed, and I encourage the government to do that. In closing, I hope the Car Dealership Fito be nancing Guarantee begins soon to provide the support it purports to provide. It is great to have this bill before the House on a problem that has been created by the government-an own goal by the government-and that they are now seeking to at least do an assist pass so the automotive industry can help get itself back on track. It was supposed to have had a use-by date of 12 months. We are nearly halfway through that period already and dealers are yet to see a tangible upside from this measure. I hope it gets passed quickly and implemented even more effectively, because the industry needs it. I support the industry in my electorate. I hope they have a prosperous future and that they can get through this difficult period, but they can count on my support, just as the opposition supports this bill.",146
194,Mr TREVOR,GUARANTEE APPROPRIATION,"I rise tonight to speak on my government's Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009. In so doing, I would like to speak about the support that this bill will provide to many smalland medium-sized businesses, not only in the electorate of Flynn but throughout the whole of Australia, particularly in regional Australia, and the boost to business confidence that we are already starting to witness in the car retail tor as a result of early government intervention in this area. In no uncertain terms-and we all accept this-the car industry in Australia is hurting and hurting badly. The global financial crisis has taken a heavy toll on this industry, as with many others. To look at the sales statistics is quite frightening. For example, figures released this month by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries tell a very sobering story. New passenger and commercial motor vehicle sales for April this year have fallen by 23.9 per cent compared to April of last year. On a year-to-date basis, sales have fallen on average by 23.3 per cent compared to the same period last year. I note that among the sharpest falls are sales of vehicles used by many small and medium businesses, such as light buses, trucks and heavy commercial vehicles, with a fall in sales of between 30 to 45 per cent year to date when compared to the 2008 figures. On an annualised basis, it is forecast that some 172,000 fewer vehicles will be sold in 2009 compared to last year. This sharp fall in demand at the shopfront has filtered back to the factory floor with four local Australian vehicle manufacturers reducing production and implementing temporary stand downs, even introducing a four-day week for component manufacturers in an effort to get through these very tough times. As I said earlier, the Australian car industry is hurting very badly and we all recognise that. Falling sales and production figures are not, however, the only bad news that this industry has had to face. You could be mistaken for thinking that matters could not get any worse for this industry, but late last year two large automotive finance companies announced that they would be withdrawing from the Australian market due to the global financial crisis. These companies, as we know, were GE Money Solutions-a part of secthe General Electric group-and GMAC, the automotive finance arm of the General Motors Corporation. It is estimated that up to one-quarter of new car dealerships relied on these two companies to obtain their wholesale floor plan finance. Floor plan finance is a critical aspect of the retail car sector. Without it, the first option is to simply use the businesses cash flow to purchase vehicles for use in show rooms, which is not an option for many in the industry with the high upfront costs required to stock a dealership. The second option is, quite frankly, empty car dealerships with no stock on hand to sell. Both of these options provide little relief to an industry already hit with falling sales of around 20 per cent on average. As we have heard in this House before, the Rudd government believes that it is not only the responsibility of governments to step in when the private sector retreats but the obligation of government to fill this gap. This has been the attitude of my government, which has stimulated our economy in the light of the global financial crisis and this the attitude that the government has taken to help an already suffering car industry and the 66,000 Australians who are employed by it and their families who depend on it. Not only does the Rudd government believe in stepping in when the private sector retreats, we believe in doing so without trepidation and without hesitation to instil confidence where it belongs, in Australian businesses and in Australian homes. In an effort to instil this confidence, ticularly to an industry already hit hard by the global financial crisis, the government has introduced the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Bill 2009, which will help fill the gap left by the departure of GE and GMAC and assist car dealerships access vital floor plan financing. The bill does this by the establishment of a special purpose vehicle, to be known as OzCar, which is a legally established trust that was set up on 2 January 2009. It, along with the support of Australia's main four banks, will provide liquidity to eligible car dealers who would have otherwise been left without floor plan financing arrangements. The government will not be providing direct funding to support OzCar; nor will it become involved in retail financing. Rather, this bill provides for a Commonwealth guarantee on the securities issued by OzCar that are risk rated below AAA by Standard and Poor's. This guarantee will then ensure that all securities issued by OzCar will be rated AAA. The four major Australian banks will then provide the loan funds necessary to facilitate floor plan financing by subscribing to these AAA rated securities issued by OzCar. Credit Suisse is to take the role of the program manager and has entered into contractual arrangement and agreements with Treasury. As the establishment of any trust is a very complex process and as government transis parency and accountability are of the upmost importance, it is pleasing to see that the trust deeds and supporting material that outline the structure of OzCar are available to members of the public on the Treasury web site. Quarterly reports are also expected to be made available to parliament on the performance of OzCar. To help ensure that the risk to taxpayer funds is limited, funds will only be able to be advanced to dealerships that are not subject to any insolvency measpar- ures and loans will be consistent with the usual commercial lending criteria. Under this program, it will be possible to advance loan funds until 30 June 2010 and any notes issued will have a three-year maturity date. The government's guarantee will continue to apply until these notes mature or are retired. This bill will assist the Australian car industry over the next very challenging 12 months and, in conjunction with the Rudd government's 50 per cent small business and general business tax break, provides further support for car industry businesses, many of which are small and medium sized, and many of which are in regional centres, providing employment opportunities for local communities throughout Australia, including rural and regional Australia. It was reported by the Advertiser on 6 May 2009 that new car sales are forecast to recover as a result of the assistance provided by these two government initiatives combined. I have been lucky enough as the federal member for Flynn to have been able to gain first hand insight into the recent challenges faced by the retail car sector by having in my electorate the president of the Motor Traders Association of Queensland, Mr Greg Klease. Mr Klease is a long standing community champion of the people of the Gladstone region, and has been for many years. He has extensive knowledge of the retail car industry, particularly in regional and rural parts Australia. Throughout this difficult time faced by the retail car sector, Mr Klease has kept me reliably informed on various issues that have arisen and that affect his members, including floor plan financing. I thank Mr Klease for his efforts in this regard and for standing up for his members and his association. He has done so with distinction. It is due to this bill's widespread benefit across Australian communities, and the certainty and confidence that this bill helps ate for businesses, employees and households that I wholeheartedly commend the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009 to the House.",151
195,Mrs MARKUS,GUARANTEE APPROPRIATION,"I rise to speak on the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009, its impact on new car dealerships, the importance of those dealerships to local economies and concerns that the Rudd Labor government has not moved quickly enough to help new car dealerships have access to floor plan financing to stay in business. Why has it taken almost six months to throw a lifeline to these businesses? The car sales industry in Australia is, or certainly has been, a vibrant, diverse, sevendays-a-week activity offering the widest possible choice with the best possible prices. That is competition in action, and competition works best when there are many outlets to choose from. But car dealerships are not just about selling cars; they also have an economic ripple effect on local economies because they require a range of products and services supplied by local and regional business. It is about jobs. By the same measure, when a car dealership closes, that ripple effect is felt by all those local and regional businesses. For their own survival, businesses have had to put people off. People have lost their jobs of and, of course, when that happens, families suffer. The simple conclusion is that we need to keep car dealerships operating during these challenging financial times. That is why the coalition will not oppose this bill. There is no doubt about the downturn in new car sales in the past 12 months. New car sales figures released by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries for the month of April 2009 show a fall of 23.9 per cent compared with the same month in 2008. This cre- was confirmed by senior executives of local car dealerships in my electorate of Greenway. I have spoken to a number of local car dealerships in my electorate and they have all reported a significant downturn. I am told that one in four businesses have reduced their stock levels or have let their stock levels run down. This is part of managing cash flow, but reducing the cost of holding goods also reduces their competitive edge by limiting choice. I am extremely concerned about the slow progress of this bill and I encourage my parliamentary colleagues to ensure that the bill is fast-tracked through the House so that eligible car dealership businesses can get the help they need without further delay. This help was announced in December 2008. It is now the end of May 2009, close to six months later. There is the parliamentary process for the bill and then the bank lending process once a business has met the criteria and lodged an application for financing under the guarantee, so there is still some time to go before these businesses that are doing it tough and are on the edge will be relieved of the stress that they are now under. How long are they expected to hold on? And why did it take so long for the government to put this bill before the parliament? Some questions need to be asked about the eligibility criteria for dealerships to cess floor plan financing. Approximately one-quarter of new car dealerships obtained their finance through GE Money Motor Solutions and GMAC Australia, both of whom are exiting the market. This leaves a large number of new car dealerships without finance facilities. I am concerned that dealerships who do not meet the bank eligibility criteria and who cannot find alternative financing will exit the industry, thus reducing competition and impacting on local economies. I urge the banks to ensure a fair go for businesses in establishing the criteria. I also urge the banks to consider the implications of any extra interest charges that may be applied for providing the guarantee. I have been advised by my local car dealerships that recent media speculation reports that banks are looking at imposing an additional two per cent interest rate on top of the current bank bill rate. Competition is great for consumers, but, to maintain a competitive edge, businesses often work on narrow margins. Even though the bank bill rate, like all interest rates, has gone down compared to previous years, it is still above three per cent for the big banks that will be providing the guarantee. If the floor plan financing request is something like $5 million, then two per cent interest above the current bank bill rate will be a huge impost and in the end prove to be unsustainable for many eligible businesses. I would appreciate from the government some clarification of and focus on this very important issue. I am concerned that this bill has a sunset clause of 30 June 2010, a mere 13 months away. We have already seen a delay in the implementation of this support and assistance. There are concerns from within the community that Australia has not yet felt the full effect of the recession. While the new accar sales industry has been thrown a temporary lifeline, what will happen after 30 June 2010 if challenging times worsen? The Rudd Labor government does not have a plan for recovery. They have put forward unrealistic and unbelievable estimates of when Australia will emerge from the huge debt and deficit created by this reckless government. In a short time, the Rudd Labor government has spent the substantial surplus left by the coalition and has gone on a reckless spending spree that has resulted in the worse debt and deficit since World War II. It means that every man, woman and child in Australia will have to pay back $9,000. With 10 per cent unemployment being forecast, how will families be able afford to buy a new car? The coalition will not be opposing this bill. It is a lifeline for eligible new car dealerships. I will be watching very closely to see the impact. My hope is that it will work but again there are some questions about the adequacy of the bill in assisting car dealerships and whether all the detail has been thought through. I commend the bill to the House.",153
196,Mr ZAPPIA,GUARANTEE APPROPRIATION,"I rise to speak in support of the Car Dealership Fifor nancing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009. It is another example of the Rudd government acting swiftly and decisively to support another sector of the community which has been negatively affected by the global economic downturn. In January 2009, the OzCar special purpose vehicle was established by the government to support interim funding to car dealerships. The OzCar SPV is designed to provide critical wholesale floor plan finance to eligible car dealerships so as to ensure that the departure of GE Money Solutions and GMAC from the Australian market and the liquidity challenges confronting Ford Credit does not result in the closure of hundreds of otherwise viable car dealers across Australia, resulting in thousands of job losses. The car dealer SPV will be a trust that will raise capital by selling securitised assets to the four major banks, under the cover of a Commonwealth guarantee where necessary. The capital raised will be made available to eligible car dealers through participating financiers for a period up to 12 months. The car dealer SPV will provide wholesale floor plan financing only to eligible dealers. It not finance any retail operations, capital loans or real property loans. To be eligible for possible wholesale financing under the SPV, a dealer must satisfy the following basic conditions. The dealer must currently be financed by an exiting financier, that is, GE Money Motor Solutions or GMAC; the dealer must currently be a new car dealer or a mixed dealership selling both new and used cars from the same business or is currently a dealer in new motorbikes, boats, caravans, trucks and commercial vehicles with wholesale floor plan finance provided by GE Money Motor Solutions or GMAC; the dealer must demonstrate that the dealership is a viable business consistent with the usual commercial lending criteria of recognised finance providers; they must be able to present up-to-date, accurate and comprehensive information on all aspects of the business as may be required by recognised and participating finance providers. Dealers who secure finance through the SPV will be subjected to regular audits consistent with best practice industry standards. Car dealers will in the first instance apply for wholesale floor plan financing from a participating financier of their choice. The financier will make a commercial decision as to whether they have the willingness or the capacity to finance the dealership from their own resources. If a participating financier cannot accommodate the dealership, yet the dealership satisfies the overall eligibility criteria for SPV financing, the financier may arrange finance for the dealership through the SPV. The SPV will not be providing any subsidised finance to any eligible car dealer. The cost of finance from the SPV will be market based and reflect current developments in the Australian and global capital markets. Car dealerships generally cannot remain in busiwill ness without a viable floor plan financing arrangement. Credit Suisse is acting as program manager of this special purpose vehicle, with Perpetual Trustee undertaking the role of trustee. A number of other high profile service providers, including Standard and Poor's, Deloitte, Liberty Financial and Allens Arthur Robinson, are providing the necessary supporting roles, ensuring the utmost scrutiny and accountability of the scheme. The Australian government will be providing a Commonwealth guarantee on the subordinated notes issued by the SPV to ensure that Australia's leading banks are able to provide sufficient capital for the SPV. Much of the automotive industry around the world has been in crisis in recent years. For many manufacturers, particularly those in the United States, the global financial crisis has caused a major upheaval to the automotive manufacturing sector. Chrysler Corporation filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 30 April 2009. Both General Motors and Ford are having to reassess their operations. There has been a sharp decline in car sales worldwide because of the global financial crisis. The second half of 2008 saw the most savage contraction of demand for new cars since the Second World War. Compared to the same period 12 months earlier, car sales in December 2008 fell by 36 per cent in the United States, 22 per cent in Japan and 16 per cent in France. In China and Brazilboth rapidly growing emerging economiesprevious quarters of strong growth became sharp declines in the last quarter of 2008. I would like to quote Mr Sergio Marchionne, CEO of the Italian car manufacturer Fiat, because I think it shows just how dire the situation in the global automotive industry is. Fiat has experienced a near miraculous revival in recent years and the company is seen as one of the strongest and most stable in the global auto industry. Fiat recently acquired 20 per cent of Chrysler. When describing the current industry situation, Mr Marchionne said: What we are seeing is unprecedented. I have never seen the failure of so many systems at That statement from someone who understands the industry effectively highlights the significant and serious situation the industry is in. What is happening overseas with car manufacturing regrettably has a profound impact on car manufacturing here in Australia, particularly for Australia's three local manufacturers, Ford, Toyota and General Motors Holden. Production by the Australian automotive industry peaked in 2004 at around 412,000 vehicles. This fell to around 324,000 vehicles in 2008 and, with current negative trends in monthly production figures so far this year, we can expect another significant decrease in production for the year 2009. In South Australia, my home state, Mitsubishi has closed its manufacturing operations with around 1,500 people losing their jobs from the Tonsley Park and Lonsdale plants. At its peak, Mitsubishi employed around 5,000 people in South Australia and supported thousands more working in the supplier industries. We have also seen a downsizing at the GMH plant at Elizabeth, with employment numbers falling in recent years from around 4,500 employees to a current level of around 3,000 employees, as a direct result of the global economic downturn which caused the drop in sales and subsequently a drop in production. The 3,000 employees at GMH have also lost overtime earnings as the plant moved to a single-shift, two-crew operation in April 2009. Also of concern is that since 2004 there has been a shift in sales away from locally produced vehicles. Even in the years when there has been a strong growth in new vehicle sales the percentage of vehicles sold, that were manufactured in Australia, has declined. Automotive production, like all manufacturing, is directly linked to sales. The global economic crisis has had a direct effect on once. consumer spending and automotive sales. Sales of new vehicles in Australia fell in April 2008 by 24 per cent compared to the previous year. Sales year-to-date for new vehicles have fallen 20 per cent compared to the previous year. Sales have also been affected by the withdrawal or retraction of wholesale funding to automotive retailers. In particular, the withdrawal of GMAC Finance from the Australian market has had a serious impact on car dealers. There are three specific financing firms for retailers that this bill addresses: GMAC, GE Money Motor Solutions, both of which have exited the Australian market completely, and Ford Credit, which is facing significant liquidity pressures that impact its ability to lend to Australian car retailers. All three of these firms have American parent companies that are experiencing difficulties because of the global economic crisis. GMAC is the automotive finance business of General Motors. GE Money is part of General Electric, a large American multinational firm that owns a range of media, technology and financial services. Ford Credit is part of Ford Australia. I understand that the government has received assurances from Ford in the United States that Ford Credit will remain in Australia and continue to support the Ford dealer network, and I welcome that assurance. Both General Motors and Ford have manufacturing plants here in Australia, so in many cases it is locally made cars that are being financed by these firms. It is in the United States, where the global economic crisis began, that the crisis is having a devastating impact on many established companies. The effect of the global economic crisis on the parent companies of these automotive finance firms here in Australia has resulted in car retailers having ficulty in accessing finance. So what is happening in the US is directly affecting what is happening here in Australia. It is this funding gap that this proposal seeks to address. Since the withdrawal of finance by GMAC and GE Money, around 60 per cent the auto dealers have secured alternative funding arrangements. Without these funding arrangements, two serious consequences result from the fall in auto sales. Firstly, facturing declines and car manufacturers already struggling are placed under further stress and more jobs are lost. Secondly, local auto retail businesses that are also being squeezed by the economic downturn simply cannot survive. Local businesses close and the ripple effect exacerbates already struggling economies. This is particularly so in rural and regional areas. Many auto dealers in rural and regional areas are unable to access alternative finance relationships because of their volume of sales. These are businesses that have already been negatively impacted by other factors affecting rural and regional Australia, such as drought and flooding. The closure of a car dealer not only has a direct impact on the economy of the local community, but it adds to the costs of locals who in turn are forced to travel further distances for their motor vehicle services and repairs. The financial difficulties for the car manufacturers in America have already had a devastating impact on their own dealers. Just weeks ago Chrysler cut 789 of their dealers, that is 25 per cent of their total. At the same time GMH advised 1,100 of its own retailers that their franchise agreements would not be renewed, and they expect to cut another 500 dealers in the months ahead. The global economic downturn has led to the closure of nearly 2,000 US car dealerships from these two brands alone with the loss of thousands of jobs. It is imperative that the Australian difgovernment does everything in its power to prevent a similar situation arising here in Australia. I understand that several Mitsubishi dealers within Australia have been unable to access alternative financing since the closure of GMAC and GE Automotive. These dealers have been provided with temporary finance arrangements by Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd, but I understand that these arrangements manuexpire at the end of June. These dealers who are currently unable to access alternative finance would benefit from this very measure. It is critical, therefore, that this legislation passes quickly through parliament and therefore provides dealers with the muchneeded finance that they will be requiring in order that their businesses remain viable. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA",154
197,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Liberal Party",157
198,Mr COSTELLO,ADJOURNMENT,"I would not want this day to pass without commemorating in the House an event which occurred in this chamber on 27 May 1909100 years ago. It was on that day that the member for Ballarat and two-time Prime Minister Alfred Deakin stood in the House and announced that he had become the Leader of the Opposition in place of Joseph Cook, the Leader of the Free Trade Party. It was the arrival of the ‘Fusion' between the Liberal Protectionists and the Free Traders in this parliament and, indeed, the birth of the Liberal Party-and I am indebted to Senator Brandis for reminding me that this is the centenary of that great event. The fusion of the two political partiesthe Protectionists and the Free Traders-led to the defeat of Andrew Fisher's Labor government and the return of Alfred Deakin to the prime ministership for a third time. There had been many ‘liberal' parties using the name before that time, going back to the colonial period. Henry Parkes, in New South Wales, had used the name ‘Liberal'; Griffith, of Queensland, had used the name ‘Liberal'; and in Victoria many different associations had at different times also used the name. But when the Commonwealth parliament was assembled, the defining economic issue which split the parliament was the tariff. The political associations took their identity from the position they assumed in relation to the tariff. On the one side were those who believed in protection and on the other side were those who believed in free trade. The Protectionists were stronger in Victoria and the Free Traders were stronger in New South Wales. With the rise of the fledgling Labor Party the parliament split three ways. Alfred Deakin famously remarked that there were ‘three XIs' playing the cricket match in the early Commonwealth parliament. It was a period of considerable instability. But the Fusion of 1909 established the two-party system here in Australia. The Parliamentary Handbook records Deakin's third government as ‘Protectionist-Free Trade-Tariff Reform', but in fact Deakin had launched a platform for the new Liberal Party on 26 May 1909. The Liberal Party went into opposition in 1910. It was not returned to government until 1913, and it was Joseph Cook who had the honour of being described as the first Liberal Prime Minister. The First World War and the Great Depression led to reorganisations of Australian political parties and the names ‘Nationalist Party' and ‘United Australia Party' were used. When Robert Menzies reorganised the non-Labor political forces in the early 1940s, he consciously chose the name ‘Liberal Party'-reaching back to Alfred Deakin and coming out of Fusion in 1909-for the party he led successfully into government in 1949. The Fusion brought together Protectionists and Free Traders, and there have always been free trade and protectionist tendencies inside the Liberal Party. It brought together supporters of arbitration and opponents of arbitration. It brought together liberals and conservatives. It is almost trite these days to say that the Liberal Party is ‘a broad church'. Very few people know that the Liberal Party is in fact the fusion of two political traditions which were brought together under the leadership of Alfred Deakin and announced in this parliament 100 years ago today. The Liberal Party ought to take great pride in that event, which gave birth to one of the great political traditions in Australia-and probably the most successful political tradition in Australian history. Under the leadership of, first, Menzies and then successive leaders, the Liberal Party in office has made an enormous contribution to the future of our country. Petition: Renewable Energy",158
199,Ms BURKE,ADJOURNMENT,"Chisholm) (7.35 pm)Whilst I am always fascinated by history, I would like to talk about a more contemporary issue this evening. I am privileged to present tonight a petition from Mary Whiteside, a constituent in my electorate of Chisholm-and I do not think Mary will mind me saying that she is on the sunny side of 70 and an incredibly vivacious and active woman in my electorate. I am very happy to actually table the petition that is critical of the government and I want to applaud Mary's efforts in literally door-knocking house-to-house in her surrounding suburbs and in going to train stations and other places to get people to her petition. Mary is a passionate advocate of clean ergy and of the need to do something urgently about climate change. Although she is not known for being involved in politics or agitation, she is so committed to this that has been pounding the streets, joining groups and looking at websites in the belief that we need to do something. She wanted to show that the ordinary citizen is concerned about this issue. She wanted to show that it is not just about big business and not just about the economy. It is about the ordinary citizen who is passionately concerned about the future of our environment and is concerned that we will surrender our future if we do not actually do something fairly urgently to deal with this issue of climate change, and to deal with it in a sensible way around alternative energies. I would like to assure Mary that the Labor Party is committed to doing things within the areas of both carbon pollution reduction and alternative energies. This is Mary's absolute passion: it is not just about reducing the carpolitics bon footprint; it is also about finding other alternative energy sources. The Rudd government will invest up to $100 million in partnership with the energy sector for the development of a new National Energy Efficiency Initiative, using 21st century technology to assist our transition to a low-carbon economy by encouraging a smarter and more effective energy network. We are not just introducing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme; we are also moving towards alternative energy sources so that we can create a situation where there is less carbon going into our environment. Smart grid technology will be introduced which uses sensors to monitor electricity supply across distribution networks using communication networks such as broadband sign technology. Smart grids help to more easily integrate renewable energy like solar and en- wind power into the grid, and enable energy generation in homes, schools and businesses to be stored and shared. I know this is a passion of Mary's. She has put solar panels on she her own home. She has put in water tanks. She is an individual who is doing absolutely everything she can to ensure that she reduces her carbon footprint, and she is keen to ensure that other people have the ability and the wherewithal to get into other forms of energy sources. Smart grids and smart meters are subjects I discussed quite recently at the Chadstone campus of GippsTAFE in my electorate. I was there with the Prime Minister just the other day. They are training apprentices to be able to produce and install the smart meter technology. So there are many things happening. I really want to commend Mary for her tireless efforts in going out there and raising the voice of the concerned citizen. She was absolutely passionate that I make it clear that it is not just about big business, and the media. It is actually the people in their own homes that are genuinely concerned about this issue and who want to see change. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives. As a concerned citizen I would like to express my disappointment at the lack of Government policy to encourage alternative energies. I believe the current proposal locks in a 5% carbon reduction target till 2020. This is totally adequate to effectively deal with the increasing climate change the effects of which are so obvious in increasing temperatures, drought, fire and flood. Scientists are indicating that we need to aim for zero emissions of carbon within ten years to retain an habitable environment. Climate change should be treated as an emergency and work begun to cool our planet. The financial crisis is also an opportunity to think our reliance on fossil fuels. The undersigned respectfully request that the Government reverse its decision to spend money on the coal industry and instead spend all that is necessary to develop clean alternative energy such as solar power, wind power and electric cars. from 265 citizens Petition received.",159
200,Mr SIMPKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"On previous occasions I have spoken on behalf of Vietnamese people within the electorate of Cowan and have voiced their concerns that their homeland is being held back by the restrictions imposed by the government of Vietnam. By ‘held back' I mean that the conditions under which people of Vietnamese origin prosper in Cowan are not shared by those in Vietnam. Vietnamese nationals have no access to the freedoms we hold dearsuch as democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of association. I would now like to make mention of one particular restriction that applies in Vietnam: restrictions on the internet. I am aware that the Vietnamese government has for years been controlling the internet by blocking websites critical of the regime. I also understand that, according to Reporters Sans Frontieres, Vietnam is among the worse countries when it comes to internet freedom. To make the point, in October 2008 the Vietnamese government created a new entity: the Administration Agency for Radio, inTelevision and Electronics Information. That agency's responsibility is to monitor the internet and control the flow of information from bloggers as the number of internet users continues to rise rapidly. The new agency falls under the Ministry of Information and Communications which, under a directive known as ‘Circular 07', in December 2008 updated the government's re- powers to censor the internet. According to a senior ministry official: The state encourages the use of blogs to serve personal freedom but bloggers have to respect social interests and community interests under the laws. It is very clear that this reference to social and community interests demonstrates an implied threat. The implied threat has been realised. In practice, this official statement Vietnam means that internet users who post items on the internet deemed to oppose the state face severe penalties. The restrictions include political commentary which criticises the decisions of the Vietnamese Communist Party and the posting of links to sites which are blocked in the country. The new internet decree is ultimately an extension of article 88 which criminalises free speech. Under that article, so-called propaganda against the state can be punished by fines and up to 12 years of jail time. In January 2008, Nguyen Van Hai, a 56year-old human rights activist who blogs under the name ‘Dieu Cay', called for a boycott of the Olympic torch relay and advocated for freedom of expression. The planned demonstration was in reaction to Chinese occupation of the Paracel and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea-which Vietnam also claims. Security police arrested Dieu Cay on charges of tax evasion in a case widely seen by both domestic bloggers and the international community as punishment for his political expression. Dieu Cay was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment. Pham Thanh Nghien, a 32-year-old human right activist, was among a dozen activists arrested in September 2008 after publishing commentary that was critical of government policies on the internet. Just prior to her rest, Pham Thanh Nghien held a sit-in inside her home to protest police harassment. She was arrested and ever since has been held without trial. Her family has yet to be allowed to visit her. A 30-year-old mobile-phone repairman, Truong Quoc Huy, was previously arrested at his home in Saigon in October 2005 with his two brothers and a female friend. The group had been taking part in a Paltalk chat room discussion about democracy. They were detained incommunicado for nine months. One month after his release in October 2006, Truong Quoc Huy was arrested again when a dozen police stormed a Saigon internet cafe. He was chatting online. He was subsequently sentenced to six years imprisonment followed by three years of house arrest. These are examples of the restrictions on rights and the oppression of individuals in Vietnam. I would like to thank the Viet Tan-the Vietnam reform party-and my friends in the Vietnamese community for keeping me up to date with these issues in Vietnam. The Vietnamese government should immediately release internet activists Mr Nguyen Van Hai, Ms Pham Thanh Nghien and Mr Truong Quoc Huy. The Vietnamese government should start respecting internet freedom and, above all, freedom of expression. The Vietnamese people of Cowan are a hard working part of our community. They came to Australia with very little. They came to seek freedom and to prosper in our society. They have done that, and done it well. When I look around my electorate and see what they have achieved, I wonder what the people who remain in Vietnam could achieve if they were not held back by the restrictive and controlling Communist Party of Vietnam. I again thank my Vietnamese friends in Cowan and across Australia, and I say to arthose that continue to fight for freedom in Vietnam to keep up the fight, not with weapons, but with technology, courage and faith. I look forward to the day Vietnam will be free again. Carm Urn. Questions Without Notice",160
201,Ms BIRD,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to speak this evening in the debate on the adjournment of the House to make some observations on what happened in this House during question time today. Question time today, not surprisingly, began, as it has in recent days, with questions from the opposition to the government on the size of the debt that has been undertaken in this budget, on the assumptions that underlie the premises of the budget and on the strategy to return the budget to surplus-a significant and important debate, one would think, and one which the opposition claimed to be engaging in in the national interest. We did not get through five questions before the opposition sought to move a censure motion, subsequently moving a motion to suspend. Asking only five questions of the government when there was the opportunity to ask 10 seems to indicate that the opposition's tactical response to dealing with the issue in this House has run out of steam. I have to say that, if the situation was as bad as the scare campaign of the opposition seemed to indicate, it was an awfully wasted opportunity to question the government on the issues that they claim are of such significance and dramatic implication for the community at large. It seems to me to point to the fact that it is indeed a scare campaign surrounded by stunts and props rather than a serious tempt to debate the issues of the day. There was a complete failure by the opposition, as there has been since budget night-even though this is apparently the biggest, most significant issue facing not only this generathe deficit. tion but, as they continually remind us, the children of the future-to provide an alternative view on the issues that confront us. One of the most significant components of the challenge that we are addressing is the significant drop in revenues that this country has faced as a result of the international downturn. One would think the member for Higgins, who contributed to the adjournment debate tonight, for example, would have something of interest to say on this issue. I well remember, as deputy chair of the Economics Committee in the previous parliament, that the member for Higgins, as Treasurer at the time, gave us two references on investigating the future of the manufacturing and services sectors post the mining boom. So one would think that he would have something constructive to say on the massive drop in revenues that this country has faced and contribute to the party room deliberations of the opposite side and the proposals put forward but, no-not a word on the issue of the drop in revenues. So one would think that perhaps they would go to the issue of the government stimulus, the attempt by this government to intervene quickly and decisively by taking action to inject demand into the economy at a time when the private sector was pulling out. No, there was no constructive alternative view there either. Perhaps they have an issue with the size of the stimulus. Did we get a direct answer on which of the particular stimulus activities they would avoid or would target in a different direction? No, just a criticism that it is too big. Perhaps they have proposed savings. Do we see a raft of proposed savings to decrease that debt? No, at- we do not. What we saw in the budget reply was simply, ‘We wouldn't reform the Medicare rebate; we would instead increase the excise as an alternative,' which would have no effect at the end of the day on the size of Presented from the opposite side are only three solutions. The member for Higgins's solution is, ‘It's me; I'm the solution,' which probably is not a surprise to anyone in this House, as I understand he made the point that the election was not lost because of Work Choices or climate change but because of a failure in generational change in their own leadership. The shadow Treasurer's solution is, ‘I'd have a $25 billion smaller deficit than the government,' in some sort of bizarre game of ‘Mine's smaller than yours' in debating this issue, but he has made no indication of exactly how he would achieve that or what that strategy would be about. The opposition leader merely offered a substitution proposal in his reply-hardly a response of appropriate size and significance considering the 75-year significance of the challenge that we face. It was a wasted opportunity in question time today. Five questions was the best they could manage in order to back up a scare campaign. (Time expired) Lone Fathers Association of Australia",161
202,Mr SCHULTZ,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Lone Fathers Association of Australia and on this government's failure to recognise the importance of the support that LFAA provides to a significant minority group, namely lone fathers and male victims of domestic violence. The LFAA represents the special needs of separated fathers and their families to the community, government, and other agencies. The organisation has operated for 36 years-for most of that period on an entirely voluntary basis. The LFAA is non-sexist, non-sectarian and non-profit, and does not discriminate against anyone. One-third of its members and half of its executive are women. The LFAA promotes and assists the development of a better understanding and equity in the Family Court on custody, access, child support, and property settlement matters. It encourages separated fathers to port and sustain their children. It promotes and encourages the best possible practice on access and custody matters-always with the happiness and emotional well-being of the child as the primary consideration, accepting that each child needs the love and guidance of both father and mother. During its more than 30 years in operation, the LFAA has worked unceasingly towards encouraging the development of a fairer family law and childsupport system-namely, one which understands, accepts and encourages the crucial role of the love and guidance of fathers in bringing up children to be happy, law abiding citizens and recognises the rights of grandparents to have a loving relationship with their grandchildren. In 1976, the LFAA, in the person of its president, pitched a tent on the lawn of the Old Parliament House to protest the limited scope at that time of the single mothers pension. This attracted the attention of the then PM, Malcolm Fraser, and quickly resulted in the extension of the single mothers pension to cover single fathers with care of their children. The LFAA, some years later, at the personal request of former Prime Minister John Howard, provided key advice through their representative on the 2004 ministerial task force, which corrected serious bias still herent in the CSA scheme at that stage, notably the failure to treat the incomes of both parents on the same basis. The LFAA, in company with other fathers groups, urged the parliament to follow up PM Howard's expressed concerns about the developing epidemic of fatherlessness and male suicide in Australia resulting from decisions by an outof-date and anti-father Family Court. This eventually led to some major reforms recognising the importance of shared parenting by both parents. The LFAA also persuaded the sup- government to adopt the far-reaching and highly beneficial concept of FRCs, which had first been put forward by the LFAA 15 years earlier. The organisation has been able, with government assistance, to run a small office in Canberra over the last three years. The LFAA has also established regional branches. These branches receive more than 20,000 calls per annum from men, women and children requesting advice, information and other assistance. The government has been very generous in the 2009-10 budget in offering additional tens of millions of dollars to gender groups which explicitly cater only for female victims-for example, of alleged domestic violence-but has ignored the 30 to 60 per cent of such victims who are men. No serious consideration has evidently been given to the rights and needs of male victims. Although the LFAA has helped a great many male parents with their problems with family law and related matters for a long time, financial assistance to it and other father/children focused groups has been about one per cent of the funding going to feminist groups. Funding for the LFAA was initiated by the previous government and extended for one year by the present government. Funding needs to be continued and extended to allow in- the very important work of the LFAA to continue. This work benefits not only the tens of thousands of men, women and children who contact the LFAA every year for advice and help but also the millions of citizens and their children who are beneficiaries of improvements in family law which the LFAA has played a leading role in. I urge Ministers Macklin and Ludwig to revisit the funding arrangements of the LFAA and make available the appropriate funds on a less discriminatory basis in order for the LFAA and its associated organisations to continue their invaluable and necessary support work to Australian fathers, who are just as deserving of this kind of support as single mothers. Robertson Electorate: Marine Discovery",162
203,Ms NEAL,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to inform members of the progress being made towards the establishment of a marine discovery centre on the Central Coast of New South Wales, in fact in my electorate of Robertson. This centre will provide the Central Coast with an environmental, educational and tourist facility that will become, I am sure, a benchmark facility for its type in Australia. A marine discovery centre at Terrigal will provide a marine research and educational facility for the university and for local environmental groups. It will also be used by community groups and will have a number of associated small businesses operating in connection with it. The HMAS Adelaide, which will be the real drawcard, will establish the centre and the Terrigal site as a must-see tourist destinaford tion. Dive wrecks and artificial reefs based on ships similar to HMAS Adelaide have proved very successful and sustainable tourist destinations in other parts of the country and have been based on dive wrecks such as this. There is already considerable interest in the project among dive shop operators, the hotel industry, restaurants and other small businesses on the Central Coast. The centre has the support of Central Coast Tourism, the peak tourism body on the coast, and they have already indicated that they will assist by taking the necessary steps to have it listed as a secondary tourist information office. Since I last spoke on this matter there has been a continuing and vigorous campaign from interested stakeholders to bring this project to the Central Coast. Earlier this year I hosted two meetings at my electorate office which brought community and industry partners together. Those meetings included representatives of the Community Environment Network, the peak environment body on the coast; the University of Newcastle's Central Centre Coast campus, which runs a highly regarded marine research centre; the New South Wales Department of Lands; and the New South Wales Premier's Department. Among all these stakeholders there continues to be a real sense of excitement about the possibilities that the marine discovery centre can open up for people and the economy of the Central Coast. The stakeholders pushed hard to have Gosford City Council nominate the marine discovery centre as its preferred strategic project under the federal government's Community Infrastructure Program. This would have brought significant funds to the project and helped kick-start the establishment of a marine discovery centre at The Haven at Terrigal, which was initially the preferred site for the facility. In the end GosCity Council chose another project in its submission to the Community Infrastructure Program, which ultimately received more than $3 million in federal funds and is a matter of great value to the community as well. But it was an opportunity lost for the project team of the marine discovery centre. However, a major breakthrough occurred recently for the marine discovery centre when it secured a new home right in the heart of the tourist destination of Terrigal. Through representations made by me and others to the New South Wales Department of Lands, the centre was granted a five-year lease on the former Tourism Central Coast information centre in Terrigal-a lease for five years at no cost. Securing a permanent base for the centre in such a prominent position is a wonderful milestone. A marine discovery centre has real potential to deliver ongoing economic returns for the Central Coast economy. This centre can be an icon attraction for the area and certainly will pay its way in the future. This is a project that builds on strong and already existing partnerships across the community. The linkages that are emerging between education, community interest, environment, tourism, local businesses and major infrastructure provision makes the centre an extremely attractive proposition. A marine discovery centre at Terrigal will provide a marine research and education facility for the university's marine research and teaching centre, which is based presently at its Central Coast campus. It is important to see an extension of that. It will also become a focus for local environment groups, such as the CEN, and they will continue to do research there as well as in their present centre. Its links to the vibrant Central Coast tourism industry are worthwhile, and I am sure these will grow and develop over time. Securing a permanent base for the centre was the next step towards achieving a marine discovery centre for the coast. This has been achieved. The centre is expected to be operating by the end of 2009, in time for the Christmas season, and I am thrilled to see it occur.

Let us all nancial year has been in the handouts, the big I said before that this country will see $315 the financial year 2021-2022, the debt will the calculations before. That will mean that the time this Rudd Labor debt is paid off. That the government has in its budget and the estimates big assumption, because the government months. The assumptions and predictions are important and in context. We have had a 13 per cent increase as the Treasurer has told us, that spending will change in character and little wonder that so there is no backup to the statement-certainly statement, clearly as unreliable as all Let us look at more figures: a retraction of then growth of 2¼ per cent in 2010-11, and two years after that. When you add those projections surplus for years into the future in order to clearly it is doubtful that the government will of course not the only sceptical one. Remember day 13 May 2009, describing the budget as the Treasurer has been referring to this economic quarters of a century. I am not sure whether self the hero or hedge the failures of the government the figures upon which this mountainous amount predicted contraction in the economy is 0.5 per lia has weathered these challenges before.

In fact, both ment than the 8.5 per cent predicted in ures-almost 10 per cent, I believe, Although this budget is as questionable in turn to the GDP growth figures.

The government has said that in be paid off, 13 years down the track.

That remains a was continually wrong throughout the last 12 to recall and I want to look at them in detail in government spending, yet in the future, increase by no more than two per cent. Quite a many people are sceptical! Although he said it, no legislation or hard restrictions, just his his work has been in the last 12 months. the economy of 0.5 per cent in the next year and then it is motoring along at 4½ per cent for the to the estimate of a two per cent of GDP pay off the Rudd Labor debt of $315 billion, again be able to take advantage of those figures. I am the front page of the Australian on Wedneson a ‘wing and a prayer'. For some months now challenge as the greatest downturn in threethis is designed to scare Australians, make himto that comparison. But, if we examine of reckless spending has been justified, the cent, and 0.5 per cent is not good. But Austrafact both the 1982 and 1991 recessions resulted these recessions resulted in higher unemploythe Rudd Labor government's unemployment figin 1982 and almost 11 per cent in 1991. fact as its deliverer in every respect, I will now of this House would know that Western Austrathan other states, with Queensland not doing that the GDP growth figures for Western Ausfor the nation, just to make up for the other NA states. Yet the curious part is that, while the growth in 2010-11, WA is predicting another retraction Rudd Labor government is predicting 4½ per 30-year national trend of three per cent. But at 3¾ per cent. My point is that, if in recent more than 30 per cent of the Australian government's growing at below the national predicted growth, look completely false. Recent years have shown and that cannot be said about the Rudd Labor like to make on this issue of recovery projection dubious figures, the assumption is that tax ing there will be no tax cuts and I also make another point related to the contribution this nation. As I said, some 30 per cent of national west, which is pretty good given we have about big-spending budget, why did Western Australia spending? Western Australia and the people in the interest and principal bills for the high-spending yet we are ripped off in the spending. That brings me to what is happening in the ing. I recall clearly the election promises clearly because we promised most of them first: ander Drive intersection, the Hepburn Avenue duplication at Marangaroo and Alexander Heights, Senior High School. We also promised some additional call the GP superclinic in the suburb of Wanneroo These promises languish in the same category. a sod being turned. That is the key point: years ago, and the people are yet to see any action. I recall that at the recent community cabinet Minister told the whole crowd that the money which was last year's budget. Having examined told the people there, who actually live in that was promised funding and they said that got the money yet and it remains very difficult in this year's budget. I did however find a reference to one item House's 13 May 2009 speech. The brief mention course, the people of Cowan would know that, cal road safety by me in 2007, the federal came in and provided $7 million of the $10 million the exact project that was funded in 2007 and been allocated. I therefore contacted stakeholders about any more money and were not expecting Rudd Labor government is predicting 2¼ per cent of 0.5 per cent. Take the next year. The cent growth in 2011-12, which is well above the it is also far greater growth than WA is predicting years Western Australia has been contributing revenue and if WA retracts again before then the Rudd Labor government's figures the Western Australian figures to be accurate, government's figures. The final point I would is that, even if you accept all these highly revenues will contribute via bracket creep, meanno indexation. That fact must be noted. the state of Western Australia makes to revenue, such as royalties, flows from the 10 to 11 per cent of the population. In this get just over six per cent of the infrastructure the state, like my daughters, will end up paying and record-debt Rudd Labor government, Cowan electorate or, rather, what is not happenof 2007 made by the Labor Party. I recall them the overpass at the Reid Highway and Alexextension in Ballajura, the Hepburn Avenue and the basketball complex at Woodvale projects; however, so did Labor. I reand the youth drop-in centre in Ballajura. If there is any action, then it has not resulted in those projects were promised, getting on to two meeting in Ballajura, in Cowan, the Prime for those projects was in the 2008-09 budget, that budget carefully, I know that what he Cowan, was not true. I looked around at one group they did not have their grant. In fact, no-one has to find the line items to cover those promises of particular interest in the Leader of the was ‘Works on the Ocean Reef Road'.

As the minister had mentioned again in 2009, I assumed that more money had in the project, who did not know anything it.
