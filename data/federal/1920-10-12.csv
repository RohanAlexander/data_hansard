6,Mr MAKIN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Hindmarsh.) [3.5] - Th Minister in his second-reading speech referred to the measure as one of urgency, character. but I direct your attention, Mr Speaker, to the fact that it has been on our ness-paper since A p r i l last, and therefore the conduct of the Government in postthe poning its consideration is hardly conclothing sistent with the remarks of the Minister who is in charge of it . From the first, the Opposition has regarded the measure as of great importance. We hope amend it so that it may prove of benefit to those who are now suffering from high cost of living, and particularly to those whose low wages make the position most difficult for them. The consideraout let or hindrance. tion of the measure provides an opporphase tune occasion for determining what power should be vested in our Judiciary to it to conserve the interests of the people and to protect them from the assaults that the great commercial exploiters are now making upon them. Statistics which have been compiled are ample evidence of a rise in prices for which there is not duction is being secured. the semblance of justification, although the attempt has been made to deceive public in regard to unjust charges by excuses in which the issue is clouded with financial and commercial technical reasonin ing. There are two questions of parano mount importance which it is incumbent on this Legislature to solve: We must ask system. ourselves whether the rights of the people are being maintained, and their interests conserved. We have just reason to doubt, whether parliamentary effort has been some properly directed to the f a it h f u l service of the people's welfare. We have also ask whether, by vesting more authority the Commonwealth Judiciary, we can prothat vide more complete protection for the action with that object in view. people. There is a feeling in the minds of honourable members that the provisions of the Constitution l i m it the power of acFederal Legislature to deal effectively or with prices, and it would perhaps be well capito make a test case which would enable u3 respecto ascertain what the limitations of our powerare. I do not know that there for is any man who could say with ceror tainty just what power the Commonwealth possesses for protecting the for people against commercial exploiters. The amendments in the Judiciary Act now proposed by the Government may have a e certain degree of importance, but I do not deem them to be of a far-reaching I hope that, as the result of the amendment proposed by the honorbusiable member for West Sydney (Mr . Ryan) we shall have presented to us at earliest possible moment a measure our Judiciary with far wider powers than they at present possess, to investigate questions of the utmost i m portance in regard to the cost of producto tion and trade profits. The people are looking to us for such legislation. There the are in the community those who say that competition should be allowed to take its full course and to run its own way withI n almost every of life, we have a standardization of effort, and certain definite lines aTe Ini1 enable down with the object of securing the highest degree of industrial efficiency. In our workshops, the principle of standardization of machinery and appliances for production is being generally adopted. In this way, increased and cheaper proThe people, however, have not reaped any direct adthe vantage in the shape of cheaper foodstuffs, clothing, or housing accommodation. If standardization is a good thing workshop practice, then there can be justification for the failure of the Government to bring prices under the same Just as wages are ruled by standards, so there should be fixed prices for certain articles and commodities. In this way, the people might be able to reap advantage from the greater efficiency resulting from the introduction of up-to to date machinery and appliances in our in various industries. It has been asserted we have little or no power to take I believe that if a test case were brought before the High Court it would be found the that section 51 of the Constitution gives us all the power that we require in that. i direction. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) has said that it is impossible, to. secure from business enterprises the. information which the honourable member for West Sydney proposes to obtain by meansof hisamendment. In support of that contention, he has referred to. the decision of the Privy Council in the case of. the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited v. The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. The decision given in. that case, however., was not that the Commonwealth Parliament lacked the power to obtain the information which was sought of the company, but that, owing, to anomalies in the Royal Commissions Act, the company was able to evade giving the evidence demanded of it. Lord Haldane, in giving the judgment of the Court, very clearly intimated that the Government failed in its claim, not because of want of constitutional power,, but owing to bungling in the drafting of the Royal Commissions. Act. Had that Act been differently drawn, it would have been possible to compel the company to give all the information required concerning its trade profits and working operations. It is possible for the Government, at one stroke, to make it unprofitable profiteer, and no Administration that is not prepared to protect the people from the unjust impositions of the profiteers will justify itself in the eyes of the elec- . Mr M-AKLN - They tors. Absolutely extortionate prices have been rulingin respect of various commodities. Even the prices of Australian products and articlesof Australian manufacture are being raised with little or no justification. By way of illustration, I would point out that certain twill manufactured in' New South Wales and sold by the manufacturer to the wholesale houses at Ss. 6d. per yard, was retailed to the people at 25s. 6d. per yard. When the manager of the clothing department of J. and B. Sniders and Company, of Flinders-lane, was some time ago called before thp Fair Prices Commission to account for an increase in the price of goods handled by them, he was asked by the Chairman of the Commission whether there was any hope that for the rest of this year there would be any reduction in the prices for tweeds and serges. Mr Daniel Solomons, Mr Makin. the manager referred to,, answered by 1 saying that he did' not think that there was the slightest hope, and' that in fact prices might go> still higher: The Chairman then asked him whether his department was making abiggergross profit now than it was ma-king sixyears ago, and. Mr Solomons, had' to admit that it was. When, asked how he. accounted, for that M*. Solomons gavei about the only answer that could begivento such a question by many .profiteers. He saidIt is the ethicsof - business.. It is like the oldsong, "" Everbody's doing it."" As a Legislature claiming to be concerned! about the welfare of. the people we should not allow such a condition of affairs to continue to exist Avithout doing all in our power to compel such people to dealjustly with the community, and be content with reasonable profits. I find that the Hqusewives Association of Victoria is endeavouring to deal with the highcost of living, and apparently the only way in which they can successfully deal with the matter is to agree amongst themselves to do without goods which otherwise they would desire to have. They, are today practically issuing an ordtei'- prohibiting the purchase by their to be a members of goods for whichexorbitant pricesa.re charged'. !",20
7,Mr BELL,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"They are wiserthan some of the politicians: are certainly moving a little faster than are some of those who claim to be serving the best interests of the people.. I give every credit to this association that is doing its part in directing attention to the fact that the different Legislatures have so far failed to protect the people from those who have grossly abused the opportunityto levy exorbitant charges upon them. I admit that profiteering is world wide, and is not confined to the Commonwealth, or any particular State. Still, I fail to see why the people of this country should be subjected to exorbitant charges, especially for goods that are manufactured in Australia for much less than the prices charged for them. I have been prepared to afford protection to local industries, in order to assist in making thi'« country self-contained, but I am not prepared to support industries carried onby persons who take anunfair Advantage of - the people by chaTging extortionate prices - for goods - manufactured here - considerably Dr. MADOKIEY - We - shall .have nationalize those industaies. Mr MAKIN' - I agree with the honortralia, able member that the' best way to deal effectively with the high cost of living for the people themselves to control .the industries engaged in the production the goods the.y require. We know that State enterprises are subjected to is deal of hostile 'criticism, but in Qiaeensfor Oand tflie prices ruling for - goods which State has entered into competition private persons to supply to the comaffairs munity are lower than where private terprise has the field to itself. That justifies the claim of the honourable ber for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) that not until we secure the nationalization these industries will the people be in position to obtain the goods they, require at reasonable prices. This has already been proved in the - driving timber trade. There may be some aspects of the recent purchase by the Commonwith wealth of saw-mills and timber areas Queensland that should be the subject inquiry; but as soon as the timber bines in this country became acquainted with the fact that the Commonwealth Government had entered into competithrow tion with them to secure the timber necessary for War Service Homes, the manager for one of the leading timber - merchants in Adelaide said that he did not think that the investment made the Government was a judicious one, - because we were just on the eve of a fall in prices of timber, those .and the Commonwealth Government - has would consequently sustain a loss the transaction. It was not until vernment, by nationalizing, to some exliving tent, 'the saw-milling industry, entered - into competition with them, that we were iafble to .secure from those engaged in - timber trade ""the assurance that a fall prices in .the industry is likely to occur. I think a similar result would follow the .'competition of the Government in other industries; and until the State assumes - direct control of them, the community - generally will not be afforded the measure of protection to which they are entitled. We - could relieve the existing situation by 'adopting the remedy suggested by 'fee honourable member for to West Sydney '(Mr Ryan), namely, by requiring statistics of the cost of production of all goods manufactured in Ausand of the landed cost of all goods imported into Australia, statistics of the is profits accruing to trading corporations, or derived from Inter-State shipping, and of of the rate of profit on the capital actually employed therein respectively; great with penalties of fine and imprisonment refusal to furnish such statistics, .or the - for wilfully making false returns. The with present form of trading governing the of the commercial .world today is endoing much to undermine the confidence fact of the people in constitutional media memof government. The contempt into which political action is falling is due to the of contrast between political forms of a 'Democracy and .the economic reality of - oligarchy. We find that the class of profiteers and commercial plunderers is a standing menace to the supremacy of constitutional authority, because it is fast people who have hitherto held moderate views, and have been content political action, into a feeling of in disgust with those means of endeavourof ing to. improve theircondition, and is Commaking 'them heed ithe advice of those who say that they can have their conditions .of life improved by a complete overof the present social system, and the vesting .of authority in the people themselves. I am one of those who have stood always by constitutional action. I have always believed in the adoption of by political media for securing reform; but I must confess that there is great justification for the advice tendered by who say that little or .no assistance been given by our legislators to the on - people to enable them to contend the Gosuccessfully with 'the high cost of as it exists '.today. ing to a summary - which has been Accordprepared,, the .average .number representing the cost of living in '-the years 1912, the 19T3, 'and 1914 was '85, whereas in 1919 of it 'had risen to 205.6. It cannot be 'contended >that the increase in wages has 'been anything like 'equivalent - to ^that m'crease in the cost ;of living - The difficulties conifronting the - working community :of Australia are becoming harder each day, and ;a great number despair of 'ever being able to catch, up the arrears into which they have fallen during recent years; suffering is universal because of exorbitant charges: anxiety is becoming intensified, and privation is rampant. Since these are the facts, we should be prepared at least to make the 'necessary inquiries to ascertain the reason for the present state of affairs. We should endeavour to investigate the ramifications of profiteering, and the Government should be ready to prove the sincerity of the desire which they profess to relieve the people of the hardships of life. If fchey really want to free the people of the tremendous burden represented by the present high cost of living, they must io something of a 'practical character, such as the honourable member for West Sydney suggests. I urge them not to regard the amendment from a partisan standpoint, but to recognise in it a sincere desire on the part of the Opposition to assist them to find a means whereby there can be brought to justice those persons who dealt so unfairly with the people during the whole course of the war, and who even now, in times of peace, are aggravating the offence. There cannot be anj' reasonable excuse for the Government refusing the opportunity now afforded to. them to do something practical to deal with a question which so agitates the public mind. It is an unfortunate, and even an outrageous, feature of our system of government, that we should have to admit that this Legislature, which is supposed to be clothed with full power to govern the destinies of Australia, and to conserve the best interests its people, is unable to control those agencies which today are doing so much to bring down the standard of living to such a dull, sordid level as is now being created. I hope that, as the result of the remarks of honourable members on this side, the Government will do their part to put into effect-the suggestions of the honourable member for Wjest Sydney. I trust that they will withdraw the Bill temporarily, with the object of bringing in at the earliest possible moment a more comprehensive measure to deal with matters which are of such grave importance to the whole community. Surely the fact that we have power over imports and exports suggests that we can do something to help the people to secure the necessaries of life at a lower margin than is possible today, especially in the case of Mr Makin. goods which are manufactured in our own country. Unfortunately, there are a number of Australian manufacturers dealing unfairly with the people by availing themselves of the protection of the Tariff, and, at the same time, charging prices almost equivalent to those demanded for imported articles . of a similar character. In view of comparisons which can be submitted between the cost of manufacturing different goods in this country and the cost of similar imported articles, it is the duty of the Government to see that' local manufacturers, who are given the benefit of Tariff protection, extend to the people that share of the benefit which they have every right to expect and demand.",21
8,Mr FENTON,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,There is a fair margin between the price of an imported article and a similar local article of good quality.,23
9,Mr MAKIN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"I quoted the case of twill manufactured in New .South Wales at 8s. 6d. per yard, and retailed to the general public at 25s. 6d.",23
10,Mr FENTON,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Yes . The wholesaler comes in there, and reaps an immense benefit.",23
11,Mr MAKIN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Another reason for this anomaly is the attitude of the manufacturers, many of whom deal only with the wholesale firms. They will not supply direct to the retailers. This system of imposing double profits on the consuming public is grossly unfair, and whilst I have a seat in this House I shall do all I possibly can to speed up the machinery of for affording relief, especially as we understand the Government are clothed with sufficient power to do all these things if only they had rJhe courage and strength bo face the position. I may be permitted to refer to a case that, perhaps, is sub judice, in connection with which it is 3tated, on behalf of the wholesalers, that a profit of 22£ per cent, is not sufficient to cover overhead charges. In my opinion, iJhat profit gives a very wide margin. It is far above what I am prepared to allow to any trading firm. We should do all we can to bring prices down to the very lowest point. I hope, therefore, that the Government will do their part by endeavouring to clothe the Judiciary with sufficient power to deal effectively with those profiteers who have made such inroads upon the welfare of the people of this country.",23
12,Mr LAZZARINI,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,".Werriwa) [3.44] It should be unnecessary for honourable members on this side to urge upon the Government the necessity of incorporating in this Bill the principles laid down in the amendment submitted by the honourable member for West Sydney (' Mr Ryan). (During the last election campaign, when candidates of both parties were seeking the suffrages of the people, profiteering, which is dealt with in this amendment, was a burning question, and candidates representing the Government side of the House claimed to be just as anxious as were their opponents to deal with the evil. Well, they are now behind the Government; but,' up to the present, nothing has been done to ease the burdens which the profiteers have been placing upon the community for a number of years. We were even told, on one occasion, that the Prime ister (Mr Hughes) intended to shoot the profiteers. Surely, then, some effort should be made to redeem these promises made to the electors, and which they accepted in good faith by returning the Government to power. Subsequently, when a no-confidence motion was being debated, we were told by Ministerial supporters that, as the Government proposals were turned down at the referendum, they had no power to deal with profiteering. The honourable member for West Sydney, however, challenged the suggestion, and, in support of his views, he has taken this, the first, opportunity afforded him, of embodying them in the amendment he has moved to the Bill now under consideration. Even if the Government had not power to deal with profiteering, one would have thought that, immediately they were placed upon the right track, immediately it was shown that it was possible to do something, their first act would have been to pass a measure to put down the evil. But, as a matter of fact, this Bill, in which it is possible to do something, has been for some time consistently at the bottom of th,©. business-paper. have spent a great deal of time during the last few months in consideration of measures intended to deal with industrial troubles; but, so long as profiteering continues unchecked, all the time occupied by this Parliament on those measures [224] to which I have referred, will have been wasted, because this industrial unrest has its root-cause in the economic condition of the workers, who find themselves menaced by the profiteering practices of the commercial and moneyed classes of this country. One would have thought that common sense would dictate fco the Government the necessity for prompt action, because, while Wages Board and Arbitration Court awards may have the effect of increasing wages, we ' are moving in a vicious circle, because after every award employers put up prices to a higher level, so that, instead of being worse off, they are really better off. The wages awarded by the Arbitration Courts or Wages Boards aro always the maximum rates paid, and although they are the highest'rates to which the worker is entitled, there is no restriction on the manufacturer as to the price he shall Min- charge for the commodity he produces. It-is useless speaking of industrial peace, and of wasting our tiime in this Parliament endeavouring to improve the position by other means, because the worker cannot expect any improvement until profiteering, which is keeping so many on the bread line, is checked. It is not a question of wages, because, comparatively speaking, the rates paid are sufficiently high to enable the workers to live in reasonable comfort; but the difficulty arises from the prices at which 1 the nece.ssaries of life are sold. It is merely a question of reducing the cost of living by compelling manufacturers and others to dispose of their products at a price more in conformity with the cost of production. That can only be done by giving the Court 'the powers set out in the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Ryan). The question of profiteering was 1 a burning one at the recent election, and it is one that has been agitating the minds of thoughtful men the world over. It is a problem that must be solved, and we are telling the people that this Parliament has no power to deal with it. There is nothing more calculated to bring the We Government into ridicule, or to stimulate direct action, than to tell the people that we have no power to deal with profiteering, and it will be difficult for those who still have faith in constitutional government to stem the tide of growing indignation and disgust towards parliamentary government. In New South Wales a Necessary Comirriodities Commission, presided over by Mr Justice Rolin, has jusc published its report, from which it would appear that there was no evidence to prove that excessive profits had been made in the clothing trade.. I believe it was stated by the learned Judge that there was a profit of only 5 per cent, on the turnover; but it is useless to endeavour to gull the people in such a way when they know that clothing is being sold at ridiculously high prices. It is useless for a Commission to report that excessive prices are not being charged when working men realise every time they receive their pay that its value has been reduced owing to the increased cost of commodities. The agitation and discontent at present existing is likely to end in revolution unless this National Governanent tackles the problem seriously, and exercises every means at their disposal to check profiteering. It is hardly necessary for me to go into details in regard to prices, and the profits that are being made, when children in Melbourne and other cities are going bootless because of the prices that are charged. Ask the children in every city and town in Australia who have to go to bed, if not hungry, at least with their appetites not satisfied, if there is any profiteering. Ask the housewife, who experiences considerable difficulty in making ends meet, if there is any profiteering. The amendment provides that statistics of the cost of production of all goods manufactured in Australia, and of the landed cost of all goods imported into Australia shall be obtained. H a d such a provision been incorporated in our Judiciary Act, these "" get-rich-quickly "" gentlemen would not have been able to charge excessively high prices, even before the war. Some time ago I was asked if I wasp> handle felt hats, which could landed in Wellington, New South Wales, at 14s. 3d. each. The commercial representative of the manufacturers strongly recommended the line; but I was in formed that I could not obtain a single hat until I was prepared to enter into an agreement not to sell them at less.than 25s. each. That wa3 in pre-war days. The same class of hat is now being sold in Melbourne and Sydney at 45s. or 50s. each, although they can be landed in Australia at approximately SOs. LO 35s. each. Mr Lazzarini.",24
13,Mr MATHEWS,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,The same can be said of all imported hats.,25
14,Mr LAZZARINI,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Yes . . In pre-war 'days the Borsalino hat, which in It a l y cost about 5s. 6d. or 6s., was sold in Melbourne at 12s. 6d., but they cannot now be purchased under 25s. or 30s.",25
15,Mr FLEMING,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,That is profiteering in another country.,25
16,Mr LAZZARINI,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"No ; I am speaking of the prices here. Quite apart from the price of imported articles, we have only to refer to the cost of boots. The price of hides, plus the cost of tanning, is the basic cost. The prices of boots are chiefly determined by the prices of leather. But have the prices of boots declined in sympathy with the reduction in the prices of leather? Only to a very small extent. Boots which up t ill three years ago could be purchased for 12s. 6d. Der pair are today being sold at 25s. and 27s. 6d. per pair. I do not desire to go into details regarding the increased prices of many commodities. The little children are familiar with them. But there is one matter which was touched upon by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr M a k in ) to which this Parliament might very well devote its attention. It should spare no effort to deal effectively with the Combines and Rings which exist in the commercial world today, and which constitute one of the means by which profiteering is successfully carried on. In particular we should give earnest attention to the honourable understanding amongst our manufacturers that they will unload their goods only to warehousemen and soft-goods middlemen: If the consumer could purchase lines of clothing, hats, and boots direct from the manufacturer, the prices of these goods would be reduced by 25 per cent, or 30 per cent. _ prepared to Mr Fenton - B y more than that in be some cases.",25
17,Mr LAZZARINI,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"V e r y likely they would be reduced by much more than that. If we can bring the .consumer into direct touch with the manufacturer, we shall certainly eliminate the profits of the middlemen, and we shall do something to restore healthy competition. Whatever may be said by the opponents' of this amendment, it certainly contains provisions which would make for the effective control of profiteering. This Government, which was w in g to shoot the profiteer at sight, will fail in their duty to the people of this country and in their pledges to the nation if they do not take drastic action in the direction - which has been outlined by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan). The more convinced our people become of the failure of parliamentary government, the more will they be impelled to resort to direct action, so that a revolution cannot be far off.",25
18,Mr MATHEWS,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Melbourne Ports) [4.4J - A proposed amendment of the available. Judiciary Act is tantamount to a proisters posed amendment of the Constitution, cause the powers which have been vested in the Justices of the High Court pracany tically make them the moulders of our Constitution. When the Federation was inaugurated the statement was freely made that under our Constitution the Commonwealth possessed certain powers. Rut. we had not proceeded f ar wheil discovered that those powers were really determined 'by the provisions of the Judiupon ciary Act, which conferred upon the Justices of the High Court the power to make our Constitution just what they - thought it ought to be. When that T r i bunal was first established it consisted of only three Justices, but this number soon increased to five, and, ultimately, seven. As the years passed we were disthat appointed to find that these Justices gave decisions regarding the powers of the Commonwealth which did not agree w i what we conceived to be the intentions of the framers of our Constitution. As Justices of the High Court make our Constitution, honourable membersought certainly to exhibit some interest in Bill to amend the Judiciary Act which now under consideration. I certainly i tend to express my opinion .upon it , even though I may be regarded as an egotisticase cal ignoramus for my temerity. Though a layman may not be able to give a very precise definition of what this measure really means, I doubt whether the lawyers in this Chamber can do very much better. The measure which we are now considerfeasible ing might just as well provide that i three Justices of the High Court, give unanimous decision upon any matter affecting the interpretation of our Conthe stitution, their judgment should become the law of the land. In 1912 section [224]- 2 of the Judiciary Act was altered to provide thatA full Court consisting of less than all the Justices shall not give a decision on a question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth unless a majority of all the Justices concur in that decision. The Government have evidently discovered that even that provision will,not meet the exigencies of the position, because it is idle to provide for a majority decision when only four Justices may be I take it , therefore, that M in are now desirous of altering the bemeasure, with a view to providing that the concurrence of three Justices upon such matter shall be sufficient. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr . Groom) is quite satisfied that the measure provides for all that is necessary. But during the past thirteen or fourteen .years all the lawyers in this Chamber have we been similarly satisfied. Why should we not allow the Judiciary Act to remain our statute-book unaltered u n t i l the Constitution can be amended in such a way as to clearly set out what are the pbwers of the Commonwealth? What can the measure which is now before us actually accomplish? It may make it easier to get a decision from the High was Court upon constitutional matters. The to Minister (Mr Groom) will agree with me if three Judges among seven give a decision which is accepted as law, that decision can at any time thereafter be th upset by the remaining four sitting together in F u l l Court. As a comimon laythe man, I know that I should speak upon these matters with bated breath; but, judged from the view-point of the man the in the street, it would seem that three is cannot possibly form a majority among n - seven. The (more I endeavour to study the matter, the more it appears to be a of confusion worse confounded. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr . Ryan) has set up a contention as to the correctness or otherwise of which I cannotventure an opinion, but I feel free to say that his argument is, at any rate, as as anything else within the scope f of the Judiciary Act. Moreover, his suga gestion, if it were adopted, would be much more useful to the people than most of other provisions contained therein. The men who are robbing the people to23 day have a comparatively free hand because the public do not know exactly how and in respect of which specific items they are being robbed. If I were to buy a hat branded "" Galatea""- I do not know that there is a hat so branded-and if I were to be charged 25s. for it when T knew from a Gazette intimation that such hats had been sold to the retail merchant for 120s. a dozen, I would perceive that the shopkeeper was trying to make a profit of 150 per cent, out of me. The fact of the price having been publicly gazetted would make the most daring profiteer hesitate. The trouble is, however, that the retailer might get out of his difficulty by erasing the original brand, and selling the hat under another name-no t gazetted, of course-stil l at 150 per cent, profit.",26
19,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"The honourable member was in better form when dealing with the constitutional, aspect. I suggest that he revert to that. - Mr MATHEWS - I am talking about something of which I have knowledge at the moment. I feel certain that if we were to legislate to compel the gazettal of prices there would be considerably more reluctance on the part of the trading community to profiteer. I must repeat, however, that there would still be opportunities to evade publicity in the matter of prices by changing the branded names of clothing and the like. If a retailer were to buy from a wholesale house a shirt branded '' Prince of Wales,"" at the rate of 72s. a dozen, and if he were to try to sell me that same shirt for 15s., I would know, upon reference to the Gazette, that he was proposing to make 150 per cent, profit. ;Such knowledge would put an end to profiteering-so long, I repeat, as the retailer did not evade the publicity of his deal by changing the name of the commodity which he was selling. But I do not wish to in sinuate that the retailer is the only profiteer; he also has his troubles. I see no reason why we should not take these proposed powers to end profiteering. I do not say, of course, that legislation along the lines indicated in the amendment would immediately succeed, for it would be experimental, and might not be perfected straight way. I when it was decided to insure corroct weight in respect of the sale of a 2-lb. loaf of bread. Many bakers were fined for selling under weight. However, a brainy man conceived the idea of selling his bread under a fancy name. He called it a French loaf, or something of the kind, and he was then not compelled to guarantee it to be a 2-lb. loaf. The opinion is gaining strength in Australia, as well as in the Old Country, that it would be well to fix the prices of standard articles of clothing, furniture, and other things. That would be very well if everybody were to agree to wear standardized clothing. However, there are too many people who would not be seen in a standardized suit or pair of shoes, and these proud folk would still be prey 'for the profiteers. There are plenty of women who will pay as much as £3 10s. for a pair of boots worth really about 25s. Standardized clothing would not appeal to them. However, from empty pride, some may prefer to be robbed, but for those who are .civilized, and who are only desirous of wearing clothing for comfort, standardized articles could be supplied. Various Governments in Australia have attempted since 1914 to fix prices, and found it most difficult to do so. It is a difficult task, I admit, but to make such an admission is merely to play into the hands of the direct actionists. They say that it is 'impossible to legislate against profiteering, and that relief can be obtained only by direct action. Therefore those who are opposed to direct action must use every means possible to enable Parliament to give effect to the wishes of the people. I have given instances of the way in which the suggestion of the honourable member for West Sydney may be evaded; still, by the exercise of common sense, I think it would allow those who are determined not to be robbed an opportunity of preventing to some extent the depredations of profiteers. I know that the Government are not prepared to accept the excellent suggestion of the honourable member for West Sydney, whom the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in the early part of the session proclaimed to be not a constitutional lawyer-of course, he was quite mistaken, because remember by the cases he has taken to their utmost limi t in, the Courts, and won, the honourable member has proved that he is a constitutional lawyer. They will not accept any suggestion, except, perhaps, One on a matter of small importance, from any honourable member of the Opposition. The day is far .off when the House will accept from any honourable member a suggestion which is good. We are still obliged to adhere to party government; otherwise we would have strong press rule, which would be even worse. However, although they are not prepared to take the big departure now suggested, I hope the Government will take some of the points from the honourable member's suggestion, even if they dish it up in some other form, so that they may give the people some opportunity of preventing profiteering. If the Government would accept the suggestion put forward, evasion by traders would not be as easy as it is today. In the street, one may see a pair of boots advertised at 35s., and in another window a pair marked at 45s. may be of exactly the same make. Of course, a man's pride may lead him to purchase the higher priced article-nothin g on earth Would save a man from wasting his money in that way-bu t there is a great section of the community who do not desire to be robbed, and having a limited amount of cash, and great responsibilities in their homes, cannot afford to waste money for the sake of empty pride. However desirous we may be of placing on the statute-book legislation for the benefit, of the. people, it will not be beneficial to them if they themselves will not assist giving effect to it . But the suggestion of the honourable member for West Sydney would at least afford assistance in beating the profiteers. We hear a great deal of talk about the universal desire to bring dowii the high cost of commodities, but to me the possibility of bringing it down seems very remote. My trouble is to prevent prices from rising further, and I believe that if the Commonwealth and State Parliaments were really in earnest, they could prevent the inflation of prices above their present level. Of course, the real value of an article is based upon the amount of profit earned by those who sell it , and if , by any set of circumstances, the vendors are able to force the public to buy at liigher prices, naturally they earn greater profits. The great fear of vested interests today is that a crash may follow any drop in prices. When we see cablegrams in the press announcing a drop in prices in other countries, we also see the fear expressed by those who deal in the particular commodities affected and in allied lines that there may be a general crash all round. I believe that if ever we have a repetition of the crisis through which the State of Victoria passed in the nineties, there will be an enormous drop in prices. It was the working section of the community which suffered most during that crisis. I am willing to risk the charge being levelled against me that I am endeavouring to bolster up profiteering when I declare that I do not wish the people I represent to experience again all the horrors of that period. If it had .not been for the dis- covery of gold in Western Australia, the people of Victoria would have starved, notwithstanding the fact that, at the time the State was enjoying bountiful, harvests. The boom which preceded the period of depression had deflated prices considerably, and people were making large fortunes out of them, u n t i l the howl for economy arose, and the Paterson Government came into power, and by applying that economy caused a heavy "" f r o s t , "" which was accompanied by a tremendous drop in prices. I have no desire to see that time arrive again - But I claim that legislation of the character suggested today, if the Government and the people were all desirous of helping, would prevent any further inflation of prices u n t i l we could re-arrange economical conditions in the body politic. Of course, if the Government does not dei n sire to do this, to advocate it is merely to talk to the wind. But on three occasions already I have told the people of this State, and I shall continue to do so on every opportunity I get during the present electoral campaign, that the high trend of prices can be stopped if the Federal and State Governments desire to stop it . The State Parliament undoubtedly possesses sovereign powers, though the exercise of those powers may raise this difficulty, that the lessening of the price of a commodity in Victoria may mean that it will be sent to some other State for sale. I understand that we produce only half the hides that are used in the manufacture of leather in this State, and it has been said that were the price of leather reduced, hides would no longer be sent here from other States. Therefore, the State oowers have their limitations. Surely, however, the people have now arrived at the knowledge that the only Parliament that could deal effectively with profiteering is the Commonwealth Parliament. It is said that we have not now the necessary power, though a recent decision of the High Oourt considerably modified the view previously expressed as to our position. The proposed Convention for the alteration of the Constitution may take years to do anything, and if in the interim we can prevent the rise of prices, we should try to do so. The amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney provides an opportunity. Every member must admit that were effect given to it , traders could not continue to rob the people with their present impunity.. As for the alteration of the law proposed by the Government, in my opinion it will mean that on high constitutional questions a threepower vote may govern a seven-power organization. Of course, one of the four Judges not sitting on the case might agree with the three who dealt with it ; but, on the other hand, four of the seven Judges might'hold an opinion contrary to the decision of the three who determined the matter. ""Under a proposal like this we get no stability, and, although the M in ister may t w it me with not being a lawyer, I say - that laymen can foresee the effect of laws just as well as lawyers can, and 1I have followed the decisions of the Court on the constitutional powers of this Parliament with fear and trembling. We thought at first that the thirty-nine articles of the Constitution gave us the powers which they were intended to give; but the High Court said that that was not so, and we have been floundering ever since. The honourable member for West Sydney, however, has conceived a (method whereby we may frighten the profiteers from charging high prices, and I think that the Government should adopt it .",27
20,Mr FENTON,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Maribyrnong ) [4.36] A conference of women that recently (met in Melbourne determined that they would discontinue the wearing of gloves u n t i l the prices of these articles became more reasonable. A mere man, perhaps, Las no right to enter upon what may be regarded as the preserves of the womeniulk, but I have often said in my own family circle that the wearing of gloves does not enhance a woman's appearance, and that they are not necessary except in biting cold weather. For a woman to wear gloves on a swelteringly hot day is to make herself uncomfortable. women know how difficult it is nowadays to get much for £ 1 , and I believe, with them, that the public would do much to bring down prices if it resolved to abstain from the purchase of many articles for which it is now charged an exorbitant rate. But in striving to reduce expenditure a f a m i l y might deprive itself of commodities absolutely necessary for the sustenance of its members, and no Parliament could stand idly by and allow such sacrifices. It may be said, "" The people have the remedy for the present state of affairs in their own hands;' let them take it "" ; but a Parliament that had the power to reduce high prices, and did not do so, would be unworthy. The 'Hungarian Parliament has passed laws imposing penalties for profiteering, and has enacted, among other things, that, a person found guilty of charging excessive rates for goods shall be taken into a public square, there to receive so many strokes of the cane.",29
21,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,I would rather go elsewhere for my examples.,29
22,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,The honourable member is getting a long way from the measure before the House.,29

25,Mr FENTON,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"How would it be if we had a law like that of Hungary, so that a member of a big Flinders-lane f i r m found guilty of charging too highly for goods might be ordered, a public flagellation in one of our parks? It is said that the result of this kind of legislation elsewhere has been the reduction of the cost of living.",29
26,Mr HILL,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Why , then, not provide in the amendment for such a penalty?",29
27,Mr FENTON,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"If there are in the community any persons who should be publicly flagellated, it is those who are extorting too much money from the poor. I know of no greater crime. Ministers sitting here in comfort and ease care not how the public may suffer. Tbey know, that they have a majority which will outvote the amendment. They are content to stand by and allow the public to be fleeced, as they did during the war period, The doing nothing to relieve the distresses of the people, notwithstanding that many of those who are suffering most are the f a m i lies of men who sacrificed their lives in the defence of the businesses of the profiteers. These words of protest against the profiteers are resolving themselves into mere platitudes because their oft-repeated utterance, but they are none the less true. Mr Knibbs, his June Bulletin, gives figures showing that between 1914 and 1920- a period of the greatest storm and stress the has ever known-the greatest professional robbery has taken place, yet the "" Y majority in this Parliament are not lift ing a little finger to relieve the people.",29
28,Mr RILEY,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,When the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt ) comes back something will be lifted.,30

The way in which the people can obtain remeasure lief - is by practically changing the face this Parliament. That can be secured only by an appeal to the people. U n fortunately, when the > people are pealed to, they sometimes allow trumlighter, pery, flimsy, extraneous questions to i fluence them in the exercise of the franway chise. I do not hesitate to say that those who allow themselves to be so i fluenced, and return to Parliament men of the class supporting the present vernment, deserve all they get. Inter-State Commission, in various reState railway disputes. ports presented to the Government durwould ing the last three years, have suggested methods by which the people might be relieved. The Government, however, fiteering. stand idly by. They allow the people suffer, and the profiteer to carry on at Court. his own sweet will . If Flinders-lane merchants, or others who are charging excessive prices, knew that they were likely to be publicly caned for doing we should soon have drastic reductions. Woollen goods, which, notwithstanding the high price of wool, are being sold the local .woollen mills at from 10s. 12s. per yard, are Being sold by the wholesale houses at 22s., 28s., and per yard. A Government that will allow that sort of thing to continue is not fit to remain on the Treasury bench, the majority which supports such a Government is unworthv to sit in Parliareal ment. The figures I have just given to the price of woollens are not my own, but have been presented in evidence before a Committee of 'Investigation. The Government object to this amend of ment, but they do not say that, while they consider this is not the time and the in place to introduce such an amendment, they are prepared, as soon as possible, to introduce a Bill which will enable us world to put down profiteering. When we - make a suggestion to them they eay, o u know full well that it is useless - for us to attempt anything of the k in d . "" The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) goes further and says, "" Did we not submit a proposal to the people nine months ago that this Parliament should be given increased power to legislate to stop the depredations of the profiteers, and did not the people turn down our prothe posals? "" It is true that those proposals were rejected, but we have recent evidence that the Parliament has even noy power to put down profiteering. If only the Government would bring down a dealing with profiteering in an of earnest and effective way, I am satisfied that the High Court would determine that it was constitutional. It has always apbeen argued, particularly by the State that it would be almost immoral n - for this Parliament to legislate in any likely to affect a State instrumentality, but, in a recent decision of the n - High Court, three of the five Justices who constituted the Bench decided that Go the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation The and Arbitration had power to deal with A Court that give such a decision would deter-, mine, I believe, that we had constitutional power to legislate against proOur Constitution has not yet to been given a fair show by the High I do not wish to speak disrespectfully of those learned Justices who have passed away, but every decision given by the Court in the past has so, been in the direction of limiting more and more our constitutional powers. Sir William Irvine, when representing F l i nby ders in this House, once likened the to position of the Australian people under the Commonwealth Constitution to that 35s. of a man who was wearing a coat many sizes toosmall for him, which was bursting at every seam. The late Mr Alfred and Deakin more than once declared that 'the late Chief Justice Marshall was the maker of the Constitution of the as United States of America. Readers of the constitutional history of the United States of America know that Chief Justice Marshall strained, almost to the breaking point, the Constitution of that great country. He knew that, unless he did so, the American people would be hobbled and handcuffed. The result of his masterly judgments i6 that the people ot the United States of America aTe satisfied with their Federal Constitution. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - The member should get it into his head that the trouble in regard to dealing with the profiteer is not a question of power. The Stabe Parliaments have complete power to deal with profiteering.",30
32,Mr FENTO N,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"But consider the personnel of the State Parliaments. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - There is Storey, Premier of New South ""Wales, and Mr Theodore, Premier of Queensland. ' Mr Fenton - But what sort of a Legislative Council has Mr Storey to deal with? W it h the exception of Queensland, no 'State has real legislative power to deal with the profiteer.. Every measure passed by the Lower House has bo run the gauntlet of the Legislative Council; and the members of those Councils are hand-in-glove with the profiteers in the community. Are they going to pass legislation which will condemn themselves and their brothers? Not at all. I believe that this Parliament has power to deal with profiteering, and I should like the Government to bring a test case before the very intelligent High Court that we have today. It is not only greater in numbers than in years gone by, but, with all due respect to those who have passed away, it is greater in brain power and legal knowledge. If our constitutional powers were put to the test, I am sure we should have from the Court a series of decisions interpreting the Acts of this Parliament in a way that would enable us to deal effectively with the profiteers. In the Bulleti n .of Australian Statistics, No. 80, compiled by Mr Knibbs, there will be found, on page 73, a table dealing with the purchasing power of money, showing the amounts necessary, on the average, in each year from 1901 to the second quarter of 1920, to purchase in each capital town what would have cost, on the average, £ 1 in 1911, in the .Australian capitals regarded as a whole.",31
33,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,To purchase what?,31
34,Mr FENTON,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"The figures relate to the purchase of groceries and food, house rents, and also ''generally."" - Sir JOSEPH COOK - The trouble is that Mr Knibbs does not deal with the cost of things' generally. H is figures relate to only a few commodities. honourable Mr Fenton - The pity is that we have not the figures showing the way in which the prices of all commodities have increased.",31
35,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"He shows that in respect of the total cost of living, the in crease is considerably less than 50 per cent. John Mr Fenton - He does not. Our complaint is that Mr Knibbs' returns do not include the cost of all household items; if they did, it would be found that the increase in the cost of living is fa r heavier than is indicated. In this return it is shown that in Sydney in 1914 it cost 24s. I d . to purchase goods which in 1911 could be purchased for £ 1 , and that in the second quarter of 1920 the cost had gone up to 36s. 5d.",31
36,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"A 50 per cent, in crease.",31
37,Mr FENTON,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"In some cases the in crease is greater. In Melbourne goods which in 1911 cost £ 1 , cost 22s. I d . in 1914, and 35s. 2d. in 1920. In Brisbane in 1920 the cost had gone up to 33s.; in Adelaide the cost had risen from 22s. lOd. in 1914, to 35s. I d . in 1920; in Perth, from 22s. lOd. in 1914, to 33s. I d . in 1920; and in Hobart, from 21s. lOd. in 1914, to 35s. Sd. in 1920. The weighted average for the Commonwealth was 22s. lOd. in 1914, and 35s. 4d. in 1920. In respect of certain goods there was an increase in some of the States of 101.7 per cent.",31
38,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,In respect of some things.,31
39,Mr FENTON,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"In respect of a good many things which are required in the homes of the poor. I give now the figures supplied by Mr Knibbs to show the difference between the .purchasing power of the sovereign in 1911 and at the present time as applied to the cost of groceries and food. He shows that in Sydney what could be purchased for £1 in 1911 cost 23s: I d . in 1914 and today costs 42s. That is nearly double, and is certainly more than a rise of - 50 per cent.",31
40,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,That was due to the war.,32
41,Mr FENTON,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"I do not care to said characterize the statement too harshly, but we have been frequently informed, that living is cheaper in Australia than in any other part of the world.

' Mr Fenton - The statement that living is cheaper in Australia than in other parts of the world is only so much clap-trap.

Mr Knibbs' figures supplied for the other capitals, as well for Sydney. For Melbourne the figures are, respectively, 21s. lOd. in 1914, and 40s. 6d. in the second quarter of this Customs. year. For Brisbane the figures are 21s. 7d. and 41s. 4d. For Adelaide 21s. 4d. view, and 42s. 9d. For Perth 26s. and 40s. 5d. For Hobart 24s. 3d. and 41s. lOd. The total weighted average, taking the whole will not keep up. of the States, is represented by the figures £1 for 1911, 22s. l i d . for 1914, and 41s. 7d. at the present time. In spite of these figures, the Treasurer says that Australia is a fine in, and that people can live more cheaply here than in any other part of the world. Although some of the States have sufit. fered severely from drought, there has been an abundant food supply produced in Australia, and we never knew what it was to be short of anything in this country during war time. That cannot be of other countries in the world. The Treasurer stated in his Budget-speech that Australia paid more per head of population in the way of war expenditure did most of the other parts of the Empire, and that, in view of the the number of soldiers we had at the Front, we suffered more seriously in casualties than did other portions of the Empire. He now says that we can live more cheaply here than people can live in other parts of the world. Every one that; but in a land of plenty we should be able to live much more cheaply than do people in other parts of the world. Surely it is no excuse for the inaction of the Government and their failure to come to the relief of the people who are suffering from high prices in Australia to say that Aye live here more cheaply than people do in other parts of the world. I suppose that according to population Australia is the greatest wool-producing country in the up world, and also the greatest food-producing country.",32

Unfortunately, after the Bill was introduced, it was imheavy mortgages. mediately placed low down on the business-paper j and this has had the effect of making it more difficult to give the lief which I sought to secure by the amendment I proposed for the extension of the moratorium for the protection people who today arecarrying heavy mortgages. There are certain parts of the ComiiLonwealth where the primary producers particularly have suffered from a severe drought. There was a drought for two years in the State of New South Wales, and the primary producers were looking forward to relief in the direction suggested by my amendment. The action which of the Government in plaeing this measure so low down on the business-paper at a time when relief was anxiously looked' for by the prior.arv producers has made i much' more difficult to give them relief by the extension of the moratorium than ib would have been if the Government had proceeded with the consideration of the Bill. When I foreshadowed my amendrow, ment the Treasurer said that if I would withdraw i the would urge 'upon the ficial Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) the necesofthe sity for bringing this matter before Premiers' Conference, wEich at the time was sitting in Melbourne. The Prime t'o Minister gave an assurance to the House that if my amendment were withdrawn he would bring the matter before the Premiers' Conference, and get the Pre-' miers of the different States to take it However, the Conference took place, and I understand that the Prime Minister Treasurer's never mentioned the matter there.. Consequently, not only he, but the Treasurer, to a certain extent, did not carry out the definite promise that they made to the House-.",33

I have only to repeatnow I said then: That the Government had an opportunity of doing something; tc give relief to those people in the who are suffering, particularly in New South Wales, from the effects of a. two years' drought, and are carrying: The Government missed the opportunity that was afforded rethem then. They did not even go to the extent of bringing the matter before the Premiers' Conference, and urging the Preof miers to do something. Evidently the Premiers did not think they were calle:l upon to take action, because they realized that the Federal Government bad the necessary power. It was the proper and peculiar function of the Federal Government to - aet. They had preyiously arranged for the extension of the moratorium under the Wlar Precautions Act,, is, unfortunately, still in existence-. The Government have done by means of it many things that are undesirable, but. this is one of the good things that could' t be done under it. They could have given relief to a great number of deserving people, but neglected the opportunity, yet if an election were to take place to-morthe Treasurer and those associated with him would point to the many benethings they had done in the interests man on the land. This is one in the stance in which the Government have absolutely failed to do their proper duty people, who are suffering today as the result of the inactivity of the Government in that regard. I intend to press the amendment, because I am satisfied that the Government have the requisite power. up. I have been told that it is now too late, to do anything. T do not know what the view is, but it is "" up to "" the Attorney-General to make some Statement to the House to show the exact position at the present time. I shall see that, even at this belated stage, something is donein the direction of giving, relief if the. mennumbers are with me. If ' it is a. fact that nothing can now be done, the fault lies at the door of the Government for having shelved the Bill for so long. They first introduced it, and then placed it so low on the notiee-paper that it has taken, months to reach it. Then on Friday last they tried to force it through, hut I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition (- Mr Tudor) prevented them from doing so.",34

However, we expect that sort of conduct from them.",35

I am pleased that the opportunity is now given to the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) to speak to his amendment. I hope something will be done to redness the grievances under which the people are suffering today through, the .prevalence of profiteering. The Treasurer endeavoured to throw cold water, on the very telling facts brought forward by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), who showed that in Queensland, according to the latest figures published, the cost of living is less than in any other State of the Commonwealth.",35
73,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"I never heard the honourable member say that.  quoted the figures for the respective capitals of the States to show that the cost of living was less in Queensland than in any other State. That is a fact, because the figures are published by the Federal Statistician, and I am sure that even the Treasurer will accept them. It will, of course, be said .that the Government have no power to deal with the profiteer. That has often been said' before; but here is an opportunity to confer ample power, by means of a Judiciary Bill, upon the High Court and die other Courts of the Commonwealth and the States, to call upon manufacturers to furnish a statement of the manufactured cost of articles.. Those can then be traced right along the road from the producer to the consumer, and an estimate formed of what should be a fair profit upon any particular commodity.",35
74,Mr BHENNAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"They ought to be satisfied with the High Court as an investigating tribunal.  We have an opportunity, by means of it this Bill, to confer that power on the High Court. No doubt the people who are suffering as the result of the profiteering that is going on will watch proceedings with intense interest, ih order to see whether the Government take advantage of the chance offered' to them to bring about an improvement of the conditions under which they have been compelled to live for the last four or five years. The honourable member for Maribyrnong spoke of woollen goodB; Two months ago I visited the woollen mills in the electorate of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister).

The honourable member for .Flinders (Mr Bruce) has previously attempted to throw cold water on any statement of this character) but I now say, deliberately, that the sub-manager of this particular mill assured me that material that was turned out by themthis was two or three months ago-at 12s. per yard went into Flinders-lane, and by the time it got through Flinderslane its price was 30s. per yard. Senator J. F. Guthrie said the same thing in another place.",35

Government supporters will also say that the statement made to me at Geelong is not true, although I have given the testimony of the man who is controlling the m ill . The honourable member for Flinders, as we all know, is interested in a business in Flinders-lane; but, while due weight must be given to his word, I would not take it , or the word of any one else, in preference to the word of those directly concerned in the turning out of the material i u the mills.",36
81,Mr ATKINSON,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Did the Geelong man say that the wholesale houses in Flinders-lane got '30s. per yard material 1  when it had passed through their hands. The difference between 12s. and 30s. represented the profit the Flinders-lane houses were making. That is the profit that the middleman was making, because I take it that the middleman is represented by those in Flinders-lane. That is to say, by the time the tailor gets this material from the Flinders-lane, people the cost has increased to 30s. per yard.",36

Its purpose is to require the production of .statistics of the cost of production and the cost of manufacture in Australia, and the landed cost of all imported goods. That, at all events, is one thing that may be done by the Government under this amendment. It was said a little while ago by those who are opposed to the adoption for the of a proper Tariff that, ss a result of increased Protection, the cost of living would go up.",36

Now the Commonwealth Government can do that Nobody in this House, not a member of"" the legal profession, would care to pit ""his opinion against that contained in the article referred to, - for we may presume that it wae written on legal advice. What is the use, therefore, of contending that the - Goverument have not the power?",37
90,Mr BELL,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"But , after you get these .statistics, what do you. propose to do?  gest . that the Government may exercise their power in. a manner which, surely, would suggest itself to the honourable member.",37
91,Mr FENTON,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Unde r the Industrial Peace Bill the Government have authority to make a complete investigation into the price of coal.  the honourable member for Maribyrnong has pointed out. by way of interjection, it is claimed that the Government, under that. Bill, will be able to follow all the operations' in the production of coal, from the time it is taken from the bowels of the earth until it is placed in the hands of the consumer, and decide what, is a fair priceI f , then, we have power to do this in relation to coal, why should we not exercise it in regard to a suit of clothes ?",37

We have the War Precautions Act in existence still. Can the honourable member 6how that the Governmenb could not deal with profiteering under that Act? But apart from bhat .power altogether, the Government have absolute control over taxation in every shape and form, .and, per medium of our taxation laws, they could reach all of these people who are profiteering. I did not require to be told by the submanager of the Geelong mills that there is profiteering in woollen goods. This fact is as plain as a pike-staff to every one in the communiby. Everybody know6 bhat, during the war period, the added cost to the local manufacture of the wool required for a suit length did not amount to more than 6s.. because all wool was made available to them at an appraised price of 15^d. per lb.",37

99,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"To some extent, at all events..  huge dividends declared by these firms who are standing between the producer and the consumer show that profiteering is being indulged in, with the result that we have to pay enormously enhanced prices for clothing-as much as £14 14s. and £15 15s. for a suit which in pre-war days could have been obtained for £4 4s. or £5 5s. As an illustration of the way in which these people are preying upon the simplicity of the consumers, I may remind honourable members that on the day that the Victorian Fair Profits Commission, which is supposed to be making a serious investigation into this question of costs of production, but which is practically useless to all intents and purposes, granted an application for permission to increase the price of bacon to Is. l i d . per lb., the Victorian Government gazetted the acceptance of a tender for the supply of bacon to the railway refreshment-rooms at Is. 5d. per lb.",37
100,Mr MAHOTTV,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"That means that the workers are being robbed to the extent of 6d. per lb.  that the increase granted by the Fair Profits Commission, compared with the' accepted tender price for the railway refreshment-rooms represents a tax of 6d. per lb. upon the general public. It is an unwarranted increase in the price of an important commodity. I do not wish to delay the House longer, as I am anxious that a vote shall be taken on this question. Members opposite have shown by interjection that they agree that profiteering is going on; and, while they agree with us to that extent, it is not their sire to do anything to prevent it. Here is an opportunity for members to show their sincerity, and to get right down to bedrock. I claim that the Government have the power to move in this matter, because they could not do what has been suggested in regard to profiteering under the Tariff, or in regard to coal under the Industrial Peaoe Act, if they have not the power. The recent decision of the High Court has completely changed the opinions that were previously held, and has absolutely shattered our oid-time convictions as to what power Parliament possesses. We have practically complete authority in a direction in which we previously thought our hands were tied. I do not think it can be said by members opposite that we have not very extensive authority to deal with the great evil of profiteering, and this is our opportunity to show how sincere we really are. This is our chance to get down to bedrock and to do our work as a Parliament in stamping out the profiteer who is inflicting such hardships upon the people of the Commonwealth. >",38
101,Mr RYAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"West Sydney) [5.48] This Bill first came before the House in April last, and shortly after it was introduced the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr 'Groom) moved a motion which had the effect of altering its position on the notice-paper. I opposed that motion, and gave my reasons for doing so. I said at the time that it was imperative that something should be done by Parliament to deal with profiteering; but the Government had their way, and the Bill was placed well down on the notice-paper. I immediately gave notice of an amendment to be moved on the motion for the second reading, the object of which was to have a comprehensive measure introduced conferring the powers upon the High Court of Australia to make the necessary investigations into the profits that were being made by local manufacturers and importers. As soon as that notice was given the measure was dropped to the bottom of the notice-paper, and remained there for some months-until last Fridaywhen the Government suddenly discovered that the measure was an urgent one. I am glad to learn that, in my absence, assisting in the Queensland de- elections, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) moved the amendment of which I had given notice, with ' the result that we are able to discuss it this afternoon. I do not know what reasons the Minister in charge of the Bill gave for treating the measure as an urgent one at this juncture. He certainly indicated, by the fact that it was placed lower on the notice paper, that it was not urgent some time ago. What is there in the Bill as it was introduced by the Government? What does it propose to do? As I understand it, it proposes to alter the position of the High Court as regards the number of Judges who must concur in a decision upon constitutional questions. An amendment is to be made in the Act of 1912 which made it necessary for a majority of the whole Bench to concur in any decision declaring an Act of this Parliament invalid. In 1912, in supporting the measure which made it necessary to haye an absolute majority of the full Bench, the present Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) saidA law ought to be declared unconstitutional only when it is obviously so. This can be clearly indicated only when a majority of the Justices of the High Court are of the opinion that it is unconstitutional. Then nothing ther cnn be said. But the people and Parliament have a right to complain when their deliberate enactments are set on one side, although a majority of the Justices of the High Court is not of the opinion that they are constitutional. That is taken from Hansard, volume 69, page 7097, and gives the reasons of the Prinie Minister for inserting the provision which the Government now propose to repeal. They now make it possible for a minority of Justices of the High Court of Australia to declare an Act of this Parliament unconstitutional. I ask the Minister if that is not the proposal of the Government?",38
102,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,Yes .,39
103,Mr RYAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"The effect is that a minority of the Justices of the High Court of Australia will be able to declare an Act of this Parliament invalid, although a majority may think-if they have the opportunity to confer-that the Act is quite valid. I have quoted the Prime Minister's reasons for amending the Act in 1912, and I know of no reasons being advanced for repealing that provision. Were any representations made by the Justices of the High Court? If so, what were they? When were they made, and is that the purpose of this amendment? The amendment made in 1915 was one which would operate during the war period, and now it is proposed that that shall continue indefinitely. What urgency is there in a measure of this sort? There is very great urgency, indeed, in having a measure that will enable a proper investigation to be made into the question of profiteering. Every one,- even the Ministers on the Treasury bench, admits that profiteering is going on. They also admit that they are not doing anything, and say that they have not the power. The Government bring into this Chamber measures to deal with industrial unrest, including an Industrial Peace Bill, and an amendment of the Arbitration Act. They elaborately set about appointing bodies to investigate the causes of industrial unrest, although they know perfectly well that the most prolific cause is the profiteering that is allowed to exist in the commuuity. What is the use of appointing Committees to investigate this matter, and to go into the causes, when we wilfully blind ourselves to the furfact that profiteering is the main cause of industrial unrest? We are refusing to confer upon a tribunal such as the High Court of Australia, or the Supreme un- Court for the different .States, the power to investigate the matters to which I have referred. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition is not intended to wreck this Bill, although it would not matter if it were wrecked, because there is hardly anything in it. Our object is to get a more comprehensive measure immediately introduced.",39
104,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,Then you do intend to wreck the Bill?,39

107,Mr RYAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"What we desire to do' is to confer upon the High Court the power to investigate the profits made by local manufacturers and importers. No one denies that that power exists, and it is the duty of this Parliament to exercise its authority. No one knows better than the Government that they have the power, but they refuse to exercise it. Now they will have an opportunity. We are taking the only opportunity that is afforded us of making a'move in this direction. The Government are in charge of the business of the House, and can bring forward whatever they like; and it is not often that we have the opportunity of amending their proposals. Here is a chance of doing it. Section 51 of the Constitution specifically gives the Government the power, amongst other things, to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth in reference to certain matters, amongst which is census and statistics. that connection that we desire to confer this jurisdiction upon the High Court of Australia and the Supreme Courts of the different States. We propose to rest this proposal upon all the powers contained in the Constitution. Here I may say that other measures that the Government have introduced during this session have heen based upon very narrow grounds when they could have been set upon broad foundations so that successful attacks might be made upon their constitutionality later on. What can be said against a proposal of this character?' Can the Minister say that profiteering is not going on? Can he say it would not be desirable to have an investigation made? Can he say that if investigations were made, we would not be able to use that informatio n with satisfactory results? If the purchaser of an article were able to see by the marking on it what it cost to produce, and the profits being made by the vendor, it would go a long way in the direction of making vendors accept a smaller profit. sible for us to exercise the power in the matter of taxation, as we have ample and plenary power in that direction. could double the imposts on those who are making excessively high profits, and we could make profiteering unprofitable.

We shall then have an opportunity of seeing precisely where honourable members stand upon an important matter of this kind. I do not believe that the amendment will be carried, but, at all events, it will have the effect of exposing the position which is occupied by honourable members in regard to this question. It may even result in inducing their constituents to bring such pressure to bear upon Ministers as will cause the latter to alter the policv which they have hitherto adopted.",40
121,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [6.3] It is interesting to hear the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) suggest that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) is doing things because of his constituents. Of course the honourable member who has submitted, this amendment did not move it for any such reason. He is actuated by a highsouled desire to prevent profiteering. Yet, when there was an opportunity of conferring upon this Parliament by constitutional means the power to deal with the evil of which he complains, he asked the people to turn the proposal down and to leave Parliament impotent in the matter. He is now endeavouring to cover up his tracks. Upon previous occasions the honourable member has raised party cries for political purposes. Only a few years ago he declaimed against the Trusts whicn he stated were all over this country, doing all sorts of in j u r y to everybody. served for one election. The following election we found that it was the f e a r f u l be investigated in the end. beef barons who were the cause of all our troubles. Now they seem to have disappeared, and there is another hideous monster in their place who is throttling everybody- I refer to the profiteer. It is significant that the profiteering to which the honourable member refers is almost in variably associated by him with the food that we eat-wit h our primary products. That is the profiteering which he is so eager to attack. He has affirmed that it is our duty to show reasons why his amendment should not be carried. If he adopted that attitude in a Court the Judge would promptly say to him, "" You are putting forward an affirmative proposition, and it is your duty to establish it . "" The honourable member says that he is not out to wreck the Bill ; but that statement sounds strangely in the light of his amendment, which proposes the omission - of all the words after "" that , "" with a view to in serting other words in lieu thereof. The purpose of the amendment is obviously :to block the measure. He desires the Bill to be absolutely withdrawn, and the Government to introduce a measure to confer jurisdiction upon the High Court to investigate certain matters and, inter alia, to provide for the furnishing of statistics. Practically he wishes to convert the H i gh Court of Australia into a sub-Department of the Department of Statistics. That is the effect of his amendment. He desires to make a judicial body, which has been endowed with the highest functions under our Constitution, nothing but a sub-Department under Mr Knibbs. His amendment purports to deal with profiteering. But he knows that under the Constitution this Parliament cannot effectively deal with that question, that the powers over trade and commerce are exceedingly .limited, and that this Parliament can in reality deal only with Inter-State and external commerce. He knows, also, from the in quiries on the subject of profiteering which are proceeding in Australia today that, if nrofiteering is to be dealt with effectively, we must get right down to the individual transactions within the States, because, after all , this is essentially an Intra-State problem. If we look at the methods by which it is being attacked in every country in the world That cry it will become apparent that it is individual transactions which must Let honourable members study the Profiteering Act in Queensland. Let them iook at the proposals for dealing with this evil which are at present before the New South Wales Parliament. Take the inquiries which are being conducted in Victoria today, and it will be seen that, in order to deal effectively with profiteering individual cases have to be reached. Federal legislation cannot affect that matter, it being generally one of Intra-State trade. The honourable member's proposal is merely a bluff. It seeks to empower the High Court Justices to do something which can be done just as effectively by somebody else, it aims at bringing about a perversion of the functions of the Justices of the H i gh Court. Of course there is Federal power to deal with statistics, and we were effectively exercising that power long before the honourable member came here. When the Australian Industries Preservation Bill was under consideration in this Chamber, there were placed in the hands of the Controller of Customs special powers of questioning. The H i gh Court sustained the Act , and long ago affirmed that this' Parliament possessed the power to enact it . lose in which the Colonial Sugar Refincars. ""ihg' Comoany was involved also proved -'that this Parliament possessed the power to legislate with respect to certain quiries. But what haB that to do with the solution of the great profiteering problem? The aduption of the amendAustralia, ment would.not help us one ictain that connection.

W h i l e I am prepared to accept an amendment in that direction, I .think that when it comes to a matter affecting the rights of the six sovereign States, which comprise the Federation, we should adhere to the existing provision of the Act , which' requires unanimity on the part of four Justices. I would like the. Minister to promise to amend the Bill so that in regard to constitutional matters affecting the rights of the States the decision of the High Court must be given by at least four Justices in agreement -. Otherwise, I shall be compelled to oppose the second reading.",44
145,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"D a r l in g Downs-Minis ..25 ter for Works and Railways). [ 8 . 1 0 ] ; - I 11 do not desire to make any further reply upon the Bill generally, but I would 14 point out to the honourable member for AXES. Dampier (Mr Gregory) that he is asking the Government to eliminate the very essence of the Bill . The necessity for this measure arises, not from any political cir- cumstances, but because of the position in which the Judiciary has found itself in carrying on its work. Let me trace the history of this matter. In 1902 the High Court consisted of a Chief Justice and 'two justices - These three carried on the work u n t i l 1906, and decisions were left practically to the m a j o r it y of NOES. the Court for the time being. In 1906 it became advisable to strengthen the High Court Judiciary,' and the number of - Justices was increased by two. Then, Tellers: again, the majority prevailed. By 1912 the work of the High Court had grown PAIBS. very much, and its difficulties had been so considerably increased by arbitral work that it became necessary to again strengthen the Bench by the appointment of two additional Justices. However, at that stage it was thought advisable to make some alteration as regards majority decisions on questions affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, which obviously include questions affecting the Commonwealth and the States, as to whether the Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate upon certain matters, as to whether there is conflict between Commonwealth and State legislation, or as to whether a State has exercised certain powers in conflict with those of the Commonwealth. Parliament accordingly passed a law providing that in a F u l l Court consisting of less than all the Justices no.decision should be given on matters affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth unless a majority of all the Judges concurred in it . In other words, although there might be six or seven justices sitting in the F u l l Court, at least f o u r Justices had to be in agreement. Mr RTAN.^-Why was that alteration, made?",44
146,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Previousl y decisions had been given by a simple majority when the strength of the Bench was smaller.; but, having increased the number up toseven, it was thought advisable to provide that four Judges must be in agreement in giving any decision affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. It must not be forgotten that Justices get leave of absence from time to time, but there is no power to appoint a Deputy Justice of the High Court. If it is wished to add to the Bench while any Justice is absent, a Justice of the Court must be appointed: At present, Mr Justice Powers is away on leave of absence, but even before he went away the Court found itself hampered in carrying onits work because of the provisionof the Act requiring decisions on such constitutional matters to begiven by four Justices.",45
147,Sir ROBERT BEST,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Particularl y when two Justices areconstantly engaged, in the Arbitration Conrt - amendment",45
148,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Yes . The difficulty arose at the beginning of this year in connection with a judgment given quite recently as to the extent to which the Commonwealth could by its legislation interfere with State instrumentalities. Three Justices were of one opinion, and three were of ar different opinion,, and: ultimately' Mr Justice-Starke had to give up his work in Melbourne to go to Sydney to take part in. the case; In* addition to their Pull Court work, matters arising under the original jurisdiction of the 'High Cou-rt have to be dealt with, and the Justices are also exercising powers for the Commonwealth under the Lands Acquisition Act. There has already been one very important case in connection, with the eastwest railway, which necessitated a Justice being away fromVictoria for a considerable time. Then there is the work cast on the Justices under the arbitration laws. Consequently it has been found very difficult to get the necessary . quorum for a sitting of the Pull. Court. Furthermore, the Justices must have leave of absence occasionally. Mr Justice Powers,, whois returning shortly, thoroughly deserved his leave, being: almost, broken, in health by 'the continuous strain of attention to arbitrationduties-; but Mr Justice Isaacs, who has not had a holiday since his appointment in 1906,. is now going on leave, so that there will still be only six Justices in active emi ployment. It is not desirable to appoint an additional Justice, and, therefore, the obtaining of the quorum, required under existing law, to constitute a Court for the decision of constitutional questions has become a practical difficulty, and it has been suggested that the Act might 'be amended by allowing such questions to be decided by a judgment concurred in. by three Justices. It does not necessarily follow that every constitutional question will be decided by three Justices only. It is certain that on any big issue arising, involving a reconsideration of the fundamental provisions of the Constitution or a revision of very important judgments, the Chief Justice would convene as large a Court. as he could get. 1 It sometimes happens, however, that cases, which involve the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth are not of such great importance. In the proposed - it is sought to enable the Court to carry on its functions expe ditiously. Obviously, it would not-do to 7 give to one party alone any special rights in this matter. It will be found that the' concurrence of threeJustices is a sufficient guarantee fora proper interpretation of the Constitution.. If a case on appeal from, a State Supreme Court, or from a decision of a. Justice-of the High-Court;, is being heard bysix 1 Justices, and the Court is equally divided, the rule is that the decision appealed from is confirmed; but in every other case, the opinion of the Chief Justice, or, in his absence, that of the senior Justice present, prevails, because finalitymust be attained. For many years constitutional questions wore decided according to the judgment of two Justices, who gave very important and fundamental decisions.",45
149,Mr BRENNAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,Some persons say that in those days one Justice made all. the decisions.,45
150,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Many of those who said; that were actuated by unkindly feelings - It will be a good thing for Australia if she never has Judges whose standard islower, than that of the first three Justices of. the High Court of the Commonwealth. Australia was very, fortunate: in. them. They were men. off the highest integrity, greatest ability, profound learning, and strictest impartiality, who, when feeling was pretty warm, kept the balance even and dealt fair l y between contending ..parties. They have left a magnificent tradition, which I hope will long influence the Judiciaries of Australia.'",45

153,Mr MCWILLIAM S,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Franklin ) [8.23]. - W it h all deference to the Minister (Mr Groom), I hold that his explanation amounted to an ment in favour of increasing number of Justices of the High Court. So far as I can gather, the only reason for the proposed change is that the preseut Justices are overworked. It must be remembered that there is absolutely no appeal from the decision of the Court in constitutional cases, although from time to time issues vitally affecting a State may arise through a conflict between Commonwealth and State authorities. I ' can conceive of no more serious questions coming before the Court than those affecting the respective rights of the Commonwealth and a State. In other countries where there has been a surrender by States to a Federal Government, difficulties have arisen, and Ave know that a difference between a large and powerful State and the Commonwealth might become very serious. It was not enough for the Minister to say that in a very i m portant case more than three Justices would sit. To legislate on the word of Minister in charge of a Bill is always a most dangerous procedure. It is not the speech of the Minister, but the wording of the Act, that declares what is the law. In matters affecting the sovereign rights of the States, we should require a better reason than the convenience of the Justices of the High Court for an alteration of the existing law regarding the adjudication of constitutional cases; and unless a better reason is given, the Committee should hesitate about agreeing to the proposal of the Government.",46
154,Mr RYAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"West Sydney) [8.27] The remarks of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) should be replied to by the Minister (Mr . Groom). At the present time, four Justices of the High Court must concur before. a law can be declared unconstitutional, and the Minister has given no reason why this arrangement should be departed from . It may be that some representation on the subject has been made by the High Court. If so, the Committee should be favoured with it. I quoted, earlier in the day, the reasons given by the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) for requiring a majority of the whole of the Justices of the Court before a law could be declared invalid. He paidargu- The law ought to be declared unconstituthe tional only when it is.obviously so. This can be clearly indicated only when a majority of Justices of the High Court is of the opinion that it is unconstitutional. Then nothing further can be said. But the people and Parliament have a right to complain if their deliberate enactments are set on one side, although a majority of the Justices of the High Court is not of the opinion that it is unconstitutional. Those reasons hold as strongly today ns when they were uttered, unless in the practical working of the Act something has occurred which makes it inconvenient to proceed under it . Perhaps the M in ister will be good enough to explain to us what has happened to make the arguments that I have just read inapplicable.",46
155,Mr BRENNAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,I think the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) should be here to tell us the reason for this change of front on his part ,46
156,Mr RYAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,He is allowing his colthe leagues to make the retreat from the position which he took up in 1912.,46
157,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Darlin g Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [8.31] - I have already explained to the Committee the reason why it is necessary to make this amendment of the principal Act . I have pointed out that the reason why it was enacted in 1912 that no decision on questions affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth should be given by the F u l l Court unless at least four Justices were in agreement, was that the number of Justices of the High Court had been increased from five to seven, and that it appeared at the time desirable to insist upon this requirement. I have also informed the Committee that, up to that time, many decisions on constitutional questions had been given by a majority of two out of three Justices, and in other cases by a majority of three out of five.",47
158,Mr BRENNAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,Did the Opposition at that time concur in the measure requiring a majority of four out of seven?,47
159,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,Yes ; but they never attempted to make party politics out of a matter affecting the welfare of the country. This Bill originates from the difficulty which the Judiciary has in providing for a Court with the majority required.,47
160,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,That is really no argument for the proposed change.,47
161,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Quite so; I am merely explaining the origin of the Bill . that we are now proposing is that, on constitutional questions, it shall be' sufficient if at least three Justices concur in the decision. That is a safe proposition for the Committee to accept. does not follow that the F u l l Court will always be constituted of three, or even five. Justices. As many Justices as are available are always summoned. Attorney-General has no r i g h t to interfere with the administration of justice except to assist the Judiciary to carry out its duties by providing the necessary conveniences. He has no power to determine what the constitution of the Court shall be. That is a matter for the Justices themselves to decide in accordance with the regular practice of the Judiciary.",47
162,Mr RYAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,Has the Court made representations as to this matter ?,47
163,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"I have already explained that this proposal arises from difficulties in which the Court has been placed, and to which the attention of the Government has been drawn. There is great pressure of business awaiting the attention of the Court, and this measure is therefore one of urgency. The Justices of the High Court are very busy, and it is to expedite their work that this action is being taken. The Committee has simply to decide whether a decision concurred in by three Justices shall.be accepted in matters involving the interpretation of the Constitution.",47
164,Mr RYAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,There might be three on each side.,47
165,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"In that case"" the decision would rest with that section which included the Chief Justice.",47
166,Mr WEST,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,Why should not Parliament decide all constitutional questions ?,47
167,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Parliamen t is very wise, but in all humility I suggest that the Justices of the High Court are better fitted to deal with them. In many in stances, it may not be found necessary to constitute a large Court, but in' all serious cases fundamentally affecting the rights of the States or the Commonwealth the House may rest assured that the full Bench will be convened.",47
168,Mr BRENNA N,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Batman) [ 8 . 3 5 ] - I would not for the world embarrass the Minister (Mr Groom), especially when the circumstances ipso facto are somewhat inconvenient for him . When speaking to the motion for the second reading All of the Bill , in a spirit of generosity to the honourable gentleman, I ventured^ to point out that apparently the Government were now amending the constitution of the High Court-the highest tribunal It in the land, exercising immensely serious functions-merel y to fit in with the convenience of certain Justices on leave. That, I suggest, is a very light and airy The way of treating this tribunal. I have some recollection that when, in 1912, a Labour Government introduced a measure increasing the number of Justices of the High Court it did not receive very much support or assistance from the present Ministerial party who were then in Opposition. We now find the Minister for Works and Railways, who was then one of the leaders of the Opposition, - bringing in a Bill to restore the status quo, and the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), who was the controlling or dominant mind in effecting the change in 1912, is not here to say a word either in excuse or justification for the change of front. It may be that three Justices are sufficient to decide any question, but it i.s idle to spin from one point of this argument to the other just as one is found for the time being to be untenable. It is idle to tell us that this alteration is being made merely because the Bench has been reduced in numbers by the fact that certain members of it are away, and then, when it is pointed out that that is an almost flippant reason for effecting such a change, to inform us that in any case the number provided for under this clause is sufficient, although the Prime Minister himself was most emphatic in declaring that it was not. That is an inconsistency which the Government might well clear up. They might well have given the reasons from the .present Government's stand-point as distinare guished from, the stand-point of the Opposition in 1912, for this retrogressive move on their paTt.",47
169,Mr WEST,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"East 'Sydney) [8.40] My view on this question differs from that-of rsany honourable members. When Federation was brought about it was cided, with the idea of pleasing as many of the people as possible, that the tralian Constitution should largely folplaintiff low the lines of that of the United States of America. It was thought that in the way. early years of Federation many disputes would be likely to arise between the monwealth and the States, but the object - and aims of the Commonwealth are now so well understood that the determination of constitutional questions might very well be referred to a tribunal higher than Court. the High Court-and that is the Parliament itself. This Parliament should be able to settle all such questions. High Court Justices, after all, in intermittee preting our laws, always endeavour to movefind out what was the intention of the Parliament, or else they look up ancient with musty volumes recording decisions given before many of us were born. The conditions obtaining when those decisions were given were vastly different from those which now prevail. Some of these decisions were given when the great terests masses of the people - were uneducated. To-day, in most parts of the world, we say have an educated Democracy, and they do not wish to be governed by decisions of the musty past. They look upon Parliament as being likely to best understand their wants. If the Parliament does not know what the people want I am sure the High Court does not. A Judge is often governed in his decisions by his environment. As a rule, a Judge does not keep pace with the times. I agree with all that has been said by the Minister (Mr Groom) in regard to the first three occupants of the High Court Bench. I had the pleasure of their personal acquaintance, and thus.had an opportunity of learning of their ideals. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan)-the east and the west are united in this matter-ha s pointed out that quite recently the High Court has reversed a long-standing decision on a very important constitutional question. I believe that the Judges of the future not likely always to agree with decisions given by Judges of today. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) is not here to explain this departure from the attitude taken up by him in 1912. After all, what is a legal opinion? If you go into a Court you will find that dethe gentleman employed on behalf of the defendant is merely engaged in telling the Ausgentleman employed on behalf of the that he is not stating the truth, and his legal opponent replies in the same That is the essence of the legal trade, for it is only a trade, as I am"" sure Comthe honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) will agree.

When a law which has been passed by this Parliaiment is tested in the High Court its validity is decided by men who have not been elected by the people, but have been appointed by a Minister because they happen to be friends of the Government, or may stand at the head of the Bar. Political parties may have appealed to the country in connection with the passing of a certain law. Its enactment may have received the endorsement of the people, and yet its validity is, under this Bill , to be lef t to the decision of three Justices of the H i gh Court. We should be more jealous of our rights in this Parliament. I believe that there is safety in numbers, and I , therefore, support 'the amendment in preference to the clause as it stands. The '.Government might just as well propose that these matters should be decided by one Judge of the High Court. The principle of the iteasure is wrong, and as I believe that at least a unanimous decision of the High Court should be required to decide the in validity of any Act passed by this Parliament, I shall vote for the amendment.",49
176,Sir ROBERT BEST,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Kooyong) [8.50] - B y submitting this amendment, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr. MCWilliaims) practically asks the Committee to negative the clause, because if we adopt the amendment the law will remain as it stands.",49
177,Mr RYAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,Not necessarily.,49
178,Sir ROBERT BEST,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"That will be the practical effect of carrying the amendment. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Grcom) has already explained that the Bill is intended to deal with a real and practical difficulty. Honourable members are aware of the multifarious duties at present assigned to the Justices of the High Court. W it h the arbitral and other work assigned to them, there is frequently a serious congestion of business in the High Court, and the Bill proposes a means to overcome some of the difficulty. In view of the high legal standing of the members of the High Oourt Bench, if three of the Justices out of six-becaus e there are at present only six in the Commonwealth-ar e agreed, we can rest assured that we shall have the best interpretation of the law, particularly when it is remembered that in the most complicated questions which had to be dealt with in connection with the early years of Federation, a decision by two Justices was held to be sufficient and inspired much confidence and satisfaction.",49
179,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,They were men of very high standard.,49
180,Sir ROBERTBEST,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"I admit that, and I am proud to say that we still have men of very high standing on the High Court Bench. Some honourable members are very much concerned about the. decision of constitutional questions involving rights between the Commonwealth and the States; and I point out, for their consolation, that Part XII . of the Judiciary Act of 1910 is not affected by this Bill . That particular part of the Act was enacted for the specific purpose of dealing with constitutional questions. It is permissible under it to make a reference to the High Court, and for the Court then to decide whether an Act of this Parliament, or a section of it , is valid or not.",49
181,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,That is permissive; not compulsory.,49
182,Sir ROBERT BEST,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"When the Court has constitutionalquestions referred to it , it has the power to deal with such questions, but for that purpose it is necessary that there shall be a full Bench. In case the whole seven Judges happen to be in Australia at the time, each of them must attend. If one happens to be absent, then the other six must attend, and a majority of the Bench, in. every probability, would decide the question referred to the Court. In a case of the kind, it is incumbent upon the Court to notify the Attorneys-General of all the States. Each has then the right to be heard in connection with the constitutional question involved. I ask lionorable members to especially bear that in mind. ber Further, if there be any association or in stitution whose interests are involved, iind the Court comes to the conclusion that it should be heard, it has the right to notif y that institution or association. of any law? . Tliere was a degree of uncertainty by reason of the conflict of jurisdiction of the Commonwealth and the States, and referred considerable expense was incurred by private litigants in going to the High Court to decide these important quesare tions. The idea of Parliament in maktion ing this provision was that these questions should be decided at the expense of the Commonwealth itself, and then, when a determination was givenupon any member get that? question, private litigants could proceed in the High Court on the basis of such determination. The idea of liament was that important constitutional, questions of the character to which. I have referred might be inexAct pensivelydetermined, and there might be thatsome certainty as to the true interpretation of Acts of this Parliament, having regard to the extraordinary complications involved by reason of the conflicting or jurisdiction of the Commonwealth sovereign States. I point out that under Part XII . , to Which I have referred, by there would be a F u l l Bench, and a desent cision upon such questions would not be by a decision of three only of the Justices of the High Court, but of a m a j o r i the F u l l Bench, so that if all seven were in Australia, four would have to be agreed as to the determination of the Court; and if one were absent, the cision of four would still be probable; but if the .Bench were equally divided, 'notified if the Court thinks the Chief Justice would be the deciding to do so. factor.",49

194,Sir ROBERT BEST,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"I do not recall whether there has been or not, but I am pointing out what Parliament provided. to I was a member of this Parliament at the time the Judiciary Bill of 1910 was passed, and I know what we had in view. Litigants might be put to vast expense and ultimately discover that some Act, or part of an Act, was ultra vires. Parliament therefore decided to adopt an inexpensive process, at the cost of the Commonwealth itself, of ascertaining the true interpretation of the law, where it was contemplated that the interests of the States might be involved. It is compulsory that the States shall be notified, that the Attorneys-General of the several States shall have the right to appear, and that a majority of the Full Bench, if present in Australia, shall determine the true interpretation.

In the vast majority of matters which come before the High Court, the practical difficulties which have been experienced under the present law, and which have involved serious congestion and delay, will be overcome by the Bill, which I commend to the Committee.",51
197,Mr BLUNDELL,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Adelaide), [9.2] The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) has put before the Committee a provision of the Judiciary Act that has never yet been put into operation. The point he has brought forward in no way touches cases affecting the rights of this Parliament on the one hand aud of the States on the other. An important decision has recently been given by the High Court, that State instrumentalities come under the operation of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. That is a case which materially affects the legislation of this Parliament and the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States. Any similar case materially affecting the powers of the Commonwealth or of the States, and the interpretations of the Constitution, ought to be decided by all the Judges available. I quite agree that in ordinary cases coming before the High Court the Bill meets the situation, but where a case affects the right of this Parliament or of the State Parliaments to enact legislation, we are in duty bound by the compact entered into when the Constitution was framed and accepted by the people, to see that no decision is given except by the majority of the Judges who are available.",51

199,Mr BLUNDELL,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"I quite realise that fact, and in such an event the opinion of the side on which the Chief Justice gave his opinion would prevail; but still we should have six men deciding a big constitutional question affecting every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth. It is not an ordinary case between litigants, but a matter affecting the ambit of our Constitution. If the Minister (Mr Groom) can satisfy me that the Bill will affect only. ordinary cases, leaving the position so far as concerns constitutional matters between the States and the Commonwealth as it now is, I shall vote for it. I am not prepared to vote for a Bill that will put into the hands of three men the power to decide in favour either of the Commonwealth, or the States on matters affecting the vital relationship of the Commonwealth and the States under the Constitution.",51
200,Mr GREGORY,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Dampier) [9.5] - I do not wish to urge any increase in the number of Justices, because we know the necessity for economy all round. I can see no necessity for increasing their numbers, but the question of the constitutional rights either of the Commonwealth Parliament or of the State Parliaments is of vast importance, and cannot be dealt with lightly. I should be quite prepared to accept the amendment of the Act as advocated by the Minister (Mr. Groom) if we could add words to provide that, where a majority did not agree, an appeal either by the Commonwealth or the States should lie to the Privy Council. I understand that the Full Court can now allow an appeal to the Privy Council on constitutional matters.",51

Some honb u t orable members seem to think that would be a serious danger to the States, but if is a danger to the States it is equally a big danger to the Commonwealth. It has been argued that it is a question of one Ultimately, of course, that is the case. The feel Judges have to construe a document. They apply certain rules of interpretation to ascertain what the Constitution It is left to their trained judicial minds to decide. If a Judge is away, a and there are three Judges on one the side and three on the other, then under l , rethis clause the judgment that will prevail will be that of the side on which the reChief Justice is. For many years there in were only three Judges interpreting the Constitution, but there was uo anxiety on the part of the States, and no danger to the their rights. In fact, there was no trouble of any .kind. Later, there were five the Judges, when the decision might be given reby three Judges as against two, but nobody raised the question of the danger of three Judges interpreting the Constitusafetion. Then two more Judges were added to the High Court. On one occasion - the Judges were equally divided.

I am opposedto extending some of the powers given to the Government in the Judiciary Act of 1915. When that Act passed, Parliament thought it sufficient that the power should exist during the war, and for six months afterwards. Now, what are those powers? Among them is power given to the Attorney General of the Commonwealth in the ..18 following terms:4 (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this part, or any provision of any State law, ATES. the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth may file an indictment for any indictable offence against the laws of the Commonwealth in the High Oourt, or the Supreme Court of a State, without examination or commitment for t r i a l .

I object to the Attorney-General being given the drastic .power of presenting an indictment against any citizen in the High Court of Australia without going through the formality of having witmesses examined in the ordinary way.",53
212,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"It is time that was stopped. PAIRSMr RYAN - It is. But now we are asked to extend that power for all time, although when Parliament passed the Act in 1915 it indicated that the power should rest in the hands of the Attorney-General only during the war and for six months afterwards. The Government now say that this limitation should be withdrawn, and, consequently, that power continue to rest in the Attorney-General. I am in favour of ending that at once. If there is to be any trial for an indictable t i v e . offence in the High Court of Australia, . it should take place after an examination of witnesses and committal for trial in the ordinary way. . Mr QtfOOM (Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [9.27] - I The object of the clause is to continue the provision made in the Judiciary Act of 1915 in relation to the original jurisdiction of the High Oourt. Act was originally introduced it had no limitation of time whatsoever. limitation was put in at the suggestion of the Opposition of the day. The power which it is sought to continue is contained in sectious 2 and 3 of the Judiciary Act 1915. The Constitution vests in the High Court original jurisdiction in regard to matters(i) Arising under any Treaty; (-ii) Affecting Consuls or other representatives of otlier countries; (iii) In which the Commonwealth or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth is a party; (iv) Between States or between residents of different States, or between a State and a resident of another State; (v) In which a writ of mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth. In addition to those powers so conferred upon the High Court, section 76 of the Constitution provides that the Parliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction on a High Court in any matter(i) Arising under this Constitution or involving its interpretation; (ii) Arising under any laws made by the Parliament; (iii) Of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ; (iv) Relating to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of different States. In 1914 the law was altered to give the Court jurisdiction-in addition to matters arising out of' the Constitution, or involving its interpretation-in ques-, tions relating to Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction. Another additional power was given in the Act of 1915, in relation to trials for indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. It was felt that the High Court, which is a specially constituted body for exercising judicial powers of the Commonwealth, should have jurisdiction in trials of indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Ryan) objects to the High Court having the power in relation to indictable ' offences against the laws of the Commonwealth.",53
213,Mr RYAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,I do not object to that.,54
214,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"It has been sparingly When that used for the reason that the exercise of criminal jurisdiction is a matter for the This State Courts. Such Courts sit in many parts of the Commonwealth, and cases ought, as a rule, to.be tried where-the offences are committed. For that reason jurisdiction is given to the State ' Criminal Courts all over Australia. That is the usual practice, but at the same time, in two or three important instances, it was considered advisable to invoke the aid of the High Court. There was a case in Sydney in connection, I believe, with contracts for supplies to the Defence Department. There was also another important case in connection with trading with the enemy.",54

Cases may have arisen where there has been a preliminary inquiry, and where the magistrate, through a lack of appreciation of the position, may have refused to commit, for trial.

The earlier our war measures are repealed, the better it will be for all concerned. of it",57
272,Mr BRENNAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Batman) [9.55] - It is very clear that in the hands of any At torney-General, and notably in those of the present Attorney-General, this proposed amendment may well become a very dangerous instrument of injustice. It is quite true that there has always resided in the Attorneys-General of the various States, and especially in the Attorney General of Victoria, the power to file a presentment against a person who has been discharged upon a preliminary in quiry, either before magistrates or justices, or a Court of Petty Sessions. The reason is a very obvious and a very proper one. It may well be that an inferior Court may, for one of a host of reasons, have failed in its duty in regard to the committal of an accused person upon, perhaps, a very grave charge. In such circumstances, it is a useful safeguard that the Government should be able to act through its Attorney-General, and to place such a person upon his trial. But such a person has already conic before some tribunal, and at least a prima facie case has been disclosed against him, and witnesses have been subjected to cross-examination. In the amendment which is now before us, it is honourable proposed that the Commonwealth Attorney-General may immediately, and without notice, file a presentment and bring a defendant for t r i a l before the High Court for any offence which is covered by the Statute. What does that mean? It bemeans that all the elaborate machinery of the High Court may be put into operation in respect of a charge which never should have been laid at all, and which, upon a preliminary investigation, might have fizzled out altogether. No injustice - can. be done - by withholding this arbitrary power from the Attorney-General. There are ample means by which the Government, either by warrant or summons-on e of the methods so frequently used by ""the Attorney-General .and his officers during the tragic war period-ma y bring any The accused person before an inferior tribunal for examination. In the absence of ' the power which it is proposed to confer, there is no danger of anv such person escaping the consequences of his actions. The law may still be set in motion, an inferior tribunal fails to commit him for trial, there will still be power to file tinue to be. a presentment, notwithstanding that the. charge against him may have been disoperate missed in the first instance. What more is demanded except it be a special power - on the part of the Attorney-General .strike his blow suddenly and quickly, to get the accused person convicted before he realizes the nature of the is oreferred against him ? I do not know why the honourable member for Wakefield tention. (Mr Richard Foster) feels so strongly upon this matter.",57
273,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,I do.,58
274,Mr BRENNAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"I did not that his experience of litigation ripe that he had any particular case his mind. If he has, I invite him to it. mention it, and to show how anything less than full justice can be done in the - absence of this amendment. whole history of responsible in the various States, there has not been a single instance in which the latent power to file a presentment, which is sumed to exist in the Attorney-General, has. when the occasion demanded been exercised without some kind of pretrary liminary examination. . Seeing power was one which was, with apologies, taken in time of war for war purposes, subject to review at the end of the war, I venture to ask what is now the object in not reviewing so ing this special war-time power? any need for it arisen ? Can the Minister (Mr Groom), or any of his colleagues or supporters, suggest a case which might arise in regard to justice might not be given under the law as it now stands? ,",58
275,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,Are we taking powers which any of the States now sess ? ,58
276,Mr BRENNAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,The propose to take a power which is really additional to the powers already posin sessed by the States-obviqusl y for use *i way foreign to State practice.,58
277,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Are we taking any shall, without further inquiry greater powers than the States have now",58
278,Mr BRENNAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"Yes ; because the difference between the Commonwealth Government and the States is that the States have their machinery already, and their regular course of procedure is and if through their inferior tribunals",58

281,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,That is not the in ,58
282,Mr BRENNAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"The question of in tention does not enter except in so far as we are entitled to ask what is to be gained by this proposed amendment that know cannot be gained under the law as it was so stands. On the other hand, I have in shown that injustice may be done under I invite the Minister to show in what way injustice may be done by the law being left as it is - If he can During the show me any injustice which is being government done to the public, or to any person in particular, I , shall be satisfied to accept the amendment.

292,Mr GROOM,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,O r to retrogress? that is the honourable member's idea.,59
293,Mr RYAN,SALE OF WHEATTOEGYPTIAN,"The Minister - isretrogressing, judging by theclauses to which hedesires us to. agree. He has mentioned several early Acts, among them those of Tasmania and' South Australia, which, set fort h acommon law-, power such as the Attorney-General, possesses by virtue of his office-.. But I do not think that in these days the public will stand for .placing it within the power of any individual, whether he be the At to r ney-General or not, to put a man upon his t r i a l without giving him some opportunity for preparing his defence. If this power is granted, persons can be deprived of the right to be in a position to properly prepare a defence. I am not willing that that right shall be taken away. This is the National Parllament. We should lead the way rather than he referred to enactments such as that passed in Tasmania, f b r example, in 1S55. I wonder what sort of a Parliament existed in those days. It was certainly not a very progressive body. Numbers of the sections which' the Minister has quoted were passed with the concurrence of Legislative Councils, which are quite out of date, and not in accord with the political views held today. I think the existing law with regard to trials might be amended. There should be a sweaping amendment, effected by this I move- Parliament - to provide that cases of defamation should be heard before common juries, and not before special panels selected by the friends of honourable .members opposite.

There should be a uniform method for the selection of juries for the trial of cases in the High Court. At the present time, when a trial occurs in Melbourne, the jury is selected from a special jury, with a property qualification of a very high value; but in Sydney the procedure is different, and in Brisbane it is different, again. There should be uniformity, and the choice of jurors should be widened as much as possible and democratized. It is from the electoral rolls that we should choose our juries, and not in accordance with the old Tory Acts of the States. I shall move in that direction in Committee.
