Courtenay Smith-, president, and others, on behalf of the Annual Convention of the Women's Christian Temperance Union of New South Wales, held in Sydney during the months of September and October, praying that the clauses in the Defence Bil l providing for the compulsory military training of the boys .and young men of the Commonwealth should be made optional. Mr ARCHER presented a petition from certain sugar-cane growers of Australia, praying that an inquiry be made by a Royal Commission or by such other means as the House may deem expedient, to ascertain the facts as to the position of the canegrowers, and to grant them relief from their present disabilities. Petitions received and read. NA DESTROYERS.",14
1,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I desire to ask the Mininstead ister of Defence a question based on one that I put to him yesterday in regard to the current rumour, that the iron workers who proceeded to the Old Country some time ago to obtain specific training in the construction of torpedo destroyers are, because of certain prohibitions, not receiving that training. Has the honourable gentleman any further information on the subject to put before the House?",14
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I have no offi-. rial information, but have had from those interested private advices that the men sent Home are under the disabilities already alleged. We are cabling to ascertain the facts.",14
3,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Will the Minister of Defence see that those disabilities are, if possible, removed?",14
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Certainly . We could have no other object in cabling to the Old Country. I shall do all in my power to see that the conditions are observed. DREADNOUGHTFUND , NEW SOUTH WALES.",14
5,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I desire to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to what purports to be a copy of a letter forwarded to him by the Lord Mayor of Sydney, which is published in the daily press, and from which the following is a quotation :Referring to the interview I had in Melbourne with yourself and your colleague, the Hon. the Minister for Defence, on the and September, at which we discussed the question of (he Dreadnought Fund raised in this State ior the purpose of assisting to procure a battleship 'for presentation to the Homeland, but which by reason of resolution's arrived at by the Imperial Defence Conference recently held in London was no longer required for that purpose. . . . Will the Prime Minister state what are the resolutions to which reference is made, and whether any have been submitted to - the Lord Mayor of Sydney and the Committee managing the Dreadnought Fund of New South Wales - before being placed before this House?",14
6,Mr DEAKIN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The latter part of the honourable member's inquiry is so far without warrant that I do not even know, except from press reports of the proceedings, what the resolutions are. I assume that the reference is to the proposal to. establish an Australian unit for service in the Pacific of offering to the British Government ' a Dreadnought, which would. be stationed elsewhere. That, I think, is the only inference.",14
7,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member has not laid before the Lord Mayor of Sydney any resolutions carried at the Imperial Defence Conference?,14
8,Mr DEAKIN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I had none to lay before him.,14
9,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Did not the Prime Minister mention to the House some time ago that the Conference held in London was consultative, and that any resolutions arrived at by it would not be binding upon the Government, or upon this Parliament? Would he regard the resolutions, if such have been passed, as so far binding upon his Government as to allow them to accept from the Committee of the Dreadnought Fund money that was subscribed for the purpose of making the gift of a Dreadnought to the British Government?",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The Conference was consultative. If the honourable member asks whether there is any condition in the resolutions to prevent us from accepting a gift of money for naval purposes, I know of none, and, if there were any, do not know that it would bind us. PUBLIC SERVICE. VACANCIES IN CLERICAL DIVISION.",15
11,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I wish to call the attention of the Prime Minister to a notice that recently appeared in the Gazette, to the effect that an examination for entry into the Clerical Division of the Public Service will take place in January next, of persons between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two. This will debar a large number already in the service, the age of twenty-two, from competing, although, acting practically under instrucDirector-General tions from the various Deputy Commis1909. sioners, they have been educating - themselves with a view to passing the examination. Would it be possible to alter the Gazette notice so that persons in the service, who are over the age of twenty-two, may be allowed to compete, and, i ' cessful, obtain employment in the Clerical Division ?",15
12,Mr DEAKIN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The condition of affairs alluded to by the honourable member is unknown to me. It will be inquired into at once. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE: SUPERNUMERARIES.,15
13,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Has the Treasurer taken steps in regard to the supernumerary employees in the Government Printing Office engaged in stamp printing ? Some of them have been employed by the Victorian Department for twenty years, and are still supernumeraries. If the right honourable gentleman has not taken action, will he look into the matter, with a view to having them placed on the permanent staff?",15
14,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I do not think the matter has been brought under my notice for a long time-at any rate, not since I have been in office on this occasion. I shall be glad to make inquiries; but the Public Service is controlled under the Public Service Act, and, therefore, the powers of the Government are subject to the provisions of the law.",15

Paragraph c provides that the prescribed training shall be, for the Citizen Forces, sixteen whole-day drills or their equivalent. I consider that that is insufficient. I therefore move That the words "" whole-day drills or their equivalent,"" lines 9 and 10, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" days by one in camps of continuous training."" Amendment negatived.",17

Vic- - The proposed new section also provides be that the period of training for the Artillery and Engineers' shall be twenty-five wholeday drills or their equivalent. The Minister has recognised that it is necessary that these arms of the forces should have of a more extensive training.,17
36,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Does not the honourable member know that some authorities hold that infantry require more training than,17
37,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"But we have decided that infantry shall not have so long a period of training. Any one who knows anything about the training of the Military is aware that spasmodic training for artillery and engineers is of practically no value, especially in the case of the horse artillery. I therefore move That the words "" o r their equivalent,"" lines 14 and 15, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" of which at least sixteen days shall be continuous.'""",17

Defence is required primarily for the protection of property.",17
39,Mr MAUGER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,And for the protection of our homes and privileges.,18
40,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"That is so to a certain extent, but many men who will have to be trained have no homes to defend, and some of them can ill afford the time which they will have to devote to this purpose. The matter is of very great importance to a very large number of men who will be compelled to give up their working time to prepare themselves to defend, amongst other things, the property of the landlords of Australia. We quite understand that there is no other way of having a defence force in this country except by training our manhood. But men should not be asked to leave their wives and children, or their widowed mothers, and others who may be dependent upon them for the necessaries of life, without recompense while they are taken into camps. There may be some who can well afford to give up the necessary time, and may be willing to do it. But many others may not be so well able to afford the sacrifice. In connection with defence there should have been a twin proposal providing for the raising, by means of direct taxation, of the money necessary to pay for this scheme.",18
41,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,There is no proposal for getting money in any wav.,18
42,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That is so.,18
43,The CHAIRMAN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I ask the honourable member not to discuss that matter.,18
44,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"For an adult, 83. a day is little enough. I desire to make that sure.",18
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,What does the honourable member mean by an adult?,18
46,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"A person of twenty-one years or more of age. Of course, many who are under twenty-one will be as efficient as those who are over that age, but we must draw a distinction between youths and adults, and the age of twenty-one years is a convenient line of demarcation. Those whose interests I have particularly in view are the unskilled workers, whose wages are so small that they cannot afford to take holidays or lose time from work. If the country comduction in wages? pels them to submit to training, it should he compensate them at a rate which will provide for their necessities.",18
47,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Is not 8s. a day the rate now paid to the Militia?,18
48,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Yes , and it is proposed to continue the militia system. This makes it the more necessary that our adult soldiers shall be all on the same footing. I desire to confirm the present rates for the Militia, and extend such rates universally. The proposal with regard to those under the age of twenty-one is that they shall be paid amounts equivalent to the average of the sums which they have been receiving during the four weeks previous to their period of training. It might be possible to provide for the payment of a fixed sum, such as 4s. or 5s. a day, but against that proposal it could be urged that younger lads would probably be earning much less. If a simpler arrangement than mine can be proposed, I shallbe happy to accept it. I am not prepared to support compulsory training, if the working-men are to be compelled to bear the whole burden of it. There are those who desire to train the working man for the defence of the property of the well-to-do, who shirk their responsibility and escape their fair burden of taxation. Similarly, when Protection was proposed, it was associated with new Protection, but when a heavy burden of taxation had been imposed on the working classes, the Prime Minister broke his word to honourable members, and refused to carry out that part of the bargain relating to the new Protection. I do not like that kind of business, and shall not support compulsory training unless democratic provisions such as I am now proposing are associated with it. Some honourable members think that public opinion on the subject of compulsory training is changing, and are extremely anxious to appear in favour of it. But, in my opinion, the compulsory principle will not be very popular when it comes to be applied, and will cause reaction. In any case, it' should not be applied except under conditions which are fair to all. Men who are taken from their employment should be reasonably compensated. No doubt the Government will use the old argument in opposing my amendment-that they have no money.",18
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Is the honourable to member aware that he is proposing a reMr J.' H . CATTS - I am not doing so. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Every from the Opposition in connection with payments to the military has been in the direction of reducing wages.,18
50,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That is distinctly inaccurate.,19
51,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The Bill makes no provision for paying 8s. a day to adults.,19
52,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,It would be better define an adult as a person over twentyyears of age. It is at the age of twenty that the Cadets will finish their training.,19
53,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That is a very good suggestion. I would rather increase than decrease rates of pay.,19
54,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Mak e the rate ios. a day. . Mr JH CATTS - I should do so if it"" were likely that the proposal would be carried.",19
55,Mr MAUGER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Why not make it £ 1 day?,19
56,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member, notwithstanding that he represents a working-man's constituency, ridicules the idea of paying the workers for the time they lose. He will have a different yarn to tell when he is appealing to the electors for their votes. I shall think over the suggestion of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, and consider the payment of 8s. a day to every person over twenty years of age. - Mr AGAR WYNNE - W it h regard to the other part of the honourable member's proposal,. I would point out that he takes no account of those who for the four weeks prior to the period of training may have been earning nothing.",19

66,Mr HEDGES,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,^The honourable member's party proposed to pay them is. 3d. a day.,19
67,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I repudiate the statement. The honourable member makes some reference to a payment of is. 3d. per day. I do not know whether he is referring to the pay of men on some of the railways which he built in Western Australia. Perhaps that is what he paid the Italians whom he employed.,19
68,Mr HEDGES,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I am building no railways in Western Australia - How can I be employing Italians to do what I am not doing? I take exception to the honourable member's statement.,19
69,The CHAIRMAN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I would remind the honourable member that if he persists in interjecting it is not possible for me to control the honourable member who is addressing the Chair, or any one else. I honourable ask honourable members to assist me by refraining from interjecting.",19
70,Mr HEDGES,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"But have I no redress, Mr Chairman? I.object to the statement of the honourable member that I am employing Italians.",19
71,The CHAIRMAN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"If the honourable member takes exception to the remark, I am sure that the honourable member for Cook will withdraw it .",19
72,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I did not sav that the honourable member is at present building a railway. I used the past tense, and the honourable member, in his denial, made no reference to what he had done in the past. I should be glad to be allowed to proceed without irrelevant interruptions. The issue is a simple one, and I hope that a vote will be taken upon it without feeling. The simple proposition is that working men who are compelled' to train to fit themselves to defend the be reimbursed for the time they lose. If the Government propose to pay any section of the forces, more than would be payable under my amendment, I shall be glad to and accept the higher rate. I have been unable withChair. to find in the Bill, however,' any scheme for reimbursing by any fixed amount those who lose time in compulsory training. The education system of the States is pulsory and free. Parents are compelled to send their children to school, but they have not to pay for their instruction. In it. the same way, if we compel a man to lose time in training to fit himself to defend Australia, we ought not to require him forego any portion of his wages by reason from doing so. of that loss of time.' In many cases, considerable hardship will be suffered if such provision as this is not inserted in Bill. It is often said that we ought encourage our young people to marry, but if such young men know that they will called upon to lose time in undergoing military training, and will suffer thereby a monetary loss, they will not be disposed to take upon themselves the responsibilities of family life. That is another reason why these men should be paid.",19

96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"That is so, and he will be putting in his training prior to joining the Militia a little later on. The honourable member's proposal would also have the effect of cutting dowm the pay of every non-commissioned officer in the Militia to 8s. a day, because they are persons coming under the category which he has suggested. It would also mean that all the Senior Cadets would have to be paid the moment they began to train at fourteen.",21
97,Mr HALL,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member specifies only ""every adult person.""",21
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Yes , but later on he says '' every other person undergoing training,'' so distinguishing them from adults.",21
99,Mr HALL,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,They will get only what they are losing. He does not say 8s. a day for them.,21
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"No , but he says they shall be paid. We are not proposing to pay the Senior Cadets at all.",21
101,Mr HALL,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Are they to be trained on working davs?,21
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Not on whole days, except four days in their holidays. The honourable member's proposal will reduce the pay-of the militiamen as at present and until the compulsory scheme comes into operation two years hence, and it will result in reducing the pay of the non-commissioned officers. I am sure the honourable member has not stopped to think of the effect of his amendment. If he had, he would not have moved it. I must give him credit for trying to do what he believes to be best for these men, but in reality his proposal would not benefit them. I suggest that he should leave the question of pay as at present, leaving it for the Minister of the day to pay such allowances as may from time to time be voted by Parliament. It is a matter that Parliament will always be able to control by the medium of the Estimates. That is so in every army. I believe that would be a more satisfactory way of dealing with the matter-adjustin g the pay from time to time as it is found necessary-tha n the insertion in the Bill of a provision of this sort.",21
103,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Adelaide) [3.28] The Minister is deserving of thanks for pointing out that the honourable member for Cook did not intend to reduce the pay either of the Militia or of the compulsory trainees. However the amendment may be drafted, Ave must give the honourable member credit for a desire to do the reverse of reducing wages. I frankly admit that the amendment is not very clearly drafted, but I understand the honourable member's desire to be that no person shall lose by reason of the time that he spends at his compulsory training. The Minister proposes that youths between the ages of eighteen and nineteen while undergoing compulsory training shall be paid at the rate of 3s. per day while in camp, and from the ages of nineteen to twenty 4s. per day while in camp. I interpret that to mean that those youths will not be paid for the half-day trainings or night drills. It is quite possible that some youths between eighteen and twenty mav be earning more than 3s. or 4s. per day outside.",21
104,Mr MAUGER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I think very few.,21
105,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I was earning more at that age, and I am sure, that a large number of our youths will be in a similar position. The object of the honourable member for Cook was to insure that they should not suffer financial loss during the period that they were forced to train for defence purposes. In spite of the interjections and gibes of one or two honourable members, who, to put the matter in the most kindly way, have not given too much attention to this Bill, the object of the honourable member for Cook is worthy of our serious consideration, and if we can meet it, we ought to do so this afternoon. We should not necessarily be bound to the 3s. and 4s. per day suggested by the Minister, because the pay may not be as much when it comes to a matter of prescribing. Those amounts are merely an intimation of the Minister's present idea. He may prescribe whatever rates he pleases. M i . JOSEPH COOK - He can prescribe them only after Parliament has voted the money.",21
106,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I know that Parliaister ment has a certain amount of the Estimates each year, but while the Minister may today suggest 3s. and 4s., the Government maV, when the Estimates are being considered, announce that finanfor cial exigencies necessitate the payment of work. lower amounts.",22

109,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The right honourable gentleman misrepresents himself often enough without my adding to his difficulremuneration ties. We ought not to be strictly bound down to the rate suggested by the Minister if we can do something that will make our young men view the Defence Forces with more favour than might otherwise be the case. The honourable member for Cook deserves our thanks for drawing our attenas tion to the possibility of many young men passed. suffering loss, and having their enthusiasm dampened rather than kindled. If honourable member can re-draft his amendon building fighting machines. ment to make his intention clear, I shall only too pleased to give him my assistance, and I thoroughly believe that other honorof able members, irrespective of party, will do the same, in order that we may refrain as far as possible from subjecting young men undergoing training to loss.",22

I understand, for instance, that the honourable member for not object to the desire of the honourable Adelaide occupied a highly responsible position before he reached twenty, and it possible that a young man may be drawing £ 1 a day from his employer at that age. The Department must have a uniform system for paying these young men if they are to be paid. Unless they are paid purely on the basis of the services which they render to the Department, we shall have different men receiving different pay, with the rich man serving alongside the poor man and drawing more. The Minwould be very ill-advised to accept control over any such suggestion. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [3-37]-- I wish to help the honourable mem, ber for Cook, because it is a serious matter young men to be called away from their There is no question that many of them will lose their positions. When volunteered for' service in South Africa they were promised reinstatement in their when they returned, but very few If the property-holders of Australia desire to have their property defended they ought to pay for that defence. It is a small matter to them, but adit is a big matter to the young man.who is called away from his employment, with a of losing it , and compelled to put in fifteen or sixteen days' training without pay, or, perhaps, without being recouped even his ordinary expenses. If the honourable member for Cook can secure adequate for the young men who are compelled to leave their work and go into camps to be drilled by gentlemen on horseback, wearing spurs and feathers, I shalt be glad to help him. Of course, I am opposed to all this military business, but, at the same time, I want to make the scheme effective as possible, if it is to be It would 'be far better to use, for the purpose of settling people on the the land, the money that we are going to waste The exbetension of our grain fields and sugar-cane fields will constitute a far stronger defence the country than war-ships, guns, or forts.

Others will not. What we require to do is tofixan absolute minimum rate of pay. I shall vote for the}",22
111,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Dalley) [3.40] - We can1 member for Cook that a fair payment shall is be made to workmen who undergo militarytraining. But I cannot agree with the argument which he has used in favour of his amendment. He has alleged that the or* ject of the Defence Bill is to protect the property of the wealthy. If I thought that, I would not vote for the Bill at all. Such an argument is almost an insult to the men who take part in the defence of this country. The idea is not to make them mercenaries. I refuse to believe that the working classes of Australia take so low a view of the duties of citizenship. Personally, I have very little property to defend ; and what I have does not require much looking after. Probably, I am not so well off in that respect as are the honourable member for Cook and other members of his party. That may be my bad luck or their good luck. But when I hear such an argument advanced, I , as one who has been associated with the working classes all my life, feel compelled to reply that I do not regard the amount paid to the Militia as payment for services rendered. If the honourable member for Cook seriously thinks that the whole object of this Bill is to provide for the defence of the pro-' pertied interests, I sincerely trust that he will oppose the measure at every stage.",22
112,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I did not say was the only object; but that it was the main object.,23
113,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I take quite a different view of the situation. The British people, and especially the Australian section of them, are actuated by quite other motives when they take part in the defence of their country. ' I am quite with the honourable member when he contends that the cost of military service should not be an extra tax upon the masses. That is to say, we should not pay for our defence by means of higher Customs and Excise duties. When we approach the nnancial aspect of the question, I shall be ready to assist the honourable member and others 'in seeing that the wealthy pay their proper proportion of the cost of defence. As to the rates of pay proposed, I think it likelv that young men between eighteen and twenty years of age will neither lose nor gain much if they receive 6s. per day while in camp. It is quite true that there' are men amongst the working classes who cannot afford to be three or four days out of employment. Many labourers do not earn more than 36s. a .week. Many of them have families to keep. Some are the mainstay of their old parents. The loss of a day or two's pay is a serious consideration to such people. A man with a small wage has no margin to provide for living [174} out in the clover paddocks to learn to drill. 1 appreciate the motive of the honourable member for Cook in that respect. But his argument that the rate of pay should bear some proportion to the earnings of members of the Militia Forces would, if adopted, be likely to land us in difficulties. A sum of 4s. per day might be adequate for some young men nineteen years of age. But there are others who earn' far more. An engrosser in a lawyer's office, who may be a very fine penman, may be earning a guinea a day. He is iust as much a worker as is a moulder or a carpenter's apprentice. The working classes do not thank their representative men for singling out sections of them for special treatment, especially in a matter like defence. If we were to lay down the principle that we should make up the shortage of wages lost through young men undergoing military training, we should get ourselves into a most awkward position. Furthermore, under this Bill , about 65,000 men will go into camp. It is a serious matter to think of paying them more than the Government propose. The honourable that it member for Cook, under cover of his amendment, has asked where the money for the payment of the men is to come from. That is an independent question. No one will assist honourable members opposite more earnestly than I shall to see that the wealthy classes do not escape their proper contribution. But, at the same time, I am voting for this Bill because the masses ought not to escape the performance of the duties of citizenship. I am not so idealistic as to think that the world today is governed on the principle that "" right is might."" I am rather inclined to think that the principle that ""migh t is r i g h t "" holds sway. It is necessary that the citizens of the country should bear their share in its defence, and I am satisfied that my constituents do not wish to escape their duty. All that they ask is that they shall not carry the whole of the burden on their backs; that is to say, that they shall not pay for the military service as well as performing the duty. But, between recognising that principle and treating our troops as mercenaries, there is a very wide difference. It has been said that we might leave the matter in the hands of the Minister, if we knew that he would handle it sympathetically. But no Minister in Australia can afford to be unsympathetic in such a matter as this. For the sake of his own political welfare, he will take care to administer the measure sympathetically I do not think that the honourable member for Cook intended to be insulting, but I say again that, in my view, it is an insult to suggest that men will only join in the Citizen Forces for the sake of the pay which they will get. A fair thing should be done by them, and they require no more. I may here point out that the proposition of the Government treats the men in a fairer manner than would have done the suggestion of that hard-shelled, democratic member of the Labour party, the honourable member for West Sydney, who, when he was a supporter of the .Deakin Administration, contended that the rates of pay should be ios. and 12s. 6d. per week.",23
114,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That was a mere expresclare sion of opinion from an individual.,24
115,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"-It was the opinion of an influential member of the Labour party. Indeed, the Leader of the party, in speech at Gympie, did not advocate that adopted. the rates of pay should be so high as are those contained in this Bill. It is essential or poor. that our manhood should render the service to the country that they are being called upon to perform, but they ought not expect to make money out of it. All that they can hope for is to be, to some tent, recouped for money out of pocket. do not know what theobject of the honI orable member is in proposing that the rate hurry things. of pay shall be 8s. per day. Surely there is nothing magical about the figure We cannot introduce that numeral into everything political. "" Eight hours a day and eight ' bob' a day "" is a very taking phrase, and if we could say, "" Eight hours' labour, eight hours a day, eight hours' and no more,"" I should be glad. we cannot, I see no particular virtue in the figure. So long as a fair thing by the men who undergo training, and perform their duty to the community, they will have no reason to complain.",24
116,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Hindmarsh) [3.55]. - The honourable member for Cook has a very worthy object in view, although proposed amendment may not accomplish what he desires. The honourable member for Bourke interjected that the rate pay fixed in the Fisher Bill was 12s. 6d. trained. a week, but that is not so.",24
117,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Does the honourable member deny that' that rate was the Gympie speech, and that the speech declared the policy of the Fisher Governit uent ? - Mr HUTCHISON -^When the Gympie speech was delivered, the Bill had not been finally drafted. There was no provision for a rate of 12s. 6d. a week, or for any other rate, in that measure, just as no rate is provided for in this measure. Under the Bill, the pay is to be. "" as prescribed,"" and, if the Government were in financial difficulties, only 2s. 6d. a day might be prescribed. In the view of the Minister, however, the proper rate will be Ss. a day for youths who have arrived at the age of eighteen years, and 4s. a day for those who have arrived at the age of nineteen years. That being so, surely the honourable gentleman will not object to an amendment which, in place of leaving the rates to be prescribed, will dethat the amounts which I have just mentioned shall be paid.

124,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Unde r the law as stands, every person joining the Militia must be paid 8s. a day. I object to the use of the words "" as prescribed,"" because I regard.it as dangerous to leave to the discretion of a Minister the determination of matters which Parliament is able to determine itself. Most of the people of this country think that the Invalid and Old age Pensions Act provides for the payment of pensions at the rate of ios. a week to all qualified to receive them, but I know a case in which only 9d. a week is being paid. If we leave the rates of pay to be fixed by the Minister, he may make them very low indeed, if his Government is in financial difficulty. The force of public opinion may compel him to do so.",24
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The force of public opinion might cause the repeal of the Act.,25
126,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"If the rates which I have mentioned are provided for, it will be necessary to increase taxation to provide the money with which to pay them. These rates cannot be paid under the existing financial conditions.",25

128,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"We have a right to know how it is to be done. The honourable gentleman, when in Opposition, repeatedly stated that in cases of this kind we should be told how the necessary funds are to be provided.

I am surprised that the posal of the honourable member for [i74]- 2 should be seriously supported. He wishes to provide that every adult shall be paid 8s. a day, or at that rate for part of a day. Now, one hour is part of a day, but it would be difficult to determine what pay should be given for an hour's drill.",25
135,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The wording is that of the Attorney-General's Department. Mr 'SAMPSON - A man might lose a whole day in attending an hour's drill.,25
136,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"In regard to the proposal that youths under the age of twenty should receive a rate equal to their average incomes during the four weeks preceding training, I would mention that I know an insurance clerk under the age of twenty who is getting from ^200 to ^250 a year. The honourable member for Cook proposes to pay such a man £ 5 a week, and to pay others serving with him, who may be as good, or better, soldiers, perhaps only 3s. or 4s. a day, because their ordinary earnings are much smaller. Such inequality of payment would at once create discontent. I desired the honourable member for Hindmarsh to mention in his speech that the honourable member for Wide Bay, when enunciating the policy of his Government at Gympie stated that they proposed that youths up to twenty years of age should receive only ios. a week whilst undergoing compulsory training, and"" that members of the Citizen Defence Forces of the age of twenty years and upwards should receive only 12s. 6d. a week.

149,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"A voice crying in the wilderness! The Labour Government passed two sets of Estimates in both which the pay of members of the Perthree manent Forces in this State was fixed 2S6d. per day; that of the permanent engineers-in accordance with what had been the practice for some years-at 6s. per day; members of the Victorian Naval Forces, 5s. per day.; and Australians Imperial Navy 4s. 3d. per day. Even those rates, however, were high compared with the proposal of the Leader of Labour party in his Gympie speech that members of the Citizen Defence iForces should receive a weekly allowance amountduced ing to about is. 3d. per day whilst training. When the proposal for compulit sory training was first made. I recognised that the difficulty associated with it would be that of finance. I ' spent Ihree Saturof day afternoons in visiting various cricket and football grounds in my constituency and discussing with young men whom met there the question of how the svs-tem would affect them. At a cricket match at Geelong I met three lads of nineconteen years of age who were married, and two of whom had - children. They I that it would be a not serious thing to compel young married men receiving such a small wage to go into camp for a number of days every year and to pay them during that time only ios. a week, as proposed by the Leader of the party, although that was better than the proposal originally made by the honourable member' for West Sydney, that the should be only 7s. 6d. a week. When I found that the present Ministry were prepared to pay lads of eighteen £ 1 is. per week in respect of the time actually spent in training, and lads of nineteen 28s. Goa week. I thought that the scheme could of very properly be accepted. The payment proposed by the Government is as much as the Commonwealth can at present afford. fear, however, that the whole scheme will be wrecked on the rock of finance. A l the Minister has made provision for the payment of the men, he will not be able to extend that provision to the extent that I desire. I certainly do not think that 3s. or 4s. per day should be the perbv manent rate of pay. Youths of eighteen on in the Militia at the present time receive 8s. per day. They receive is. a night for recruit drills, and as soon as they pass into ranks are paid 8s. a day in respect of time lost. I hope that the Minister will endeavour to bring the general rate of payup to that level. I do not say that it of should apply to all, but during the last years of the conscriptive period it at ought to prevail. I do not wish to see any rate fixed in the Bill, because I believe that it will be the duty of the Minister 6d. to endeavour gradually to increase the pay as funds permit. If , as the honourable in the member for Cook proposes, however, the rate of pay is fixed, the hands of the Minister will be tied. The Militia pay at the present is £ 6 8s. per annum. In 1892 the Militia in Victoria received £ 1 2 per annum; subsequently that payment was reto £ 1 0 per annum, and thereafter to £ l P^ annum, until the year 1902, when was further reduced to £ 6 8s. a year. If the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Cook, is adopted, the rate pay which he proposes will become the maximum - instead of the minimum. We should endeavour to get for every man at I least 8s. a day. I ask the Committee to say that if the pay of the members of the Citizen Forces is fixed at 3s. per day in the case of youths of eighteen, and at 4s. per day in the case of youths of nineteen, the members of the Permanent Forces shall receive a similar minimum wage. It is a disgrace to the Commonwealth that members of the Permanent Forces should be receiving only 2s.. 6d. per day, and that rate of - pay, I may add, has been placed on the Estimates on two occasions by a Labour Administration.",26
150,Mr FRANK FOSTER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"New England) [4.20] - In considering the question of the cost of this scheme one nalutally asks what sincerity there is in the proposals of the Government. After examining their financial proposals I am constrained to ask how they intend to finance the. scheme as it stands. If its cost is increased as proposed by the suggested amendment, still greater difficulties will be encountered.",27
151,Mr ARCHER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Does the honourable member support the suggested amendment?,27
152,Mr FRANK FOSTER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Not as it stands. I have considerable sympathy with the object which the honourable member fot Cook has in view, but I am not in sympathy with the proposal to increase the pay of lads serving in the Citizen Forces until the forces are made effective. If we are short of funds, and those who oppose the honourable member's proposition say that we are, we should take cate to so spend the money at our disposal as to make our defences as effective as possible. We shall certainly need to increase our expenditure on the training of our forces in otder to secure an effective system of defence, and I should not like to see any man forced into a position that would lead him to want. Ts a man to be compelled to undergo military training to his loss or for his benefit? Undoubtedly that training is designed to benefit him. Our young men visit cricket and football grounds and places of amusement for their pleasure, and 1 believe that the average Australian, if appealed to in the right way, will readily display his patriotism. I endorse the remark of the honourable member for Dalley that we must not regard our citizen soldiery as mere mercenaries. I hope that such a spirit will never prevail in Australia, and that the poorest men in the Commonwealth will recognise that they are being called upon to undergo military training for their own benefit as well as for the benefit.of others. The position of a man with wealth or a good income to fall back upon is decidedly different from that of another who has to depend upon a meagre wage for a livelihood. I hope that whoever is administering this Act will strive to see that men who are taken away from their only means of support are caused to suffer as little loss as possible while under training. I should not worry, at all if wealthy men received no payment while undergoing training, because it would not matter much to them, but one must worrv about the man who has no other support than the wages that he earns. I hope the suggestion of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, that the payment be not less than 3s. per day for youths of eighteen, or 4s. per day for youths of nineteen, will be adopted. That seems a very small pittance, and it would be hard to make the pay less. I agree with other honourable members that it is wise to leave the intricacies of this measure to experts. No doubt we laymen can see what is right and what is wrong as regards the general principles of the Bill, and in the matter of expenditure, but in the intricate details the experts have such a lead of us that it is rather fortunate that they are taking charge of the measure.",27
153,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Cook) [4.27] - I desire to move presently to fix a rate of payment in the Bill. The Minister has professed certain ideas of his own, but he may not always occupy his present position. We have seen even the present Go : vernment change their opinions frequently, and they may change theirs on this matter, so long as it is left open. The Minister himself was not in favour of compulsory training a little while ago. He ha's altered his opinion on that question,, and may alter it on this.",27
154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That is what a man gets for treating the honourable member generously.,27
155,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,In what way did the Minister treat me generously? 1 hope he does not wish to infer that I have received generous treatment from him in any administrative matter connected with his Department. I do not know that he has shown me any generous treatment in the House.,27
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Perhaps not; go ahead. Mr J. H. CATTS - I hope the Minister does not refer to anything that occurred today in connection with his Department ?,27
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,No .,27
158,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"If anything that I have said has induced the Minister to go further in regard to the pay than he originally proposed, I shall be glad, but I have heard nothing to lead me to such a belief. This question is one of the most important in connection with the whole measure. I represent a large working-class district, where the men cannot afford to lose time unless pay is assured to them. Their wages are not large. There are 30,000 electors in my district, and you can go from any one point to any other in it in twenty minutes, so that honourable members can see that it is a closely settled working-class district. After consideration of statements made during the course of this debate, I move That proposed new section 130 be lef t out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the follow- Mahon, H . ing-""130 . Every person of twenty years and over undergoing training in the-Militia shall be paid at not less than the rate of 8s. per day for each working day or part of a working day on which he is undergoing such training. Every person undergoing compulsory training shall be paid for each working day or part of a working day on which he is undergoing such training at a rate of 3s."" per day for persons between the ages of 18 and 19 years, and 4s. per day for persons between the ages of 19 and 20 years. Such payment may be made out of any appropriation made by Parliament for that purpose."" That will mean that all those compelled to train between the ages of eighteen and twenty will be guaranteed at least from 3s. to 4s. per day. who - voluntarily join the Militia from eighteen years upwards to be paid 8s. per day. I would like the pay uniform, but from the debate I find that impracticable at this juncture. amounts that I have foreshadowed in it are not what I should have liked, but I have consulted a number of my friends, and I find that they are the amounts for which 1 can get some support. I desire to go further on the first opportunity I get, but this provision, if carried, will be an instalment, and an indication to those who lose time from their work in drilling for the defence of Australia that they will be guaranteed some fixed amount to reimburse them.

Proposed new sections 131 to 133. agreed to. Proposed new section 134(1.) No employer shall prevent, or attempt to prevent, any employee who is serving in the Cadets or Citizen Forces from rendering the Those personal service required of him, or in any way penalize, or attempt to penalize, any employee for rendering such personal service, either by reducing his wages or dismissing him from his employment or in any other manner : Provided that this section shall not be conThe strued to require an employer to pay an employee for any time when he is absent fromemployment for the purpose of training. Penalty : One hundred pounds. (2.) In any proceedings for any contraventionof this section, it shall lie upon the employer to show that any employee, proved to have been dismissed or to have been penalized or to have suffered a reduction in wages, was so dismissed penalized or reduced for some reason other than for having rendered the personal service required by this Part.",28
159,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Corio) [4.38] - I would direct the attention of the Minister to the following phrase in the second and third linesany employee who is serving in the Cadets or Citizen Forces. That does not meet the position of men who have not .yet started their training. 3i The Minister will meet both cases if he substitutes for ""serving"" the words "" liable to serve,"" or, perhaps, "" liable to 16 be trained."" Proposed new section 125 provides that all male inhabitants of Australia shall be "" liable to be trained."" The unfortunate feature of this Bill is that eight or nine different persons seem to have been engaged on it. In one place the words ""liable to serve,"" and in another the words "" liable to be trained"" are used. Section 59 of the original Act, which still remains in force, uses the words "" liable to serve in the Militia Forces."" It would be better to use the phrase "" liable to be trained.""",28
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I suggest that the honourable member should allow this proposed new section to go at this stage, and, in the meantime, I shall look into the matter. I have been consulting the Attorney General ; and, if we find that an alteration is required, we will recommit the Bill.",29
161,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I am not troubled about an inconsistency in the use of phrases. But say that an employer tried to stop a lad from going into training at all, and the objection that he was not ""serving.""' This provision says that an employer shall not prevent an employee "" who is serving."" It is one of the strongest penal provisions in the.Bill; and it has to be watched very closely, because it will not be readilv accepted. When we are passing a Bill of this nature, we have to see to it that the penal clauses do actually penalize. If the matter were merely one of phrases, it might be left to the Attorney-General. But if the Minister wants the proposed new section to be effective, he should not leave a loophole to any dishonest employer to render the provision nugatory.",29
162,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Wentworth) [4.42] - I quite agree with what the honourable member for Corio has said. I should like to ask a further question. Let us assume that an employer has in his service a youth who is engaged, not for a fixed term, but by the week. Suppose that the youth is called out for service, and that at the end of his service, the employer refuses to fake him back again, saying, "" The man whom I took on in your absence suits me better than you did. I will keep the older man, because he will not be liable to be called out for training."" In the majority of cases, employees are not permanently engaged, but are employed from day to day. I want to know what the Minister would do to meet a case of that kind. I do not ask him to draft a clause forthwith, because hasty legislation to meet the cases of wily perf sons is not desirable. But I hope that the Attorney-General will endeavour to meet all cases as far as possible.",29
163,Mr GLYNN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Angas - Attorney General) [4.44] - This Bill was not drafted entirely in the Attorney-General's office. The word "" serve "" is used rather generically. I should prefer not to suggest an amendment now; but will promise to go through the Bill carefully and see whether there are any inconsistencies which require to be remedied.",29
164,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I would rather have an amendment made now.,29
165,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"If , at the recommittal stage, it is still thought that there is a danger in the direction indicated, will the Minister agree to recommit this clause?",29
166,Mr GLYNN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Certainly ; but if the honourable member would prefer to put in the words "" liable to,"" that could be done now. Amendment (by Mr CROUCH) agreed toThat after the word "" serving,"" line 2, the words "" o r liable to serve"" be inserted.",29
167,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Hindmarsh) [4.46]took - The proposed new section provides that no employer shall prevent, or attempt to prevent, any employee from rendering personal service, either by reducing his wages or by dismissing him. But an employer may penalize a youth, not for rendering service co the Commonwealth, but for not rendering service to him. He may say, "" I did not dismiss this man for the service which he rendered to the Commonwealth; I dismissed him because he did not render service to me.""",29
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That would be almost a direct way of saying that the man was turned away because he had served the Commonwealth.,29
169,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I have known employers to refuse to allow their apprentices to attend camps of training. I fear that there will be the greatest difficulty in enforcing this penalty. It is difficult to prove why an employer dismisses a man. I have known employees to be dismissed because they gave evidence before a Royal Commission, but, of course, that reason was not stated.",29
170,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Wentworth) [4-50] I understand that the point which I mad(a few moments ago will be considered bj the Attornev-General, and that if he considers that this proposed new section is not satisfactory in its present form, it will be recommitted. As to the point raised by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, it does not protect another large class of persons who are engaged in military service, .and who are as deserving of our protection as those who are rendering compulsory service. I refer to the first line of militia created from the compulsory service cadets. The proposed new section speaks of "" rendering the personal service required of him,"" and again, lower down, there is a reference to "" rendering personal service "" ; but no regard is paid to the militia services, for which payment is made.",29
171,Mr GLYNN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The Citizen Military Forces include the Militia under the definition clause.,30
172,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I am inclined to think on reconsideration that that is so. As regards the safeguard against an employer simply not re-engaging a man who had been serving, and giving as his reason that he likes a new employee better than the old one, the matter certainly requires the attention of the Attorney-General. I hope that amendments will be submitted at the recommittal stage to meet the point.",30
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [4.52] - If , on reconsideration, I can make this provision more stringent, I shall be glad to do so. My desire is to !give absolute protection to those wbo have to undergo training. But I tell honourable members frankly that I doubt whether we can provide for every contingency. We cannot, I am afraid, legislate to prevent an employer, who is unscrupulous and mean enough to take advantage of his position, dismissing an employee. I would far rather rely, and do rely, upon the patriotism of employers, after we have done our best to safeguard the trainees under the Bill. I am glad to see that already there is evidence of a very good spirit amongst the employers in this matter.  deprived men of the opportunity of going to Easter encampments until the Prime Minister intervened.",30
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I have no doubt that our Departments are as .bad as private employers. Human nature is not much better inside than outside the Service. But my desire is to safeguard the trainees to the fullest extent, and if any one can suggest a more stringent provision, I shall be glad to consider it.",30
175,Mr MAUGER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Maribyrnong) [4.54] I agree with the Minister of Defence that, whatever provision we frame, we shall have to depend upon the fairness and generosity of employers. If an employer insists upon dismissing a man, it will be difficult to sheet home to him any other reason than the excuse which he offers, and I believe that when the new system becomes universal, difficulties will not occur so often as they do now. I would, however, urge upon the Minister that he should make the provision as stringent as possible. There are undoubtedly men who would avail themselves of every opportunity to evade their legal responsibilities.  not make a provision of this kind too stringent. No doubt where a number of boys were being employed, it would be easy to replace them with others, and when they returned from their training, they could be taken on againj and summarily dismissed a day or two later on the plea that they were not doing their work properly. In such a case, what action could the Defence Department take? In Queensland, employers dismiss lads perhaps a week before they become entitled to receive certain rates of wages. The employees are told that there is no more work for them, and they have to leave. We know that in Victoria on one occasion some of the Public Departments were preventing militiamen from attending an Easter Encampment, and the Prime Minister had to issue a minute directing that all militiamenin the Public Service should be relieved of duty to attend camp, and should be paid as usual while absent. He added that the Commonwealth should be model employers - in a matter of this kind.",30
176,Mr MAUGER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I had to issue an imperative order to the same effect.  Departments themselves transgress, what can we expect from private employers? However stringent this provision may be made, there will be a loophole of escape. Like the honourable member for Maribyrn(mg, I hope for much from the loyalty and patriotism of employers. Without their co-operation, the system must break down. My fear is that in the capital cities large numbers of boys will be thrown out of employment after the annual period of training. Those who have reared families .know that it is very difficult to obtain work for lads who are between the ages of seventeen and twenty.",30
177,Mr MAUGER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"It is harder to get work for them then than at any other time.  Fathers and mothers, especially those who are partly dependent on their children's earnings, naturally look askance at the compulsory provisions of the Bill, because they fear that their children may be thrown out of employment.",30
178,Mr GLYNN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [5.1] - This matter has been considered very carefully by Ministers, because one has to be very cautious in guarding against the easy evasion by employers of the prohibition against the arbitrary dismissal of employees for absence on military service; but I think that the provision in the Bill is inadequate. There is a similar provision Jn the Arbitration Act, and a Bill to which the name of Senator Needham is attached goes even a little further. Taking advantage of the criticism of honourable members, I move, with the approval of the Minister of DefenceThat after the word "" rendering,"" line 6, words "" or being liable to render Amendment agreed to. Consequential amendment also agreed to.",31
179,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Wentworth) [5.4] - There is another point which I think worthy the attention of the Attorney-General. The form part. proposed new section throws the burden of proof on the employer who prevents an employee from rendering ""the personal agreed to. service required by this Part."" Between the ages of eighteen and twenty, men will be compelled to serve in the Citilawful zen Forces, and between the ages of twenty and twenty-six will have to attend one equivalent, registration and one muster parade in each one year. But there will be those who will voluntarily enlist in the Militia, and seems to me that we are not providing against interference with their service on (where the part of their employers, because it will not bo "" the personal service required by this Part."" Part XII . does not require voluntary enlistment.",31
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,A man who enlists in the Militia is required to render personal service.,31
181,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"But that is not ""the personal service required by this Part."" The man whose patrotism compels him to voluntarily incriease his term of service should be protected, if necessary, from his employer.",31
182,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Althoug h enlistment in the Militia may be voluntary, as soon as the militiaman is sworn in, his personal service becomes compulsory.",31
183,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"But , as I have said, it is not "" the personal service required by this Part."" No doubt what employers^ will object to will be attendance at the eightday camps. We should protect men from interference by such employers. To do so, I move That the words "" by this Part"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" of him.""  provides thatNo employer shall prevent, or attempt to prevent, any employee who is serving in the Cadets or Citizen Forces from rendering the personal service required of him. The Militia will form part of the Citizen Forces.",31
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"But service in the Militia under the circumstances suggested by the honourable member for Wentworth the will not be "" the personal service required "" be inserted. by this Part."".",31
185,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Does the Bill deal with regulations, or are they covered by the principal Act?",31
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"They are covered of by the principal Act, of which this will Amendment agreed to. Proposed new section, as amended, Proposed new section 135(1.) Every person who in any year, without excuse, evades or fails to render the personal service required by this Part, or its shall be guilty of an offence, and shall, in addition to the liability under section hundred and thirty-three of this Act, be liable to a penalty not exceeding One hundred it pounds and not less than Five pounds. (4.) In default of any penalty imposed, or the Court is of opinion that the imposition of a penalty would involve undue hardship) in lieu of imposing any penalty, the Court may, if it thinks fit, commit the offender to confinement in the custody of any prescribed authority for a time corresponding in duration to the time which, in the opinion of the Court, would be taken up in rendering the personal service required. . . . .",31
187,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Corio) [5.8] - I should like to know the meaning of the words ""or its equivalent."" The proposed new section seems to provide a method by which, men may buy themselves out, by paying a fine of not less than £ 5 nor more than £100. Those who have read anything about conscription know that men have often cut off a finger or a toe, or have otherwise mutilated themselves, to evade military service.  Ihe non-combatant forces.",31
188,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I fail to see that any good purpose will be served by the retention of the words ""or its equivalent."" A sympathetic Bench might fine a man £5, and the payment of that monetary penalty might be held to cover the period of service evaded.",31
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [5-11] - The words "" or its equivalent "" refer to trainees who have evaded some part of their service. If they evade any part of their service, they have to make good the time lost. If a boy does not train in the first year, he has to undergo a double term of training in the second; and if he fails to do any training in the first and second years, the whole of the training prescribed must be undergone by him in the third year.",32
190,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,How long can that go on?,32
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Unti l the end of his cadet term. When that term ends, we can get hold of a lad who has not done any training, and may fine him, and make him train under duress.  him into barracks?",32
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Probably we should. We might let him attend to his ordinary work during the day, and compel him to train in barracks at night. He might be placed under military arrest.",32
193,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,But sub-clause 4 of the proposed new section would operate only in default of any penalty being imposed.,32
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The imposition of a penalty would not relieve the offender of his obligation to serve.,32
195,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Sub-claus e 4 will have to be amended if that is the honourable member's intention.,32
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"No. posed new section {133 it is provided thatThose who are classified as non-efficient, either for failure to attend during the prescribed thing. period, or because they have not attained a sufficient standard of efficiency, shall be required to attend an equivalent additional training for each year in which they are non-efficient. In other words, those who do not come up and do their training in one year will be made to do it later on.",32
197,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"That is, if the Court thinks fit.",32
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The Court might determine, if a case were brought before it, that the offending boy ought .not to be trained. It might find that he had not the requisite ability to enable him to assimilate the instruction given. We must trust to the discretion of the Court in the last resort. Who else is to be the final judge ?",32
199,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,But sub-clause 4 is not mandatory so far as the Court is concerned.,32
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Of what use would the Court be if it were given no discretion?, We must simply fix upon a certain standard, and leave the Court to determine whether that standard has been subscribed to by the offending trainee, and, if not, why not? The Judge must have a discretion.",32
201,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Hindmarsh) [5.16] - The proposed new section is very unsatisfactory. The Minister of Defence tells us that, in addition to the fine that may be imposed for evading service, the offender may be compelled to attend an equivalent additional training. In subclause 4, however, it is provided thatIn default of any penalty imposed or (where the Court is of opinion that the imposition of a penalty would involve undue hardship) in lieu of imposing any penalty, the Court may if it thinks fit commit the offender to confinement in the custody of any prescribed authority. . .",32
202,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That is what will be donein the case of the poorer classes.,32
203,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Exactly . They will be placed in confinement in every casebecause they are unable to pay any penalty.,32
204,Mr GLYNN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The penalty is milder, I think, than that provided for in theprincipal Act, which provides for imprisonment.",32
205,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"-My objection is Tn pro- that sub-clause 4 differentiates between rich and poor. We want to see that the rich man's son. does not escape; to a rich man a money penalty would be as noWe must insist that all shall' undergo the prescribed training, but under the proposed new section as itstands that cannot be done.",32
206,Mr GLYNN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The provision which the honourable member has just quoted means that in default of payment of a fine theoffender shall be committed to confinement.,32
207,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"fh e Minister of Defence referred us a few minutes ago toproposed new section 133 and said that under it any person evading training would be compelled to make good the time lost and, in addition, would be liable to apenalty.",32
208,Mr GLYNN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That applies to every one.,32
209,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The Bill not say so.,33
210,Mr GLYNN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,It does.,33
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,In the proposed - new section before us we have the wordsEvery person who . - fails to render the personal service required - - - shall in addition to the liability under section 133 of this - Act be liable to a penalty,33
212,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I do not like the proposal to vest the Court with discretionary power. It will lead to differentiation between rich and poor.,33
213,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Corio) [5.20] - The Minister of Defence has not shown that it is necessary to retain the words "" or its - equivalent."" The honourable gentleman referred the Committee to proposed new section 133. The service therein referred to, however, relates to the same part of the Bill as does the proposed new section now before us, and I am sure that the words ""or its equivalent"" may be read as - meaning a money equivalent. Does the Attorney-General say that any good purpose will be served by retaining the words.",33
214,Mr GLYNN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"There was a doubt about the matter, and they were inserted for - greater caution.",33
215,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The Courts will endeavour to read into them some meaning. ""This measure will be fought in the Courts, and we need to provide a penalty that will stand. I am sure that no one - desires that many men shall be able to - evade service owing to a defect in this (Bill. A lawyer who appeared for the defence might urge that the person charged was going to do his equivalent service, and a fine could not be imposed until every attempt had been made to force him to serve that equivalent. The danger is that these words will be read as referring not to a personal, but to a monetary equivalent, and I should like them, to be - struck out.",33
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Parramatta-^ Minister of Defence) [5-23] - I wider-stand the phrase "" or its equivalent "" to refer to an equivalent service that should have been performed in some year that has - passed. If a man does not undergo the specified training in one year he must perform its equivalent in the second.",33
217,Mr REID,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Unles s the words "" or its - equivalent "" mean something else than personal service they are unnecessary.",33
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I do not think that the retention of the words is very important, and if honourable members desire does them to be omitted, I shall offer no objection. I move That the words "" o r its equivalent,"" in subclause 1, be left out. Amendment agreed to.",33
219,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Cook) [5.25] - I have read the whole of proposed new section 135 carefully, and it certainly does not seem to provide any adequate penalty.; It appears to be totally unworkable. Under it offences might apparently be piled up from year to year and carried forward, and in the end I am afraid that the offender would escape scot free. Of course it is the duty of the Government and of the Attorney-General's Department to provide the necessary machinery for giving effect to the Bill, but these provisions seem to be totally, inadequate. . Mr CROUCH (Corio) [5.26] - I move That the words "" default of , "" in sub-clause 4, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" addition to."" The penalty mentioned is a money penalty. I want the young man whose father can afford to pay a line for him to be still liable to do his term of service.",33
220,Mr HALL,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Werriwa) [5.27] - I agree with the honourable member for Corio. The sub-clause as it now stands will allow the Court, if k wealthy man's son comes before it, to merely impose a fine of from £ 5 to .£100, and let him go. That relieves him of the obligation to put in his training.  will have to serve even then.",33
221,Mr HALL,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The Minister may say it!, but we want the Act to say it. At present it says that, "" In default of any penalty imposed,"" the Court may commit the offender to confinement.",33
222,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,It provides also that where the imposition of a penalty would involve undue hardship the Court may commit. That refers only to the poorer classes.,33
223,Mr HALL,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The Court might apply it to the richer classes. The words "" in default of any penalty "" may apply to a man who can pay the fine as well as to the man to whom it would be a hardship to pay it. In the one case the wording is "" in default of,"" and in the other "" in lieu of."" What is the difference? There seems to be none. The sub-clause as drawn makes it clear that the Court can, if it chooses, allow a man to escape his service by merely fining him ^ 5 . The Attorney-General would be well advised to accept the amendment.",33
224,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Robertson) [5.30] - The sub-clause seems to need recasting. There is nothing to save a person who has no money from being imprisoned, whereas the person who has money may escape that inconvenience. Such a provision offers a premium to those who have rather than those who have not.",34
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [5.31] - I confess that there seems to be a possibility, under the sub-clause as drawn, of a man with plenty of money being able to pay the fine and so enabling his . son to evade the service. I therefore accept the amendment. ' Mr HUTCHISON (Hindmarsh) [5.32]. - Will the amendment really accomplish the honourable member for Corio's object? I question whether it will compel the oflender to still do his training. Mi. CROUCH - I shall afterwards move to substitute "" shall "" for "" may "" in relation to the Court. Amendment agreed to.",34
226,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Corio) [5.33] - The subclause says, "" the Court may if it thinks Fit."" Is this a case of "" trust the Court "" ?",34
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"No ; but Court, after imposing a fine, may ask, ""Are you content to do your training?"" and the training may be performed without any necessity for duress.",34
228,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"What if the man does not do his training then? Mr. JOSEPH COOK:-Then , of he goes to confinement.",34
229,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Ha d e not better make this sub-clause compulsory?,34
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [5.34]--Would it not be fair, if a heavy fine had been im-. posed, to give a boy a chance to do his training in the ordinary way, if he wilfl do it ? The purpose of this provision is to give the Judge a discretion.",34
231,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,In such a case the Court would adjourn the case for a time to see if the bov did his training.,34
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The Judge should be left some discretion whether he should send the offender to duress at once after fining him, or not. A fine of £,^00 is very heavy, and will straighten some of them up.",34
233,Mr HALL,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Werriwa^ [5.35] - Would it not be possible to provide that the Court "" shall commit the offender to confinement unless he gives sureties to complete his training under the Act""? The Minister's intention seems to be that the Court shall impose a fine and let the offender do his training, but that if he does not do it he shall be committed to custody.",34
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [5.36] - A youngster may be absolutely incorrigible, and when the Court has imposed the fine it may consider whether it is worthwhile to send him to be trained. Will such a boy be worth anything to us to train in view of his incorrigibility or other undesirable traits?",34
235,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Robertson) [5-37]--Will the Attorney-General state the effect of the word "" may"" in this connection, as applied to the Court?

238,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Hindmarsh) [5-3 l--This is not a question that we 8 can leave to the discretion of any person. We all know that there are extraordinary discrepancies between the sentences imposed for similar offences by different the magistrates in the lower Courts in all the States, and I am sorry to say that they are usually in favour of the rich man's s.on. Numbers of articles have appeared 1 in the press pointing out these discrepancies, even in the same Court, to say nothing of different Courts. I am sure that the course, Minister's intention is that every boy liable to be trained ihall put in his training asw prescribed.",34
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Yes , if he is worth training.",34
240,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"If he is not worth training he deserves punishment all the same. Surely a boy is not to be let off because he is incorrigible. The sub-clause provides for the incorrigible boy, because the Court may commit him to custody. Even if he cannot be trained, he ought not to escape confinement. But the sub-clause leaves a loophole for the richman's son to escape.",34
241,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Oh !,34
242,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"It is admitted by great authorities that justice is bought. One of America's greatest lawyers, in Figures of the Past, a magnificent work that I have just read, expresses what some of our own lawyers have said over and over again. The partner of the present Attorney-General, in a splendid address at"" Adelaide some time ago before the Justices' Association, said something; even stronger than I have said. When we have these facts staring us in the face, why leave this loophole? I only want a fair thing done. We cannot help what happens under the law. We cannot help one magistrate being unfair as ipompared with .'another. But when we have power to provide that all shall be treated alike, we should do our duty in that respect. The honourable member for Corio would be well advised if he extended his amendment to provide that the Court shall have no discretion.",34
243,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I propose to move to insert the word "" shall,""",35
244,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I cannot see why any honourable member should oppose such an amendment, except with a desire to assist some persons to escape doing their duty.",35
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,What an infamous thing to say !,35
246,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"It must be so. The Minister is rather fond of making such remarks. He has told us that his desire is to have every man trained except incorrigibles. That ought to be the desire of all of us. But if we leave the sub-clause it stands, that object cannot be accomplished. If I were opposed to the scheme of the Bill, I should object to an amendment, but I want to get every adult male brought, under the measure. I do not want my own boy to get through nor any one else's boy.",35
247,Mr AGAR WYNNE,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Balaclava) [5.43]. I object to the honourable member for Hindmarsh slandering our Courts and our Judges, simply because dishonest things have happened in other countries. No doubt there have been corrupt Judges in some countries, but I am satisfied, after a long experience of the law in this State, with a knowledge of the conditions in other States, that our Judges are absolutely incorruptible, and that the administration of justice in Australia is as fair and honest as it can be. The honourable member has merely spoilt his case and his argument by slandering people who have honestly endeavoured to perform their duties.",35
248,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I rise to order. I object to the honourable member for Balaclava saying that I have slandered any one. I merely stated what the Attorney General's partner said.,35
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,May not that have been a slander?,35
250,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I say that it was no slander. I ask that the word "" slander,"" used by the honourable member for clava, shall be withdrawn. I would not slander his profession or any other profession.",35
251,The CHAIRMAN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I do not think that I can call on the honourable member for Balaclava to withdraw the word to which exception has been taken; but as the honourable member for Hindmarsh objects to its use, I ask the honourable member to withdraw it.",35
252,Mr AGAR WYNNE,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I should be sorry at any time to hurt an honourable member's feelings, and if the honourable member for Hindmarsh thinks that I have used too strong a word, I shall be pleased to withdraw it. But I certainly think that he used a very harsh term regarding the administration ofjustice in this country. My experience has been exactly contrary to his own.",35
253,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Wilmot) [5.45] - In my opinion the remark that "" Justice is bought,"" used by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, was most uncalled for. The record of the Australian Courts does not justify such an assertion. I was at first of opinion that the language of the as provision under consideration was not strong enough; but I am now satisfied that the' word "" m a y "" would fit the case, because under proposed new section 133, any person who does not attend, or otherwise makes himself inefficient, will have to go through his training again. There wiil be no alternative but for the Court to commit an incorrigible person. It is not the object of the Bill to give any person a chance of escaping his training. I feel satisfied that whether a youth was a rich man's or a poor man's son, justice would be meted out to him.",35
254,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Cook) [5.48] and I agree that where it is prescribed that a certain penalty shall be imposed for a definite offence, a discretionary power ought not to be left to a Judge or magistrate. Therefore, I shall support the strengthening of this provision. At the same time, I wish to say lhat I cannot support the interpretation placed upon the statement of the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I do not know of a single case in which justice has been bought in Australia.",35
255,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I did not say that.,35
256,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I should not like to be committed to the honourable member's words, whatever they may mean. 1 know of no case in which it has even been suggested that the administration of justice in BalaAustralia has been corrupt.",35
257,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Hear , hear j neither do I . Mr J. H. CATTS - I do, however, know of cases where justice has not been administered, not because the fountain of justice was polluted corruptly, but because of an unconscious bias on the part of those presiding on the bench at the time. I have known of cases where decisions have heen given that were not in accordance with the evidence, and of cases in which it appeared to me that there was a very strong leaning indeed.",36
258,The CHAIRMAN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The remarks which have been made do not justify the honourable member in entering upon a discussion as to what has happened in certain law courts.,36
259,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I am giving reasons why I think sub-clause 4 should be strengthened. We ought not to afford an - opportunity for social and class distinctions to be made. I have known cases! where the class line has been strictly drawn.,36
260,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Magistrate s may have been biased.,36
261,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"That is what I am saying, and that is the reason why we ought to make sure that there shall be no waiving of penalties when the sons of the well-to-do try to escape the compulsory training prescribed by this Bill. No such thing as social influence or club influence or association influence ought to have any effect upon the administration of the measure. I think that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has been totallv misunderstood by some honourable membersopposite. Perhaps there has been a desire to make it appear that he said something which the words that he used do not actually convey.",36
262,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member began by condemning him, and now he seeks to excuse him.",36
263,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I am not going to accept the interpretation placed on the honourable member's words by honourable members opposite. Of course, an election is pending, and we know what honourable members and their supporters are capable of doing.",36
264,Mr REID,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"East Sydney) [5.54] - I did not hear distinctly the statement of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, but I feel sure that he could not have meant to impute that any member of the Judicial Bench in this Commonwealth has in any case been ""bought.""",36
265,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I never said so.,36
266,Mr REID,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I feel sure that, whatever the expression used by the honourable member may have been, he did not mean that because, if he had said such a thing, or meant it, it would have been the grossest and most undeserved slander that any human being could utter against the occupants of the Judicial Bench, and against the character of the people of Australia.",36
267,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Hindmarsh) [5.55]. - I regret that any honourable member should have sought to misrepresent what I said. The words which I used I will repeat, and Hansard will show that what I say is correct. What I said was that a great American lawyer, in a book called Figures of the Past, said that justice could be bought.",36
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The honourable .member said more than that.,36
269,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Will the Minister of Defence be kind enough to keep quiet while I am explaining that I have been misunderstood? Even the American lawyer, from whom I quoted the phrase, did not assert that the American Courts were corrupt. I was dealing with the rich and the poor, and I stated-wha t is undeniable - that we find different magistrates giving different decisions upon the same kind of evidence. We repeatedly see articles in the press commenting upon the different character of the decisions given by magistrates in similar cases. The partner of the Attornev-General has said something quite as strong.",36
270,Mr GLYNN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"If so, I repudiate it. I have not heard him make any statement of the kind, nor have I seen such a statement attributed to him.",36
271,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,What he said before the Justices Association was that half our law was Judge-made law.,36
272,Mr REID,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That is quite another thing from saving that Judges are bought.,36
273,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The right honourable member will agree with me that in Australia justice is bought, though not by the corruption of Judges or magistrates. I had to pay pretty dearly for legal assistance on one occasion, and yet failed to win my case, though afterwards my opponent was put into gaol, it being proved that he had robbed the country of ^60,000., Had I not been able to pay for the assistance of counsel, thus buying my law, I should have been mulcted in a heavy penalty. I ask those who say that justice cannot be bought what chance would they have of winning a case against the right honourable member for East Sydney or the Attorney-General ? A man who tried to sent his own case when such lawyers were appearing against him would have a very poor show of winning.",36
274,Mr REID,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member's expression was very unfortunate. He would sary. not like it to be said that any member of his partu could be bought.,37
275,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I have mentioned that a great lawyer used the expression.,37
276,Mr REID,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I understand now what the created, honourable member meant; but the expression he used was unhappy. It might be used all over the world in a wicked sense.",37
277,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I would be the last to suggest that our Courts I do not even suggest bias on the part of magistrates whose decisions have differed. Bui, as some men would be able to pay lawyers to appear in their defence, while the hands of magistrates. others would not, and as magistrates are inprovides thatfluenced by the representations of those who appear before them, I say that we should not pass the Bill in such a form that either rich or poor mav be able to evade military service. - Mr ATKINSON - If a fixed penalty were provided, injustice might be done.",37
278,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"We have left it the discretion of magistrates to say whether the penalty shall be ^ 5 or ;£ioo. What I contend is that, in any case, the defaulter should be compelled to undergo his. period of training.",37

280,Dr WILSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Corangamite) [6.2] am surprised that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has forgotten that in all battles in British history the and poor have fought side by side, and died together as comrades. What has happened in the past will happen again in the future. In Australia the sons of rich and poor do their duty together, without fear favour. There are incorrigibles belonging to all classes, and this provision is intended to deal with them. It seems to me that preamendment which has been made on the motion of the honourable member for Corio renders the parenthesis '' where the Court is of opinion that the imposition of a penalty would involve undue hardship"" unneces",37

While agreeing with all that has been said about the integrity of our Courts of Jus tice, I cannot ignore the fact that magistrates are at times unconsciously biased, at and I am opposed to allowing the administration of the measure to be affected by such bias. The person proceeded against may not be able to pay a penalty, and the magistrate before whom he is brought may, as the provision stands, out of the kindness of his heart let him go. There should not be be this loophole for evasion. To place this discretion in the hands of the magistrates is to undermine the principle of service, in regard to the application of which there should be no room",37

288,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I think a still further amendment is necessary. If the alteration suggested by the honourable member for will Corio is made-and , in my opinion, it or should be made-the proposed new subsection will provide that the Court shall ""commit the offender to confinement in the the custody of any prescribed authority.""",37
289,Mr CROUCH,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I suggest that he should be committed to the custody of the commandant of a camp.,38
290,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The "" prescribed authority "" might be the devoted mother of the erring ladThe provision is so drawn that any authority might be prescribed.",38

292,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"-No doubt, the cares of office have dimmed the honourable member's memory of his youthful days; but there is a time in the youth of perhaps every young man when to be confined within his own home is a serious penalty, and a future Minister of Defence might take the view that it would be a sufficient penalty pose upon offenders under this proposed new sub-section. I should like to know definitely what it is proposed to do with such offenders. What is the prescribed authority to whose custody they will be committed ?",38
293,Mr REID,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"East Sydney) [6.11] - I should like to ask the Minister of Defence, or the Attorney-General, for an opinion as to the meaning of the words ""without lawful excuse"" in sub-clause 1 of the proposed new section. A great deal may depend upon them. The expression seems to refer only to excuses in law. If it does, then difficulty may arise. Cases may occur in which the failure to render service has been due to circumstances that would excite the sympathy and consideration of the Court and of every one else. I can conceive of a case in which not a rich man, but a poor man, might be grievously affected. A young man might perhaps be the sole support of his mother, and the remaining members of her family, and it might be vital for him in a particular year, owing to the specially urgent circumstances of that family, not to give up to training the time that the law demands. If the words ""lawful excuse"" would cover a case of that kind, I should have an easy mind, because, in that event, the person charged would not be punished. But I am afraid that "" lawful, excuse "" would not cover such a domestic emergency.",38
294,Mr AGAR WYNNE,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Wh v not substitute "" valid "" for "" lawful""?",38
295,Mr REID,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The Court would ask for a lawful excuse, and would say to the offender, "" There is nothing in the Act dealing with cases of emergency affecting a breadwinner."" If the words ""lawful excuse"" mean only an excuse in law, some most distressful cases, in which the person who had absented himself would have the sympathy of every member of the community, would have to be punished by the imposition of a fine of not less than £ 5 . Such a penalty would be ruinous to a man in the circumstances I have mentioned, and, if sub-clause 4 were made mandatory, as has been suggested, his position would be further aggravated by his compulsory removal from the duty of earning bread for those dependent upon him.",38
296,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,He would have only to serve in confinement the time he had evaded.,38
297,Mr REID,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"But that might be all important to those whose daily bread was to imdependent upon his labours. While I strongly concur in the desire to make this provision as uniform as possible, so that no invidious distinctions shall be made between rich and poor, I am very much afraid that in endeavouring to achieve that object we might inflict very serious injury upon the poor. A young man might have dependent upon him a family, some member of which was permanently invalided. All sorts of urgent cases might arise, but, under sub-clause 4, as it stands, the Court could take the special circumstances into consideration, and in doing so would carry out the wishes of the whole community.",38
298,Mr JH CATTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The right honourable member is showing howmany interpretations can be placed on the provision as it stands.,38
299,Mr REID,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I am speaking, not of the interpretation of the proposed new section, but of the circumstances of those who may be brought before the Court. If the word ""shall'' were substituted for the word "" may,"" a most cruel course might have to be taken, which would expose the whole system to odium. In the exigencies of the poor, the taking away of a breadwinner might work the most serious"" consequences. I do not say that such cases would be frequent, but an acute case might arise, and if the word "" shall "" were substituted for the word ""may,"" the person concerned would have to be sent into confinement. If the word "" valid"" were substituted for the word "" lawful,"" as the honourable member for Balaclava has suggested, I should see no objection to the use of the word "" shall,"" because, in the circumstances to which I have referred, there would be no offence. There would be a valid excuse if such a case came into Court, and, as a matter of fact, I do not think the authorities would bring it before the Court.",38
300,Mr CARR,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Then the authorities would be the arbiters of the matter? . Mr Reid - We cannot always trust implicitly to the authorities.

I tainly should not like to see the word ""valid"" substituted for the word ""lawful."" If the honourable member for Hindmarsh thinks that I suggested that I had cases aught but respect for our Australian Courts, he is mistaken. In cases that excite high political feeling, the Courts should not a discretionary power. Under the Comfuture monwealth Conciliation and Arbitration we cannot foresee. Act, we have expressly provided that strikes shall not take place. No discretion vested in the Court so far as they are cerned, and, as a further illustration point that I wish to make, I would remind horvorabie members of what took place when the Victorian Factories, and Shops Act first came into force - The State Agent-General then' found it necessary, again and again, to write to some of justices in suburban courts, because, owing to their political feelings they declined impose penalties in cases brought under that Act. It. was some time before the Act found its way into public favour, there is not the slightest ""doubt that, as as this system comes into force, rise to a great deal of feeling.

That feeling is likely spread, and it would be a' mistake to the Court a discretion in such a matter as the Court. this. Let us place upon the authorities the responsibility of pressing for punishment in hard cases. Under this measure we shall have a public prosecutor. There cannot be private prosecutors.",39
302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"That , is to say the member would not trust a Judge, word but he would trust the authorities.

If the authorities are to determine cerwhether or not punishment should be inflicted, many cases that ought to be brought before the Court will never see thelight of day. This provision will meet all the that are likely to avise. I think it would be unwise to make sub-clause 4 mandatory, since, by doing so, we should lay have down a hard-and-fast rule to apply to events, the circumstances of which If the Court has no option but to commit a person into is custody for evading service, great hardconships may arise. I agree with the right on the honourable member for East Sydney that it would be better perhaps to substitute "" valid "" for "" lawful,"" so that only those who were unable to offer a valid excuse would be punished; but I think we shall do well to leave sub-clause 4 as it stands. the If the Court is compelled to punish men for not attending to their military duties, to even when they have been prevented by necessity or other just cause, hardship will be inflicted.

The competitive examinations shall be of a practical character, and no written work shall be demanded other than of the nature required for tfie rank concerned in the field and in the ordinary exercise of duties. The standards and manner of holding such examinations shall be prescribed in the regulations. All books required for such examinations shall be issued to candidates without charge."" I hope the Minister will accept this proposal. In the past men who have served for many years, and gone through the ranks, have had the greatest difficulty in m obtaining promotions. I have known men who never did a single day's drill receive commissions, although I have known them to develop into first class officers. At : the same time, when men who had been through the ranks applied for commissions at the request of the commanding officer and of the men themselves, all kinds of attempt.; were made to block them. If we are to have a citizen force, we ought to have the very best brains among the officers. Another method by which promotions from the ranks might be blocked is by prescribyears, ing unnecessarily severe examinations. That would give a great advantage to young - men whose fathers could afford to give them an expensive training. That sort of thing obtains now. I want to see the examinations as severe as the duties will warrant, but they should not go beyond the duties which the candidates will be required to perform. Examination papers set, not only in this, but in other Departments, have been most unfavorably criticised by the public and press because of the extraordinary questions asked. In the Postal Department candidates for positions in which they would simply have to dress and paint telegraph poles, have been asked questions relating to geography and other subjects, which very few members of this House could have answered. There is nothing in the proposed new clause that will alter the Bill in any way, and no extension of any kind is proposed. My only desire is to have a citizen force in the best sense of the word, with equality of opportunity to every man according to his ability.",40

(4) There shall be no military funerals in uniform except on active service, or in the case of those who have been on active service.

Uniforms shall be supplied free of charge to all ranks, including officers. (d) The system of military salutes shall be reduced to the simplest form for military discipline."" With regard to paragraph a, a great deal of time has been taken up in the past by unnecessary show parades.

As the Department recognises that they should be still further diminished, it is well to set it out definitely in the Bill. Our forces ought to have a practical training in the duties that they will be expected to perform in time of war. With regard to paragraph b, the honourable member for Richmond, when Minister of Defence, was good enough, at my request, and at the request of others, to agree that Indian Mutiny and Crimean veterans should be given a military funeral so long as the Department was not put to expense. I am sorry to say that quite a number of such veterans have passed away quite recently. In every case the relatives greatly appreciated the funeral accorded in pursuance of that permission, and the Department was not put to any expense. With reference to paragraph c, military uniforms should certainly be all of one character. My meaning is that one uniform should not be finer or more showy than another. Of course, they ought to be distinctive, and this paragraph would not interfere with the use of different coloured materials for different arms of the service, or different facings for the Infantry. All uniforms ought to be as simple and as nearly of one character as possible, with, of course, all the d stinctions that the Minister mayi : think desirable. I believe that is in accordance with the Minister's own wish.",41
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,This would do away with the kilt.,41
316,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I think not, but if it had that effect it would be for the Minister to say that there should be an exception. It would be possible to provide that all the Scottish regiments must wear kilts of the same material, though, of course, the tartans would be different. But no regiment should have a finer or more expensive uniform than any other. With regard to military salutes, I think that they should be insisted on when men are in uniform, but not otherwise, because that has led to trouble in the past, and will do so in the future.",41
317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [8.3] - I regret that I cannot accept the amendment. I do not think that it would be wise to provide that the Citizen Forces shall be instructed only in the duties required of them in war. Of course, the main object of their training will be to fit them for warfare, but a limitation of the kind proposed might prove very, inconvenient. I do not agree with the honourable member that military funerals should not be in uniform. I can conceive of nothing more impressive than such functions. In my opinion, they help to strengthen the feeling of comradeship. Naturally soldiers, when bearing a deceased comrade to the grave, like to wear the dress which he wore as one of their number, and this sentiment of comradeship should be encouraged. If , as the honourable member proposes, our military uniforms were all of one character, the Scottish corps would be robbed of their kilts, unless we put all the regiments in kilts - I would  Hindmarsh would like to have the Naval Brigade in kilts.",41
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"As to saluting, we propose to standardize the training, drill, and discipline of our troops with that of the rest of the Empire. Having determined to do that, it would be unwise to depart from the principle in respect to saluting. To do so might lead to complications, if our officers or soldiers were sent to other parts of the Empire and officers and men from outside were exchanged to serve here in their places. It must not be forgotten that the utmost economy will become a necessity of the situation because of the expense of our Military Department.",42
319,Mr THOMAS BROWN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Calare) [8.7]. - The honourable member for Hindmarsh will be wise not to press his proposals. I should not like the Highlanders to be deprived of their kilts.,42
320,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That is not intended.,42
321,Mr THOMAS BROWN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I agree the honourable member that uniforms should ue supplied free of charge, both to officers and to the men in the ranks, and that they should be simple in character. By providing the officers with uniforms, the Governhave ment will make it possible for men who are now debarred from accepting commiswith sions, because of the expense, to gain the promotion to which their merits entitle them.",42
322,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Officers ' uniforms are not as expensive as they used to be.,42

No doubt the other proposals the honourable member, while it would not be wise to embody them in the Bill, are I worthy of consideration, and will probably form the basis of useful reforms. As to saluting, I agree with the Minister that should try to make our .practice and discimen. pline the same as that of other parts of Empire.",42
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The question form can be dealt with without the insertion of a provision in the Bill.,42
325,Mr THOMAS BROWN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"That is so. If the Government determines to supply forms to all ranks, it will have to establish and control a factory for their manufacture. I understand that power is taken to do that.",42
326,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Hindmarsh) [8.12]. like it to be understood that it is not my intention to deprive the present regiments of their distinctive dress. I feel very strongly on the subject of uniform. While it may not be necessary to insert a provision regulating the supply of uniforms, we should have an assurance from the Minister that both officers and men will be provided with uniforms by the Government. Officers' uniforms must not and cannot be .expensive, because of the number of officers required. It will be more difficult than the Minister thinks to get the necessary officers. At present, we are short of officeis by some hundreds, but we should make every effort to get officers, and to promote those who possess the best qualifications. To poor men the cost of uniforms means a great deal.",42
327,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The number of officers will be so great that this matter will have to be considered very seriously, and, no doubt, the necessities of the situation will compel us to do what the honourable with member wishes to have done.",42
328,Mr THOMAS BROWN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,We should like to know that it will be the policy of the Department to provide officers with uniforms.,42

337,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Wentworth) [8.19] - I have given notice of my intention to move the insertion of a new part providing for the establishment of a Military College. It is as follows :- PART XV - MILITAR Y COLLEGE. 147. The Governor General shall establish Military College under a Director, who shall be a highly qualified officer with a general knowledge of the science of war, and a staff consisting of not less than four Assistant tors, who shall each be a specialist in the allotted to him at the College. 148.

338,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I do not think that officers any other Bill does it.,43
339,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That is no reason why and I hope this Bill should not.,43
340,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Is the experience of into the the world worth nothing to us? Air. KELLY - So far as this Bill is it is not, since it is entirely different from the Military Acts of other countries. There is no doubt that, to any impartial student of this measure, its one outstanding weak feature is that, while we are endeavouring under it to provide training, which some consider inadequate, for the rank and file, there is no attempt made by it to provide efficienteducational training a for the officers who have to command them. Let us consider for a moment the position of the existing officers in Australia, apart, Direcof course, from any personal considerations. duties We have recently provided, at considerable The new 18as pounder field gun provided for the Australian Field Forces is, perhaps, as good agun as is to be found in the world, but do to honourable members know that in the Commonwealth' there are only two officers who or re have passed through a proper field artillery",43

342,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"On e officer is on the Central Administration, in Melbourne, and the pracother has recently returned from England, after undergoing a course of training therehis There is a third officer undergoing training him in England; but we have in Australia at the the present time only two who understand the use of this new arm. Let us go now a stage further, and consider the position of the superior officers-officer s of the rank not disof colonel-wh o would have to commandof the Commoncolumns in time of war.",43
343,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I presume that the hona cerorable member, in speaking of officers who have qualified, is referring to those who have passed through the School of Gunnery at Woolwich?",43
344,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I am speaking of officers qualified to give instruction. There are a number of officers who have been for a long time in militia field batteries, and from what I can gather from them, they have only recently begun to appreciate, at all events in New South Wales, how infinitesimally little they know. They have been led to do so by the visit to New South Wales of an exchange officer from India, associated with the Field Artillery. With his arrival they began to understand for the first time that there was such a thing as indirect fire in connection with field artillery. wish to delay the Committee, but desire to point out that it is far easier to train the rank and file than it is to give an officer sufficient knowledge, experience, and confidence in himself to make him a fit commander for the troops we have when the time for action arrives. I have drawn up these provisions after consultation with a number of persons. The only objections with which I have been met so far may be briefly stated. In the first place, I am met with the plaint, "" What is the good of Parliament doing anything? Why not - leave it to the Defence Department?"" I am not disposed to leave it to the Department, because I have a very shrewd suspicion that its permanent officers, the vast majority of whom have not aualified themselves as they would have had to do in the Imperial or any foreign service for their offices, will show as great reluctance in the future to insure the proper education of their colleagues and themselves as they have in the past. So much for that objection. Another objection that has been urged is that it would be very difficult to induce a militia officer to undergo the course requisite to make him efficient. My answer is that, if that is so, the sooner the Parliament understands i l the better for _ the people of Australia. We are living in a fool's paradise if we go on imagining that our officers are reasonably efficient, when it is known that they are not, and when it is - thought at Head-quarters that they would - object to any course proposed to make them - efficient. I shall explain very briefly the proposed new clauses. My idea is to have a central college, to which every one who - seeks the rank of major will have to go, and pass a course of instruction, receiving while there a pay allowance.",44
345,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member is following, to some extent, the Canadian system.",44
346,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"No . Canada has a college-Kingston-partl y devoted to ordinary educational subjects, and dealing partly with military training. Under our Constitution, which leaves to the States the subject of general education, such a departure would be out of the question. I propose a college for the education of our higher officers. I still propose that all examinations for officers under the rank of major shall remain, as at present, entirely under the Department. But when a man wishes to go up to field rank-that is to say, when he desires to beI do not come a major-h e should prove himself thoroughly qualified in his own particular branch of the profession, and should prove, in addition, that he is so conversant with other arms that his own force might have to meet in time of war as to be able to lead his men with a fair chance of success. Further, I propose that, when a man goes up for the rank of lieutenant-colonel in our Militia Forces, he shall pass an examination equivalent to that which, in the Imperial Service, is called ""Tacticalfitnessfor command."" A man who seeks that rank in the Imperial Service must show himself to be versed in the use of all arms and able, to lead a composite force in the field. That is all that I ask that our officers shall do. I am asking, in fact, that our militia officers shall have placed before them opportunities which they have never had to make themselves as efficient as they could hope to be as militia officers, and, I trust, as efficient as permanent officers could hope to be. I propose that they shall go to this Military College, where they will receive the assistance of experts in the various branches of military science.",44
347,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,What will be the basis of admission ? Does the honourable member propose that students shall have previously matriculated ?,44
348,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Any man desiring to go up for the rank of major must have passed the course laid down by the Department.,44
349,Dr WILSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,He must at least hold the rank of captain.,44
350,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Yes . When he goes to the college, the Director and AssistantDirector will have to test his capacitv, and help to educate him outside the theoretical schools. He will have the services, from time to time, as the Department decides, of a permanent field artillery battery, and such other permanent arms as may be found necessary for his proper education. It has been suggested that Camberley, - the great staff college in England, has no permanent arm attached to it. That is true. It is. not necessary that it should, because, as the honourable member for Maranoa knows., after a man has completed his staff course there, he can be sent to Aldershot, where he can be placed in command of a column, and put through his facings in the same way. We have no means in Australia, unless Ave adopt some such plan as this, of testing an officer's knowledge of an arm of the service to which he has not been used. A man who desired to become a lieutenant-colonel of infantry, to be efficient, would have to prove that he knew something about the use of artillery. In such a case, what does the Minister do? He sends the officer to a sixteen days' camp of the Australian Militia Artillery. ' The brigade has allotted to it a period of trainingabout one-fifth of that thought necessary in other countries, where there are citizen forces, and it has to cram into sixteen days what other forces attempt to cram into sixty. The result is that, long before the men have got through their sixteen days' course, they realise that their time is all too short. They have no time to instruct themselves, let alone to instruct any"" one else who comes to witness and stays to interfere with their operations. It is essential to the efficient working of a Military College in Australia to have, at all events, a permanent battery of field artillery, able, not only to educate officers, but to test the capacity of artillery officers generally. I submit proposed new section 149, because under the state of affairs ruling in, the Department, a man has only to pass a theoretical examination to become an instructional officer. He may be withoutfitnessto instruct. I am informed by officers in a position to know, that a large proportion of our instructional officers are a travesty upon the name. How can we expect to have our rank and file trained if our instructional officers have received no instruction to fit them for the very high responsibilities they ' are called upon to bear ? The other proposed new sections I commend to the attention of honourable members.",44
351,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,What about a Naval College?,45
352,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"That will be absolutely essential when the Naval Eill is brought before us. We do not know what the provisions of that measure will be. Proposed new section 152 compels men to become efficient within two years, and the next provision that I propose to insert is designed to encourage them to become efficient as soon as possible, by enacting thatMilitia officeis who have passed the v prescribed course at the Military* College, shall take seniority over other officers of similar rank in the Commonwealth Militia Forces who have not passed the said course. That will show us immediately what officers we have who are energetic and keen; such officers ought to go up to the highest positions that we have at our disposal. The last of the proposed new sections that I desire to insert merely specifies that officers attending the Military College shall receive while there pay and allowance. I am not attempting to bind the hands of the Government of the day.",45
353,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"On the contrary, the honourable member is trying to free their hands.",45
354,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I am trying to make certain that the Defence Department will at last take some action to do its duty in this regard. I wish to direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that all questions of detail under these proposals are still left to the Department. Everything witlv regard to 'fechnicali questions with which we, in this Parliament, are not competent to deal, is left to be prescribed by the Governor General. But if these provisions are inserted, we shall at least give to the Militia officers of Australia an opportunity to become truly efficient. The most energetic officers will be able to rise to the highest ranks. That is an opportunity they have not had before, and to that fact is traceable the disorganized state, so far as training is concerned, that we see them in today. I commend these propositions with confidence to the Committee, believing that honourable members will see that ot least something in the direction I propose shall be provided for in this Bill. I move That the following proposed new section be inserted :- "" 147. The Governor General shall establish a Military College under a Director, who shall be a highly qualified officer with a general knowledge of the science of war, and a staff consisting o i not less than four Assistant Directors, who shall each be a specialist in the duties allotted to him at the College.""",45

The honourable member is to be complimented on what he has done, and I think that the Minister can with safety adopt his proposals.

The Minisabout ter's scheme, so far, is only on paper.",45
356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The same may be said of the amendments now before us.,46
357,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Precisely . The whole higher officers. scheme is on trial, and the Minister cannot raise the objection that what the member for Wentworth is proposing is an innovation, and, for that reason, should not be accepted. Unfortunately, m public life, as in other spheres of action, if wants to make enemies, he has only to entical deavour to excel others; if he degires make friends, he has only to let others excel him. The honourable member for is Wentworth has unquestionably excelled many others in his study of military tions, but I hope that his proposal will favourably received. The only real test of the whole scheme, whether in regard the Minister's Bill, the present Central ministration, a Military College, or future officers, will be actual war conditions. that Parliament can do is to adopt what it considers the best and most progressive scheme, and see that its policy is carried out. The honourable member for Wenthuman worth has pointed out that the Minister must first grapple with the question of whether his own Central Administration competent enough for the high standard which he desires the rank and file to The difference between the average highly skilled non-commissioned officer who has seen active service, and the ordinary officer who has not, is that the former is able deal with men and impart instruction, and the other often is not. Many men can found chock-full of book lore, but unable' to impart their knowledge. That is the difficulty that the honourable member for Wentworth is apparently trying to get over. All I am afraid of is that he may be trying to make the training too theoretical. an instance of the value of theory, in younger days there was a highly theoretical officer in the Army, named Major-General Cleary, whose book on minor tactics was regarded as the standard text book for only officers. Any one who could pass an examination in it was considered to be an excellent officer, but what was the practical, result? That officer, who was sent to Great Britain. South Africa on active service, was actually one of the first Generals captured by the Boers. The Boers did not work on his is. lines. If they had done what that highly rank skilled tactician told them to do on, say, of page 646 of his book, he could have beaten them every time; but they did not bother that. This shows that we can paint the advantages of a college in too bright colours, although I agree that we ought to have a college for the instruction of the",46
358,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I have endeavoured to inhonorable sure practical efficiency also.,46
359,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Whil e the honourable member has drawn certain deductions from his study of the subject, there are other a man men who draw their deductions from pracexperience, or perhaps by peeping into to some of the very works that have been quoted in this debate. All I wish to say that the theoretical business can be driven too far. As an illustration, there can be quesfound in any city in Australia, men who be are profoundly versed in the knowledge of the law, and can teach it in the universities, to but they are absolutely useless in the AdCourts. They do not understand human nature, and cannot handle a jury. If you All put some of these theoretical military scholars about 60 miles from the theatre of war, they could write splendid articles and directions, but in .the handling of documents-mankind-the y would be very much at sea. I hope the Minister will not disregard the strong plea which the is honourable member for Wentworth has made. I suppose if the Minister were candid, he reach. would admit that he did not know the port side of a drum. He has done remarkably well in mastering the details of the subject in so short a time; but he to should remember that the mere fact that a proposal is an innovation, and is disliked be or looked upon unkindly by his present Central Administration, is not a sufficient reason fnr throwing it under the table. If he makes inquiries, he will find that the Head-quarters Staffs in the various States have not been remarkable in the past for As military sagacity. Any public man could my name scores of officers in the States who have been fit only to draw their pay, and look well on parades.",46
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Does that apply to Australia ?,46
361,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I am sorry to say that the Boer war showed it to be true also of Before that event, any public man who said that the British military-authorities were lax in their control or direipline, or lacking in ability, would have been scouted, and there would have bf>en a .demand for his suspension from the nearest tree. But the Boer war taught the sad lesson that, while the sprigs of nobilitywere courageous enough, they had not sufficient knowledge to lead troops, and thousands of the rank and file had to suffer in consequence. The Minister has been fortunate in getting this Bill through, and in having an awakened public to back him up in the matter. I hope that it will stand to his credit for many years to come, and, if itpasses, it will be a living memorial to him, but he should look further ahead to the contingency that we may have to face, and make sure that when our efficients have been drilled, they will be officered by men who will not lead them to the shambles. There is no doubt the Australian officer will have courage enough, but will he have enough ability to lead our forces in time of war? The lesson of the Boer war was a timely one to the British Empire, and every year since then, leading authorities in Great Britain have been hammering away to secure an improvement in the Central Administration, and a greater standard of ability among the officers of the Army. Surely we are not going to forget that lesson, or to ask the taxpayers to be bled almost to their last.shilling in order to put an efficient military force in the field, neglecting the training of efficient officers, - which should .be one of the main features of a first-class force? The proposition of the honourable member for Wentworth is most timely. Three weeks ago I said that if the Minister carried out the intention of the Bill, and tried to improve the Australian Forces, he would be for two years the most hated man in the Commonwealth; and that the test of his ability and firmness would be the fact that he was hated. No doubt the late Minister of Defence, Senator Pearce, did what he thought was correct, but what made me doubt his usefulness was the paeans of admiration which arose from the officers of the Central Administration when he left office. Can the Minister show the Committee why a college should not be established ? Is it a matter of expense, or does he think that it will be useless ?",46
362,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"As a matter of fact, T have money on the Estimates for a college, and am now elaborating a scheme.",47
363,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Then why object to provide for it in the Bill ? We know that the mere placing of a sum of money on the Estimates does not mean that the work will be done. This proposal is a splendid finish to the Bill. Honourable members know that the principle of universal service has now been practically adopted, but they are not asking for anything in the nature of a standing army.",47
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Do not forget that this is not a standing army.,47
365,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I quite recognise that; but we want to make our men efficient. It is not enough to jgive tihem a sort ofphysical drill up to the age of twenty, and then throw them out, and call the result an army.",47
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The mere passing of these clauses will not make the Army efficient.,47
367,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Thei r adoption will affirm the usefulness of a Military College. Men have often got commissions in years gone by without sufficient knowledge or experience to warrant it. I was amongst the number myself. Too many men have been ""jockeyed"" into the position of officer in Australia. It is all very well for afternoon tea parties and ball rooms, or for filling out tailor-made clothes, but when the responsibility comes, there will be a different tale to tell. This is a serious matter. Australia recognises that she wili while have to play her part in actual warfare, perhaps very soon, and she must be prepared. There are men holding positions now as colonels, majors, and captains galore. You can put six of them in a bag together and the worse one will generally be found at the bottom. This picture may be strongly drawn, but it is not drawn dishonestly. Men who were more fit to he instructed by their corporals than to give instruction have obtained commissions. If you asked manv of these so-called officers today to explain in a few sentences an ordinary movement, they could not get beyond a stutter or a stammer, but would have to fall back on their colour-sergeant. The honourable member for Maranoa knows that that sort of thing is rife in Australia to-d^y. There are men who could not explain an ordinary brigade order, if called upon suddenly to do so, holding high positions. Are we to allow that system to continue? The honourable member for Wentworth has admitted that compulsory service will bring into the forces many of the brightest intelligences, and openings should be made for them. The establishment of a Military College will be no bar to their advancement. I am with any honourable member who wishes to perfect this scheme. I do not know whether the Minister objects to the establishment of a college on political grounds, because he will not know where to put it, but he should not let that hinder him. It does not matter where it is established.",47

374,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Surely the honourable member will not compare Australia with America. As to Canada, which has also been mentioned, if we are only to get out of the college a result equal to that obtained there, it is not worth undertaking.",48
375,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The best officer the Minister has came from Kingston.,48
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The Canadian Military Force today is not as good as ours in point of efficiency, in spite leges. I do not want honourable members to think that I am opposing the establishment of a Military College. One of my first acts on assuming office was to take steps to obtain one.",48
377,Dr WILSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Then why does the honourable member oppose the insertion of these provisions ?,48
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I ' have not said that I do. I merely wish to have them amended, as they must be, to be .of any service. As they stand they are unworkable. 1 do not object to making provision for the institution of a Military College. Indeed, the principal Act provides thatThe Governor General may establish an institution for the purposes of imparting education in the various branches of naval and military science, and in the subjects connected with the naval and military professions, and for qualifying persons for the naval or military service.",48
379,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The Act says ""may""; the proposed new part says "" shall,"" which is a. very different thing. After six years nothing has been done in the - way of establishing a Military College.",48
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"A requirement such as the honourable member wishes to set up would be unsuitable for Australia. He proposes that every officer shall go to the college to receive instruction. That would not be possible. The college would be located in, say, the Federal Capital.",48
381,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Onl y those who wished to If we qualify for promotion to the rank of major would have to go to the college.,48
382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member makes the passing of the college course a condition to. thepromotion of very officers. To pass that course they must go through the college.,48
383,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"There will be only 200. majors. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - In the beginning, the Australian Military College must be more or less peripatetic. We shall have to take some of our instructions to our officers.",48
384,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"And , no doubt, the present officers will appoint themselvesto the responsible positions of instructors.",48
385,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,We have officers fitted to do the work of instruction.,48
386,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I suppose they have advised the Minister that they are so qualified. Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - My honourable friend seems to think that no one in the Defence Service knows anything. In that of their col- he is quite wrong.,48
387,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I have never said that. The honourable member's own officers would lie the first to admit that the Instructional Staff is not fullv qualified.,48
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,There are some excellent officers in the Defence Service.,48
389,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That is quite true.,48
390,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"On e of the best of them, whose brilliancy my honourable friend would be the first to admit, is today engaged in considering proposals for the establishment of a college j but after three months' study of the question he is not ready to formulate proposals. Yet honourable members seem to think that the whole matter can be settled in half an hour.",48
391,Mr AGAR WYNNE,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Would the Minister wait three months, if the enemy were at the gates?",49
392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I do not understand the bearing of the interjection. I am speaking of the difficulty of inaugurating a college which will be efficient, and will""work on right lines. That is a matter of supreme moment. I desire to establish an efficient college; but we must have regard to the conditions of Australia and the circumstances under which our citizen officers must do their work - It would not be wise to prescribe rigidly in an Act of Parliament the lines on which the College must be run.",49
393,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The proposed new sections would allow the Department to prescribe the lines on which the college must be run.,49
394,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"No ; they would only allow the Department to prescribe the Standards which miust be observed. My criticism of the proposal is that the honourable member prescribes the machinery to be used, which is not yet possible. In all else I am in agreement with him. X believe with him that we should set a high educational standard for our officers. But the Department must be allowed to shape the machinery of instruction according to the contingencies which may arise.",49
395,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,What amendments would the Minister suggest?,49
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"In the first place, I think it unwise to provide that the staff shall consist of not fewer than four Assistant Directors.",49
397,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I have accepted a suggestion from the honourable member for Hindmarsh in regard to that matter.,49
398,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"My suggestion is that the Assistant Directors should be such as the Minister may prescribe. As to proposed new section 148, I think it would be wise to leave out the reference to a permanent field artillery battery. The Department may well be left to deal with that matter, especially in view of the fact that, at the beginning, at any rate, the college staff must travel. The purposes which the honourable member has in view will be defeated if he insists that all the officers in Australia shall be dragged to one centre to be trained. There must be the greatest elasticity in the working of the college. I see nothing to cavil at in proposed new section 149. All the members of the Administrative and Instructional Staff should be fully qualified officers. As to proposed new section 150, does not the honourable member think that it gives the man who has plenty of leisure an advantage over the man who has not?",49
399,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The man wlio will have most difficulty in getting time to go to the college is the man who has a big business lo look after.,49
400,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I am speaking of men of leisure.,49
401,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"There are so few in Australia that they do not count.  of men who have leisure and brains, too, it will be all the, better for the Commonwealth.",49
402,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The proposed new section will handicap the man who has not leisure, but who has brains. I doubt whether it will be possible to give effect to those numbered 150 and 151, as they stand. In my opinion, 152 contains a very unfair proposal. In regard to persons in any other walk of life such a proposal would not be made.",49
403,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Does the honourable memberwish to make the Defence Service an as v lum?,49
404,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"It will be agreed that in the Old Country the standards of efficiency are at least equal to ours. But when a measure was passed requiring colliery managers to obtain certificates of efficiency, it was provided that those already in existence should be given certificates, so that they might retain their positions.",49
405,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,They were making their living as collierv managers.,49
406,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The officers of the Department are making their living by soldiering.,49
407,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,A man who is managing a colliery is thereby proving his ability to do so.,49
408,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The assumption seems to be that those who are performing the duties of military officers in Australia are more or less incompetent. Some of the I est officers we have are not likely to pass technical examinations easily. This provision should be made more elastic.,49
409,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Does the Minister suggest that we should prescribe efficiency for newcomers and allow the existing staff of officers to remain inefficient?,50
410,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That is a delicate question to answer. It assumes inefficiency on the part of the existing officers..,50
411,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,We can have no guarantee that they are efficient until they have proved themselves to be so.,50
412,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I would not submit some of the best officers in the service to a technical examination.,50
413,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Then the honourable member would show favouritism. There has been a good deal of that in the past.,50
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member places too much emphasis on the value of technical examinations so far as the present officers are concerned. If proposed new section 152 were rigidly applied, it would rule out, or keep down, officers who are thoroughly efficient-good , practical soldiers who cannot be expected to begin their schooling again. Mr. KELLY - It would only keep back those who could not get a certificate of their fitness for the rank which they hold. Dt. WILSON - Withi n a period of two vears !",50
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,It is not easy for a man of forty-five to qualify to pass examinations.,50
416,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The Minister could prescribe practical examinations for the officers whom he has in mind.,50
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I retort upon my honourable friend that in doing so J should be making, unfair ""distinctions.",50
418,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"How would it do to confine the provision to the permanent officers ? Mr .JOSEPH COOK - I should not object to that. If these provisions are made too rigid, it will be difficult for some years to come to officer our Citizen Forces.",50
419,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That is a serious statement to make.,50
420,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Yes ; but it is my duty to make it. I do not object to the setting of the very highest educational standard for officers; but there should be elasticity in provisions such as these. I ask the honourable member not to make it impossible for us to officer our new forces by making the machinery of education and examination too rigid.,50
421,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Hindmarsh) [9.18]. - I agree with the Minister that the proposals of the honourable member for Wentworth need amending, but the honourable member is to be commended for having brought them forward. I am astonished that the Minister, after expressing a desire - to establish a college, has put so many difficulties in the way. Why is there a sum on the Estimates for the establishment of a Military College, if it cannot be used ?'",50
422,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I have not said that.,50
423,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member said that there would be the greatest difficulty in getting officers to go to the proposed college. Not to have a Military College would be like allowing our educational system to be without training colleges for teachers.,50
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I am taking steps to provide for the establishment of a college.,50
425,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"We should begin with a college in which to train instructors to be sent all over the Commonwealth. School teachers - are trained in this way, and are required to pass pretty stiff examinations. I agree with the Minister that there should not be a strict limitation regarding the staff of the college. There must be a good Director, and he must have under him a thoroughly qualified staff. I would leave' it to the Director and the Department to say how the staff should be formed. The honourable member for Wentworth proposes that we shall have a permanent battery attached to the college. A permanent battery will become an absolute necessity under the proposed organization, not only in one State, but in two or three, if not more. A permanent batterv, properly horsed, could be obtained for less than. the present cadre system costs. If this amendment is carried, the Military College will be established at one or other of the large centres of population in the Commonwealth, and there will be a battery attached to it.",50
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,All this is being done. I have decided to abolish the cadre and to put the money into two extra batteries.,50
427,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Then what is the difficulty? At the present time, officers are sent from one State to another to attend the instructional schools. If we can send a hundred officers from one State to another at the present time to receive instruction, we could send just as easily a thousand officers to a Military College. No difficulty was expeiienced in sending a number of officers from Adelaide to Sydney to attend the instructional school there, and, under the compulsory system, it will be still easier to make arrangements for officers to attend a Military College. I was surprised to hear the Minister talk of the unfairness of proposed new section 152. Under it, not one of our existing officers will be deprived of his present rank if , within two years, he is able to produce a certificate of fitness from the Director of the Military College. I am glad that it provides that that certificate shall be scribed.",50
428,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That gives the elasticity for which the Minister asks.,51
429,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Quite so. An officer might have a thorough practical knowledge of his work, but, as the Minister said, might be unable, owing to the fact that he had been away from school for many years, to pass a rigid examination such as young officers would be compelled to pass. But the honourable member for Wentworth provides for such a contingency, and if an officer cannot pass a fairly easy theoretical examination, he is not fit to hold his position. We are proposing compulsory training, not because we desire to have all over Australia a show force, but because we believe"" that there is, in the near future, a probability of danger to Australia. If that danger is at hand, the sooner we get rid of officers who cannot pass a prescribed examination the better. Subject to one or two alterations, I shall support the proposals made by the honourable member for Wentworth, who, I think, is to be commended for having brought them forward. The Minister has shown no reason why they should not be substantial! v adopted.",51
430,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Wilmot) [9.25] The honourable member for Wentworth is to be commended for having submitted these proposals to the Committee, and I trust that, even if they do not meet with the approval of tha Minister as they stand, he will yet see his way to incorporate in the Bill the principles for which they provide. The general principle of the amendment is in keeping with the tone of the Bill. It will make, in the first place, for efficiency. An efficient force might be led into disaster by inefficient officers; but, under these proposals, provision will be made for adequate instruction. Another feature of the amendment which appeals to me is that it makes room for merit to come to the front. We ought to have a college where our officers can be thoroughly trained, and we should have, in connection with it, the best instructional ability that can be obtained. If the Minister extends sympathetic, treatment to this amendment, I am sure that he will give satisfaction, not only to the Committee, but to the people of Australia generally. One of the objections to the present system is that a number of senior officers are doing work that they were never trained to do. An officer who has devoted his attention to one as predepartment of military science may be found controlling a totally different branch, and in this way a number of promising and hard-working officers are precluded from securing promotion. The Bill provides for the training of the rank and file, and by the establishment of a Military College we-shall be able to properly train our officers, and so bring about a military organization the officers and men in which will have the fullest confidence in each other.",51

434,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Wentworth) [9.34] - The Committee would perhaps regard it as an advantage to give effect to the Minister's proposition, but in such a way as not to still further delay the establishment of a Military College. I do not wish to use the word "" may "" if it can possibly be avoided. The principal Act provides that a Military College "" may "" be established, but, although that Act was passed some years ago, the college is not yet in existence. I wish to make it clear that it is the desire of the Committee that a college shall be established at the earliest possible moment, and I therefore ask leave to amend my amendment by omitting the words "" The Governor General shall establish,"" and inserting in lieu thereof the words ""There shall 'be established.""

Unless we this provision definite, the "" may "" busition ness will probably continue for another five or six years, and the time of Parliapetition. ment will again be occupied in considering such a proposal. Ministerial promises made in connection with Bills in Committee are of a varied character. The remarks made by the Minister of Defence did not go far in the direction of showing that he approved of the proposed new section, although, as it came from his own side, seemed rather afraid to offer it an outquite and-out opposition. If it is amended as ferently. the honourable gentleman suggests, our time will have been wasted. The need for eduone cating our officers is manifest in every direction.",52
436,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The Minister said that provision was made on the Estimates for establishing a college.,52
437,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Provisio n has been made on the Estimates for many things for years past, but Ministers are always afraid to spend the money. The Minister of Defence is forced to admit the need for improvement in this direction. knows that certain officers hold posiand tions who cannot pass the examinations proposed, and while I have no desire be harsh in dealing with them, it seems rather hard that the whole of the Defence Forces should continue to suffer because there happen to be in high positions tain officers who ought never to have been there, and who have never attempted to quality themselves for their posts. Whilst we have a number of excellent officers, there is, nevertheless, a number holding office for no other reason than that, at particular juncture, they had influence with the Minister of the day, or moved in certain social circles. When an honourable member suggests that there should be educational standard in the future, it our duty to support him, and not to permit the Minister, by any such subtle proposal as he has made, to so affect the proposed new section as to cause its operation farcical.",52
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,We will see what the honourable member will do when all this It is has been fixed up.,52
439,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The Minister ought no colnot to be so offensive in tone.,52

When an honourable he member opposite makes a suggestion, it is clear that the Minister can act difThroughout this debate there has been manifested by the Opposition but desire, and that is to improve the Bill. That desire ought not to be met in the way in which the Mini.ster has received it. I am anxious that this Bill shall leave the House in as perfect a condition as honourable members can make it, and I am satisfied that if we adopt the Minister's suggestion that the word "" may "" be substituted for the word "" shall"" merely because the word "" shall "" will, it is said, be offensive in certain quarters, no educational military institute will be established. He On the contrary, we shall go on as before, officers will be appointed to positions that they are not qualified to fill.

444,Mr THOMAS BROWN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Calare) [9.41]. cer- - I support the honourable member for Wentworth's proposal, because its tendency will be to secure greater efficiency in our Defence Forces. Objection may be taken Ui the stringency of the conditions that the honourable member would lay down, but I a understand that all he desires is the establishment of a college on a basis that will make it efficient and effective. He has simply indicated those conditions because they an appeal to him as achieving that end. I is was surprised to hear the Minister say that the conditions could not be brought into operation in the Commonwealth. The Minister seems to think that it will be difficult to be to secure competent men to take charge of the college. If the Minister is correctlyadvised in that respect, it shows a lamentable state of affairs, and the sooner the Defence Department look outside of Australia for qualified men the better it will be for the whole service. But I believe that competent and capable men can be obtained here. Whilst I desire to secure efficiency, I do not believe in decrying the capabilities of Australians, and I wish to give our own men a fair opportunity to prove themselves. If the state of affairs indicated by the ter exists today, there is no reason why it should continue. I believe that the young - Australian will speedily qualify himself if given training and opportunity. If the Minister cannot find young Australians to take these positions now, that difficulty will soon disappear if he carries out the scheme of the honourable member for Wentworth. With respect to the peripatetic college that the Minister speaks of, I can quite understand the advantage of giving instruction, but I cannot conceive of a college worthy of the name being a moving affair.",52
445,Mr KELLV,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,He is going to have an instructor and call it a college.,53
446,Mr THOMAS BROWN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"It is very desirable to send an instructor to different parts of the Commonwealth, but the Minister's idea is to constitute that instructor the college. The honourable member for Wentworth has something very different in view. Probably he will not object to instructors being sent around as adjuncts to the college, but he wishes to see a properly equipped establishment created. I support the honourable member in that view because whilst practical knowledge is indispensable, there is also room for theoretical training, ancl if this college is to serve its purpose, it must impart both practical ancl theoretical instruction. As the honourable member for Dalley very properly pointed out, officers! ' after passing examinations wilt have to take up active work, and deal with human documents. They will have to know how to handle men- a knowledge which will not be gained by mere theoretical training. I wish to impress upon the Minister that what the Committee want is not a college in name, but a college in reality. I am sure the honourable member for Wentworth is prepared to give the Minister a maximum amount of elasticity in the scheme, but he does not desire to give it so much elasticity that nothing at all will be done. Present conditions show the absolute necessity for the great departure which is now proposed. We train the rank and file, but do not insist on corresponding training for those who have control of them.",53
447,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,This House is playing a new regimental march now.,53
448,Mr THOMAS BROWN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I hope it will play it effectively, and no longer enact legislative ideas without useful results following from them. It is time this House Minisbegan to march towards something practical. We have hitherto taken it for granted that the higher officers possess the requisite knowledge and efficiency to qualify them for their positions, and one of the weak points of the Defence Service has been the fact that the men have known more about their duties than"" the officers who are supposed to instruct and lead them. That sort of thing does not encourage a spirit of loyalty or respect towards those holding important positions. Another weakness of the forces hitherto has lain in the fact that to be an officer gives a certain amount of social standing, and a number of men with means have endeavoured to secure those positions, perhaps with the laudable desire to assist in defence matters, but also for the sake of the social status .which accompanies them. The result has been a close class preserve with respect to military promotions in a number of the higher grades. The essential condition for promotion in-many cases, when men have endeavoured to qualify as officers, has not been ability, or a knowledge of the duties, or capacity to handle men, but the possession of sufficient wealth to discharge the duties of the social side of the position. Men without wealth who have endeavoured in the past to secure promotion have been denied it for that reason. In the earlier days in New South Wales a young man who had a most brilliant career at college, and I believe at the University, chose a military career and secured an appointment in the Defence Service. But, unfortunatelv. his parents were not wealthy and he could not command the money that was supposed to be essential for entrance to the higher ranks. He was boycotted, his life was made miserable, and the result of the odium cast upon him because he happened to be a poor brilliant man was a tragedy.",53
449,Mr STORRER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Will a college prevent that?,53
450,Mr THOMAS BROWN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I am advocating it because I believe that it will be one of the means for preventing that kind of thing, and that men with brains and ability will be able to pass through the college and obtain positions, while the without brains and ability and perseverance, but with only the recommendation cash in his pocket, will be no longer top dog in the service. If we get a Defence Bill. Force on that basis, it will be a credit to us. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will come down from the pedestal which he has mounted, and agree to the proposal the honourable member for Wentworth. I trust the result will be something substantial in the shape of a Military College that help merit to get to the front, and give chance that it has never had before.",53

The whole scheme will be inadequate without having as centre some college of this character-no peripatetic one as has been suggested, but one established with facilities to give struction to those who possess capacity brains, and to enable them to secure positions in which they can be of service their countiy. I hope and believe that we University. have within the Commonwealth young men who will show themselves as capable to positions of command as any men from countries.

There seems to be a very small line dividing the Minister's position from proposition put before the Chair by the honourable member for Wentworth. It is difficult to draft on the floor of chamber amendments for important posals of this character. But the ister having expressed himself as favourable to the establishment of a college, and ing intimated that he has already taken steps to provide for that being done, extraordinary that he should resist these proposals. It has been suggested that, though he will not come down at once, will come down gradually. If our Citizen Forces are to be what we hope they will be, we must provide for the education the officers who are to control and instruct man them. If the Minister will undertake to accept and redraft the proposals, better of hard progress will be made.",54

As he has recognised the need for a Military College, will I hope that he will accept the proposals it a as a direction from the Committee that such an institution should be established without delay. The Bill has been generously supported, and the establishment of as a well-equipped instructional Military College, which will turn out officers possessing the proper qualifications, seems essential to the success of the scheme of defence for and for which it provides.",54
454,Mr STORRER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Bass) [10.4] - I am the sorry to have to differ from many honourable members in reference to the proposed establishment of a Military College. Notits withstanding what has been said by the t a honourable member for Calare, it seems to me that a poor lad at a college of this kind inmight be quite as uncomfortable as was the and person to whom he referred. Mi. THOMAS BROWN - There are plenty to of poor men going through the Sydney",54
455,Mr STORRER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Have honourable take members considered what the proposed colother lege would cost? The honourable member we for Hindmarsh suggested that 1,000 officers could be brought to a central college that and trained; but how are we going to I apknow that in the past some of our officeris have not been as competent or as diligent as they should have been, but we have the had many intelligent officers, who twere as good as any we shall have in the future. I cannot understand why they should be the spoken of with disparagement. If the honproorable member for Wentworth had anyMinthing to do with it, the proposed college would be located in Sydney, and officers havwould be brought from all parts of Australia to be trained there. The arrangeit is ment would be a good one for youths whose parents were in a position to give althem an expensive education, but men who he had their living to earn could not be expected to give up the time necessary for a course at the colloge. In my opinion, of it would be wrong for us to shut the door to promotion on men who, as volunteers and militiamen, have done good work in the past, but who cannot spare time for a college'training. I hope that the Minister will be more firm in his opposition to the proposed new section. Six of our officers are now receiving instruction in India, and there are others away in. England. Surely that method of training is sufficient at present. It will be a good thing to have instructional officers travelling from State to State. The Minister has told us that for three months past an officer has been engaged in considering how this work can be best done. It is strange that, if the establishment of a Military College is necessary, none of the Minister's predecessors thought of establishing one. In my opinion, the proposed college would be a very expensive institution, from which the Commonwealth would get very little. The Bill as it stands will be sufficient for the present day. Under it the Minister will be able to provide for the instruction of the officers in the States in which they are serving, instead of having to compel them to go to Sydney, where they would have to be maintained at great expense to the taxpayers.",54
456,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"North Sydney) [10.9] - I agree as to the need for a Military College, but I am not prepared to accept the proposals of the honourable member for Wentworth in globo. In some directions they do not go far enough, while in others they go too far. The honourable member does not go far enough, inasmuch as he does not provide that all positions above the rank of colonel shall be filled by members of this Parliament. The possession of intimate, and, indeed, superior, knowledge of military matters which has been displayed by some speakers in the debates on the Bill, accompanied as it was by serious reflections on nearly all our present officers, would, if these reflections are sustained, seem to entitle honourable members to the higher positions in the service. We are asked to commit ourselves to a scheme which the honourable member has elaborated pretty fully, but about the cost of which he has said very little. If the Minister proposed a series of amendments like these, the Committee would expect full particulars as to cost. We should want to know to what we were being asked to commit ourselves, and the necessity for doing what was proposed.",55
457,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The Minister has admitted the need for a Military College. [175],55
458,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Neithe r he nor the honourable member has said anything about the cost.,55
459,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The need is the first consideration.,55
460,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"A time will come when cost will be the first consideration. That time will come very quickly, if we adopt every suggestion that is made to us. We are being asked to commit ourselves to a fairly complete scheme. The honourable member wishes us to provide that there shall be a college. A college will not be established any the sooner because the word "" shall"" is used. - Mr Glynn - There "" shall "" be an Inter-State Commission.",55
461,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member's interjection illustrates my meaning. Not only are we asked to say that there*shall be a Military College; we are also asked to say that it shall have a certain staff, that there shall be a battery and permanent units for instructional purposes, and that there shall be. examinations for appointments and promotion. The nature of the examinations for the ranks above those of captain and major are prescribed.",55
462,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,No ; it is left to be prescribed by the Minister.,55
463,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The details are to be prescribed; but we are asked to commit ourselves, without being supplied with sufficient information, or being apprised of what is being done in other parts of the world, to a course of practical and theoretical instruction, and the nature of the examinations which are to follow is prescribed. The Minister would be treating the Committee improperly if he sprung such amendments upon it, and did not inform us as to the probable cost of the proposal. We should, moreover, expect from him a statement as to the best, most effective, and most economical system in force in other countries. Officers now in the service who within two years cannot pass examinations, are not to retain their present rank. Mr KELLY.;-It is only proposed that they shall obtain certificates of fitness.",55
464,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,From the Director of the Military College.,55
465,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Nothin g is said about the passing of examinations. Their fitness is to be ascertained as prescribed. That matter is left to the Minister.,55
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,No ; to the Director of the Military College.,55
467,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The word examination is not used in the clause referred to. Mi. DUGALD THOMSON - This is an instance of the .insufficient knowledge which we possess of what is intended. The passing of examinations is referred to in previous clauses as proof of fitness, and how is the Director to ascertain the fitness of the present officers unless he examines them? Those who pass the prescribed examinations are to have seniority over those who do not. That provision applies to the present officers. Provision is also made for the giving of pay and allowances; but we have no information as to what that will amount to. I am in favour of the establishment of a Military College of some sort. One of our great deficiencies at the present time is the lack of opportunities for the instruction of officers. I shall support any measure for supplying the deficiency if I feel that the probable cost will not be more than we are justified in incurring.",55
468,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,There is already a sum on the Estimates.,56
469,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,That is so. I do not blame the honourable member for Wentworth for having brought forward these proposals; but it is too much to ask the Committee to accept them without further information. They will involve considerable expenditure.,56
470,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,How does the honourable member know that?,56
471,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I wish to know, and the Committee ought to be informed, what the probable cost will be. The honourable member gave us no estimate of cost. I give him credit for the way in which the clauses have been framed. The scheme seems very complete; but I do not know enough about it to accept it as being the best that could be devised. The supporters of the Government especially should be satisfied with the statement of the Minister as to what he is prepared to do in this matter. He is prepared to accept even the mandatory provision in regard to the establishment of a Military College, and I do not think that the honourable member for Wentworth, or any other Government supporter, should try to force upon the Minister something that he is not prepared to accept in the absence of the necessary information.",56
472,Mr WILKS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member says that we should obey the Minister.,56
473,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I have not said anything of the kind. I am simply pointing out that this is a far-reaching proposal, and that we have no information as to what it will cost, as to what systems are in force in other countries, or as to which of them we should imitate. In the circumstances, therefore, surely it is enough for the Minister of Defence to commit himself to the establishment of the college, and to say that we shall have a further opportunity of considering the precise scheme to be adopted.",56
474,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Does not the honourable member .think that we ought to consider it before we pass this Bill?,56
475,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Not the precise scheme to be adopted in regard to the Military College. The honourable member for Hindmarsh supports this amendment, although, earliei in the day, he submitted an amendment providing that promotions in the Citizen Forces to the ranks of officer and non-commissioned officer should be from those who have served in the ranks of the Citizen Forces, and that the competitive examinations should be of a practical character, no written work being demanded other than of the nature required for the rank concerned in the field and in the ordinary exercise of duties.",56
476,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Is that inconsistent with the proposal now before us?,56
477,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member proposes that officers shall' not continue to hold their present positions unless theirfitnessis declared.,56
478,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Officer s who hold field rank. Proposed new section 152 applies only to field officers.,56
479,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"It applies, at all events, to officers.",56
480,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Not to all officers, as the honourable member endeavoured to show.",56
481,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I did not ; endeavour to do so. I said that it applied to officers, and it certainly does. It proposes that officers shall be dealt with more drastically than the honourable member for Hindmarsh desires.",56
482,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I said that old officers should not be dealt with drastically, so far as theoretical examinations were concerned.",56
483,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I admit that. I think that those who, like myself, are in favour of a Military College, should be satisfied with the Minister's offer. I am convinced that the use of the word "" shall "" will have no effect, but beyond that, I am against our committing ourselves to a scheme, the effect of which we do not know.  why is the honourable member making such a noise about it?",56
484,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I am not.  ber cracking the whip?,57
485,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"If any one makes a noise in this House, it is the honourable member; and as for cracking the whip, I have only .to say that I do not wield it.  whip to the honourable member. He is not game to use it himself.",57
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I have not spoken to the honourable member about the matter.,57
487,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The Minister did not suggest that I should speak; and, in view of the assurance which he has given the Committee, surely it is better that we should not commit ourselves to posals which, in the long run, may not be found to be the most suitable.",57
488,Mr STORRER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, I desire to ask whether the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wentworth is in order ? Is it competent for an honourable member to make a proposal which will mean increased expenditure, and, consequently, an increase in the burden of taxation.?",57
489,The CHAIRMAN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I have no knowledge of any increase of expenditure in connection with the proposed new section, and I rule that it is in order. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [10.29] - The Committee is indebted to the honourable member for North Sydney, who has had the courage to endeavour to persuade the Committee to pursue ordinary business lines; and, before pledging itself to the establishment of a Military College, to ascertain what it will cost. A Military College will be a very expensive show. The maintenance of West Point, which is about thirty or thirty-five miles from New York, involves an annual expenditure of many thousands of pounds. West Point is an establishment for the production of snobs, bluffers, ancl cads. All over the western States of America, young officers from West Point draw a strict line of demarcation between their men and themselves. They have introduced into the United States the caste of the Brit.'sh Army. Here, it is proposed to provide for directors, assistant directors, captains, generals, and a lot of high-toned gilt-spurred roosters. During the American War, a young officer complained that whilst he was walking with his young lady at Winchester, Virginia, some of the country lads in the Army had failed to salute him. A court-martial was held, and when it was explained that the officer was in private dress and was not recognised by the men, the reply was made, "" The officers shall parade before the men for an hour PRch day, so that they may be known to them."" Men like Grant .and ""Stonewall ' Jaek-1 son, did not descend to the caddishness and snobbery that is associated with West Point today; they were the sons of poor men from the western States. Why should we adopt this proposal, just as we went in for the bounty system, without ascertaining what it is going to cost the country ? We were returned to do something to benefit the people; and, unless we are careful, the country will become so top-heavy with taxation that property-owners will be sold up, pro- lock, stock, and barrel, in order that military caste, which will be a menace to the nation, may be maintained. The money that we shall waste on powder and smoke, as well as on the proposed college, would be sufficient to place thousands of men on the land, and to enable them to increase the production of the country. It is time that a protest was entered against the way in which this House is involving the people in extravagant and unnecessary expenditure. I am afraid that honourable members will need an army to protect them from indignant taxpayers, if they go on as they are doing.",57
490,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Would the honourable member start to build a ship, and then refuse to provide it with engines? That is what we should be doing, if, after providing for compulsory training, we refused to establish a Military College for the training of the officers. M.r. KING O'MALLEY - We want to encourage farms, not fighting machines.",57
491,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"That is logical; but if we start to make a fighting machine we must see that it is efficient. Mr KING O'MALLEY - This proposal means the beginning of a military caste, and the creation of a condition of affairs in which private citizens will have to salute the soldier on horseback. In Austria and Germany today a private citizen is nobody; a soldier is everybody. We are going now to introduce into Australia a system which has pauperized Europe. In England, where militarism has prevailed for centuries, there are 7,000,000 unemployed. The military system has been a plague to Europe; and I fail to see why it should be introduced into Australia. If Canada had had troops along her frontier and warships on her lakes, she would have been lost to England long ago. It is because of the absence of fighting men along her frontier that there is no danger of trouble between United States and Canada. Japan had wars ever since she went in for a naval and military system, and every nation Europe that has had recourse to militarism has had to fight. It will be the same with Australia. As honourable members are bent on evil and extravagance, I suppose no one can stop them from rushing, Niagara-like, ro their own destruction.",57
492,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Robertson) lishment [10.40] - The time is coming when we shall have to establish a military school, but will be long before any Government will be justified in agreeing to a scheme forward for the purpose by a private memshould ber. Any such scheme must come from responsible Minister, who has about him competent men to advise him. The honorI able member for Wentworth provides all sorts of curious qualifications in the scheme as laid down by the person who has given him instructions. I cannot suppose that would presume to know anything about at military matters himself.",58
493,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member almost as jealous of me as he is of the orable member for Brisbane.,58
494,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I believe the honourable member is priggish enough to think that he knows something of military matters.,58
495,Dr WILSON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member is grosslv insulting.,58
496,The CHAIRMAN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I ask the honourable member for Robertson to withdraw that mark.,58
497,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Certainly , if is offensive. The honourable member for Wentworth belongs to the class of men to whose presence in the service he objects, and any information that he has to impart must be second-hand. It is to be hoped that when this House is called upon consider the establishment of a Military carry messages. College, a Bill will be drafted by a responsible Minister upon the information of men who are capable of directing him. the Minister himself brought down a prorest? posal without consulting his officers, he would probably fail, because he is not. does not profess to be, a military expert. is only an innocent person, who knows thing about the matter, that would presume to draft four or five clauses, for the establishment of a college, and lay down what the qualifications of the men in that college should be. The honourable member for Wentworth does not know that a great deal of valuable instruction is at present the imparted at ihe Sydney University, and has that schools are established through which educated young men have to pass before in 'hey are qualified for admission. Those qualifications are quite sufficient far our present service, and quite as much as our finances will stand. The Government would not deserve to remain in office for twenty four hours if they accepted from any private member a draft scheme for the estabof a Military College. I admire thu .Minister of Defence for the amount of it contempt that he has shown for the proposals of a man who is absolutely unaware put of the way in which a Military College be conducted. I do not suppose the a honourable member for Wentworth has seen even the outside of such an institution, and am certain that he has read nothing about the subject. Let honourable members read the qualifications which he has set out for a captain. Under his scheme, an incompetent he person, a man who has had no instruction all, may be a captain of a military force, and under certain conditions may take the is rank of major. The thing is farcicai. honThere is no place under this scheme for such men as Hector MCDonald.",58
498,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,O r Colonel Foxton.,58
499,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I do not know that gentleman's qualifications for the position of colonel. I do not know that he ever passed an examination to obtain that office, but it is very indecent to bring his name into the discussion. Personally, I should renot obtrude him on the Committee as a military officer of any account. Some one it has remarked that he is an aide-de-camp to the Governor General, but that means little or nothing. He may be one of the gentlemen who would be qualified under the honourable member for Wentworth's scheme to be a major. He may be fit to to be an aide-de-camp, who has only to",58
500,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"What does the honorI f able member think of ""Colonel"" For",58
501,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I must conand trast the modesty of the right honourable It member for Swan with the demeanour of nothe honourable member for Wentworth. When the former was Minister of Defence and brought down a Bill, he was so desirous of making it acceptable to the military experts of the House that he made overtures to an honourable member of the Opposition, perhaps one of the ablest men in our service today, and accepted important suggestions from him, and those were admitted to be the .best part of the Bill. That is the difference between a man who knows his business and a man who does not. The man who has the responsibility will take the advice of those who are competent to advise him, but it is absurd to ask the Committee to follow a person who is incompetent in everything, and sets up to be a military director and the drafter of a Defence Bill.",58
502,Mr FRAZER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Will the honourable member find out what the Minister intends to do with these proposed new sections?,59
503,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"If the Minister has accepted them on the advice of a private member, I shall vote against him, but I am certain that I shall not be called upon to do so, because the Minister is a man of mature judgment. He has been pulling the legs of a number of the "" mili-' tary experts "" of the House all yesterday and today, and by doing so has been able to get his Bill through in less time than any other Defence Minister has required for the sarnie task. He has done that simply by tickling those gentlemen. I understand that the Government will have nothing to do with these proposals. At some future time they may find it necessary to establish a Military College, but that time is not vet.",59
504,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Wentworth) [10.50] - It would be very ungrateful for me to devote more than a passing reference to the eulogy which the honourable member for Robertson has just passed upon me. I am afraid the honourable member has against me two grounds of complaint, both of which are thoroughly justified. In the first place, I know nothing myself about military matters, and confess that I have to obtain my knowledge elsewhere, and in the second place, as the honourable member puts it, that I have had the unwarrantable impudence to put my name at the head of a series of amendments. If I could get the benefit of the honourable member's erudite mind and wide experience I should let him! place even the name of "" Henry Willis "" at the top of this sheet, so long as I was sure that I was doing the right thing in having him on my side. I have heard the honourable member ask whether any one in this Parliament had ever heard the name of one of our most distinguished members - the honourable member for Brisbane-because he had the misfortune to be selected to go to England in place of my honourable friend. He has on several occasions indicted other honourable members-equall y as warmly as he indicted me just now-for putting forward schemes involving large financial responsibilities, because he had not the extreme good fortune to originate those ideas in his own intelligence. It would be as ungrateful of me to pay further attention to his remarks as it was ungrateful of him to treat me in the way he has just done, seeing that I have been his warmest friend and most unctuous admirer ever since I have been in this Chamber. I have recognised his capacity for every high office that has ever been before this Parliament, and have myself advocated his claims not only for the position of general officer commanding the Australian Forces, or envoy plenipotentiary on - behalf of the Commonwealth in defence matters, but also as High Commissioner in the United Kingdom. The honourable member for North Sydney offered one criticism which was fair, but elaborated it far more than was necessary, unless the question is regarded as a party one, which I should very much regret. He referred to the question of cost. It is impossible for a private member to explain to Parliament the complete cost of a proposal, but so far as I have been able to obtain information, the cost of the professorial staff, in salaries, and so on, of the college would amount to about ,£5,000 per annum. Of course, that does not include the cost of the building, or the transfers, etc., of student officers.",59
505,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,It would be only t a small modicum of the total cost.,59
506,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"It would be, but until we have some chance of making our militia officers truly efficient, this Bill is so much waste paper as a scheme for Australian defence.",59
507,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I quite agree with the honourable member.',59
508,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Then , why cannot the Minister accept, if not this proposition, any reasonable modification of it?",59
509,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I told the honourable member that we were hard at work carrying this idea out.,59
510,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I think the Minister admits that the training of our militia officers is a matter of supreme importance. He made a statement to the effect that it would be impossible for the existing militia officers of Australia, to a number sufficient to keep the organization going, to obtain from the Director of this establishment, as prescribed by the Minister himself, certificates of their fitness for the ranks which they are holding. Such a statement will shock the Commonwealth as soon as it is understood. It means that we cannot depend upon our militia officers of the higher grades to do anything mote than lead their men into a shambles if the time of trial ever comes.",59
511,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,It means nothing of the kind.,60
512,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,- If it does not mean that I cannot understand the King's English. I would suggest to the Minister the advisability of reporting progress.,60
513,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Le t us get through.,60
514,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,If is not reasonable lo try to push through a matter of this kind when the Minister has himself admitted the urgency of a fair discussion of it. A number of honourable members have gone away not expecting it to come to a head to-night.,60
515,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I told everybody that I should try to get it disposed of.,60
516,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,What honourable members who favour this proposal were so informed by the Minister? He did not tell me so until this moment. Surely I am entitled to at least as much consideration and courtesy as other honourable members. Is this being made a party matter?,60
517,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,-This is not quite the honourable member's form.,60
518,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I have not often been treated in the same way. Mr FRAZE» - What is the Minister going to do?,60
519,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I have told the Committee plainly what I shall do.

521,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Wentworth) [ i 1.2] - The words to which the Minister refers amount to a direction that the Assistant Directors shall be specialists. Without them, it would be possible to appoint an officer who had passed through a garrison school of gunnery as an Assistant Director of field gunnery work, in regard to which he would not be an expert My desire is to obtain qualified instructors for each branch.",60

All the experts, including those to whom my honourable friend pays the greatest deference, and whom. 1 dare say he has consulted, agree that the instructional officers must travel.

548,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Will the honourable member believe me when I tell him that have not consulted an officer near me, save one, in regard to this matter, and that one whom I have consulted is very favormaking able to this proposal? It is a pity that the honourable member cannot be fair.",62
549,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I am endeavouring fair. Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - The honourable member is making all sorts of allegations.,62
550,The CHAIRMAN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I must call the ment, Minister to order. He will tunity to reply.",62
551,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,I assure the honourable gentleman that I have no desire to be unfair.,62
552,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member is making allegations that are I grossly unfair.,62
553,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The whole burden of sole the remarks made by the Minister and honourable member for North Sydney, who of method. cracked the Ministerial whip so successout fully, was that the combined intelligence of the Department had declared that this system-was not practicable.. We are now to understand that the combined intellition gence of the Department has not been consulted ; that only one officer coming into close contact with the Minister has been consulted.",62
554,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Agai n a misrepresentation. Mi. KELLY - It is certainly not a. misrepresentation of a statement to which I think I have every right to take some,62
555,Mr JCSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Indee d it is.,62
556,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I can assure my honourable friend that I am not differing with him for the mere sake of differing. I rebegard the training of officers as the most important feature of the defence of Australia. To create a force and to neglect to train the officers who will command it is like building a ship and failing to engine it. Surely the - honourable gentleman recognises that there is something on more to be done than training a few levies. Indeed, they cannot be trained we have proper instructional officers, and cannot be led into action unless the; have efficient officers to lead them. If the a Minister is not prepared to accept my proposal, I hope the Committee will divide on the question, so that the country may know may who does and who does not wish to see our Defence Forces capably led, efficiently instructed, and well-officered.",62
557,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"ParramattaI Minister of Defence) [11.28] - For the last fifteen minutes, the honourable member the for Wentworth has been doing nothing but imputations unworthy of him and of the subject under discussion. I tell him again that I have not consulted my officers to be regarding this matter.",62
558,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"We were told, not by the honourable member, but by another honourable member sitting behind the Governa little earlier this evening, that they have an opporhad been consulted.",62
559,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I made no such statement. I have said that a Military College is already in process of creation, and I am so impressed with the necessity for giving this instruction to the officers that do not think it is possible to concentrate it in one central institution. That is my point of difference with the honourable the member, and it is, after all, only one My proposal will carry the honourable member's object far more effectively than his can possibly do. That is the only reason why I suggest it. I want to give the officers all the instrucpossible, and I desire to make it more easily available to them. The honourable member has made imputations unworthy bf him.",62
560,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,What imputa:ion have I made? The Minister of Defence is losing his head.,63
561,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member is not, I am glad to say. I congratulate him on the absolute command of the Opposition which he seems to possess to-night.",63
562,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,This is surely a non-party measure.,63
563,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"It is, so far as this side is concerned. Mr '.KELLY - The whip was crackiing pretty hard this evening.",63
564,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Settin g aside all that, I tell the honourable member candidly that he will be well advised in his own interests, in adopting my suggestion. I am seeking .to help him to achieve his object in a practicable, workable way. That is all I desire, and I ask him to take the experience of the Department.",63
565,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,But the honourable member says that he bas not consulted the Department.,63
566,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"What I have told the honourable member in regard to this proposal is correct. I have not consulted the officers of the Department, so far as this proposition is concerned j but as the honourable member has been told half-a-dozen times to-night, I have been consulting with my officers for three months with regard to the establishment of a Military College. Is there anything inconsistent in the two statements? My honourable friend ought to stop this paltry pointmay ing ; it does not help the discussion in the least. The honourable member is treating me very unfairly. I am trying to put his proposals into working shape, yet I am given credit for every motive save that which I have. I think that I have a right to complain of the honourable member's treatment of me in connection with this matter. I suggest to him a course by which his proposal can be carried out effectively. We cannot take all our officers to one central college. Australia is an immense continent, and it would cost an enormous sum to carry out the project in the way the honourable member suggests. I should not object to the expenditure if the course proposed by the honourable member were the only practicable one; but I do not think it is, and I supjgest to him a means of achieving his object, which, while saving expense, will be equally efficacious. I am leaving the whole matter in the hands of the Director, whom he suggests should have control of the college. I propose to give him the power to prescribe, the examinations, and to see that they, are faithfully carried out.. So long as that is guaranteed, what more does the honourable member want?",63
567,Mr KELLY,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member is suggesting, I think, that the Director should take the place of the Examination Board.",63
568,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I am endeavouring to meet a geographical difficulty; I do not wish to water - down the examinations. On the contrary, I desire that they shall be as stiff as we can possibly make> them, consistent with our obtaining the requisite officers. I suggest to the honourable member that he accept my amendment. It will make his scheme workable, having regard to the vast continent over which our officers are spread.",63
569,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Adelaide) [11.33] - . May I respectfully point out that at present it is the practice to take officers from Queensland and Western Australia to the scliools of instruction' at Sydney, so that geographical difficulties are not now being considered.",63
570,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,We are not taking them from Western Australia.,63
571,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"Onl y recently I met an old friend who was travelling from Western Australia to Sydney, to go through a course of instruction at one of the military classes there.",63
572,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"An odd one or two be sent there from Western Australia. Mr ROBERTS' - That is the practice now in regard to all the administrative and instructional officers, and the proposed new section refers only to them. They are'hut few in number.",63
573,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,About 250...,63
574,Mr ROBERTS,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"The number who will requirs to attend the college is scarcely as large as that, more especially as the Minister is not inclined to accept proposed new section 152, which relates to the present officers. I congratulate the honourable member for Wentworth on his evident desire that our officers shall in future be instructed in a practical manner. To have a peripatetic director, with a staff and a lor of paraphernalia, going from State to State, and holding in 'Western Australia probably a different examination from that which he might hold in Queensland, would involve an expenditure almost equal to, if not greater than that which would be incurred in bringing the officers from the various centres to the college. The honourable member for Wentworth's proposal is worthy of serious mnsideration. The Minister has already accepted the proposed new section providing for the establishment of a college. For what purpose is that college to be established? Surely for no greater purpose-than that of educating the Administrative and Instructional Staffs up to the standard essential for the welfare and guidance of our Defence Forces. If the Committee agrees to the suggested amendment of the proposed new section, the whole of the procedure at present adopted, so far as I understand it, will have to be altered. One or two officers may travel all over Australia, and give examinations in certain centres, but 1 firmly believe that we shall obtain greater uniformity and a higher standard of education if all officers are taken to the college. I am not going so fur as the honourable member for'Wentworth does at present by suggesting that every militia officer should be sent to the college for a course ot instruction, although that might be done in the not far distant future. But we ought to demand that our .permanent officers,_ and particularly the Instructional Staff, shall be educated up to a uniform standard in some central place where the work can be carried out most effectively. If we leave all the conditions lo be prescribed we may have in the future the conditions which exist at present, and which are not as satisfactor)' as they ought to be. Mr. JOSEPH COOK ' (ParramattaMinister of Defence) [11.36] - If the honourable member will permit me. to interrupt him, I should like to say that the numbers are not quite so large as I thought they were, and that in the circumstances, I tHink that we may well stretch a point, and adopt the honourable member for Wentworth's proposal. It will mean more expense, but I do not mind that. ' Mr HUTCHISON (Hindmarsh) [11.37]. - The.honorabl e member for North Sydney told us to-night that we ought to have regard to the question of expense in dealing with Ihese proposals - The Minister now says that the question of expense does not concern him.",63
575,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,Onl y so far as this proposed new section is concerned.,64
576,Mr HUTCHISON,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"I wish only to point out that whenever a proposal is made from this side, with which the Government du not agree, we are told by them that we ought to consider the question of expense.",64
577,Mr STORRER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,"On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, I desire to point out that the Minister of Defence has just stated that this proposed new section will mean additional expense. I desire to know whether it is competent for an honourable member to move a proposal which will increase the public expenditure, and in respect of which no message has been received. It has been held before that a private member may not move to increase the burden of taxation, and I fail to understand why the honourable member for Wentworth's amendment should be held to be in order.",64
578,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The increase in expenditure is only incidental. No appropriation is made.,64
579,Mr STORRER,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,But the Minister made the distinct statement that the adoption of this amendment would increase the expenditure.,64
580,The CHAIRMAN,BUILDING OF TORPEDO,The proposed new section does not make any appropriation. Proposed new section agreed to. Progress reported. House adjourned at 11.41 p.m.,64
