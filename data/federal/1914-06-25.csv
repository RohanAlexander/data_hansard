53,Mr GROOM,MEAT EXPORT TRADE,"-The practice which the Commissioner is adopting is not an unusual one.

68,Mr JH CATTS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Cook) [10.54] When my remarks were interrupted last night I was dealing with the unsatisfactory conditions existing in the Treasury. Necessarily I was compelled to be brief in my remarks, but the instances which I then gave appear to be characteristic of the general administration of that Department. I propose to deal with the various Departments in turn. Attorney-General:-This Department is administered by Sir William Irvine. That gentleman is under engagement to the Marconi Company, from whom he holds a retainer. It is well known that the Marconi Company has taken legal action against the Commonwealth Government, contending that the Commonwealth has infringed the company's patents in connection with the inauguration of a system of wireless telegraphy. Large sums of money are involved, yet the services of the Attorney-General are not at the disposal of the Commonwealth in any way in connection with this case. A statement of these facts, which have been admitted on the floor of the House, is a sufficient indictment of the shortcomings of the Government in this connection, and further comment is needless. External Affairs:-This Department is administered by the Hon. P. MCM. Glynn. Although a great deal of criticism can be levelled at this Department, there is one item which I think is overwhelming in its importance. I refer to slavery in Papua. I have the evidence of a Liberal newspaper supporting the Government as to the awful state of affairs existing in that dependency of the Commonwealth. In the Age of the 16th of this month there appears an article with these headings in large type:PAPUAN SLAVERY. MORE REVELATION'S, ADMINISTRATHE UECBUITINA SYSTEM. Natives Kidnapped. AD- It is now over a month since the Age published the first of the revelations concerning OF DIS- cases of undisguised slavery which existed in Papua within the last twelve mouths, and s t i ll the promised oflicial report is not forthcoming. Efforts have been made to minimise the imPRINTING portance of the revelations and to suggest that VOTE-OLD- they related to quite isolated and very exceptional incidents in the life of the territory. Additional information has come to hand which goes to prove that the Australian public has a very great deal yet to learn concerning the ways of a certain class of labour recruiters who have been permitted to operate in Papua under the very noses of the officials resident in outlying districts. This information demonstrates that were it not for the present energetic and fearless administration of the Native Affairs Department the grossest possible injustice would be done to the helpless natives in the inland villages. And the n details are g i v e n Towards the end of 1913 there were at work in a certain division two recruiters. The methods these men adopted were briefly these: They would arrive at a coastal village with a recruiting vessel and a well armed crew. They would land and inarch through the village to another village a few.miles inland. Here the two men, either directly or through interpreters, would tell the "" boys"" that the nearest Government magistrate wanted to see them in the first village, and that it was the natives' duty to go there at once. The natives, much impressed, would obey, and would go to .the first village, only to be informed there that the magistrate was not - in the village, but aboard the vessel they could sec swinging at anchor in the roadstead. Unsuspiciously the poor blacks would go aboard. Directly the last boy had touched the ship's deck the blacks were thrust below, the vessel would sail, and when next the natives saw land they were miles away from their homes, and quite at the mercy of their unscrupulous captors. Other instances are given, which the time at my disposal does not permit me to quote. Then the Age, at the conclusion of this indictment of the Government, says The feature of these, as of many other cases of semi-slavery in Papua, which has such a disquieting aspect, is the silence of the authorities. The investigation into the actions of the two recruiters described above took place nine or ten months ago, but no report has been made. to Parliament on the subject. Parliament and the people of Australia are entitled to know all the material facts concerning the abuses of the Papuan labour recruiting Ordinances which arc the subject of official action. Until the policy of secrecy now reigning in the Department of External Affairs is abandoned, a continuance of public confidence in the administration is impossible. There could be nothing more sweeping than that statement, which is the testimony of a great Liberal newspaper. Those facts are not from some "" tainted "" Labour source.",16
69,Mr BRENNAN,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Hav e not the Governto ment any information concerning these constitute scandalous allegations?,17
70,Mr JH CATTS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Apparentl y they do not wish to give the House and the country any information on the matter. I now propose to quote a remark by a previous Lieutenant-Governor of this Territory, namely, Sir Willia MCGregor. Referring to those who work the plantations in these islands, he saidThey went to New Guinea for their ends, and this fact should never in dealing with the natives of that country. The natives are evidently regarded merely as instruments to be used pursuit of wealth, and it is the duty of to (1) the protecting Government to administer the affairs of the Territory with that pedes fact in mind. The principle which is here responsible for one of the bloodiest wars to (2) of history. The great civil war of America between the North and the South arose reforms over this very question of slavery. Yet the same practice obtains on a smaller recognised scale in a territory of our own. I scandal that the Government have exhibited such ineptitude in this matter that a great Liberal newspaper has deemed it its duty to direct attention to' it , and has declared that the Administration under existing conditions is absolutely impossible. Defence:-This Department is adCockatoo ministered by Senator Millen. There is chaos and muddle in every important that defence activity(a) The Navy. (6) The Military . (c) Works. Dealing with the Navy, I quote a special article which appeared during the current month in the Sydney Morning Herald-anothe r great Liberal which newspaper. If time permitted I might quote that journal with a view to showing the great success with which the Defence Department was administered by Senator Pearce. But the article to which I now desire to direct attention was published in tha* newspaper on 15th June of the present year. It reads„ DEFENCE. CHAOS AT THE NAVY OFFICE, FRICTION AMONGST THE MEMBELLS. Grave Official Delay. Reports have gained currency in political circles during thu past few days with regard the general condition of Defence administration, which, if substantiated, are thought to a public scandal.",17
71,Mr HIOGS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Now I can understand why Mr Wilson Dobbs suggested the use of that prayer in connection with the approaching elections.,17
72,Mr JH CATTS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I would advise m those who read my remarks to turn up in Hansard the speech delivered by the honourable member a day or two ago, and own they will then appreciate the point of be forgotten his interjection. The article proceedsThe most serious statements may be briefly in the summarized as follows :The friction at the Navy Office, similar that which culminated in the dismissal of Captain Hughes-Onslow, still continues, imefficient administration, and has resulted, and still results, in gross delays and chaotio involved was management of naval affairs. There has been a consistent opposition the interests of Cockatoo Island on the Naval Board, which has resulted in necessary being delayed for considerable periods, and in many cases neglected altogether, although the urgent need for them had been long before the Commonwealth took t is a over the control of the dockyard. (3) Vital matters going to the very root of Defence administration, such as war orders despatched by the British Admiralty, which settled the disposition of the Australian Fleet in time of war, did not receive consideration confidence in for several months. (4) The Commonwealth does not possess in its service a single officer, either on the Naval Board or occupying subordinate positions outside Island, who has had any experience at all of modern naval work, and it is feared if similar delays which accompanied the appointment of Mr King Salter as general manager of Cockatoo Island, take place in strengthening the technical side of the Navy Office, an even greater waste of public money may be occasioned. This has special reference to the organization of Naval Bases, which is propose to now to be taken in hand. (5) No steps have been taken, as was contemplated, to strengthen the Naval Board, now comprises two officers who have had no modern naval experience at all, either ashore or afloat, and one officer whose experience has been entirely afloat. No member of the Board or any of its officials have had "" Admiralty "" experience. The application to the Admiralty for the services of an officer of high standing, with experience on naval works, has for some reason been withdrawn. Melbourne Punch, another Liberal newspaper, in its last issue, I think, states that the withdrawal of this offer by the British Admiralty is due to the bungling that has taken place in the administration of the Department by the present Minister. The Sydney Morning Herald continues!(C) Mr Manisty, who alone of the members of the Board had had Admiralty experience, was permitted to leave Australia last March at the expiration of the term for which he was appointed at a critical period in the development of the Navy without even being asked to wait till his successor in the secretaryship of the Naval Board was appointed, in order that the duties of the office might be personally explained. No successor of Mr. Manisty as finance member of the Board has yet been appointed, although he left Australia three months ago. The article is too long for me to quote in extenso. What I have already read summarizes the complaints against the Department. On the 18th June of the presentyear Punch deals with the same question. That organ, it must be remembered, occupies in the Liberal world of Victoria a somewhat similar position to that which is occupied by the Bulletin in New South Wales. This is what it saysThat waste and inefficiency have characterized naval administration during the last twelve months has been patent to every observer. Since the arrival of the battleship, the maladministration has amounted to a public scandal, l t is now so serious that thu Liberal party newspapers are shocked into dismay. It may be, of course, that Senator Millen went to the Navy Office at a difficult moment. The Fleet was coming, a strong Commander-inChief was arriving, the Naval Board was weak and split in twain, and the money bill was becoming heavy. A decrepid dockyard had just been taken - over, by the Commonwealth from a State Government, that thanked its stars that it had been able to shift its bugbear on to a simple-minded, trusting purchaser. And, worse of all, Senator Millen was new to the game, and was harassed with work at the military branch. But it should have been within the power of this "" reform "" Minister, this Titan of business methods, who scoffed at past administration, and promised to show us all what a magnificent organizer he was, to get things adjusted in twelve months. He has had money, time, every expert assistance he has asked for, and an obedient and able staff. But he has made the worse possible muddle out of his difficulties. . . . Naval Base work has been neglected, except where it has furnished opportunity for a party political attack; and Cockatoo Docks have beon allowed to drift into a worse mess than they were in when Senator Pearce bought them for £870,000. Disorganization exists in the administrative branch and dissatisfaction iii the service. Could anything be more sweeping than the criticism which this Liberal newspaper has felt itself compelled to launch at the Minister of Defence ? I do not think so. A f t e r some months of the control of this Department by Senator Millen there was a report published by Sir Ian Hamilton as follows: The centralization in. the Defence Department at Melbourne exceeds anything I have experienced during more than forty years' service in India, in the United Kingdom, and in every part of the world where troops, administeredby the British War Office, are stationed. . . It is on financial grounds that the present mass of petty questions, which, in a wellordered business, would be dealt with locally, are now referred from districts to headquarters. This is a report by one of the greatest experts in the service of the British Empire. Then we have a statement as to the labour difficulties at the Cockatoo Island Dock. This great reform Minister, Senator Millen, has sought to introduce piece-work in this establishment; and in last week's newspapers there was a notice to the effect that there is to be a reduction in the wages of the artisans by, I think, 3d. an hour. This has caused general commotion; and Senator Millen has now arrived at the conclusion that it is impossible to carry on the administration without going back on this phase of his foolishness and having a conference with the representatives of the Labour organizations to seek their aid in making it a success. In the Sydney Morning Herald of the 16th June the following appears: Senator Millen is, however, grappling with the difficult problem of remedying the defects at Cockatoo Island, in spite of his other preoccupations. After conferring with the general manager of the dockyard, Mr J. King Salter, the Minister will carry out his intention of conferring with representatives of the men employed at Cockatoo Tsland, with a view of obtaining their co-operation in finding a solution of the labour difficulties at the dockyard. The problem before the Minister is threefold:-(1 ) The appointment of some common industrial tribunal (if possible, Federal in its scope) which can deal with the various labour difficulties that occur from time to time; (2) the supply of the present serious deficiency in labour which is delaying the work; (3) the adoption of some form of piece-work. The methods of this anti-Labour Government have caused confusion at the dockyard; and Senator Millen has practically had to go down on his knees and invite the Labour organizations to join with him in finding a solution of the difficulties and bringing the management to some sort of success.",17
73,Mr HIGGS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,He does show a grain of intelligence in doing that!,19
74,Mr JH CATTS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Yes ; he has got things into a hopeless muddle, and is now compelled to retrace his steps. On the military side, there was a great camp at Liverpool last year under the control of this Minister, and a special board was set up by him, and instructed to investigate the work then done. instructions were as follows: COUKT OF INQUIRY re LIVERPOOL CAMP. In dealing with this report, I desire that the Military Board should include a recommendation as to what immediate action should be taken with regard to all the officers who are shown by this report to have failed in their duty. Also, what should be done to remedy the defects and weaknesses shown to have existed in the system of administration and command. The result of the investigation is summarized on page 21 of the report as follows : As far as this battalion-is concerned, it may be said that-Saturday and Sunday were wasted, owing to defective ordnance administration. Monday and Tuesday were worse than wasted, owing to bad brigade arrangements. Wednesday, to a great extent, was devoted to resting the men. Thursday gave them two hours ten minutes' useful training and some instructive marching. Friday's work was spoilt by marching them in trying weather before any training was attempted. Saturday spoilt, to a great extent, the good effect of anything that had been learnt during the camp. So far as the 14th Infantry are concerned, this camp was a waste of time and money. This is a report by a committee set up by ' the Department, and it testifies to the in eptitude, incapacity, and bungling under this so-called reform Minister. This Government has introduced novel regulations and instructions regarding labour on public works to get r i d of the contractor, and in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 6th June an instance is given of the success of the Government's adminstrationA DAY-LABOUR JOB. Members of the local rifle club are incensed at the Department paying £71 to carry out work at the local rifle range which the club offered to do for £45. The work was left in a most unsatisfactory condition Department has now promised to send up a man to complete the work to satisfaction, but by the time it is completed the cost will be fully £100. Thus we find that a job which those connected with the local rifle range offered to do for £ 4 5 will, under the bungling of the Minister, cost £ 1 0 0 , or more than double.",19
75,Mr MASSYGREENE,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,The extract read by the honourable member shows that the Minister knew nothing about the matter.,19
76,Mr JH CATTS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The Minister knew nothing of the particular instance, but what was done was under regulations The which the Minister issued. Area Oflicers:- I now desire to show SUBJECT: how area oflicers are being deluded. These men were promised that their pay should be increased from £ 1 5 0 to £ 1 8 0 per annum. The arrangement was that the money had to be placed on last year's Estimates, but that was not done; and now the Government has issued regulation No. 55, of 1914. I have not time to read the regulation, and shall simply give its E. D. MILLEN. effect. The increment, it appears, is to be given only after oflicers have served three years, and then on the recommendation of their superior oflicer. It should be remembered that the services of almost all the area oflicers commenced at the beginning of 1911, and, therefore, the regulation cannot take effect in any case u n t i l after the end of this year, and then, as I say, only on the recommendation of the superior oflicer. What does this mean ? It means that the Government have promised the increase of £ 3 0 , but have left their successors to pay it . Did we ever hear of such a lovely scheme of financing? This is the way in which the Government fools the area oflicers. Customs Department: - The Customs Department is administered by the honourable L . E. Groom, and the supineness and ineptitude of the management is well known from one end of Australia to the other. The Government are responsible: I again bring great Liberal newspapers into the witness-box to testify to their .bungling and chaotic administration. The Age on 15th June this year contained the following: From the moment it took office until it Quirindi, Friday. secured its double dissolution it has declined to give a Parliament which is crowded with Protectionists the slightest opportunity 'of rectifying our Tariff, which everybody knows to be full of flaws, and an utterly ineffective The instrument of Protection. Now, however, that an election has been precipitated, and the people's day of power is dawning, there is a sudden and tremendous change, and the Minister of Customs, who ignored anomalies for. more than a year, and a bare month ago thought it highly "" improper "" for any one to seek to expedite the work of the Commission, eagerly assures us that progress reports will be forthcoming next session, and "" definitely "" commits his Government to deal with anomalies as soon as the new Parliament meets. And in referring to this matter on the following day, the Age saidRecognising that the Tariff must be one of the main issues, the Ministerial party has been giving close attention to that subject. . . . The revised policy of the party is now to legis- Wynne, who is a most late immediately on Tariff anomalies, *a list of - which, it is said, has been compiled by the Department. The rectification of these anomalies will be independent of any report from the Inter-State Commission. Moreover, the Commission is now to furnish progress reports, so that the Government may be able to deal with the exclusively Protectionist incidence in the Tariff. We are to go to an election with this in eptitude in this Department-it is a matter of common knowledge to the publi<5and when there are a considerable number of our workmen unemployed, unable to obtain employment probably because this Government neglected to do its duty in regard to several outstanding instances of "" b l a c k "" goods driving our own manufactures out of our own markets. During the last twelve months the Department should have been put to its full usefulness to the country. done nothing. A j i d now we are told that Ministers are going to do something in the future.",19
77,Mr HIGGS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"They promised rectification - of anomalies, but they will not define what an anomaly is.",20
78,Mr JH CATTS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"They promised it , but they .are in such a state of uncertainty that they are unable to make up their minds on anything positive. They have adopted the same old Conservative attitude of men who will only do something constructive when popular clamour will, np longer tolerate the neglect of national interests. Consequently there is stagnation in this great Department that should exist for the development and progress of the great industries of the country. Home Affairs:-This Department is administered by the E i g h t Hon. Joseph Cook, assisted by his humorous understudy, Mr W. H. Kelly. Electoral Branch, working under the direction of these Ministers, has produced a condition of affairs that is discreditable in the extreme. details and proof, based on Liberal admissions, were given by me yesterday, and may be seen on reference to the Hansard report of my speech of yesterday, and therefore need not be repeated. Otlier honourable members of the Opposition have amply substantiated the charge. The rottenness of the administration of the Electoral Branch has been proved up to the hilt. Postal Department:-This service is administered by the Hon. Agar estimable gentleman, but whose control, owing to the limitations imposed upon him by the Government, has not been a success. I now come to another quotation from a Liberal newspaper bearing on the administration of this Department. I could say these things, and more, myself, but if I give th© testimony of Liberal newspapers as to the administration of their own Ministers, it will be more effective. The Melbourne Punch, of 25th June, 1914-that is today's issue-o n page 1099, saysMr Wynne says that he is tired of the Post Office. There has never been such a Department. It has broken Minister after Minister, and it is as far away from organization as ever. It helped to break the health of Mr. Austin Chapman; it disgusted Sir John Quick of public life; it left Mr Frazer sapless after eighteen months of office; it sent Mr Thomas It has scurrying away to External Affairs; it hurt Mr Tom Ewing, and Mr Mahon and Senator Findley; and it stays on-the Commonwealth old man of the sea. It has beaten every politician who has tackled it, and none of them could say why. Perhaps it is the result of red tape, or Acts and regulations, or sheer bigness; or, perhaps, it is a case of one man attempting the impossible. The old office goes lumbering along, weighted down with inefficient officers taken over from the States, and waiting for the one great Napoleon of organization who can lift it up to good condition. Mr. Wynne's case proves that without a Napoleon the Post Office needs a board of independent governors. Eailway Departments would be just as much the despair of Parliaments and people if politicians were allowed to govern them also. But the point is that the Government were heralded in as the great business Administration. It was said that they were going to organize everything, and bring about economy in the Commonwealth Departments, and efficiency in the administration of the affairs of the ComThe monwealth. But her© is the testimony of a Liberal newspaper, an enthusiastic supporter of the present Government, which states that the administration of the Full Postal Department has been an utter failure. I have no desire to direct my criticism towards the honourable gentleman in charge of the Department personally. I believe that he is absolutely the best of this bunch of Ministers, and that he stands head and shoulders over any of his colleagues as a business administrator, but, even in this case, the very best manthe Government could chooseso lacking are they in material-ha s so administered his Department that it is now stated that disorganization is rife in it , and that the Government have failed to meet the situation effectively. The sum total of inefficiency and tude of this Government is alarming. Notwithstanding that all the great Liberal newspapers of the country had their well organized and highly paid staffs watching day after day for the three years that the Labour party were in office in order to try to find something on which to criticise the administration of Departments, there were none of the charges and evidences of incompetency such as are now proclaimed throughout the land. These things are so undeniable that these great Liberal newspapers are compelled by the facts that cannot be hushed up, quieted, or subdued, to bear witness to such an aggregation of administrative bungling, as has not appeared before in this country. It was my desire to deal with another matter which affects the Government as a whole, and in which they have combined their collective wisdom, or lack of wisdom",20
79,Mr HIGGS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Ineptitud e would be the better word.,21
80,Mr JH CATTS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Perhaps it would be. Their collective incompetence appears to have brought them into a more sorry mess in matters in which they have acted in concert than even the bungling that has occurred in the separate Departments. I now refer to the way in which they have bungled the questions arising out of our Constitution in connection with the double dissolution, and the refusal to allow the people of this country to express an opinion on the proposed Constitution alterations, which have been twice passed by the Senate in this Parliament. However, the time ab my disposal will not permit of my dealing with this item as it should be dealt with if touched upon at all , and therefore I am compelled to leave it . I can only say that the Government, without a constructive programme, Conservative in the treme, with the weight of sins which oppresses them, and, with the mess they have made of the administration of the Departments, testified to throughout the length and breadth of Australia, will certainly get their deserts when they appear before the people. I trust the electors will take special steps to see that their names are on the rolls. I am absolutely confident that if the whole of the people of Australia are given an opportunity to express their opinion on the Government programme and administrainepti- tion, the promises they made beforo being intrusted with the control of affairs, the insincerity which has characterized them, the absence of any attempt to give effect to their promises, and their general bungling, which is in evidence all round, this second Fusion will suffer the fate which was meted out in 1910 to the first. I feel sure that there will be a regular debacle, that these worn-out politicians, these has-beens, these gentlemen who are living on their past reputations, stripped of any qualities which could be of use to the people of this country in these enlightened days, will meet their Waterloo on the day of the people's supremacy, and that at r u l y democratic, progressive, constructive Labour Administration will take their place on the seats of power and authority in the Commonwealth.",21
81,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Ballarat) [11.33]. - I have frequently mentioned in this chamber the inspection charges made by the Western Australian Government on potatoes coming from other States. I first mentioned it last year, and was told that the Minister would consider it .",21
82,Mr GROOM,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The last reply I gave was that the Commonwealth and State officers were engaged in going into the whole of the inspection charges, and I am expecting a report daily from the West!",21
83,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The matter is too serious for delay. Last season the potato-growers had an absolute failure so far as prices were concerned; and this year they are not much better off. I understand that potatoes are bringing a fair l y high price in the West, but our growers are practically prohibited from sending their produce there. The Western Australian Government are evading the section of the Constitution ex- which says that there shall be Free Trade between, the States. They have been imposing an inspection fee of 15s. a ton.",21
84,Sir JOHN FOKKEST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"You r Labour Government, I suppose?",22
85,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,It was put on by the Liberal Government.,22
86,Mr GROOM,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"It was put on last year by the present Administration. previous Government had a different regulation respecting the inspection of potatoes, but Mr Bath repealed it. I saw him about the matter when he was in Melbourne recently, and he promised to give it serious consideration. I have received intimation that the whole of the figures are being gone into, and I think the honourable member will find that relief will be given.",22
87,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The whole trouble arose through the rascality of one or two exporters of potatoes in Victoria. While potatoes were 15s. a ton here, and much dearer in the West, it was clearly proved that an inspector in the employ of the Victorian Government acted in collusion with a certain exporter. The firm made thousands of pounds by getting potatoes which came from districts where blight was prevalent, at 15s. a ton, putting them into other bags on which, with this officer's connivance, the Government brand was put, and exporting them to the West as potatoes grown in clean districts. The Western Australian Government, in consequence, imposed an inspection fee of 15s. a ton. This matter can be seen in the records of the Victorian Agricultural Department, and the Liberal Government in power in Victoria at the time did not do their duty by prosecuting the inspector, and letting the people know exactly what was going on. I very much regret that Parliament will prorogue with the question at such an indefinite stage. What is to happen if the officers cannot come to an agreement, and the Western Australian Government refuse to reduce the charge? Under section 112 of the Constitution we have power to compel them to do so.",22
88,Mr GROOM,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,The 'honourable member lieve that. will admit that it is fair and proper to allow the Western Australian Governreply from the West. ment first to remedy the difficulty before exercising our powers under the ConAustralian stitution.,22
89,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I admit that.,22
90,Mr GROOM,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"We have asked them to do so, and Mr Bath consented to the Conference which is now being held. think the honourable member will find that as the result some reduction will take place. I cannot anticipate, but Mr Bath approached me in a very fair spirit.",22
91,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"If the matter had only been mentioned for the first time The this session, I could understand that reply being given, but it is nine months now since I brought it under the Minister's notice.",22
92,Mr GROOM,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The difficulty was to get information from the West, but when Mr Bath came over I saw him personally.",22
93,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The matter is of such importance to the potato-growers that I am surprised that the Government, who profess to be the friends of the farmers, have allowed it to lie dormant so long. I am glad that a Conference has been called, but if no agreement is come to, the potato-growers of Victoria will have lost this season's market in the West before Parliament meeto again. Action ought to be taken immediately, because many growers who cannot find a market for their potatoesmay be turned off their farms. Victoria is free from the blight now, and there is practically no disease amongst our potatoes,, so that it seems a great pity that the residents of the mining districts of the West should be paying such high pricesfor potatoes, while our Bungaree potatoes are selling at 70s. per ton.",22
94,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"They are not paying a very high price. When we have any to sell, we cannot get any price for them.",22
95,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I am talking afcout good potatoes. The potatoes grown in the West cannot be compared with those we grow at Bungaree, in Victoria. If the Minister of Trade and Customs will give me an assurance that he will treat the matter as one of urgency",22

101,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I admit it, but it I was threatened in a previous case, and even the threat had an immediate effect upon the Government in question. I trust that the Government will recognise even at this late hour the serious position confronting the potato-growers of Victoria in finding a market for their produce. I understand that the Tasmanian Labour Government propose to test the validity of these inspection charges, and I think thab the Federal Government should assist them. the Attorney-General was asked the other day whether assistance would be given, his answer was, "" No ; leave it to the in dividual. "" But this is rather a big matteifor the individual to take into Court.",22

103,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"V e r y well; I leave it at that. I hope that the action which is being taken will have the desired result, and that finality in the matter will be reached before the end of this month, as it will be impossible for this Parliament to take further action if the M in ister's anticipations are not realized. The responsibility will rest upon the Minister of Trade and Customs if this season the potato-growers are unable to secure a market for their potatoes.",23

Mr Mahon"" - The Treasurer's habit is to make personal attacks on opponents and then claim that he never resorts to personalities. As an instance, he said on one occasion, quite gratuitously, that if I walked down the streets of Perth I would be absolutely unknown. My retort, which I think was apropos, was that some persons were too well known, and that I had never been chased out of Kalgoorlie by 30,000 infuriated diggers. Of course the right honourable gentleman was f u r i ously indignant that I should recall a well-known incident which is embalmed in history. Getting back to the point, I want some assurance of an opportunity to consider the private business on the paper. Honourable members do not come here as children and put motions on the paper that have to be printed day after day at the expense of the country without a sincere intention that they shall be considered by the House. Some attention should be paid to their wishes in the matter. In Great Britain at the present moment public opinion and feeling in Australia is being outrageously misrepresented by a certain globe-trotter who has a place in the House of Lords. I refer honourable to E a r l Grey, who wishes to involve AusHis tralia in an enormous expenditure to establish some Empire structure in London, although we have ample accommodation there already.",24

Anyhow, I shall strive to secure it . There is ample time available for private members' business and for settling the issues depending upon the appeals from the decisions of Mr Speaker - It is right that you, sir, on resuming the chair, as perhaps you may, after the election of the new Parliament, should be fortified with the knowledge that your decisions have received the approval of the House, or otherwise. I am glad to see that the Attorney-General has come into the chamber.",24
137,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"He has not long to remain, but anything the honourable gentleman has to say he will be glad to hear.",24
138,Mr MAHON,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I wish to say how pleased the honourable gentleman must be at the honours which have recently fallen thick upon him "" as autumn leaves in Vallombrosa."" Not only has his scheme to bring about a double dissolution been crowned with success, but a mark of high favour has been conferred upon him by His Majesty the K in g . There is no doubt that the honourable gentleman has earned that distinction quite as well as have some, who already enjoy it . I congratulate him on his accession to such distinguished company as that of Sir Robert Best and Sir Thomas Ewing, not to speak of another who has also received a title. In connection with the latter an anecdote is current which shows the sort of person considered worthy of these distinctions. In Papua lately one of the most heroic feats in exploration ever recorded was performed by a Government officer named Ryan. Had Ryan's valour been exhibited on the field of battle i stead of amidst the rapids of a remote Papuan river, he would most assuredly have been rewarded with the Victoria Cross. When the story of his gallant exploit was modestly submitted by Ryan to this official, now happily retired to private life, what was his comment? Naturally one would have expected a word of commendation of the splendid feat and of the gallantry with which, at the imminent risk of his own life, Ryan - himsel f seriously wounded-saved lives of his little party of native policemen. What, I say, was the official comment? Absolutely not a word of praise, but merely an intimation that Mr Ryan's typewriter "" evidently wanted a new ribbon."" And this individual is selected for Imperial honour while Ryan, the man of heroic action, is passed over! The Attorney-General no doubt feels happy that his name will appear in Burke and Debrett; yet I have a lingering doubt whether the ancestor to whom he sometimes refers with justifiable pride would, if in the flesh, share his feeling. For that ancestor, I may say, in passing, the race to which I belong cherishes a reverence and affection which inclines it to look leniently over many things that otherwise would have its condemnation. A f t e r his recent achievements we must regard the Attorney-General as a great political architect, but he may have ""builded better than he k n e w "" in bringing about this double dissolution. His political ancestors of fifteen or sixteen years ago, when they gave to the Senate its present political power, thought that the Senate would be dominated by the wealth of Australia. They did not imagine for one moment that the Democracy would capture that Chamber. They then "" b u i l d ed better than they knew,"" just as I think it will be found the Governor General's present advisers are doing. My belief is that their advice will eventually react with appalling effect upon the party they represent in this House. Under the Constitution as I read it the Governor General has a certain discretionary power. The section which provides for his guidance by the Federal Executive Council in Executive matters cannot, as the verdant Argus would have the public believe, override those clauses which specifically vest in n - him certain discretion. How can it be contended, for instance, that the discretion conferred by section 128 is to be exercised only by the advice of Ministers. It was put in the Constitution expressly to be exercised independent of such advice. That is obvious, because if you read it otherwise there is no machinery left by which a measure passed twice by the Senate and rejected here can be sent to the people for their decision. Acting upon the advice of his Ministers, the the Governor General hag surrendered absolutely that discretion, and has become for all practical purposes",25
139,Mr SPEAKER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I ask the honourable member not to reflect on the Governor General.,25
140,Mr MAHON,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I did not intend to make any objectionable reference to His Excellency, nor can my remarks be construed as being in any sense derogatory to him ; but it is necessary to my argument that I should point out the effect of his recent decisions.",25
141,Mr HIGGS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,The standing order provides that an honourable member shall not refer irreverently to the Governor General.,25
142,Mr MAHON,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I was about to say that, in order to make my argument clear, it is necessary that I should refer directly to the replies which the Governor General has made to the addresses from the Senate. cellency has undoubtedly surrendered to the Ministry of the day the discretion which the Constitution vests in him in certain circumstances, and has surrendered it under the assumption that in doing so he is obeying a principle of what is called responsible government. There is no occasion even now to reflect in any way upon the representatives of His Majesty in the Commonwealth and the States. As long as the Australian people are satisfied to - put up with imported viceroys I do not know that I , as dual, have any right to complain. We are spending on these gentlemen, and upon the upkeep of Government Houses, at least £100,000 per annum, and if the "" u m p i r e "" - if we may so refer to the Governor General in this connection-is to be merely an animated rubber stamp, whose action is to be absolutely dominated by the Ministry of the day, that Ministry holding office by the very smallest majority, then it is wildly foolish for the people of Australia to go on paying so much to maintai n these gentlemen and their establishments. Mr J. H. CATTS - There is on cord an instance where W . G. Grace appealed to the cricket council against an umpire's decision in regard to the wearing of leggings, and was successful.",25
143,Mr MAHON,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I do not follow cricket or football to any great extent, and therefore am not a great authority on the subject to which the honourable member refers. But I do think that Australia must shortly come to the conclusion that it cannot afford the wild extravagance of spending £100,000 per annum, if not more, on the upkeep of gentlemen who act merely on the invitation or according to the direction of the Ministry of the day. If we want these * functionaries at all , we can get them at a much cheaper rate. We have in our midst men who are quite as capable of applying a rubber stamp or a signature to a Bill as are these gentlemen who are now imported from oversea. The Ministry have therefore given a great i m petus to the movement against imported Governors; and if it becomes, as I think and hope it will, a live issue in the immediate future, then the responsiHis Ex- bilit y rests with them; and there again they "" builded better than they knew."" The threatened - dissolution of Parliament has promoted the origin and circulation of some curious similes by the Government press. According to that veracious print, the Argus, it is quite sacrilegious to call in question the action of the functionary whose fiat is the last word in the matter. Criticism of his act or motives is likened to the violent assaults now so frequent on football umpires. This simile is obviously defective, and shows on the part of its author an indivi- a painful lack of imagination. It seems to me that he would have found a much more effective illustration of the position by drawing on practices not uncommon in another branch of sport. For instance, there are gentlemen in motor cars who do speed trials on the highways and the streets, and derive much enjoyment therefrom. Now I think a completer illustration of the present political deb&cle may be derived from the playful pranks of what is known as "" the motor hog."" We"" know how often he runs people down, and then careers through the night so that his number may not be detected. A juggernaut has struck this Parliament, and the ""hogs"" who steer the re- machine will not permit us to get its number, so that their conduct may be in vestigated before the grand jury of the nation. The honourable member for Calare has posed as an authority on matters in my constituency. I have here a letter, from a witt y friend in Kalgoorlie, from which I should like to read an extract, as it may interest the House, and may enable the honourable member to see himself to some extent as others see him. My correspondent writesI notice by Hansard that the honourable member for Calare has been posing, on the strength of a flying visit, as an authority on wages and conditions of life generally in Kalgoorlie. As a fact, ho had very little opportunity of obtaining a true view of gold-field life, and the 4 "" silvertail"" element, with which he associated himself exclusively, evidently transferred their outlook to the guileless visitor. Anyhow, his remarks excite from the old hands only a smile of derision. By the way, I see that he is loaded with a multiple patronymic-Henr y Robert Maguire Pigott. The two latter names excite reminiscences. They belong to men who achieved great notoriety in their native land. One-Maguire-wa s a patriot, parliamentarian, orator, and historian. The other-Pigott-wa s none of these, though he helped to make hisr tory of a sort. Judging by what I saw of this political medicaster during his stay here. I should say there is immeasurably more of the Pigott than of the Maguire in his composition. I would like to refer to some remarks made by the honourable member for Riverina the other $ay, but as he is not now present, I shall postpone what I have to say until a future occasion. I again appeal to the Government to give an opportunity for the discussion of the business of private members on the notice-paper. For your own satisfaction, Mr Speaker, you should insist on the discussion of the motions dealing with rulings that you have delivered; as none of them are in my name, I can speak impartially regarding them. It would probably tend to your satisfaction if these motions were dealt with, because it would enable you to assure your constituents during the coming conflict that, whatever had appeared in the press or had been said on the platform concerning your decisions, a majority of your fellow members had in dorsed your interpretation of the Standing Orders. I hope that the Treasurer will represent to his colleagues the need for giving opportunity for the discussion of all these motions. As a reference to Hansard will show, the debates which arose when Mr Speaker's decisions were challenged were very exciting, and it is not fair to him, to the House, nor to the country, that the questions which have been raised should be left unsettled. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Issue and application of £3,060,026).",26

146,Mr JH CATTS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"There is no information in the Bill . Why does the Trea-"" surer need £200,000 for an Advance? What will he do with the money? The work of this Parliament is practically finished. During the next three months, while preparations aTe being made for the election, how can be spend nearly a quarter of a million pounds on unforeseen, incidental expenditure ? The relation which contingencies bear to the itemised expenditure is ridiculous. The salaries for the central administrative Naval Force amount to £7,000, and the contingencies to £2,000. How can the Central Naval Office need £2,000 for contingencies? The salaries for the Royal Naval College amount to £4,500 and £3,000 is set down for contingencies. For the Royal Militar y College £4,000 is required for pay and £9,000 for contingencies. Again, under the head of the Northern Territory, for the Administrator's office £6,170 is required for salaries and £15,000 for contingencies.",27

160,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Yes .,28
161,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I desire to refer to the exportation of potatoes from this State to Western Australia. To show the urgency of this matter, and how potato growers in Victoria could be relieved, to 1 might mention that for Bungaree item potatoes growers are getting £ 3 10s. the a ton, whereas in Perth, on the of 16th June, potatoes were quoted at from £ 1 0 to £ 1 3 5s. a ton, showing a difference of at least £ 6 10s. It costs a very few shillings to pay for the carriage of a ton of potatoes to Western Australia. If the omcers can come whereby the in spection charge can be removed, it t is will be of very considerable benefit to both consumers in Western Australia and growers in Victoria. I say desire now to clear up a statement made by the Minister of Trade and Customs. He said that the inspection due of 15s. a was imposed by a Labour Governmisment in Western Australia. That stateright ment is correct, but when honourable understand the conditions are existing prior to that act, they will .we realise that at least the Western Ausi l l tralian Government have dealt much justly with potato-growers in Victoria than did the previous Administrapurtion, known as the Wilson Liberal GoOf vernment. Mr Hogan, member for to Warrenheip in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, has been taking a great in Some months ago our ex-Minister of Agriculture, Mr . perGraham, repudiated the statement that the inspection charge was imposed by a the Labour Government in Western AusOn the 2nd December, 1913, Mr Bath, Minister of Agriculture in Western Australia, wrote to Mr Hogan It was not this Government that introduced the peeling regulations, as these were in force for some time prior to our advent to office, and they not only had the effect of putting up prices to a prohibitive rate to consumers to between £30 and £40 a ton, but had seriously curtailed the consumption. Within a short period after I took up the duties of Minister of Agriculture, I withdrew these peeling regulations, and instituted the system now in force, with the result that there was a very substantial reduction in the retail price of potatoes, and a corresponding increase in the consumption. This you can note from the table contained in the copy of letter attached, which is to be read from the bottom upwards. Our position is that we made the introduction of potatoes much easier, but, at the same time, we found it necessary to insure adequate safeguarding of our potato-growing areas from the introduction of disease. I will deal with that l at e r Prior to the inspection fee of ls. per bag there was a charge for this service of l d . per cwt., though the conditions under which it was deemed advisable to allow potatoes to be introduced here were certainly restrictive. Having due regard to the safety of local producers, it was found necessary, in addition to the inspection fee mentioned, to require that all imported potatoes should be peeled in bond. This acted very detrimentally to shippers in the East, and was the means of enhancing the price of the article here to an almost impossible figure, placing this very necessary item of diet practically outside the reach of the ordinary householder. Recognising this, the Government realized the necessity for some amelioration of the existing conditions. I set out hereunder a comparative statement showing prices ruling in 1911, as against those for 1913. W it h o u t q u o t in g all .the figures, I m a y say that in We s t e r n Australia , on the 2 9 t h J u l y , 1911, potatoes were selling at from 34s. to 40s. per c w t . , but almost i m m e d i at e l y a f t e r Mr B at h altered the peeling regulations, and substitute d the inspection due of Is . per cwt., the price of potatoes f e l l to 14s. per. c w t .

It will be noted that Mr B at h saidWe found it necessary to insure adequate safeguarding of onr potato-growing areas from the introduction of disease. I wish to show tEe tactics some of the commercial toria, and the laxity of the Victorian Government nexion with the export shoulders of the latter today for the action Western Australian Government. honourable members to listen to a most remarkable statement Afr. MCGRATH. toria, which is taken from the Age of the 8th December, 1911By a recent successful coup in potato-dealing a large profit, estimated at £10,000, is alleged to have been secured by a Melbourne firm. That is all I will quote from that particular portion, but I will now show how that £10,000 was madeDuring the brief period the Labour Government were in power in Victoria, I (Mr Hogan) obtained from the Minister of Agriculture (Mr . Plain) the file dealing with the potato scandal, and I found that the case was referred to the police, and that inquiry proved up to the h i lt that a grave scandal had been perpetratedthat a conspiracy had been successfully run in connection with the export of blight-infected potatoes to Western Australia, bearing the Vietorian Government's certilicatc that they were free of blight, and had been grown in blightfree districts-Elmhurs t and Tolmie. Tliere is no nse in mincing matters, and, therefore, J may say that the firm concerned is that of W. H . Maine ancl Company. They are s t ill d o in g business in M e l bourne, I understand. The facts are briefly these: An inspector, employed by the Department of Agriculture, named Sisson, was induced to give certificates that potatoes which had not been grown in the Elmhurst and Tolmie districts, and which he knew had not been grown in those districts, had been grown there, and were free from blight. Accompanied with those certificates, the potatoes were sent to Western Australia, and when they arrived there the Western Australian Government found that they were badly diseased. What else could the Western Australian Government do under sueh circumstances than say, "" We cannot depend on Victorian experts; we must inspect the potatoes ourselves; "" and that is what they did. The firm I have named, during 1911, sent an enormous quantity of potatoes to Western Australia. They were really the only firm that could send potatoes to Western Australia, and the other firms wondered how it was done. Eventually, however, the secret leaked out. It was a significant fact that this inspector, who was dismissed by the Department of Agriculture, is now in the employ of Maine and Company; in fact, lie was really in their employ all the time. . . . I have here an extract from the departmental file, in the Department of Agriculture, showing the quantity of potatoes branded "" T. Bowler, Tolmie,"" forwarded to Melbourne during June, July, and August, 1011, and the quantity shipped during pursued by the same period by Maine and Company, classes in Vicbranded "" T.

Bowler, Tolmie,"" during the same period, of affairs in Vic- amounted to 1,212 bags. That one grower had sent from the district of Tolmie 447 bags of potatoes, and yet Maine and Company had sent to Western Australia 1,212 bags branded with that grower's name, or just about three times as many bags as Bowler had sent to the Melbourne market. Those facts were clearly proved, yet the Agricultural Department took no action except to* dismiss the inspector. officer had entered into a conspiracy with those exporters, and during the time that the blight was prevalent in this State, they were getting potatoes from blight districts, getting the Government brand placed on them as having come from clean districts, and sending them to Western Australia under the name of a particular grower in Tolmie.",28
162,Mr BAMFORD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,What - happened to Maine and Company?,30
163,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"No action has ever been taken. The Labour party obtained control of the Victorian Parliament for about a week, and during that week the Minister of Agriculture looked up the files in the Department; that is why we are in a position to say today that the.se things took place. Naturally, the Western Australian people ore afraid that some of those tricks will be repeated again. If the Minister of Trade and Customs were present, I would suggest that the inspection should not be left to the various States, but should be undertaken by the Federal Government. would not for a moment advocate sending potatoes or any other produce to Western Australia which are likely to introduce disease there. As a safeguard against any such contingency, it is necessary that there should be uniformity of action, that the inspectors should know their duty, and that the Government brand on articles should be a guarantee that such articles werefree from disease.",30
164,Mr BAMFORD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,We want somebody to inspect the inspector.,30
165,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Evidentl y that was so in the case I have mentioned. The Minister of Trade and Customs stated previously that the inspection fees in Western Australia had been imposed by the Labour Government. I have just quoted a letter from Mr Bath, the Minister of Agriculture in Western Australia, in which he shows that prior to the imposition of that fee every potato [96] imported into Western Australia had to be peeled in bond.",30
166,Mr GROOM,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I told the honourable member that.,30
167,Mr MCGRATH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"That precaution raised the price of potatoes to £40 per ton in Western Australia. Immediately the Labour Government come into office The in that State, they rescinded the regulation in regard to peeling in bond, and imposed an inspection fee of 15s. per ton. At once the price of potatoes fell from 40s. per cwt. to 14s. per cwt., which shows, bad though the present regulation is, it is infinitely better than the regulation which obtained prior to the advent of the Labour Government. I have been trying to show honourable members that the Ministry in Western Australia had to do something to prevent the importation of diseased potatoes. If by any chance the present Ministry should come back to power after the elections, I think the question' of the inspection duties being undertaken by the Commonwealth Avill be worthy of their consideration. I hope the Minister of Trade and Customs will see the urgency of this matter in connection with the Conference that is to take place within a. few days, and that some satisfactory arrangement in regard to the inspection of potatoes in Western Australia may be arrived at.

173,Sir JOHN PORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"No ; it is the old system that has been in force from the beginning of the Act. When pensioners 'are admitted to charitable institutions on the order of a magistrate, we pay the institutions 8s. per week for each pensioner. That is the amount which we are required to pay for the maintenance of inmates of these institutions when they are sent there by order of a magistrate. They may, perhaps, be already pensioners, but even if they are not, so long as they are sent there by the order of a magistrate, the Commonwealth has to pay for their maintenance at the rate of 8s. per week.",31

184,Mr GLYNN,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,For farmers or farm workers. - Mr BAMFORD - It is not much use advertising in France.,31
185,Mr GLYNN,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I did not say that we are advertising in France. I said that we are advertising in the northern countries of Europe. In some European countries, as honourable members are aware, a fine is imposed for advertising. Happily, the conditions of many countries, as well as of Great Britain, are improving from the stand-point of labour. In one instance, in the north of England, where 100 or 150 immigrants had been procured last year, only seven agricultural labourers could be obtained this year. Many men there now belong to unions, which have been successful in obtaining for them better conditions than they previously enjoyed. ' Mr FISHER (Wide Bay) [12.33] - I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer two questions-on e having reference to the Commonwealth Bank, and the other to the gold reserve. Dealing with the latter first, I again express my regret that the Treasurer sees fit to keep such an excessive gold reserve against the Australian Note issue at the present time. He has never made a clear and definite statement to this Parliament as to why he does so. His act is unjustifiable, and is against the best experience",31
186,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I do not think so.,31
187,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,And it is absolutely unnecessary.,31
188,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,That is the right honourable member's opinion.,31
189,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The only State in the southern seas, or even in the Dominions, which has had a large experience of a State note issue is Queensland. Its experience of nineteen years conclusively proves that a not less than 25 per cent, gold reserve is ample. The Australian Note issue has never varied to the extent of more than £1,000,000. After reaching £10,000,000 it has shrunk to a little more than £9,000,000. Yet the Treasurer assumes that in some circumstances the variation will be such that he may be immediately faced with a demand for gold to the extent of £2,000,000. The Treasurer could pay £2,000,000 in gold at any moment and still be within the law. There never was such a mistaken policy as that of throwing away probably £50,000 a year.",31
190,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"We could not vest it , anyhow. We will want it immediately.",32
191,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,The Treasurer could invest the money from month to month.,32
192,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,And little for it .,32
193,Mr FALKINER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,How can he invest it from month to month?,32

195,Mr FALKINER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,How ?,32
196,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I lent it to the States.,32
197,Mr FALKINER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"What interest would the right honourable member get by lending it from month to month? Mr FISHER . ^ 1 think three months is a fair term. B ut the money will not be required for a year, and for that period 4 per cent, net can be obtained at the present time. When Treasurer, I obliged States with short-dated loans at the rate of 1 per cent.",32
198,Mr FALKINER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,On e per worth thinking about.,32
199,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I suppose it would be beneath the dignity of the honourable member to help the States in a small way like that.,32

201,Mr HTGGS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The honourable member said that 1 per cent, was not worth thinking about.",32
202,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"But other honourable members think that the public interest is of some importance. Even if the Commonwealth got no interest, it would be better to lend the money, and allow it to be utilized, than, to allow gold to be accumulated in the Treasury in excess of all reasonable requirements.",32
203,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,We have heard all this before.,32

212,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Yes , I suppose that is very nearly so; but the right honourable gentleman said 33 per cent. ' Mr FISHER - Some sixteen cartloads of gold would have to be taken away.",32
213,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,The right honourable gentleman said 33 per cent.,32
214,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I have always said that from 33 per cent, to not less than 25 But per cent, is an ample and suflicient working margin.",32
215,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,We have had no experience of stress.,32
216,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,We have had nineteen years' experience of the system in the North. Sir JOH N FORBEST - But never under - any stress or difficulty.,33
217,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"What period was the most distressing in Australia? - not in 1901-2, when there was the greatest drought ever known here? The Treasurer is totally unreliable when he very well. makes such general statements.",33
218,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I right honourable member is very unrelition able, and I should not like to follow in finance. The riglit honourable gentlefortunate man has had no experience, and yet ho such a f u n d . expresses opinion ex cathedra, as if he knew all about the matter.",33
219,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I admit I have not had great experience.,33
220,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Then why be so dogmatic ?,33
221,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"But I have the adimpression vantage of historical evidence, and experience of others. The Treasurer need not get angry because I have proved him to be erroneous in his stateenacted ment that we have had no experience difficulty and stress. The system was inaugurated in Queensland in 1893, and arena! in 1901-2 there was the most distressful period ever passed through in Australia. The number of, sheep dropped by 50 per cent., and the nation's finances were at the lowest ebb. Taking it that even only £1,000,000 were invested, it would, at the present rate of interest, bring £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 ; but, apparently, the ment can well afford to do without that money, and think nothing of it . Why am I accused of keeping a reserve per cent, during the latter period of the Labour Administration? I d id so because I had promised to do so; and on this side always keep our promises.",33
222,Mr MASSYGREENE,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"In any case, it would not go into revenue, would it ?",33
223,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"No . Evidently the opinion of the honourable member is that if it does not go into revenue, i not matter.",33
224,Mr MASSYGREENE,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,No .,33
225,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"What is the point, then ? If it does not .go into revenue, it goes into a fund that can be used the public interests; and two bodies benefit, namely, the States, who obtain money at a lower rate of interest than that at which they could borrow else? where, and the Commonwealth, which is advantaged to the extent of £40,000. Another point is that the Commonwealth has been borrowing from the Australian Notes Trust Fund aud other trust funds at the 3 i per cent., or, including Was it sinking f u n d , at a cost of 4 per cent.",33
226,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"We get the money for nothing, and I think we do",33
227,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,The Government get thin k the that advantage as the result of legislapassed by the Labour Government. him The right honourable gentleman was in having left handy for him,33
228,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I was thinking about it before the right honourable gentleman came into office; and he must remember that he got a forced loan from the people.,33
229,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The Treasurer is like one of the Georges, who was under the that he "" alone d id it ; "" he of the forgets that the system had been in existence for seventeen years before he wrote a memorandum, and had been in a Parliament of which I was.a of member at the time it passed.",33
230,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,That was a small,33
231,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"It may be of interest that, in addition to the asset in connection with the note, issue, there are accumulated earnings in trust f u n d amounting to £471,000 odd. There would have been a full £500,000 if the Treasurer had exi n ercised what I call reasonable common Governsense in the investment; and such an earning power is of some value. Further, there is greater stability in a State note of 40 issue than in any other issue.",33
232,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The interest, we after deducting expenses, amounted to £301,000 at the beginning of last year.",33
233,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"In June this year it is £471,000 odd, and that is without taking into account the value of the plant and the notes in circulation and in hand, t does which are a very valuable asset.",33
234,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,We get it for nothing; it is all right.,33
235,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I think the Treasurer will admit that we have been fortunate in in securing the services of the man who looks after the printing of the notes.,33
236,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Yes , I thin k so.",33
237,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I have been informed that he is printing the notes a great deal more cheaply than we could have purchased them, and is producing an equally good article.",33
238,Sir JOHN FOEEEST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,And we have the whole under our own control.,34
239,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"That is so. I may mention that every authority that we consulted, without a single exception, was against the notes being printed in Australia; but the late Government decided to have the work done here.",34
240,Mr FALKINER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,A r e we p r in t in the notes Ave inquire now?,34
241,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I think so.,34
242,Mr FALKINER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I think not, because a little while ago we were still issuing notes of the private banks.",34
243,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Why bought those notes, and it would be foolish to throw them away before 'they are used up.",34
244,Mr FALKINER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,But the right honour and able member spoke as though all the printing necessary was being done here now.,34
245,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"So it is, only we do not throw away property that is still useful.",34

249,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Subjec t to the Treamonwealth surer's concurrence, I 'say Yes. If i not, it is because the printer's time has been taken up in the printing of stamps. The approximate £500,000, of which I have spoken, - is an additional reserve against the Australian notes.",34
250,Mr FALKINEE,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,What did all this the public?,34
251,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Nothing . W it h regard to the Commonwealth Bank and tude of the Treasurer towards it there never was a father of an institution that would desire so much to destroy it the right honourable gentleman and his no good. friends.,34

253,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I shall prove it . We have witnessed the spectacle in this Parliament of honourable members rising on the other side to attack the bank and its Governor, his conditions and his actions, without a tittl e of evidence.",34
254,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I have helped the bank a good deal.,34
255,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I hope so, because it is the right honourable gentleman's duty to do so in his present position.

Why then do the Government want cost to do away with the Commonwealth Savings Bank? Why do they want to embarrass these two States by changing the attithe present conditions?,34
258,Mr RODGERS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,If the State Savings Banks have done better it must mean that as the Commonwealth Savings Bank has done,34

We gave them competition, and now they say, "" We want would gain great advantages also. none of it . We do not want competition; we want to be protected against any rivals.

The Labour party have given the people another their own which has prospered,, and honourable members opposite hate it , and hate all connected with it ; but the people have discovered enough now to know that it is, and will continue to be, a permaof nent part of the Commonwealth banking system, as it ought to be. At the 1912 Premiers' Conference I made t h ing proposals: The States to become partners with the monwealth in the Commonwealth Bank(o) By supplying portion of the capital, exceeding one-half; (6) by each State becoming responsible for the liabilities proportion to the capital subscribed by it ; (c) by each State sharing the profits proportion to capital subscribed by it.

After' the Commonwealth Bank has taken over the business of the State Savings the State Government to have first amount which it repays to the Savings Bank in redemption of loans existing when the bank was taken over; also to have first call three-quarters of the amount of deposits State available for investment. In addition to these terms the States were offered representation on a body which should meet from time to timo to consult as to the working of the instithrough tution. I suggested that this body might consist of the Treasurers of the States the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. other words, so far as the Savings - Bank was concerned, I proposed that each State should retain all its current investments, 'and also have first call on three-fourths of any further deposits in that available for investment; and, that as regards the remaining Air.

Each State would get he more than it could ever have by having separate balances, and the Commonwealth At the Premiers' Conference of 1914, the State Premiers, Western Australia, dissenting, made the following offer to the The Commonwealth Bank to withdraw from bank of the Savings Bank business. The States to. allow the deposits now held by the Commonwealth Savings Bank to remaiu on fixed deposit with the Commonwealth Bank, and to become responsible through their Savings Bank or otherwise for the repayment such deposits. States to transact their State banking business with the Commonwealth Bank. The Governor of the Bank submitted the e followfollowing alternative schemeHe proposed to accept the States' offer to Comtransfer their banking business in Australia and London to the Commonwealth Bank; and not offered to hand over to the States 75 per cent, of the increase in depositors' balances for investment in the States for a term of 30 yearn of the Bank in at market rates.

He intimated, however, that he would consider the States becoming partners in the as a Commonwealth Savings Bank, each State to receive half the net' profits made by Bank, the Commonwealth Savings Bank in its call on any business in that State. It is interesting to again recall that the on Treasurers of both Victoria and New in the South Wales intimated in the Conference that their State Savings Banks had done much better since the advent of the Comconsultative monwealth into the business. The Commonwealth Government,the Prime Minister, intimated to the Conference on the same day on which and Mr Miller's proposal was made, that it In accepted the resolution of the Premiers, and was prepared to take the necessary steps to carry the arrangement into effect.

The total amount provided for by this Bill is £754,930, and, with very few exceptions, is for the purpose of continuing or completing works which have already been authorized by Parliament. It is intended that the Bill shall cover the expenditure for three months-July , August and September.",36
262,Mr RILEY,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Hav e you spent all the money voted on the last Estimates?,36
263,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"No . But under the provisions of the Audit Act all expenditure authorized on the last Estimates lapses on the 30th June next. It has already been intimated that it is expected that the new Parliament will assemble about the 5th October, when it will be the duty of the incoming Government-this Government, I suppose-to immediately ask for Supply. Whether I am in office or not, the incoming Government will have my support in getting that Supply, because without it the administration of affairs cannot be carried on. I have always been in favour of assisting the Government in office to that extent. The items of expenditure in the Bill are about a fourth of th© amount provided on the present Estimates. I shall refer to the principal items. There is provision for an expenditure of £75,000 on th© Federal Capital, including provision for water supply, the construction of a weir on the Cotter River, road construction and maintenance, the erection of a power-house and brickmaking. I believe that the weir will be a very fine work. The sit© is a magnificent one, and it will hold a sufficient quantity of water, and good water at that. The power-house is already near-, ing completion, and the brickmaking machinery was being brought up-to-date when I paid a visit to Canberra a little while ago. There is provision for £14,000 for Quarantine, to enable works in connection with the construction of new buildings to be continued. For Naval buildings, £30,000 is provided, and includes provision for the completion of the works now in progress at the Naval College, Jervis Bay. For military defence £40,000 is provided for the erection in the various States of drill halls, mobilization stores, buildings for Aviation Corps, the completion of woollen mills, &c. For Post Office buildings, £80,050 is provided. Of this, £4,000 is to be devoted to wireless stations. The balance will be expended in the various States in the following proportions:New South Wales, £30,000; Victoria, £20,000; Queensland, £5,000; South Australia, £8,000; Western Australia, £12,000; Tasmania, £750; and Northern Territory, £300.",36
264,Mr RILEY,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,There is nothing there for Papua.,36
265,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Papua is an independent country. The sum of , £270,000 is provided for telegraphs and telephones.

In and South Australia numerous works are provided for, a switchboard which will cost £2,500. A sum of £40,000 is provided works at the Naval Bases to meet expenditure in connection in progress at Westernport burn Sound during the months of the next financial year. the construction of the Fleet, £75,000 is provided for labour and material in connection with the building of the cruiser Brisbane and the torpedo Torrens, Swan, and Derwent, now being built at Cockatoo Island. Northern Territory £5,6S0 is to be spent, including expenditure from Pine Creek to boy tin-field, just opened up, and from Stapleton to Daly, and subsidies for the construction roads where land is already leased, £500. The object of the Bill is to allow the works already authorized by last session to be carried I informed the Committee when I introduced the Supply Bill covering the ordinary services, we have been accustomed in the past to pay for these works for a short period out of the Treasurer's Advance, but the practice has been found inconvenient, and has necessitated duly swelling that vote, and, as the result is the same in the end, it seems to me that the time has now arrived, seeing that the expenditure on these works and buildings has grown to such large dimensions, when Ave should have, as was contemplated by the two Bills submitted, one for the ordinary services and one for AA'orks and buildings. I hope that the already supplied in the first Supply - I thank honourable members for their assistance in having it passed-and which I am now giving will be sufficient to enable honourable members to gain a clear view of Avhat the ment intend to do during the first three months of the coming financial That is all I propose to say in regard to Sir John Forrest. signalling the Bill itself, but I intend, and am £10,091; sure that honourable members will exIn pect me to make, a statement regarding the expenditure on New Works and Perth, Buildings.

270,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The honortha.t able member did, but I do not think that he meant it . It was perhaps only a chance observation. The figures that I GoA-ern- am about to give will show that there has been no starving of the Departments on year. the part of the Liberal Administration .

274,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"We shall see directly whether or not the honourable member was correct in the statement he made. To continue my comparison the expenditure on New Works and Buildings out of revenue, let me give following additional itemsOther itemB under the control of the Department of Home Affairs 75,008 Telegraphs, telephones, lines, instruments, switchboards, n respect of the last-named item, there expenditure of £247,357 out of revenue on very urgent in 1912-13. public necessities1912-13. 1913-14. £ £ tory and Port Augusta railway ... 62,619 . 60,500 vVarlike stores, 1912-13. 1913-14. guns, vehicles, £ £ factory equipment, &c. ... 551,895 . 320,500 24,738 I suppose that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will hail with delight the falling off in respect of that item, 90,00 0 though I cannot share his satisfaction1912-13. 1913-14. £ Naval works, machinery, and plant ... 180,865 165,721 Other Defence items 16,060 22,090 Constructionof the Fleet ... 604,397 802,43 2 4,076 3,40 0 Purchase of Defence land (infalling cluded last year under Other Items)... 120,006 works, Trust Account 413,694 15,897 Totals ...£3,536,365 ...£3,540,571 It will thus be seen that there was an increase of only £4,206 in our expenditure Out of revenue on New Works and Buildings as compared with that for that the previous twelve months.

Then, again, last year a sum of £152,319 was paid out of loan account for the purchase of a site for the General Post Office, Perth. The purchase having, been completed, we have not had to pay anything on that account this year.",38
275,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Is it not a fact that that property is bringing in a net return of about 5 per cent. ?,39
276,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I think it is; but when we build the new post-office I do not suppose that it will give us that return.,39
277,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"It is bringing in a net return of 5 per cent, at the present time.",39
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Yes ; it is, I think, well let. On the redemption of South Australian loans, in connection with the Northern Territory and Port Augusta railway, last year £240,899 was expended out of loan, whereas this year we have expended £128,000. On the Pine Creek to Katherine railway last year there was no expenditure out of loan, but this year there has been an expenditure of £4,000, and it is possible that before the end of the month an amount of £123,000 will have to be made available for payment in Loudon. On the Papuan railway, for which a loan was obtained, and which was authorized last session, £16,000 has been spent this year. Another item in the Loan Bill passed session was in respect of land purchased for post-offices. Under that heading we have spent £70,000, whereas nothing was spent during the preceding twelve months. Yet another item in the Loan Bill of last session is that of conduits for telephones, the expenditure in respect of which this year has amounted to £306,000.",39
279,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,That is not a fair comparison. We did the same class of work out of revenue.,39
280,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I have given the late Government credit for that in my figures relating to the expenditure out of revenue.,39
281,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I know that the right honourable member does not wish to be unfair.,39
282,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,That is so. The .expenditure on telephone conduits which we provided for out of loan funds was paid for out of revenue in 1912-13.,39
283,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"We did the work, and paid for it , out of revenue.",39
284,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The total loan expenditure during the year just closing has amounted to £2,109,000, as against £1,189,904, showing an increased expenditure of £919,096. The estimated expenditure for the current year was £2,815,627, after allowing for the amount of £300,000 required for defence sites, which was struck out of the Loan Schedule by the Senate, and subsequently made a charge out of revenue. Of the £300,000 that was thus made a charge on revenue, only £120,000 has been spent. The expenditure from loan this year will be over £706,000 less than was anticipated. The expenditure on the transAustralian railway was expected to be £1,400,000, but it has been only £1,340,000. On the 30th June there will remain £453,000, which the Treasury officials say will be sufficient to carry on the work with vigour until the re-assembling of Parliament; but an additional appropriation from Loan will then be necessary. The funds to which I have referred have been provided by the investment of trust money in Commonwealth inscribed stock. The note fund is the principal source of our loan funds. The Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, the purchase of land in the Federal Capital area, the erection of Commonwealth offices in London, the resumption, last of property in Perth, the redemption of loans, the construction of a railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River, have been paid for with loan money. Speaking on the Loan Bill on 29th October last, I said, in reference to the programme of my honourable friends opposite, that during their three years of office they had outlined a policy of railway construction from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie and from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek which would cost over £10,000,000. I pointed out that they had practically agreed to spend millions on making Naval Bases, on the foundation and embellishment of a Capital City, and on other national works, and I asked whether it would be possible to find the money by direct taxation. I ventured the opinion that it would be impossible, and that, even if possible, it would be unwise and ruinous. It is the general consensus of opinion that railways should be paid for from Loan Funds. We have to carry out, not only the transcontinental railway now in course of construction, but also the north and south transcontinental line. I have urged this Government, and the Queensland Government, that the best way to open up the Northern Territory would be to extend our railway from the Katherine River southwards to, say, Newcastle Waters, and through the Barklay Tableland to Camooweal, where it will join the Queensland railway system, there being only 200 miles of line to construct to extend the Queensland railway from Cloncurry to that point. The 'Queensland Government is making a railway from Rockhampton to Townsville, and within a short time one will be able to travel through the older settled parts of the continent from Fremantle through Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Rockhampton, Towns.ville, and then west through Cloncurry to Camooweal, and so on across the Barklay Tableland to Newcastle Waters and Port Darwin, going through good country all the way. That is a project which I hope will be carried out.",39
285,Mr THOMAS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,What is the difference between the right honourable member's policy and that of the Labour party?,40
286,Sir JOHNFORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I do not know that. If my ideas agree with those of my honourable friend, it shows that two persons can think of the same thing at the same time. This is a great national question, not a party one. We must be careful to construct our railways through the best country, so that they may prove paying concerns, otherwise they will be burdensome. Our railway expenditure in the Northern Territory will probably amount to about £10,000,000. The Leader of the Opposition seems to consider a Naval Base as a work in a different category from other public works. It would be a splendid thing if everything could be paid out of revenue, but in a new country that would not be economical, because; to enable our people to develop the land, we should leave as much money as we can in their pockets. We should be careful not to take fro m them by taxation money that they need for the carrying out of their own projects, which must advance the country in which they live. In my'opinion, it is not necessary to make any difference between one kind of public work and another. My right honourable friend was asked on the 11th of this month whether he was prepared to pay for the construction of Naval Bases by money raised by increased taxation, and he replied "" Yes.""",40
287,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I said nothing about in creased taxation.,40
288,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The remarks to which I refer appear on page 2043 of the Hansard record for the current session, and I shall read them, as I have no wish to do my right honourable .friend an injustice.",40
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I suppose the right honourable gentleman wishes to tax the people very heavily in order to spend millions on Naval Bases? Why does the right honourable gentleman not say "" yes"" if that is what he means T",40
290,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I have explained again t>nd again that whatever expenditure is necessary for the protection of the country in ordinary times, it should be met out of annual revenue.",40
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Her e is a question which tests the whole sincerity of the .right .honourable gentleman's statement. ' Is he prepared to tax the people to pay-for-all these Naval Bases?,40
292,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Yes . If the Prime Minister puts that as an honest, straightforward question.",40
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I do.,40
294,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Whateve r is necessary for ordinary defence purposes should be debited to the annual revenues. That is my position.,40
295,Mr MCDONALD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,And direct taxation imposed for it.,40
296,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I knew that there was a trick, and I was right. The Treasurer attributed to me the words "" increased taxation.""",40
297,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,How is the necessary money to be obtained except by increased taxation? This year our expenditure has exceeded our revenue.,40
298,Mr LAIKDSMITH,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Then what has become of the Prime Minister's surplus?,40
299,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The sum of £2,653,000 which was carried forward has been reduced to £1,000,000, the difference having been spent, in addition to the whole of the revenue for the year. As we are spending a large sum in excess of onr revenue, how can we get money for additional public works unless the revenue increases largely, which is not immediately likely, or unless we borrow, providing interest and a sinking f u n d , or - unless we increase taxation ? The statethat m e n t of my righ t honourable friend was that he would pay for the construcfinished, tion of Naval Bases by taxationI leave out the word "" increased."" But I know that there must be an i crease. I estimate that the following amounts will be required for the followis ing Naval Bases during the next few part of the establishment. years:Sydney, New South Wales, in addition to £1,043,000 already arranged for Cockatoo Island Dock ... £1,500,000 Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, say Westernport and Hobson's Bay, Victoria ...

We have already arranged to spend at all . £1,043,000 for the purchase of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. That is a loan on which we are paying interest, and we Port Darwin. shall have to pay back the principal. There was an item of £175,000 on the Loan Bill of last year which is included in the amount of £1,043,000.",40

301,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Onl y by arequipment rangement; it is not a transferred perty within the meaning of the Constitube tion Act. However, it is very convenient for the Government to treat it on the understanding that it is a. transferred property. The right honourable member the Leader of the Opposition was quite right in getting Cockatoo Island Dock handed over and paying interest on it as transferred property, if he cares to call so; but that does not take away the obligais tion of finding that money when the time comes for repayment, and of paying in - At terest on it in the meantime. That to all intents and purposes a loan. saw in the paper this raorning that £300,000 is required already to be spent at Cockatoo Island. Then there is the Cockburn Sound base. I have an inticommitment mate knowledge of the whole of that locality; I know the difficulties surmounted, and I know what dredging has to take place, and I have estimated £2,000,000 will be required to be spent there by the time the base is so that naval ships may rendezvous there, and go in and out at all times through the channels which must n - be dredged through the Parmelia and Success banks, and by the time the dock completed, because that is a necessary I think £2,000,000 is a moderate estimate.",41
302,Mr FENTON,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,On what do you base your figures?,41
303,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"On my own knowledge, and I have had a large 2,000,00U experience of public works. Those are my own figures. Coming now to 2,000,000 i,000,000 Westernport and Hobson's Bay, Victoria, it must be recognised that we must have a dock there. We cannot have a large city like Melbourne without a dock. Sydney has one, and Melbourne will require a similar convenience. For this Naval Base, then, I have estimated 3,500,000 £2,000,000. That also is a moderate esti£10,000,000 mate. At Port Darwin, £1,000,000 will be wanted if we are to do anything",41
304,Mr FENTON,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,There is no dredging at,41
305,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"But it is anexpensive place at which to carry out works. . Then there are the nine subbases, for which I have put down £3,500,000, and that brings the total to £10,000,000. If any one who has a knowledge of the cost of these works and' and the difficulties which surproround them can assure me that they can carried out for less than £10,000,000' I will be glad to hear him.",41
306,Mr WEST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Y o u could not do the work in five or six years.,41
307,Sir JOHNFORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"It is not proposed to do that. Those works will take a several years. Therefore, I say that thei t right honourable member for Wide Bay inconsistent when he says that the Naval Bases ought to be built out of revenue. the first opportunity, and evenis before there was any great necesI sity for borrowing, he purchased theCockatoo Island Dockyard at a price which, - with the loan authorized last year for furthe r equipment, brings thefrom loan to £1,043,000.",41
308,Mr FLEMING,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"That was in order to to be show a surplus of £2,000,000.",41
309,Sir JOHNFORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I desire to know why the Leader of the Opposition! did that. Surely Cockatoo Island is a naval base. And the expenditure which has already been incurred is only the beginning, because we were told this morning that the expenditure of another £300,000 is required there at once.",41
310,Mr WEST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,That is for machinery; the dock is there.,42
311,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"All the estimates include machinery. I would ask honourable members opposite what prospect there is of opening up Cockburn Sound, which the honourable member for Fremantle is so much interested in , if we are to restrict our expenditure to amounts obtainable from revenue? And what hope have other honourable members, who aro interested in the other bases and bases I have mentioned, of getting them opened up without recourse to loan money, when we know that, according to Admiral Henderson's estimate, they will probably cost £15,225,000. There is only one way in which they may be carried out from revenue, and that is by imposing extra taxation; and the righ t honourable gentleman will be puzzled to carry out those works even by that means, because taxation is pretty heavy already, and very large taxation will be necessary in order to complete works of such magnitude.",42
312,Mr FENTON,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,How would you carry them out?,42
313,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"B y borrowing the money and providing only interest and sinking f u n d . That is what the Lahour Government did in connection with the deck. Do honourable members mean to tell me that the expenditure on Cockatoo Island can by any sort of reasoning be considered other than loan expenditure? That is suitable for loan just as much as any other work ever undertaken in Australia from loan funds. By borrowing the money and providing only the interest and the sinking funds, the annual expenditure could be within our means, and the interest and sinking fund would only increase proportionately with the work of construction. We would not borrow the money all at once, but as we required it , just as is done in connection with our railways and other public works. Why should we depart from the plan upon which our railways, telegraphs, harbors and Tivers, water supplies, defences, and other extensive enterprising works have been so effectively carried out ?",42
314,Mr RILEY,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,^They are reproductive works.,42
315,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Not all of them. There is a large number of buildings and other forms of expenditure that do not bring in a direct revenue. We have expended in Australia about £300,000,000 of loan money on the following works: Railways and tramways ... £180,000,000 Telegraphs and telephones 4,000,000 Harbors and rivers ... 22,000,000 Water supply ... ... 40,000,000 Roads and bridges ... 7,000,000 Defences ... ... 3,000,000 Miscellaneous ... ... 44,000,000 sub- I ask honourable members and the people of this country why we should depart from a system that has proved so beneficial ? I think the success which has attended our public works system throughout Australia is marvellous. For the most part those works which do not pay are paid for by those which do. Our railways may not all pay, but the whole of them together pay something like 4 per cent., and so are no burden on the general taxpayer. They represent £180,000,000 of our loan expenditure. Such a departure as is proposed seems to me to be dangerous to our progress and development. As I have already pointed out, the Labour party departed from their non-borrowing policy at the very first opportunity, when actually there was no necessity to borrow. I cannot see why we should discontinue a policy which is dictated by common sense, and is so much in accordance with our own ideas. Most honourable members in this House are architects of their own. fortunes, and have they always depended upon having the money in their hands before undertaking any enterprise? Every man in the ' community works with borrowed capital. Even the smallest farmer borrowsfrom the Savings Bank in' order to develop . his holding and make himself a home. Is not that the system followed by every one ? There is practically no man who carries on his business with his own money. The policy everywhere is to get money at a cheap rate and invest it at a better rate. It is the same with the squatter, the shipowner, and .the merchant; it is all a policy of borrowing the capital of other people and making a profit out of it . The result is unparalleled in the whole world for success. In Northern land and in Western Australia-indeed, in any part of the continent-we gress and development that would not have heen possible but for the advantage of borrowed capital. We should have had none of our great avenues of communication, such as our railways, or the magnificent settlement that can be seen on every hand, but for borrowed We are now told at the beginning of our career that we must not borrow, but must raise what money we need by taxing the people. I say at once that I am dead against that principle, because it must be admitted that the more we take - out of the pockets of our people worse it is for the country. money they have, and more besides, they require to develop their lands and the industries in which they may be engaged. The principle of no-borrowing is founded - on some misconception, and is not practicable, as is shown by the facts of our - every-day existence. Any one who enters upon an enterprise, whether it be in the building of a house or the starting of a business, must have financial There are the Savings Banks, and other financial institutions, and in Australia we have what is known as the Agricultural Bank. This institution founded by a Bill that I myself duced in the Western Australian ment; though to hear some people talk one would think that I was altogether devoid of liberal sentiments. Under Act, a man may, for the asking, obtain 168 acres as a homestead farm, and, moreover, before he leaves the office, he receives an order which entitles him, to an extent provided in the measure to draw allowances on certificates of improvements. A man thus assisted can go to work at once, and is allowed' the full value, I believe, for the first £300 of improvements. This, of course, is borrowed money, without would be impossible for many without means to make a home for themselves and their families. a curious thing that honourable opposite in private life practise they condemn in the State. wrong for the State to borrow, it is wrong for an individual to borrow-if borrowing is advantageous to people, it is advantageous to the State.

320,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The issue is one to which I pin the honourable member down. We shall demand that the annual expenditure on defence shall be made out of our annual revenue, as is the case with every self-respecting country in the world. The Government, and their supporters, came here, so they said, to prevent extravagance; and yet, in a time of peace, when the prosperity is unprecedented, and money so plentiful that there is a credit balance, they propose to borrow money for the purposes of defence - The Treasurer was quite fair, as he generally is, and admitted that the Government had spent £1,500,000 of the surplus bequeathed to them.",44
321,Mr MCDONALD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,But the Prime Minister said otherwise.,44
322,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The Prime Minister! He does not know anything about it . What would the Treasurer propose to do in time of distress, war, or other emergency? If we pledge or over-pledge the country's credit in times of peace, we shall find that credit gone in £ime of trouble. Every self-respecting country does what the Labour party proposes shall be done. A borrowing policy is no new thing on the part of the Treasurer or the Prime Minister. When the last Fusion Government were in office they introduced and passed an Act to borrow £3,500,000 for the purpose of constructing a Navy. We, on this side, did our utmost to defeat that measure, but we were closured. However, we appealed to the people on the issue, and declared for an Australian-owned and manned Navy, in co-operation with the Navy of the Mother Country, to be paid for out of the annual revenue.",44
323,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The Labour Government took the money from the States. What used to go to the States came to the Commonwealth. - Mr FISHER - We took nothing from the States but what the States agreed to give up, and what the then Fusion Government agreed to accept. That agreement was made by the Fusion Government, and not by us, and it was made with the consent of the States, as arranged at the Conference, of the proceedings of which there is not a line extant.",44
324,Mr MATHEWS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Not even the blottingpaper !,44
325,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Quite so; even the blotting-paper used at that Conference was destroyed in case a single piece of authentic information leaked out. The agreement was embodied by the then Government in a Bill, and we on this side, as a party, accepted it as an honourable agreement. One of the earliest pieces of legislation by the Labour Government was an Act assuring to the States the whole of the money which was set out in the agreement, and which the States are getting today.",44
326,Mr ATKINSON,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Onl y for ten years.,44
327,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"True ; but that period was fixed when we beat the Fusion Government on the question of putting the agreement into the Constitution-w e beat the Fusion Government then, and we shall beat them now. The Fusion Government at that time had the co-operation of the States, and a two-thirds majority made up of a combination of parties in the House. But we went to the country, and the Labour party won. We then declared that we would not pledge the credit of the people of Australia in good times for purposes of defence.",44
328,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"There were not very good times when the Fusion Government was in power. The good came afterwards, when the Labour party were returned. Mr FISHER,- I accept the right honourable gentleman's statement. It is true that we had good times, but the right honourable gentleman, in his present term of office, has had better times. And what has he done with the opportunity? He admits that he has gone to the bad to the extent of £1,500,000 in his first year. Let the right honourable gentleman show manliness and courage, and admit the facts.",44
329,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Coul d you have done any better?,44
330,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I do not accuse the Treasurer of having done badly. He has said that we inherited a great heritage. I maintain that he inherited a greater heritage, yet finds himself going gradually to the bad, eating up not only the wholeof the revenue he has received, but also the surplus that was left to him.",44
331,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,You ate it up when you were in office.,44
332,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Notwithstandin g that we inherited a deficit, we paid £3,500,000 of loans from revenue, and during the whole of our three years of office we saved on an average £100,000 a month.",44
333,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"You had in three years £18,000,000 more than we had.",45
334,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The Treasurer during this year has had, on the average, the. same as we got in the previous year; but instead of saving £100,000 out of his annual revenue, he has dipped into another purse, and gone under the line to the extent of £150,000 a month, thus making a difference of £250,000 in the monthly expenditure of the two Govern-ments.",45
335,Mr FLEMING,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,As the result of commitments left by the Labour Government.,45
336,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,The Treasurer now wishes to plunge into the loan market while his annual expenditure is in ' excess - of his revenue.,45
337,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,You would rather go in for extra taxation.,45
338,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"As regards commitments, the silliest of men can talk like that. I pay this honour to the Treasurer that he has never been so foolish as to refer to the word -"" commitments."" He has a bigger mind. I am sure that many a time he feels a twitch , if not a little shame, at the use that is being made of the word "" commitments,"" that word which has been coined by the Prime M in ister, and who, perhaps, knows more thanhe pretends to know. What is the reference in the word "" commitments "" ? Owing to the rule of Parliament, that no money can be expended u n t i l it is properly appropriated by Act, a considerable proportion of the financial year - is passed before expenditure on any work is legal; and, therefore, in most cases the full amount appropriated cannot be legally spent with in the financial year, or the works approved of completed. Therefore, at the end of each financial year, no matter what Treasurer is in office, there is a carrying over of works that are uncompleted and unpaid for. I ask the Treasurer whether it is not a fact that a portion of the appropriations for this financial year w i l over until the next financial year?",45
339,Sir JOH NFORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I suppose"" so.",45
340,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The Treasurer has had long experience in these matters, and knows that this falling over is inseparable from the very proper policy of receiving authorization before expending money. It will be clearly seen that the the legacies from one Government to another are about equal.",45
341,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Not necessarily equal; but there is always overlapping.,45
342,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"If another Government came in , in all probability there would be the same amount falling over into the next financial year as was left over for the present Government to meet when they came into office. So the argument in regard to "" commitments "" belongs to the kindergarten school in regard to its financial aspect. The Treasurer, in dealing with Cockatoo Island, was less ingenuous than usual. His contention is that Cockatoo Island is not a transferred property.",45
343,Sir JOH NFORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,It is not under the law.,45
344,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"If the Treasurer holds that view, then he must say that quarantine stations and lighthouses are not transferred properties. Sir. JOH NFORREST - It h i nk they are covered by the Constitution. I maintain that Cockatoo Island is not an ordinary transferred property.",45
345,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I do not wish to do the right honourable gentleman an injustice. I do not wish to go to the public and charge him with misrepresenting the matter. I would not do it unless I knew that he had deliberately done so, and I do not believe that he is capable of doing that. Quarantine stations, lighthouses, and defence works are al l practically on the same basis.. When Defence was taken over by the Commonwealth, all the defence properties were assessed by our own offioers, and approved; and as Cockatoo Island was an essential part of the property purchased by the State of New South Wales for the purpose of defence and other things, and as the Commonwealth Government were desirous of building war-ships in Australia, and considered that Cockatoo Island was the best place where they could be buil t and repaired, we entered into negotiations with the State Government to transfer that part of their property from the Crown of l f all the State of New South Wales to the Crown of the Commonwealth. . For that reason, the property falls into its proper relationship as a transferred property of defence, and any argument to the contrary would defeat the whole purpose and intent of the provision in the Constitution regarding transferred properties. any There is no need to say that a loan should be raised for the purpose of getting that transferred property, because the State of New South Wales already possesses the loan, and the Commonwealth merely pays the interest on it .",45
346,Sir JOHN FOKKEST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"They have applied for the capital. All the States have applied for £9,000,000.",46
347,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The Treasurer now tells us that the States are demanding cash from the Commonwealth Government for all these transferred properties, including defence buildings, post-offices, Customs houses, and so on. blame them, but the Treasurer is not going to pay it to them.",46
348,Sir JOHN FOKREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"No ; because we have not the money unless we borrow it . Where are we going to get £9,000,000?",46
349,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The Treasurer now agrees with me that quarantine and lighthouses, and any other State functions the. Commonwealth takes over, should be taken over as transferred properties; so that the action of the Labour Government in regard to Cockatoo Island was not only correct, but also the only sensible and sane course the Government could follow. Apparently, the proposal of the Treasurer is that if he had the power he would borrow £15,000,000. , Sir JOHN FORREST - Not all at Only when we might require it .",46
350,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I do not accuse the Treasurer of wishing to borrow money until he actually needs it , and then only under the best conditions; but evidently the policy of the Government is to borrow from time to time as required for naval and military expenditure.",46
351,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,No . great works such as Naval Bases.,46
352,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Would you exclude military works?,46
353,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I think forts come under the same category.,46
354,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"F o r military naval works of that kind, the policy of Government is to borrow money.",46
355,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I do not see any other way of doing it unless you tax people.,46
356,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Does the Government c of Great Britain do it ?,46
357,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Thei r position is different. Other countries do it , and I revenue. believe that Great Britain will soon do it .",46
358,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"In times ofwar, Government of the United Kingdom. site would raise loans, but they lay down the general rule that these works in times of peace must be paid for from revenue, and at the same time they are also reducing the national debt instead of increasing it . - Sir JOHN FORREST - In Australia we have so many more things to do with our money.",46
359,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I agree with the Treasurer that, in regard to reproductive works, a young country should avoid drawing .heavily on the annual revenue for the purpose. The only restriction I I do not would put on borrowing in that relationship would be to prevent the carrying out of wild-cat schemes that would not bring in a reasonable return. 'Now as regards the Perth Post Office site, which was mentioned by the r i g h t honourable gentleman, and which was spoken' of so much during the 'last election, we' borrowed the money to pay for that site, and the property now upon it earns 5 per cent, interest on the money borrowed. What a foolish thing it would have been' for any one to say, "" We will buy a property returning 5 per cent, out of current revenue!"" The purchase of that site was a good investment. The Treasurer knows that it is a property that will gradually in once. crease in value. We borrowed the money from the Trust Funds, which the Fisher Government established, at 4 per cent., of which 3J per cent, was debited to the Trust Funds, and \ per cent, went to a sinking f u n d . The Treasurer has an actual net profit of \ \ per cent, on this transaction on which we entered, and yet the matter was made the subject of conOnly for demnation.",46
360,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"There will be no \ \ per cent, when we build a post-office on the site. There will then be no rent.",46
361,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"At any rate, the Treaand surer is getting it now; and, in our the opinion, the freehold property was worth the full value of the money spent on the purchase, and if the Commonwealth erects the a post-office on the site, though we may not get income in the shape of rent, we shall have its equivalent.",46
362,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Then we shall have to provide the interest out of,46
363,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"If the site had not been provided by the previous Govern the ment, we should have had to get another of equal value, and pay cash for it , as we did in the case of the London offices site. The Treasurer is, as a matter of fact, pleased that the site in Perth was obtained in that way. I was waiting for him to tell us the state of his Trust Funds. That would have been a simple b it of information that would have been of use to the puDiic. I hope that before the Parliament is dissolved he will be good enough to give that information to the public. I wish now to deal with other issues. I quite agree with the view which the Treasurer has expressed regarding the opening up of Australia by transcontinental railways, with a branch line to Queensland. The carrying out of such an enterprise must involve much time and money, and will require great determination. It will certainly need a Government with a backbone to give effect to it . Honourable members will search in vain for a record of any new country that has suffered from the prosecution of such a bold and resolute policy. It may involve the country in a loss for some time, but we are well able to bear the burden of giving effect to it , and posterity will have reason to thank us for doing so. Every State in the Commonwealth has, with one exception, where railways were run out westwards to open up new country, laid down branch lines that have soon proved profitable. In the past trouble has arisen really in connection with the smaller lines, and I agree with the Treasurer that we might legitimately pledge the credit of Australia to enable these great works to be carried out. These railway lines are tangible, in terest-earning properties, increasing in value from day to day. Naval and military works, however-fort s and naval bases-ar e in a different category. They return nothing, and are of no value except for defence purposes.",46
364,Sir JOHN FOBREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Unde r my scheme the country, instead of being required to actual pay for these works at once, would pay for them gradually.",47
365,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"But if the right orable member's party comes back to office it will go on borrowing and borrowpublic, but the producers. ing for every work of the kind.",47
366,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,And paying off and paying off.,47
367,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,The end of our defence expenditure is not yet. Greater troubles may arise.,47
368,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,My trouble is in regard to taxing the people so much.,47
369,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The first principle of defence is that the people who own a country should defend it . If a very special expenditure were necessary to save the country, then I should be prepared to pledge everything we have in order to save it .",47
370,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The r i g h t honourable member and his party would provide at once for defence by taxation, whereas I would pay off our defence expenditure gradually, making it easier for the people to bear it .",47
371,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The policy of our party is that we should spend from year to year out of revenue whatever the country can afford on a definite defence policy. Under such a system we would be able to see as time went on what we wanted. It is to be seriously regretted that the original estimates of the cost of giving effect to the defence schemes propounded by our distinguished naval and military advisers should have proved to be sadly in error. This Parliament cheerfully entered into those schemes, and intends to complete them. The Labour party, however, stand for proficiency and economy. We shall ask the people to continue these schemes on the basis of a reasonable expenditure; but we shall not pledge their loan credit for such a purpose. The Treasurer had little, if anything, to say regarding the question of a uniform railway gauge throughout Australia. If there is one reform that ' is urgently necessary it is this. I had the honour to put before the country a policy which declared that there should be at least one gauge of railway from Perth to Townsville. Clearly such a railway is as necessary from the stand-point of general utilit y as it is for Defence, and the economic benefit, within a very few years, would, I believe, be more than sufficient to pay the interest of the honcost of reconstruction. A uniform gauge would benefit, not only the travelling Producers,'.) indeed, are the chief losers from the present breaks of gauge, which give rise to great economic waste. I feel sure from what I have read, and from what I have heard the Treasurer say, that he is entirely in accord with the policy I have just enunciated, but I think it should be definitely fixed. I also expected to hear 'the Treasurer make some reference to the agreement entered into with the State Premiers in regard to the control of the Murray waters, and the proposal of the present Government to grant £1,000,000 to assist the States in locking the river and making other improvements.",47
372,Sir JOHNFOKKEST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I believe t h a Bill is being drafted; bu t I have seen it .,48
373,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,The Treasurer was at inherited. the Conference.,48

376,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I do not thin that the exact terms have been settled, but, generally speaking, an agreement been arrived at.",48

378,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I have heard that that is so.,48
379,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The importance and far-reaching effect of such an agreement account. cannot be readily realized. first proposal on the part of the Government to co-operate with the States in carrying out a great enterprise. So far as I can judge as a ,layman, they have no direct authority under the Constituever, tion for doing this, but, on general ciples, I am not opposed to the proposal. If the National Parliament can assist State Governments in opening up trade routes, and in shortening and cheapening the means of transport, then I , and, am sure, many members of my party will be delighted to co-operate with them, especially where the primary, producers ral policy. will be benefited by such schemes. But we cannot stop at the work of improving the navigability of the Murray and the Murrumbidgee. We should be prepared to co-operate with any State' in dealing with other navigable rivers, whether they Government' - for 'having spent flow through one State or more. That is in that direction' than we had done. my view, and I hope that the Treasurer will adopt it . I congratulate the righ t honourable gentleman on the frank statement he has made regarding the finances. He must have felt uneasy when his Go_ vernment were being charged with spending considerably more than their income. The plain statement of fact is that the present Government have expended all the revenues that they have received,'plus about £1,800,000. If they had had more t a time, there can be no doubt that they not would have quickly expended the remaining £1,800,000 of the surplus which they I think that the Treasurer was somewhen what disingenuous in his comparison of the expenditure on new works buildings by the Government and their predecessors. When we were in office, we set aside out of revenue £600,000 to do what was practically loan work, and we had no expenditure to that extent out of loan money. The Treasurer, in presenting us with a statek ment showing what the present Government had expended out of loan account has on telephone conduits, should have mentioned that we provided out of revenue",48
380,Sir JOH NFORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I showed what subhad been expended out of both loan by an exand revenue accounts.,48
381,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Quite so, bu t I think that we expended a very large sum out of revenue on works which the present Government have provided for out of loan It is the",48
382,Sir JOHN FOEEEST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I gave the Fisher Administration credit for that in my statement of expenditure out of revenue.,48
383,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Quite so; I wish, howto emphasize the difference in the prinprinciple followed by the Labour party and the present Administration in this the respect. When we had any spare revenue, we expended it on the construction of telephone conduits and other im provements relating to the Postal DepartI ment. We regarded that as a good, sound policy to follow in times of prosperity. It is certainly in keeping with our geneComing to the ' Federal Capital expenditure, it was somewhat interesting to hear the right honourable gentleman claiming credit on behalf of his more I think I have heard many of his supporters declare that they would not spend a penny on the Capital. I agree, however, with what the Treasurer has done in this respect. The work of buildiug the Capital having been commenced, we should complete it in the speediest way consistent with economy and the proper expenditure of public money. I desire, also; to congratulate the Treasurer upon his straightforward expression of opinion, that, while some of the buildings erected during our term of office for the Militar y College and other purposes were better than they might have been, the character of the constructional work was all that could be desired. He has spoken, also, of the beauty and utility of the Cotter River, and of the works initiated by the Labour Government in providing a necessary water supply for the Capital. I am glad that he has been frank and fair in this matter. We are laying the foundations of the Capital of a country that will be, I hope, if it is free from foreign aggression, one of the greatest in the world. Every National Parliament must have its own home for its own safety and security. There should be no loss of time and no delay in providing it . There are many persons who may say that a Federal Capital is not required; but it is required by the Constitution. We have lately heard a great deal about the Constitution and what it imposes- a great deal that we never thought of ; but if there is anything clear and definite in that instrument, it is the statement that there must be a Federal Capital, and that it must be established in New South Wales. The Treasurer did not refer to a matter which is of importance to Tasable mania. The Government increased the Commonwealth's grant to Tasmania, b u has only paid £5.000 of its liability to State.",48
384,Sir JOHN FOKREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"This year we have paid Tasmania £90,000. 'The Fisber Government paid only £85,000 for one year; we have been meeting its liability and our own ever since.",49
385,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"This Government .has made one payment of £5,000. It in creased the Commonwealth's grant to Tasmania by £400,000, and has so far paid only £5,000. Ministers and their supporters have the same views about paying as they have about borrowing. They promised Tasmania to do something for her in the dim and distant future.",49
386,Sir JOHN FOKREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Our arrangement is very scientific.,49
387,Mr FISHER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Yes . Ministers take the credit and kudos of the increased grant, and will leave to their successors the liability. There are many other matters with which I should like to deal, but I shall not trespass further on the time of honourable members. I suggest to the Treasurer that he should not waste the public money by keeping such a large gold reserve; that he should get the £4.0,000 due to the Commonwealth.",49
388,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I thin k t h at we shall want it all next year.,49
389,Mr MCDONALD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Kennedy) [4.19] I congratulate the Treasurer on his frank admission that he has a deficit of £1,819,000. The Prime Minister, speaking at Tamworth, told the people that the Government has a surplus of £800,000. One or other must be telling an untruth , and I do not think that it is the Treasurer. It is only fair that the country should know the exact position of the finances. I should like to know what the right honourable gentleman proposes to do in regard to the Savings Bank business of the States and the Commonwealth. He says that we should not have interfered with the ""Savings Bank business of the States, and the Government promised to introduce a Bill to give effect to an amicable, arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States regarding the business of the Savings Banks.",49
390,Sir JOHN FORKEST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I introduced the Bill.,49
391,Mr MCDONALD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,The right honorgentleman told us then that the Commonwealth had no righ t to interfere with t the Savings Bank business of the States. the How long is it since he changed his mind on the subject?,49
392,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I never committed myself in the matter.,49
393,Mr MCDONALD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The right honourable gentleman went as near to doing so as he could. Speaking at the Premiers' Conference, held at Brisbane in May, 1907, he s a i d It has been urged on the Government several times-and I have had it in my own mind in the interests of the people of Australia, although I have not done anything yet, nor do I know that the Government are going to do anything-bu t it is within our powers to have a post-office savings bank for all Australia. The Honourable G. SWINBURNE-It was mentioned yesterday. The Eight Honourable Sir JOHN FORREST - I have not read the report; but I say it is compelent for us to establish such an institupenditure tion ; and what a splendid institution it be for ""the people of Australia! - Now the right honourable gentleman conasked demns it as an institution of this "" horrid, beastly Labour party,"" which should have been established. Now he is trygauge ing to destroy, this ""splendid instituvernment tion.""",49
394,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Is that all t h at I said?,50
395,Mr MCDONALD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"- No. ' The honourable member said furtherWe know very well that the States have no machinery to successfully carry on a savings bank without the assistance of the post-office, which is under the control of the Commonwealth. That observation of the honourable gentleman, therefore, cuts two ways. We can get some of the savings of the people into the coffers of the Couunonwealth any time we like, aud perhaps then the honourable gentleman would not be able to boast that he has command of the Savings Bank money to a far greater extent than the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has not laid hands on the Savings Bank, and should it ever do so, it will not be for the purpose of borrowing money, but for the convenience and assistance of the people of Australia. Honourable members opposite not, when the Treasurer made that speech, on the most amicable terms with the States, and to establish a Commonwealth Savings Bank, which he said would be a splendid institution for Australia. He pointed out that in the Post Office the Commonwealth has better facilities for collecting money than the States possess. At that time the right honourable gentleman was in favour of a Commonwealth Savings Bank. But the party opposite never learns anything. Now it is cringing to the Premiers and Treasurers of the States, as it did in 1910, to secure support at thecoming election. Let the riglit honourable gentleman be frank, and tell us whether he has really changed his mind on this question.",50
396,Sir JOHN FORREST,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I did not propose a Commonwealth Savings Bank. What "" the honourable member has read were really passing remarks.",50
397,Mr MCDONALD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"They formed part of a strong party speech. When the righ t honourable gentleman's conscience pricks him, he speaks his thoughts in a way that there is no mistaking. The Leader of the Opposition spoke of .the break of gauge question, which this Government has referred to a body of experts. Havquite ing committed the community to an exof millions of pounds upon the would construction of a long length of railway on the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge, Ministers have a body of experts to report which is the best uniform gauge for Australia. not If the Commission recommends that the shall be 5 f t . 3 in . , will the Gotear up the line they are now building and convert it to 5 f t . 3 in. ?",50

I would be ashamed to belong to a set of men who would commence the construction of a line and afterwards ask experts to determine what the gauge should be. There is a reason for that policy, and that is that South Australia and Victoria are opposed to the 4-ft. 8 i - in. gauge, and the Government are tryin g to curry a little favour with those two States, but have not the honesty or moral courage to tell the people what is in their minds. In these important matters we have a right to know just exactly where we are. The Treasurer has not told the were House how far he has depleted the old age pensions fund . It is from that f u n d that the Government have taken a large threatened portion of the £1,800,000 which they have spent in excess of their revenue during the last financial year. We desire to know just exactly what is in the minds of the Government. Are they going to reduce the old-age pensions?",50

I refer When M i nnot isters were asked about their mistake, they said, "" Those who have to pay the Excise are all very honourable men', and they will pay up. They belong to the Liberal party, and assist the funds of that party."" If they did not say that, they ought to have said it . But those people did not pay up until we had the humiliating spectacle of the Government begging and pleading with the Opposition to allow legislation to pass, not only in this, but in the other Chamber, so that they might protect the revenue to the extent of £156,000. What Ave did was quite proper; but the circumstances showed stupidity and blundering ou the part of the Government.",52

449,Mr MCDONALD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,It is perfectly true that the Labour party passed the Bill ; but does the honourable member say that that was a blunder?,53
450,Mr CONROY,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I do, undoubtedly, considering the form in which the Bill was passed.",53
451,Mr MCDONALD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,What about the' stupidity of the other party in not finding that out?,53
452,Mr CONROY,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I do not deny that either.,53
453,Mr MCDONALD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I have, at all events, one friend on the other side who admits the stupidity and blundering of the Government in this matter. There are many other subjects to which I might refer, more particularly that of the Teesdale Smith contract. What is the position? Mr Fenton . ^A blunder!",53
454,Mr MCDONALD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,I am not sure that it was not a criminal act that was committed. The Government have allowed the country to be fleeced of tens of thousands of pounds.,53
455,Mr MCWIIJLIAMS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,There were worse blunders by the Labour party.,53
456,Mr MCDONALD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Eve n if that were true, it does not excuse the present Government; and such a retort does not clear the atmosphere in any way. Mr MCWxLi/iAMS - Blam e both Governments.",53
457,Mr MCDONALD,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"It is not my function to blame the Labour Government. It is the duty of honourable members opposite, if they can, to point to any wrongs committed by the Labour Government; but, up to the present, they have not successfully done so. The Government now find themselves in legal difficulties in connection with the Teesdale Smith contract. They have paid a great deal more than they had any right to pay for the digging of soft material at a price based on that of digging hard material; and the latest news is that, in order to complete the work, the Government are employing day labour. Why are the Government not honest enough to tell us the exact' position? At present we have no very clear idea as to what is being done in this connection. I understand that this Bill has to be passed today, and, under the circumstances, I shall not longer detain the Committee.",53
458,Mr HANNAN,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Fawkner) [4.48] - I notice that there is an item of £10,000 for advertising in connection with the Government immigration policy. Only a few days ago, along with a number of other honourable members, I had the painf u l duty, as representing the unemployed in the city of Melbourne, of waiting on the Prime Minister.' It is not that unemployment is confined to the Victorian metropolis, for I believe it is prevalent in every State of the Union. The State Governments are principally, if not wholly, responsible for finding employment for the immigrants who are brought, to this country. The Federal Government have no power, in any .shape or form, to settle people on the land; and the object of the immigration policy of the State is to bring people here for the purpose of settlement. Mr George Elmslie, the leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, has pointed out that since the inauguration of the immigration policy, about five years ago, only 3,00 out of the many thousands of people brought here have actually been placed on ti e land. It is evident that four-fifths of the immigrants have been encouraged to come to Australia by the gloAving promises made in alluring advertisements in the press of the Old Country; and this £10,000 we are now asked to pass is to further advertise the great opportunities which Australia offers to the rural workers of the Old Land. I admit that, from a working man's point of view, Australia is superior to the majority of the older countries; indeed, I go further, and declare that, from that point of view, it is superior to all countries. We must not forget, however, - that the Federal Government and Parliament have no power, so far as land settlement is concerned; and, therefore, we should not in any way be parties to assisting the State Governments to bring people here only to find, as Australian natives have found already, that there is no land available. As a member of the Labour party, I enter my emphatic protest agaiust this Parliament spending any money on immigration u n t i l it has power to find employment or provide land for settlement.",53
459,Mr GROOM,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"That is, the honourable member would wait until the Commonwealth has power to deal with the lands ?",54
460,Mr HANNAN,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I should wait until the Commonwealth can in some way carry out the promises that are being made to people in the older countries. Does the fact that less than 300 people out of thousands have been placed on the land justify this, or any other Government, in advertising in the manner in which they have advertised during recent years? The failure of the State Governments to carry out their promises to immigrants would justify this Parliament in refusing to spend another penny. There is another feature that should receive serious attention. At the present time, a State Royal Commission in Victoria is visiting the metropolitan slum areas, and they have found that thousands of our workers are living under conditions that are a disgrace to any civilized community. If we go to South Melbourne, Port Melbourne, Richmond, Collingwood, or the industrial centres of Carlton, we' find highly respectable working men, with their wives and families, livin g in what are practically slums, and paying rents of 10s. to 12s. a week out of a wage of £ 2 5s. or £ 2 6s. The State Governments of Australia-particularl y the Government of Victoria - and also the Commonwealth Parliament, so long as it votes money to assist immigration, are responsible for the present condition of affairs. Thousands of people have been brought here with no provision for their proper housing, with the result that for every vacant house there are two or three applicants, and the landlords have seized the opportunity to levy what is practically a tax of, on the average, 5s. or 6s. a week on the wages of the working classes. If any .State Government had gone to the people and told them that this would be the effect of their immigration policy, they would have received very short shrift. In New South Wales, the Labour Government are carrying out a system of immigration, but they recognise their responsibility for seeing that the people are properly housed; and, in view of the extra demand, have, during the last three years, been erecting workmen's homes. In Victoria, under a Liberal Government, the position is altogether different, for no housing whatever has been provided. If in this State of Victoria there were a Government determined to settle people on the land, they would be perfectly safe in instituting an immigration policy; but the fact of the matter is that immigrants are walking about the streets of Melbourne, in open competition with Australians for the work that is available, and in this State, at all events, employment is very scarce in many industries. The Victorian Government have recently taken a new line in immigration, and are bringing thousands of boys to the State. Heaven knows that the conditions in the rural industries of Victoria-and these are typical of Australia generally-ar e bad enough today without the open competition of boys, imported from other parts of the world. Honourable members opposite, like the majority of country representatives in the State Parliament, are the advocates of cheap labour in Australia. In the State, country members proclaim from the platform their readiness to assist Parliament to pass industrial legislation for the protection of men and women in factories, but when they are asked to assist the Labour party, with legislation for the protection of rural labourers against unscrupulous rural employers, they are found voting in favour of the latter. There are employers in the country districts of Australia who can only be classed with many employers in our manufacturing industries. We have fair employers who at all times a r willing to comply e with trade union conditions, but there are others who are always trying to get under legal determinations, and behind conditions fixed by industrial tribunals. And we find honourable members on that side of the House, and men sitting in State Parliaments, doing all in their power to deprive the rural workers of anything in the nature of a reasonable wage.  rural workers' l o g i",54
461,Mr HANNAN,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"F r o m the very in ception, the honourable member for Echuca has been recognised as a protector of that particular class of employer who delights in paying the lowest wages and giving the worse possible conditions. He is a bitter opponent of all forms of trade unionism, and he is prepared to support the Government to the hilt in denying to the rura l workers the right that all other workers of the community enjoy, that of registering under the Arbitration Act, and applying to the Arbitration Court for better conditions. The rural workers' log referred to by the honourable member is a proposal put forward by the union. The members of that organization have asked the farmers to meet them in conference to discuss certain proposals. have had any experience in industrial matters know that the original proposals submitted by the workers are not always adopted. If the farmers agree to meet the representatives of the Rural Workers Union in conference they will have the same experience as employers in other industries have had, namely, that they will find that the men are a reasonable body; and if the farmers do not meet the men in conference, no doubt the latter will take the other constitutional means at their disposal, and approach the Arbitration Court to get better conditions.

465,Mr HANNAN,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"The statements made through the press and by a number of gentlemen standing under the Liberal Those who banner were responsible for the presence of many honourable members, not because they were statements of fact, as f ar as the rural workers' log was concerned, but because they were misrepresentations o l the contents of that log, and of the possible policy of the Rural Workers Union. The rural workers do not desire any more rights than those conferred on the members of every other union in Australia, namely, the righ t to meet as an organization, the right to confer as members of an organization, and decide as to what they consider are fair and reasonable conditions for their labour, the right to submit those conditions to their last employers in conference, and, failing a satisfactory settlement in that way, the right to approach the Federal Arbitratio n Court. So far that course of action has been denied to them, and we find that the present Government, who say that they are the friends of the workers, come forward with a policy which contains a proposal to amend the Conciliation aud Arbitration Act , by striking out the provision which gives to the rural workers the same righ t to approach the Arbitration Court that other workers in the community enjoy.

But to that section honourable members opposite who say they have such a great regard for the interest of the workers would deny the right of approaching the Court in order to secure better conditions of labour. The system of Wages Boards referred to by the honourable member for Wannon has been in operation in Victoria for twenty years, but the rural workers",55
468,Mr RODGEKS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Hav e never asked for it. Mr HANNAN"" - The rural workers of Victoria have been denied the right of Wages Boards by the gentlemen in the State House connected with the same party and same political organization as that to which the honourable member for Wannon belongs.",56
469,Mr RODGEKS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,They have never asked for it.,56
470,Mr HANNAN,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"They have asked for it. The organized rural workers of Victoria have asked for it, and, true to their pledges, the Labour party, as a party, when an opportunity was given, have stood up on the floor of the State House and appealed to the Governments of the day to extend the Victorian system of Wages Boards to the rural workers of Victoria, but it has been denied to them by the party responsible for the political being of the honourable member for Wannon. We find that the Government who denied to these men that form of legislation are bringing to our shores hundreds of boys-the last ship brought 600 of them-and sending them to the rural districts, in order to assist advocates of cheap labour. It is only a question of time when, with this form of competition going on, aud with no trade Union regulation of the industry, the condition of the rural workers here will be as deplorable as that of rural workers in the Old Country. In the circumstances, I enter my emphatic protest against any Federal Government voting' money to assist the State Governments in luring people to Australia under promises which those Governments know that there is no possibility of carrying into effect. The other day one gentleman said, "" There is no such thing as unemployment in our country."" The same thing is said by other men on whom fortune has always shone. They say that any man who needs work can find employment, but these men have never experienced what it is to go out in the morning and parade the streets all day with the apparition of unemployment and want tracking them all the time, otherwise they would not be so fond of sneering at one who speaks to them of unemployment. There has been unemployment in this country in the past, and there has been want. There is unemployment, and there is actual want, in the State of Victoria today, and, while there is unemployment and want in our midst, as long as I can raise my voice, I shall raise it against people being brought here under promises that cannot be carried into effect, thus preventing our nativeborn from obtaining that employment which will provide food and homes for them and for those dependent on them.",56

472,Mr RODGEKS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I think it was £19,000,000.",56
473,Mr TUDOR,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Ver y well; let it be £19,000,000. But honourable members do not also say that in the present year the Liberal Government have received more than was received last year by the Fisher Government, or six or seven million pounds more than was received in any year by the last Liberal Government in power. And yet they have got through the it all. The Treasurer has submitted that Ministers have spent every penny of the £23,000,000 or £24,000,000 they have received. Now they come along and say they have a surplus of £1,000,000. If an honourable member started in business with £2,600,000, spent £1,600,000 during the year, and, though he tried hard to do so, could not spend the other million pounds, could he say that he had a surplus of a million pounds? If honourable members opposite are honest, when next they are telling the people that the Fisher Administration . during its three years of office had £18,000,000 more revenue than its predecessors had, they will frankly admit that the present Government have had the same revenue, that they have spent every penny of it, and that they have, in addition, spent over £1,600,000 out of the surplus of over £2,600,000 which they inherited from the Labour Government.",56

475,Mr TUDOR,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I am not abusing the Government; I am simply pointing out the actual facts. W it h the exception of the Prime Minister, no one interjects more frequently than the Treasurer does. Yet when he is reading page after page of his speech he pays no attention to interjections; he wants to be able to hand over to Hansard his typewritten copy of it . The right honourable gentleman has told us that the schedule to this Bill represents for the most part votes which the Government have been unable to expend during the last twelve months. That being so, if the £754,000 for which the Bill provides represents for the most part re-votes, it will be seen at once that if the Government had spent that amount they would have swallowed up the whole of the surplus lef t them by the Fisher Government. When the Estimates were under consideration last year, many representatives of Victoria now sitting behind the Government condemned our expenditure on the Federal Capital. We expended about £100,000 in twelve months, whereas the Fusion Government propose to spend £75,000 in three months. These honourable members, however, offer no objection.",57

And yet a post and telegraph office has been opened at the new Commercial Travellers' Club, by a Government who pretend that they are doing something l'or tht/ country.

485,Mr TUDOR,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I do not say that. My point is that there were already four post and telegraph offices within a quarter of a mile of the General Post Office, and that this new post and telegraph office at the Commercial Travellers' Club was not asked for by any member of Parliament. The commercial comniunity in our cities apparently can obtain these concessions without the intervention of a member .of Parliament.",58

506,Mr TUDOR,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I wish, in conclusion, to emphasize the point that honourable members opposite can no longer plead that we enjoyed a larger revenue than has fallen to the lot_of a Liberal Government. The Fusion party, during the laSt twelve months, had the same revenue that we had, and have not only expended the whole of it, but some £1,500,000 in addition. They have also provided out of loan account, as the Treasurer has admitted, for works which we carried out last year out of revenue.",58
507,Mr SHARPE,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Oxley) [5.30] -- I should not have risen to speak on the motion were it not for the fact that the Department of the Postmaster-General is spending a great deal of money on post offices in and around Melbourne, although in Brisbane many prosperous suburbs, and many busy parts of the city, are entirely without post-offices. No doubt, Ministers desire to placate staunch supporters, and have placed post-offices in the heart of this big city to enable the large business houses to avail themselves more readily of postal facilities. It is the great use that the business houses make of the Post Office, and the smallness of the sums that they pay for the services rendered to them, that cause the loss of revenue in the working of the Department. Had the Government the courage to charge business houses what they should pay for the services which are given to them, the postal revenue would be larger, the service would be better, and decent salaries could be paid to our postmasters, and proper remuneration to underpaid assistants. The public suffers because the Government will not charge properly, for many of the services which it renders to business houses. We have been promised a new post-office at South Brisbane, with a separate telephone exchange, but, although land has been secured for a site, the erection of the building has not been begun, and we do not know what is intended. This part of Brisbane has grown largely as a business centre, and as a residential quarter, but it is without a decent post-office, and its telephone communication is inadequate and out-of-date. The people of Brisbane will be sadly disappointed if something is not done shortly to improve their service. A new post-office was promised for Wynnum, where there is a population of 2,000 or 3,000, but nothing has been done in the matter yet. I suppose that sufficient influence has not been brought to bear on Ministers.",59
508,Mr RODGERS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Has the honourable offer member spoken privately to the Postmore master-General about these matters?,59
509,Mr SHARPE,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"That should not be necessary. The Minister knows his duty, and should do it. I expect him to do the right thing by the whole community. He should not concentrate expenditure in his own neighbourhood. A large expenditure on post-offices should be made in Queensland, where postal facilities are inadequate, and where population is increasing rapidly. I hope that when the Postmaster-General visits that State he will commit his Department to many new postal works. The policy of the Minister of External Affairs for the development of the Northern Territory was put into my hands only a few moments ago. I incline rather to the Treasurer's ideas as to the best way of opening up the Territory by railway construction. The Minister of External Affairs seems to have accepted advice which is not as practical as the Treasurer's ideas. The matter, is not of consequence now, however, because the Government is not likely to have an opportunity to put any policy into effect. What is proposed for the encouragement of the dairying industry in the Northern Territory is, to my mind, altogether unsuitable. In my opinion) and in that of the best judges of country who have visited the Northern Territory, the land north of the fifteenth parallel of latitude is unfitted for dairying, which could not be carried on there with any degree of success. It is proposed to buy in the northern part of Queensland, at £8 or £10 a head, cattle which can be used for dairying in the Northern Territory. I think that the only cattle that could be bought would have to be got from the southern part of Queensland. Many beasts would be killed by the hardships of the journey, and those that survived would probably not recover for two or three years. It is very difficult to travel dairy cattle. They must be handled tenderly, if good results are to be got from them when they have reached their destination. Probably the Minister is acting on the advice of a man who is not competent to advise him on this subject. In my opinion, dairying in the Northern Territory can have a chance of success only if young stock is sent from Queensland, and allowed to mature there, acclimatizing in the process. This would give an opportunity to inducements to dairy farmers to rear calves. The rearing of calves is a matter to which, serious attention will have to be given in the near future, because the stock of the Commonwealth is rapidly decreasing. Probably the calves that are now killed would, if allowed to go on maturing, supply all the meat that Australia requires. At the present time, owing to the smallness of their holdings, dairymen can rear only a small percentage of their calves; generally only enough, to maintain their dairy herds.",59
510,Mr RODGERS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"When a man from 60s. to 70s. for a pig six months old, and only about 15s. for a calf of that age, would you compel him to rear a calf in stead of a pig?",60
511,Mr SHARPE,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"A calf six months old brings considerably more than 15s. If the honourable member has any at twice the price, I know where he can get a ready market for tbem. Last year the New South Wales dairy stock decreased by 21,000, and the South Australian dairy stock by 11,000; I have not seen the figures for the other States. These are facts thatAve cannot put on one side. Moreover, by reason of the present high price of f at stock, dairymen are being in duced to turn many of their dairy cattle into beef cattle, so that within a year or two we may have a shortage of both beef cattle and dairy cattle. My solution of the difficulty is that the Government should resume a great part of the Northern Territory for the rearing of .beef cattle. Most of the good country there has already been secured, but the Government should reserve whatever may be left. Then, in stead of buying dairy cattle, full groAvn, to be taken to the Northern Territory, our dairymen should be induced to rear their young calves, to be sent there for the establishment of dairy herds in the Territory.",60
512,Mr FENTON,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"Maribyrnong) [5.45] I notice that there are published in this evening's paper figures in relation to the rolls. I believe they are similar figures to those mentioned in the House by the Prime Minister yesterday. I do not knoAv whether those figures are going to do duty at the elections, but I find in them a slight mistake.",60
513,Mr SPEAKER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,The honourable member cannot discuss that subject. This is the Works and' Buildings Bill .,60
514,Mr FENTON,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I was under the impression, for the moment, that we were on general Supply. At any rate, these figures are inaccurate; but even they show that there are only 10,000 electors less on the roll now than there were last year, and half of that number can be made up in Maribyrnong alone when there is a full roll. I can assure the Attorney General that there will be more names on the. roll at this election than there were at the last. I desire to say just a few words in regard to the mounting up of expenditure in regard to defence. I can get find that the defence expenditure in the Schedule of this Bill totals a big amount, and in the Supply Bill we passed this morning, nearly £1,000,000 of the total of £3,000,000 is to be devoted to defence. This matter is becoming so serious that I believe the Department is becoming altogether too big for one man. I do not care how good a Minister he may be, whether he be Senator Mille n or Senator Pearce, or what his politics may be, the time has come when this House should carefully consider the expenditure on defence. It is too late to talk about any great reforms now, but I hope that when the new Parliament assembles a Committee of members of both Houses will be appointed for the life of the Parliament, whose duty it will be to scrutinize and analyze all expenditure on defence works and defence generally. In that respect, we in this House are in a sad plight. Without making any reflection on any Minister, I say that the House is at a distinct disadvantage in not having amongst its members a Minister who is thoroughly acquainted with the details of defence expenditure. This Chamber is supposed to be the real custodian of the public purse, but it seems to be customary, in the creation of Cabinets, to choose the Minister of Defence from the Chamber which has no control over finance.",60
515,Mr THOMAS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"I do not see any necessity for having any Minister in the Senate, after what has happened. There is no Senate now.",60
516,Mr FENTON,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"In effect, the Senate has been wiped out; and, so far as I am concerned, if that Chamber is to be limited in its powers, as the decision of the Governor General limits it , 1 would advocate the abolition of it altogether.",60
517,Mr THOMAS,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,The decision of the Governor General has done away with the Senate.,60
518,Mr SPEAKER,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,Order !,60
519,Mr FENTON,GUN ACCIDENT AT LIVERPOOL,"We have been landed in a difficulty by the advice of Ministers having been acted upon by the Governor General ; and, without desiring to cast any reflection upon the Senate, I say that we might as well do without that Chamber altogether. I was remarking that every Ministry seems to place the Minister of Defence in the Senate, and, in order to counteract that disadvantage, we ought to have a permanent Committee of both Houses, including an Honorary Minister, if necessary, to scrutinize defence expenditure, so that this Parliament may have more than one man with a f a ir grip of this great spending Department. I hope that something will be done, apart altogether from the appointment of a Public Works Committee. That Committee will have enough to do to look after works in connection with other Departments, but it is necessary that this House should know more about the details of defence expenditure than it does at the present time. We may ask for particulars, but we rarely get a satisfactory answer, because the one man who is well posted in the details of Defence administration is in the Senate chamber. If necessary it would be a splendid idea to amend the Constitution, so that if a senator held the portfolio of Minister of Defence, he could take a' seat in this chamber during the discussions on the Defence Estimates and other defence subjects, and give this House the information which it should have. At the present time this House is in an awkward position with Tegard to defence. The Treasurer reels out details of million after million of expenditure, but when he is asked to particularize in regard to defence he has not that familiarity with which would enable him to give a satisfactory reply. I must compliment the right honourable gentleman on the concise statement he gave to the House this afternoon; and on the fact that he is prepared, although other Ministers are not, to give credit to this side of the House for the works we inaugurated and partly carried out. If I have a seat in the next Parliament I shall insist on the defence expenditure being scrutinized more closely, and on more information being furnished to this Chamber, either per medium of a Coftimittee of both Houses, or by bringing the Minister of Defence into this Chamber during the discussion of defence matters. I shall fight for such a reform in one shape or other. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages. Mr Fenton. NA NA COMMITTEE.

522,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,I shall consider the matter between now and tomorrow.,61
523,Mr BURCHELL,MANUFACTURES,"Fremantle) [6.5] During the discussion on the Supply Bill we have heard much about qualified electors being struck off the rolls; and I believe that even'you, Mr Speaker, have had some difficulty in this connection.",61
524,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member cannot traverse matters that have been a subject of - debate.,61
525,Mr BURCHELL,MANUFACTURES,"I only desire to lay that today my attention has been Irawn to the fact that, through excessive ze'al on the part of some official or other, both my wife and myself have been disfranchised. If it is possible to successf u l l y lodge a formal objection against persons who are prominent in the electorate, possibilities of electors not so well known being disfranchised are very great indeed.",61
526,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,Thes e things occur every day.,62
527,Mr BURCHELL,MANUFACTURES,"I do not wish to debate the matter, but simply to draw attention to the fact. The Prime Minister knows perfectly well that, whether I reside in the division or not, I am entitled, as the Parliamentary representative, to have my name on the r o l l ; and I wish to take the present opportunity to enter my protest. Members who live nearer to their constituents have the advantage that they can bring matters of this kind quickly before the House, whereas we from a distance have to wait a considerable time for letters. I certainly think that some more stringent method should be adopted by the Electoral Branch to insure that qualified electors are not most unjustifiably removed from the rolls. The onus, it seems, is in every case thrust on the individual to see that his name is on the roll rather than calling upon the Department to take the necessary care to keep the roll fair and clean. I take the opportunity to press the fact that apparently those who are opposed to us politically would deprive even members of this House of the right of voting.",62
528,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,"Melbourne Ports) [ 6 . 7 ] - I appeal to the Prime Minister to allow my motion in favour of Home Rule for Ireland to be put without debate. The right honourable gentleman knows full well that never in this Parliament, and, I doubt, in any other Parliament, have members been deprived during a whole session of any opportunity to bring forward private business.",62
529,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Why talk like that? This is not an ordinary session. We agreed to do certain things, and we have kept the agreement.",62
530,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,"I do not wish to go into the question of whether or not this is an ordinary session, because, if I did so, I should have to blame the Prime Minister for the situation, which, in my opinion, has been created without necessity. I should not be so anxious to have the motion put to the vote if it were not for the fact that men in prominent positions in the Old Country have been expressing opinions as though they were speaking for Australia, when, as a matter of fact, they have no right or authority to do so. Their utterances, however, are taken as gospel, and are published broadcast in the press. In [97] the case of Earl Grey, for instance, it was, in my opinion, a piece of consummate impudence on his part to express himself as he did when he returned to England after his visit to Australia. He spoke as if he knew the Australian people, and as if they concurred in his opinion on the Irish question.",62
531,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,What has he been saying ?,62
532,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,"He expressed the opinion that the people of Australia had no .sympathy with those who desired Home Rule, but every sympathy with Ulster. While in Australia that gentleman was very busy in this connection, and I was not at all surprised at the action he took on his return to England. Further, while I have the greatest respect for our High Commissioner, I must say that that gentleman has expressed a very strong opinion, and, in view of his position, he may have bean taken as voicing the views of the people of the Commonwealth. The only body or set of individuals who can properly set fort h the view of Australia are the representatives of the people in this and another place. But for the fact that private members' time was absorbed' by the Government, I have no doubt that I should have obtained an expression of opinion on the motion, for it was my intention to take up very little time. My desire now is to show that those who have been, purposely I think, misrepresenting the opinions of the people of Australia, are quite wrong; and the Democrats of the Old World ought to be shown that we in Australia are Democrats who desire to see justice done to the people.",62
533,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"Kalgoorlie) [6.12] - I endorse the request made hy the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. The Prime Minister was not here today when I desired to point out to him certain reasons why private members should not be deprived of a privilege which they present have freely exercised in every session of every Parliament of the Commonwealth up to the present.. This is the first time that private members, who do not put their motions on the paper merely to ornament it , have had their rights in this respect taken away. This is the first Government who have attempted to gag in dividual members by refusing an opportunity for the discussion of their motions; and I think that the Prime Minister has sufficient sins on his shoulders without having to face the country with the in cubus of this additional offence. It the more in accordance with fitness and justice, which we expect from oue in his position, to give time for the discussion - of a few of these private motions.",62
534,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,I know that I am ihe scapegoat for you people I,63
535,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I have said nothing unjust in depreciation of the right honorrary able member, and he well knows it . cannot point to any remarks of mine dura ing the past thirteen or fourteen years that have been very severe on him.",63
536,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"I read something that the honourable member wrote the other day about, I think, "" bovine ferocity.""",63
537,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable memprised ber has evidently fallen across some literature. He may depend upon it that it was something good, and I am glad a kind friend has brought . it under notice. Private members, as I say, - aot put their motions on the notice-paper merely for display, but with a desire lhave them discussed. Prime Minister that many f r u it f u l - An legislation have originated, not -{Governments, but with private members. It would appear that I said something rthe other evening, perhaps not underclass standing his outburst of poetical eloits quence, that has hurt the feelings of the 'honourable member for Riverina. Howthese - ever, the honourable member quite took .away my breath when he claimed that "" Tipperary "" was voting for him. Of - course, as we are at the Antipodes no - doubt a good many things here are just the opposite to what they are in the 'World-the seasons, for instance. B .as to the generality of things, the notion is merely a fable. We change our skies, ibut not our manners and feelings. That is why' I find it extremely difficult credit the honourable member's claim regarding "" Tipperary "" vote3. It would certainly be most remarkable if the man - who in "" Tipperary "" would be looking for the honourable member with a gun, should be chasing him with a vote i Riverina.",63
538,Mr FALKINER,MANUFACTURES,"I ask that that statelawyer, ment be withdrawn.",63
539,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,What statement?,63
540,Mr FALKINER,MANUFACTURES,"That any man in Tip- boroughperary would chase me with a gun, or that my ancestors were ever treated in that - way.",63
541,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,The honourable memwould ber has said nothing unparliamentary.,63
542,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I freely withdraw anything I have said which is objectionable to the honourable member for Riverina. In deed, I had not meant to refer specifically to him. I was referring rather to the class he represents. It would be an amazing thing if a man, who in Tippewould be looking for a representative He of the class of the honourable member with guu, should be chasing him with a vote in Riverina. If it be true, then such people are recreants to the principles for which their ancestors suffered. Knowing that the people to whom the honourable member refers generally sympathize with Democracy, I shall be suri f they add to the majority which good the honourable member anticipates. There is another matter I would his like to touch on before I sit down. do We are in the habit of receiving certain publications in the Library, and to It l i in k that for the sake of deI remind the cency some one should draw attention ideas to the utterly partisan character of the with majority of them. I have no objection to the dissemination of opinions, however contrary they may be to mine, as every has a right to the free expression of own views, but I do object to the finding on the Library table half-a-dozen of magazines expressive of one set of opinions, and only a few insignificant newspapers in another part of the building expressing a different set of opinions. I call attention to a few phrases I have chosen from the March number of the Old National Review, which is an utterly paru t tisan publication, in order that Mr . Speaker might see whether, i u his opinion, it is a publication that is worthy of finding a place in the National Parliament. to The publication says on page 12Unionists continually misread their opponents . . . because they treat an Asquith Cabinet as a Gladstone Cabinet. Tliey talk with bated breath of the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the First Lord of the Admiralty, &c, conjuring up visions of n the Grand Old Man, Pitt, or St. Vincent. They have actually to deal with a time-serving Asquith; a Welsh mountebank, Lloyd George, and a Dundee wind-bag, Churchilla descendant of the great house of Marlwhose careers prove that they will stick at nothing. With their colleagues they constitute a Cabinet of HabakkuksI have consulted most of the dictionaries and cannot find a definition of Habakkukswho at a pinch do not draw the line at corruption. I believe the Prime Minister was once an admirer of Liberal Governments. This publication refers to the present British Government asSlimy hypocrites such as Mr Masterman, one of Mr George's sycophants. Th'e Prime Minister used some very strong language the other day at Tamworth. I thought it was hardly the speech of a gentleman who intended to wind up the session in peace and good-will and amity with his fellow legislators.",63
543,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"- I must have been reading some of that stuff of yours, and it must have set me going.",64
544,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I recognise that the right honourable gentleman has borrowed the best portion of it . Now, other quotation from this so-called National ReviewThe Government have been publicly convicted of corrupting their constituencies . . . . Government of snobbery, jobbery, and robbery. Another phrase used is, ""Government by prophecies blackmail.""'",64
545,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURES,Do they refer to our Government ?,64
546,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"No ; to the Asquith Government. If the honourable member used such terms as applied to the present Government, I believe, that there is a ""black hole"" somewhere to which he would be consigned pretty quickly. Other things the. i'n this journal areThis is merely one of the dirty tricks with welfare. which the name of Asquith will be for all associated'. Thu callous cynic at: the head of the Governsimilar ment. Ananias has become a back number since Mr Lloyd George appeared on the political horizon. The Opposition should have long since manded the impeachment of Mr Asquith, the traitor that he is. The reading of the speech of the Prime Minister at Tamworth recalls a passage in Dante's description of the chamber the infernal regions to which traitors are consigned. Dante says that when a person is guilty of a notable treason his soul descends to the infernal regions, while a demon takes possession of the dicate, body so long as it remains on earth. I is not uncharitable to say that somewrits [97]- 2 thing of that kind may account for the extraordinary deliverances of the Prime Minister recently at Tamworth and otherplaces. I am glad to know that the right, honourable gentleman has been studying, some of the literature in Labour journals. It may remind him of the time when he was a bright and shining light on the-> side of Labour. The days of death-bed. conversions are not finished, and whoknows but that at some time or other the; Prime Minister will see the original light, that lured him to public life, and rejoin,, if permitted, the party of Democracy which is doing its best to elevate t h a people of Australia.",64

548,Dr MALONEY,MANUFACTURES,"I give uotice that, here is anto-morrow I shall move That this House testifies to the facts that after twenty-one years' experience of woman suffrage in various parts of Australasia, and fourteen years' experience in the Commona wealth, the reform has justified the hopes of its supporters and falsified all the fears and of disaster voiced by its opponents.. That, as foreseen by its advocates, its effects have been(a) to gradually educate women to a senseof their responsibility in public affairs; (&) to give more prominence to social and domestic legislation. That Australasian experience convinces this. House that to adopt woman suffrage is simply to apply to the political sphere that principle of government that secures the best results in domestic, sphere, the mutual co-operation of men and women for the individual and general time. I may say briefly that this motion is on lines to that to which I sought to get the agreement of Mr Deakin, who was. leading the House in 1909.

551,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,"I shall be satisfied with the answer of the Prime Minister subject to Supply being granted, which I am helping him to get, and which he will get. He could indicate when His Excellency will be good enough to issue the writs. It has now been laid down in an official document that His Excellency acts on the advice of his Ministers on this and on other matters. Therefore, I think the time has arrived when the Prime Minister should indicate when the issue of the writs is likely to take place, for the information and protection of those who are entitled to be on the roll and exercise their franchise. I do not desire to traverse other matters. We shall have another sitting tomorrow. I quite agree that, instead of meeting at 10.30 tomorrow, we should meet in the afternoon.

For reasons which I can give the right honourable member, I cannot tell him the other dates, but we shall try to do the fair thing. As to the question raised by the honourable member for Melbourne, I would point out to him that he need not wait until tomorrow.

560,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,I wish only to express my own opinion on the abstract question of womanhood suffrage.,65

562,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"That is all I propose to do. Indeed, I do not know the exact terms of the motion. I am not prepared to interfere in any way with any of the political troubles of the Old Country. They have their own troubles there, and they are set in different circumstances from our ownj but I say quite frankly to the honourable member for Melbourne that I think the time will come when the women |of the Old Country will be given the vote. I am sorry that so much trouble should be taking place in England in regard to it, and I believe that the women of Great Britain would have had the vote before now but for the conduct of the suffragettes. That is my firm opinion.",65
563,Dr MALONEY,MANUFACTURES,But the right honourable member thinks that womanhood suffrage has done good in Australia?,65
564,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"That is so. I have seen no reason to alter my opinion. The result of extending the franchise to women in Australia has been distinctly good, and I do not think that the extension of it to the women of the Old (Country will do the slightest injury to the Empire. More than that I cannot say. Questiou resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 6.36 p.m. t",65
