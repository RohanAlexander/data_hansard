2,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Marriage To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of Parishioners of Saint James Church, North Road Brighton Vic 3186 and as members of the federal electorate for Goldstein draws to the attention of the House our petition on our position on the meaning of marriage. We therefore ask the House that you protect the unique institution of marriage as traditionally understood and actually lived as the complementary love between a man and a woman. from 1 citizen Potato Imports To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of members of the Australian vegetable and potato industries, initiated by AUSVEG, the national peak body representing around 9,000 vegetable and potato growers around Australia, draws to the attention of the House: Concern from the industry that potatoes from New Zealand infected with Zebra Chip disease complex - a devastating potato disease which has caused millions of dollars worth of damage worldwide - will be allowed into Australia if a current New Zealand request for market access is approved. AUSVEG has grave concerns that if this market access request is approved, it will put the the Australian potato industry at extreme unnecessary Selection risk, as it is highly likely that a proportion of the potatoes that come into Australia from New Zealand will be infected with Zebra Chip disease complex. We therefore ask the House to:  Take steps to ensure that Australia, via the relevant governing body, rejects the application by The Ministry of Agriculture Biosecurity New Zealand for market access, which would allow them to import fresh potatoes into Australia for processing under a Quarantine Approved Premise arrangement. from 26 citizens Marriage To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of concerned citizens, in support of marriage as currently defined in the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) draws to the attention of the House:  that on 8th November 2010 the House of Representatives endorsed a motion that said ""That this House calls on all parliamentarians, consistent with their duties as representatives, to gauge their constituents' views on ways to achieve equal treatment for same sex couples including marriage. ""  that marriage is currently defined in the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) as being "" ... the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.""  that each element of the definition of marriage is essential to its integrity, particularly with respect to the welfare and well-being of children;  that marriage is a ""keystone"" institution on which our society rests;  that marriage provides for a stable family structure and is the ideal environment in which children are raised and nurtured; and  that marriage is worthy of ongoing protection and support. We therefore ask the House to maintain support for marriage as currently defined in the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) and reject any proposal to amend its definition. from 120 citizens To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives We, who sign below on this petition, do not agree with the proposal to recognise same sex marriage as being a lawful part of the Marriage Act of Australia. We therefore ask the House to keep the Marriage Act of Australia as it is and make no change. from 35 citizens National Bowel Cancer Screening To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of concerned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the continued lack of full implementation of the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP). National Health & Medical Research Council approved Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention, Early Detection Management of Colorectal Cancer strongly recommends biennial screening for bowel cancer for the Australian population over 50 years of age. Since the launch of the NBCSP five years ago, Australia still lacks a comprehensive program which provides biennial screening for Australians over 50 years of age. These delays continue to result in unnecessary deaths from what is essentially a preventable disease. Over 14,000 Australians - men and women, young and old-are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year.  One in 12 people will develop bowel cancer in their lifetime. The disease kills over 4,000 people each year-more than breast cancer or prostate cancer.  If caught in time, around 90 per cent of bowel cancer cases can be successfully treated. Screening has been estimated to save around 30 lives per week. We therefore ask the House to do all in its power to ensure the implementation of a comprehensive National Bowel Cancer Screening Program biennial screening for the population aged 50 and over, together with a public awareness campaign Marriage informing people of the purpose and relevance of screening for this preventable disease. from 5,081 citizens Member for Fisher: Travel Expenditure To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives We, residents of the Sunshine Coast, are concerned about the extraordinary expenditure of taxpayers' money by the Member for Fisher, Peter Slipper. There is particular concern about his level of use of ground transport and air travel Program outside his electorate and during times when parliament is not sitting. We request a full audit of Mr Slipper's entitlement claims made during the past decade, requiring that he explain the detail of parliamentary and electoral business that led to them being incurred. We request that any audit by the Department of Finance be overseen by the National Audit Office to assist with recommendations that may produce expenditure guidelines in line with community expectations. We further request expenditure provisions be tightened to require all Members to give detail of the parliamentary or electoral business that led to an expense being incurred. from 2,696 citizens Syria To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the call by Foreign Minister Mr Kevin Rudd for the United Nations Security Council to refer President Bashar alAssad of Syria to the International Criminal Court. We believe that it is not in Australia's interest for Mr Rudd to jump to conclusions about President al-Assad and his government's handling of the current upheaval in Syria. We are aware that there have been calls from peaceful demonstrators in Syria for reform and that in response President Assad has announced significant reforms. We are also aware that there is evidence of sectarian violence and the killings of soldiers, police and innocent people by armed civilians presumably intent on undermining and overthrowing the Syrian government. We reject the notion that political freedoms can be achieved through violence. We know that the largest demonstrations across Syria occurred on 25 March 2011 and were in support of President Assad and reform. In these circumstances, we therefore consider it inappropriate and ill considered for the Australian Foreign Minister to make a call to refer President Assad to the International Criminal Court. We therefore ask the House to request the Minister of Foreign Affairs to desist from making any further call for President Assad to be brought before the International Criminal Court and we request the Minister make an effort to seek a more informed and balanced view of current events in Syria. from 2,683 citizens Petitions received.

3,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS,"Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Live Animal Exports Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 10 June 2011 about a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding live animal exports from Australia to the Middle East. I regret the delay in responding. The Middle East region is a vital group of live export markets for Australia. High standards of animal welfare throughout the entire live export chain including post arrival are essential for long term trade sustainability. The Australian Government shares the Australian community's concerns about the abuse of animals and is taking action to ensure exporters can assure the Government that cattle, sheep and goats will be managed through the supply chain in accordance with international animal welfare standards. Senator the Hon Joe Ludwig, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and. Forestry, has asked Mr Bill Farmer AO to undertake an investigation examining the whole live animal export supply chain, from paddock, to export and up to and including the point of slaughter, for all markets that receive Australian livestock. The review will support greater transparency across our export markets, provide recommendations on reforming the trade, and will contribute to the design and application of new safeguards for animal welfare. The Industry-Government Working Group on Live Sheep and Goat Exports has been established in addition to the IndustryGovernment Working Group on Live Cattle. The working groups will focus on traceability and supply chain assurances for all live cattle, sheep and goat exports. Both Industry-Government Working Groups will be reporting to the Government at around the same time as the independent review into Australia's livestock export trade (the Farmer Review) at the end of August 2011. This will provide the Government with comprehensive information for considering the future policy direction for live animal exports. Thank you for bringing the petition to my attention. from the Minister for Trade, Dr Emerson Live Animal Exports Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 6 June 2011 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, forwarding a petition regarding live animal exports from Australia to the Middle East. I regret the delay in responding. The Middle East region is a vital group of live export markets for Australia. High standards of animal welfare throughout the entire live export chain, including post arrival are essential for long term trade sustainability. The Australian Government shares the Australian community's concerns about the abuse of animals and is taking action to ensure in future that cattle, sheep and goats will be managed through the supply chain in accordance with international animal welfare standards. I have asked Mr Bill Farmer AO to investigate the entire live animal export supply chain, from paddock to export and up to and including the point of slaughter, for all markets that receive Australian livestock. The review will support greater transparency across our export markets, provide recommendations for reforming the trade and will contribute to the design and application of new safeguards for animal welfare. The Industry-Government Working Group on Live Sheep and Goat Exports has been established in addition to the IndustryGovernment Working Group on Live Cattle. The working groups will focus on traceability and supply chain assurances for all live cattle, sheep and goat exports. Both Industry-Government Working Groups will be reporting to me at around the same time as the independent review into Australia's livestock export trade (Farmer Review) 31 August 2011. This will provide the Government with comprehensive information for considering the future policy direction for live animal exports. I will release the reviews along with the government response in due course. Thank you again for bringing this petition to my attention. from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig Kingsford Smith Electorate: Kensington Post Office Dear Mr Murphy Petition - Kensington (NSW) Post Office Thank you for your letter dated 7 July 2011 concerning a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration regarding the possible closure of the Kensington Post Office. Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding. Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day-today running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to its operational network. As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post does not receive any funding from taxpayers and, as far as practicable, it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. Australia Post has advised that it has had discussions with relevant stakeholders about the decline in customer numbers at the Kensington Post Office and the ways in which the financial position of the outlet could be improved. However, I understand there are no plans to close the outlet. Australia Post has also advised that it recently renewed the lease at Kensington and will continue to operate from the current premises. Both full counter and post office box services will be provided. I trust this information will be of assistance. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy Racial Discrimination Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 23 May 2011 regarding a petition on the development of a National Action Plan to Close the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I apologise for the lengthy delay in responding. The petition calls for the Australian Government to commit to the bipartisan development of a long-term National Action Plan to Close the Gap in disadvantage between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians. I acknowledge that the petition contains 38 signatories who are concerned about the continuing gap in life opportunities experienced by Australians. I also acknowledge the 2010 Report of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the comments contained therein. I would like to assure you that the Australian Government is strongly committed to closing the gap in Indigenous disadvantage and improving the life chances of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The Government is currently working to turn around decades of under-investment and has marshalled unparalleled resources and agreements across governments to work towards closing the gap. In 2007-08, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed to six ambitious targets for closing the gap in Indigenous disadvantage through the National Indigenous Reform Agreement. These targets focus on making improvements in life expectancy, child mortality, access to early childhood education, educational attainment and outcomes. The Government is investing $5.75 billion over the next three years to reduce Indigenous disadvantage. Significant reforms have been forged through National Partnership Agreements with state and territory governments to improve outcomes in Remote Housing, Early Childhood, Health, Education and Economic Participation. Under these agreements, governments have been working in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Australians in a sustained effort In the 2010-11 financial year, 490 new houses and 2,288 refurbishments were completed in remote Indigenous communities across Australia. This exceeded the ambitious target of 463 houses and 2,012 rebuilds. The Australian Government has also invested $100.6 million in the Tackling Smoking initiative to reduce Indigenous smoking rates. In addition, achievements under mainstream initiatives include assisting 47,000 Indigenous Australians through the Family Support Program to provide help and support for families dealing with relationship problems and separation issues, and placing 58,950 Indigenous jobseekers in jobs. Indigenous Improving the health and well-being of Indigenous people is a high priority for the Government, but it cannot be achieved in isolation. As a signatory of the Close the Gap Statement of Intent, I am aware of the importance of this document and its commitments. The Close the Gap Statement of Intent is consistent with the work that the Government is carrying out across Australia to improve the life chances of Indigenous Australians and represents a united effort of the Australian people to achieve important reforms. I am aware that the petition calls for the Government to develop a long-term National Action Plan to Close the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The Close the Gap Statement of Intent refers to this Action Plan as one which should aim to address the existing inequities in health services in order to achieve quality of health status and life expectancy between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030. Currently, the Government is implementing Indigenous health plans which share the very same goals. The National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health 2003-2013 (the Framework) was developed using the 1989 National Aboriginal Health Strategy as a foundational document. The Framework seeks to address contemporary approaches to primary health care and population health within the current policy environment and planning to close the gap. structures. The Framework clearly articulated that health gains cannot be made in isolation. Therefore, it adopted a multi-sectoral approach to improve housing, education and employment to support and sustain improvements in health. The Framework commits governments to monitoring and implementation within their own jurisdictions, working together at the national level and working across government on joint initiatives between health departments and other portfolios. COAG agreed to the $1.6 billion National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Indigenous Health Outcomes in 2008 (the NPA) to contribute to the first of the Closing the Gap targets - to close the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a generation. The Government is providing $805.5 million over four years for an Indigenous Chronic Disease Package as its contribution to the NPA. This Package will reduce chronic disease risk factors, encourage earlier detection and management of chronic disease in primary health care services, improve follow-up care and increase the capacity of the primary care workforce to deliver effective health care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples across Australia. These overarching Indigenous health plans are due to expire in 2013. The Government is currently considering options for arrangements beyond 2013. All governments will continue work in this area through their commitment to the National Indigenous Reform Agreement. Closing the gap will take time and demands perseverance from all of us. The Government is committed to this national priority which is essential if we are to build a future where each and every Australian is valued and included. I appreciate efforts made by individuals and health professionals towards reducing Indigenous disadvantage. Thank you again for providing me with the opportunity to comment on this petition. from the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin Ballarat Electorate: Mobile Phone Dear Mr Murphy Telecommunication services in the Hepburn Shire Thank you for your letter dated 30 May 2011 concerning a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration telecommunication services in the Hepburn Shire. Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding. The Australian Government understands the importance of mobile telephony to Australians. In recent years the mobile phone carriers have significantly expanded their terrestrial mobile networks. Vodafone Hutchison Australia claims its networks currently cover more than 94 per cent of the Australian population. Optus claims its 3G network provides services to 97 per cent of the Australian population. Telstra claims its Next G network now provides mobile coverage to 99 per cent of Australians. better For the most part the recent extension of mobile coverage across Australia has been based on commercial decisions by carriers. In making a decision to extend coverage to a particular area, carriers will consider a range of factors, including site availability, cost structures, likely levels of demand from users and overall economic viability of the service. Residents of Hepburn Shire may wish to contact Telstra, Optus and Vodafone Hutchison Australia to make their needs known. I have enclosed the contact details of the carriers for reference. It can be useful to involve local government in identifying potential demand for mobile services in the area. Information such as projections of population growth, visitors to the region and records of traffic volumes can be helpful in assisting carriers to make informed decisions about whether to extend coverage to certain areas. Sometimes commercial barriers to improving coverage are insurmountable. New tower sites in mountainous terrain are often more difficult to justify than proposals for towers on flatter, cleared ground. As mentioned in the petition, the mobile phone signal in this terrain is often blocked by the mountains and therefore does not travel as far. Carriers often find it difficult to Services justify new towers in this situation as the number of users who can access any given tower is very limited. Mobile phone services in emergency situations While mobile phone services improve communications in everyday situations, experience from the 2009 bushfires in Victoria is regarding that terrestrial mobile phone towers are not 100 per cent reliable in emergency situations. Being located at the top of prominent hills for the best geographical coverage of the area, they are extremely vulnerable to bushfires, attendant power outages and are often at high risk of being destroyed or damaged during these events. In consideration of the bushfires and other recent www.dbcde.gov.au/satphone natural disasters, there has been an increased focus on emergency communications and response systems. Due to the risk that the networks themselves might be impacted by the emergency, telephone-based emergency warning systems are only a supplement to, and not a replacement for, the range of measures currently used to warn the public of emergencies. There are many ways of conveying information and warnings during an emergency including television, radio, public address systems, door-knocking, sirens and signage. In addition, emergency warnings are transmitted via telephone land lines, terrestrial mobile phones and satellite phones. Given this, the residents of Hepburn Shire may wish to consider using a satellite-based means of communication. In contrast to terrestrially based mobile networks, the infrastructure for satellite mobile telephony is predominantly located in space, and so is less subject to disruption from bushfires. Satellite mobile phone services cover the entire Australian landmass and population and are available from a number of providers. Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme The resident of Hepburn Shire and surrounding areas may be eligible to apply for a subsidy under the Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme (the scheme). The scheme improves the affordability of mobile communications for people living and working in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage, by providing subsidies for the purchase of satellite phone handsets. The scheme provides up to $1000 for eligible applicants who live in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage or up to $700 for eligible applicants who live in areas that have coverage, but spend more than 180 days across a two year period in non-coverage areas. Under the scheme's rules, those eligible to apply include individuals, small businesses, community groups, not-for-profit organisations, Indigenous corporations, emergency service organisations, health organisations and educational institutions. The application form for the scheme is available from the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. Visit for further information. An information kit can be obtained by contacting the scheme administrator on 1800 674 058 or via email at satphone@dbcde.gov.au. Other technology for requesting assistance In emergency situations, an alternative to telephone communications is the use of distress beacon units, such as an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) or Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs). These devices are designed to assist in an emergency by alerting rescue authorities and indicating location. More recent models incorporate Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) technology, enabling much more accurate determination of the location compared with earlier models. These devices are not as limited by terrain as mobile phones and, by providing the location, will speed up any rescue effort. A variety of providers around Australia offer these for sale or hire. Thank you for bringing the petition from the citizens of Hepburn Shire to my attention. I trust this information will be of assistance. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy Kooyong Electorate: Balwyn Post Office Dear Mr Murphy Petition - closure of Balwyn Post Office Thank you for your letter dated 6 June 2011 concerning a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration regarding reestablishing post office services in Balwyn. Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding. Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day-today running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to its operational network. As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post does not receive any funding from taxpayers and, as far as practicable, it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. Australia Post has advised that in determining whether additional retail postal outlets are justified, it takes a number of factors into including the location and viability of existing outlets and the volume of business likely to be transacted. The corporation also has a national Community Service Obligation performance standard that in metropolitan areas at least 90 per cent of residents should be within 2.5 kilometres of a retail outlet. Australia Post has reviewed the distribution of postal outlets in the general area around Balwyn. The Balwyn Newsagency offers core postal services and there are five retail postal outlets within a 2 kilometre radius: the Yooralla Licensed Post Office (LPO), 1.08 kilometres from the former Balwyn LPO; Canterbury LPO (1.27 kilometres); Surrey Hills North LPO (1.4 kilometres), Camberwell East LPO (1.47 kilometres) and Deepdene LPO approximately 1.48 kilometres distance. Australia Post is unable to support the request for an additional postal outlet at this stage. Australia Post believes that the reasonable needs of the community are being met by the current mix of postal outlets. I trust this information will be of assistance. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Economy, Senator Conroy Brisbane Electorate: Ashgrove Post Dear Mr Murphy Petition - Ashgrove Post Office Thank you for your letter dated 4 July 2011 concerning a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration regarding the closure of the Ashgrove Post Office, Queensland. Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day-today running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to its operational network. As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post does not receive any funding from taxpayers and, as far as practicable, it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. Australia Post has advised that the Ashgrove Post Office, which closed for business on 21 January account 2011, had experienced a steady decline in customer numbers in recent years and was no longer commercially viable. There are four postal outlets located within a 2 kilometre radius of the former Ashgrove Post Office: Ashgrove West Licensed Post Office (LPO) (1.4 kilometres); Newmarket LPO (1.7 kilometres); Red Hill LPO (1.7 kilometres); and Paddington Post Office (1.9 kilometres). In ensuring minimal inconvenience to post office box customers, Australia Post relocated the Ashgrove suite of post office boxes to the Ashgrove West LPO. The address details of all post office box holders remained the same. Customers were also able to lease a post office box at an alternative outlet if they wished, with the offer of a free six-month redirection. Customers who did not wish to have their post office box transferred to an alternative outlet could have their mail delivered to their household or business via the street mail delivery service. Again, these customers were offered a free sixmonth redirection service and free 'Change of Address' cards to assist with the process. Australia Post's customers were first alerted to the proposed closure in November 2010 and again in early January 2011. During this period Australia Digital Post has advised that it had widespread community consultation including with Ms Teresa Gambaro MP, State member Ms Kate Office Jones MP and Councillor Geraldine Knapp. Australia Post is unable to support the request for post office facilities to be located in the Ashgrove shopping precinct. Australia Post believes that the reasonable needs of the community are being met by the current mix of postal outlets. I trust this information will be of assistance. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy Pharmaceutical Services Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 4 July 2011 regarding a petition recently submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions requesting the facilitation of an additional licence to dispense medicine in Glen Gala Shopping Centre Sunshine West, Victoria, to improve accessibility, affordability and choice for the members of the communities of Glen Gala, Sunshine West, Ardeer, Derrimut and The Avenues Estate. I would like to take this opportunity to explain the approval process for new pharmacies under the Pharmacy Location Rules (the Rules). For a pharmacist to be approved to supply Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines at particular pharmacy premises, he or she must make an application to the Secretary of my Department (delegated to an officer in Medicare Australia). Applications are considered by the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (the Authority) against requirements specified in the Rules. The Rules are intended to promote community access to PBS medicines by ensuring that a viable and appropriately located pharmacy network is in place. They do this through location based criteria that encourage an appropriate geographical spread of pharmacies, whilst ensuring that pharmacies do not become too closely clustered together, which could lead to some pharmacies having insufficient volume of work to allow efficient and viable operation. The Authority considers applications against the relevant criteria in the Rules and is unable to consider other issues outside the Rules. If the Authority finds that an application satisfies the requirements of the Rules, it must recommend that the application be approved. The Authority cannot recommend approval if the requirements of the Rules are not met. Unless an application is lodged for consideration by the Authority, it is not possible to determine whether or not that application would be successful. In situations where the Secretary's delegate has rejected an application and the applicant believes there are exceptional circumstances that may result in a community being left without reasonable access to PBS medicines, an applicant can request that I exercise my discretionary power under the National Health Act 1953 to approve the pharmacist to supply PBS medicines. Such a request must be made within 30 days of receipt of advice that an application has been rejected. competition, I can only exercise my powers if I am satisfied that:  a. a decision not to approve an application will result in a community being left without reasonable access to PBS medicines supplied by an approved pharmacist; and  it is in the public interest to approve the (PBS) pharmacy. I trust that the above information is of assistance. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Decentralisation Program the Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 4 July 2011 concerning a petition recently submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions concerning the decentralisation of population from cities to towns. I apologise for the delay in replying. In accordance with Standing Order 209(b), I would like to make the following response. The Australian Government is committed to improving both the liveability of our urban areas and effectively building our regions in order to enhance the well-being of all Australians. To this end, Sustainable Australia - Sustainable Communities: A Sustainable Population Strategy for Australia aims to enhance opportunities of current and future generations through more effective anticipation, planning and responses to the impacts of a changing population on our economy, environment and communities. This includes managing the impacts of a changing population, particularly in our urban and regional areas. The Strategy's focus is to ensure that we have in place the necessary policy settings and governance arrangements to deliver improvements in our well-being at the local, regional and national levels into the future. Australia's regions will be better connected with the rollout of the National Broadband Network, which can enable internal migration through facilitating more widespread access to health services, education and specialist services that are typically found in major cities. The National Broadband Network will also facilitate more opportunities for people to engage in teleworking - broadly defined to include work undertaken at home, use of mobile devices in transit or at a different place of business or telecentre. Effort and coordination is required across governments, portfolios and sectors to secure our economic prosperity, improve the liveability of our cities, suburbs and regions and protect our environment. Among the most important things we can do to take pressure off our major cities is to ensure that regions are more attractive places to live, work and build a future. State, territory and local governments have critical roles in the provision of infrastructure and services that impact the sustainability of the population. The varied ways in which population changes impact across Australia demands effective policy and program responses from all levels of government that can be precisely targeted to specific communities, be they national, regional or local. My Department's Promoting Regional Living program builds on the success of the Evocities initiative with $11.5 million provided over four years to support non-capital cities implement strategic and targeted marketing strategies, to promote the benefits and opportunities of living and working in those cities. Cities that have strategies in place for future growth needs will also be eligible for support. Priorities that may have particular relevance to these cities include: access to critical transport infrastructure; current skills base and future skills needs; new opportunities for private sector participation and partnerships; opportunities to maximise the use of broadband for the purpose of expanding business enterprises and the delivery of services; opportunities to attract new and recent migrants; social inclusion; water and energy efficiency; affordable housing options; and climate change and environmental adaptation and management. Similarly, my Department supports the Regional Development Australia committee network, which is made up of local leaders who volunteer their time to work with government, business and community groups to help address the economic, social and environmental issues affecting their communities. A key priority for many Regional Development Australia committees is to consider how to attract people to move to live in their regions, particularly from major cities. This can be encouraged by the region offering diverse employment opportunities, good transportation links, a good standard of community facilities and a wide range of services. I understand that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is writing separately to the Committee on matters raised in the petition that fall within his area of responsibility. Thank you for raising this matter with me. from the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Crean Flynn Electorate: Digital Television Dear Mr Murphy Petition about digital television reception in Miriam Vale and district, Qld Thank you for your letter dated 4 July 2011 in your capacity as Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions. In your letter you referred to a petition from the residents and citizens of Miriam Vale and Districts, Queensland, about digital television reception in those areas. You sought my response to the petition by way of a written response to the Committee. The petition asked the House to 'ensure that the Miriam Vale community has access, free of charge, to quality digital TV and to ensure the services provided are local and not relayed from a satellite. The community wishes to access its TV signal via terrestrial means via a ground based transmitter.' The petition also drew the attention of the House to 'the unsatisfactory position with regard to the changeover from analog TV to digital TV. The community has a high number of retired residents who are unable to sustain the cost of transition.' Digital television services in Miriam Vale I am advised by the Digital Switchover Taskforce that most viewers in the Miriam Vale area are currently likely to be receiving their analog television services from the Miriam Vale/Bororen transmission site, which is located about 10 kilometres east of Miriam Vale. I understand that the three commercial services and the SBS are provided from this site as self help retransmissions, and the ABC provides its services in both analog and digital. In January 2010 I announced that under an agreement between the government and commercial television broadcasters across Australia, broadcasters will upgrade a number of existing regional analog self help transmission sites to operate in digital. These site upgrades are being carried out by broadcasters. No funding is being provided by the government for the upgrades and therefore the choice of sites to be converted is a matter for the broadcasters to determine. I am advised that broadcasters have decided not to upgrade the Miriam Vale/Bororen site to digital. The Australian government understands the importance of free-to-air television to people living in regional Australia and has introduced policy and legislative measures to maximise viewers' access to digital television services. Providing equal television services to viewers throughout Australia is a central feature of the government's digital switchover program. To ensure that viewers in areas where there is poor or no access to terrestrially broadcast digital television services, such as in the Miriam Vale area, the government is investing $375.4 million over twelve years to provide transmission of digital free-to-air services from a new satellite platform known as the Viewer Access Satellite Television (VAST) service. By providing funding for the VAST service, the government aims to ensure that anyone in Australia who cannot receive digital terrestrial services will have access to a reliable and professionally operated free to air service, now and into the future. The VAST service is a first class direct to home digital television satellite service which covers all of Australia. It provides technically high quality viewing of the same number of television channels that are available in capital cities in both standard definition (SD) and high definition (HD). Viewers in the Miriam Vale area who currently receive their analog television services from the Miriam Vale/Bororen self help site, and who are not able to receive an adequate signal from another transmitter serving their area, will be eligible to move to the VAST service. They will also be eligible to receive assistance under the government's Satellite Subsidy Scheme. More detailed information about the VAST service and the Satellite Subsidy Scheme is provided below. Some viewers in the Miriam Vale area are likely to eligible to receive assistance to switch to digital television under the government's Household Assistance Scheme. More detailed information about this Scheme is also provided below. Viewer Access Satellite Television service The VAST service features channels carrying programs sourced from Southern Cross Seven, Imparj a Nine and Ten network. It also includes the main national broadcaster services, ABC1 and SBS ONE, together with SD digital channels ABC2, ABC3, SBS TWO, 7TWO, GO!, Eleven and the HD channels ABC News 24, SBS HD, 7mate, GEM, and ONE HD. The VAST service also provides viewers with access to the local regional news services currently broadcast by the commercial broadcasters in their terrestrial licence areas. This means that viewers in the Miriam Vale area will be able to receive WIN News from Rockhampton and Bundaberg, Seven Local News from Rockhampton and Wide Bay, and the Southern Cross Queensland news. The regional news services are provided through dedicated news channels. The news services of the national broadcasters, the ABC and SBS, are also provided. ABC news is available through ABC 1 on a state basis, so Miriam Vale viewers will receive ABC1 Queensland. Satellite Subsidy Scheme Viewers moving to the VAST service because they live in areas served by analog self help sites that are not being upgraded to digital, and who are not able to receive an adequate signal from another transmitter serving their area, will be eligible to receive assistance under the government's Satellite Subsidy Scheme (the scheme). Under the scheme, the government will contract with satellite installers experienced in domestic satellite dish installation to provide a subsidised installation package to these households. Eligible households will pay a predetermined co-payment to the installer which is fixed as part of the contract between the government and the service providers. Households will be clearly advised of this co-payment in advance of the installations taking place. In regional Queensland the household co-payment is $220. To ensure a flat co-payment across large areas, the government provides a subsidy of $400 per household in defined 'standard' areas, $550 per household in defined 'very remote' areas and $700 in defined 'far north tropical' areas. The scheme pays for the conversion of one television set per household to the VAST service. People with more than one television who move to the VAST service will have to install additional cabling and set-top boxes at their own expense, although the same dish can be used for a number of televisions. This is not substantially different what people with more than one television in metropolitan and regional areas throughout Australia who receive their television services terrestrially will have to do to receive digital television. Applications for assistance under the scheme opened for Queensland on 30 May 2011 and they close on 2 October 2011. Households in the Miriam Vale area may apply for assistance under the scheme online by www.digitalready.gov.au and then scrolling down the page to 'How to apply' under `Govt assistance'/'Satellite Subsidy Scheme'. Viewers may also apply by calling the Digital Ready Information Line. The situation for tenants in state or local government housing is that provided they are Australian citizens or permanent residents aged 18 years or over, either the owner/landlord or the tenant of the dwelling where the satellite television equipment is to be installed is eligible to apply for the scheme. Tenants opting into the scheme on behalf of their landlord will need to have received their landlord's permission for the installation to be carried out. There will only be one installation per dwelling. Once an applicant (either the landlord/owner or tenant) has applied successfully for the scheme, their dwelling will not be eligible to apply for additional subsidies, and the applicant will be required to pay the household contribution. Tenants and landlords will also need to agree about ultimate ownership of the equipment installed. The government has funded the scheme in recognition of the investment made by households in communities with analog self-help terrestrial retransmission facilities in establishing and running their own analog self-help towers, and to ensure that the cost for households to install VAST reception equipment is minimised. The scheme is restricted to householders who live in or own an eligible residential dwelling, and is not available to non-residential dwellings. Places of business are excluded from the scheme as they to are not residential premises. The government is not subsidising the conversion of businesses to digital more generally. People living in permanently located cabins and caravans within residential parks are eligible to participate in the Scheme as long as they can provide evidence of a valid residential park site agreement, residential park tenancy agreement or long term holiday site agreement. Permanently located caravans or cabins occupied under these going to types of agreements are considered to be residential dwellings for the purposes of the scheme. Household Assistance Scheme The Household Assistance Scheme will, at no cost to eligible households, supply, install and demonstrate a HD set top box specifically chosen to meet the needs of the elderly or those with a disability, and carry out any cabling and antenna work where necessary. Households eligible for assistance under the Household Assistance Scheme located in areas unable to receive terrestrial digital television signals will receive satellite reception equipment. A person may be eligible for assistance under the Scheme if they live in a switchover area that is due to switch to digital, own a functioning television, do not already have access to digital television on any of the televisions they own and they receive the maximum rate of one of the following payments:  Age Pension  Disability Support Pension  Carer Payment  Department of Veterans' Affairs service pension  the DVA income support supplement payment Eligible customers in the Miriam Vale area would have received a letter inviting them to participate in the Scheme in April 2011. A person eligible to receive assistance under the Household Assistance Scheme may not also receive assistance under the Satellite Subsidy Scheme. Thank you for bringing these matters to my attention. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Economy, Senator Conroy Pharmaceutical Services Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 4 July 2011 regarding a petition recently submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions requesting that the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (the Authority) location rules are maintained in the Glen Gala, Sunshine West, Derrimut and the Avenue Estate communities, Victoria. The Pharmacy Location Rules (the Rules) are a fundamental component of the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement (the Fifth Agreement) between the Australian Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. This Agreement commenced on 1 July 2010 and terminates on 30 June 2015. Applications by pharmacists for approval to supply Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) medicines are considered by the Authority against the requirements of the Rules. The Authority cannot recommend that an application be approved if the requirements of the Rules are not met. In situations where an application is rejected and the applicant believes there are exceptional circumstances that may result in a community being left without reasonable access to PBS medicines, an applicant may request that I exercise my discretionary power under the National Health Act 1953 to approve the pharmacist to supply PBS medicines. A review of the Rules was undertaken in 2010 as (DVA) required under the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement, and the findings of that review are currently being considered by Government. I trust that the above information is of assistance. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Medical Research Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 7 July 2011 to the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Nicola Roxon MP, on behalf of the Standing Committee Digital on Petitions, regarding a submission requesting that the House of Representatives does not support a reduction in medical research funding. Your letter has been referred to me as the Minister responsible for health and medical research. I apologise for the delay in responding. There has never been more money invested in health and medical research in this nation than there is today, right now, under this Government. The Gillard Government has reconfirmed its commitment to health and medical research by maintaining the all-time high levels of funding to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) in the 2011-12 Budget. The Budget commits $746.1 million to the NHMRC for health and medical research. That is an increase of 4.3% on last year's funding of $715.5 million. The Government recognises the importance of health and medical research. The Government is also aware of the pressure for research institutes, universities, hospitals and health services more closely together. The disease burden continues to change with the growth of chronic diseases and the impact of ageing. It is critical that research be translated into improved clinical practice quickly, and that these imperatives are seen as part of the broader health reform agenda. To this end, the Government has commissioned an independent strategic review of health and medical research (the Review), which will focus on optimising Australia's capacity to produce world class health and medical research to 2020. Stakeholder participation will be critical to the Review, and there will be a broad range of consultations to ensure key stakeholders are able to engage in the process. Further information on the Review, including draft terms of reference, will be made available through the Department of Health and Ageing in the coming weeks. I appreciate your interest in health and medical research. from the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mr Butler Malabar Headland Dear Mr Murphy I refer to your letter of 22 August 2011 to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, the Hon Tony Burke MP, concerning a petition recently submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding ongoing public use by horse riders on the Malabar Headland, New South Wales. As the matter you have raised is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator the Hon Penny Wong, I have referred your letter to her office for attention. from the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke Statements",21
4,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," Today I have presented 10 petitions that the Petitions Committee has found to comply with the standing orders. I want to repeat a remark that I make from time to time. The to work committee may or may not agree with the contents of a petition but its role is not to decide whether a petition is acceptable for tabling on the basis of the members' personal beliefs; rather, the Petitions Committee's role is to consider whether a petition complies with the rules of the House in terms of its form, content and language. If it complies, the committee will authorise its presentation. This approach reflects the historic nature of petitions, the committee's role as a conduit between the people and the House, and the House's respect for freedom of speech. I would also like to point out that, in addition to House standing orders which govern petitioning, the Petitions Committee-and indeed all proceedings of parliament-are also guided by broader foundations of parliamentary practice. These foundations lay down some fundamental expectations of all who participate in the work of the parliament. This is something that petitioners need to consider when preparing petitions. The right of petitioning the Crown and parliament is not a modern activity; it has existed in the Westminster system since the 13th century. Petitions are essentially requests by citizens or residents for action by the House of Representatives. Petitions set out the issue that gives rise to the petition and then make a request of the House. For example, petitions may ask the House to: introduce legislation or appeal or change existing legislation; take action for a certain purpose for the benefit of particular persons; or redress a personal grievance, such as correction of an administrative error. Back in the days of King Edward I, the petitioning process was primarily used to redress personal grievances. Over the centuries, the basis of petitioning has evolved and developed such that petitioning now focuses less on individual grievances and more on issues affecting the collective. One of the reasons for this change is that there are now many other avenues for individuals to pursue the resolution of a personal grievance-for example, through approaching their local member of parliament. Agencies today that may also be relevant for Commonwealth matters include the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and bodies such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The petitioning process is therefore not usually the first port of call petitioners to seek a resolution or a solution to personal grievances, given that other often more specialised avenues exist to raise these matters. Engaging in the petitioning process, like any engagement an individual or a group of individuals undertakes with the parliament, should be undertaken in a considered and respectful manner. Finally, petitions are a powerful tool for the general public to air their views or issues with the possibility of influencing policy or causing action to be taken. Even if no action results immediately, one of the most valuable results of the process is that members and the government of the day are informed in a formal and public manner of the views of certain citizens on a given matter. Parallel to this ability is the expectation that petitioners will treat the process with care and respect, ensuring that petitions comply with the letter and spirit of the requirements of the House. NA Regional Australia Committee",32
5,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Good morning. Today I am happily representing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia, which is currently conducting an inquiry into the use of fly-in fly-out-FIFO-and drivein drive-out-DIDO-workforce practices in regional Australia. It has come at the behest of a number of communities throughout Australia and from members in this parliament. The member for Capricornia, for example, who is in the House at the moment, has been interested in this workforce practice for some time and was instrumental in having it referred to the regional Australia committee. We are inviting-indeed welcomingresponses from throughout Australia about the various aspects of fly-in fly-out and drive-in drive out workforce practices. In the for main, people normally associate it with mining, but it affects many other rural and regional areas of Australia as well. The committee has adopted the following terms of reference, which I would like to share with the House, in order to give a framework for people to respond: The Standing Committee on Regional Australia will inquire into and report on the use of 'fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) and 'drive-in, drive-out' (DIDO) workforce practices in regional Australia, with specific reference to:  the extent and projected growth in FIFO/DIDO work practices, including in which regions and key industries this practice is utilised;  costs and benefits for companies, and individuals, choosing a FIFO/DIDO workforce as an alternative to a resident workforce;  the effect of a non-resident FIFO/DIDO workforce on established communities, including community well-being, services and infrastructure;  the impact on communities sending large numbers of FIFO/DIDO workers to mine sites;  long term strategies for economic diversification in towns with large FIFO/DIDO workforces;  key skill sets targeted for mobile workforce employment, and opportunities for ongoing training and development;  provision of services, infrastructure and housing availability for FIFO/DIDO workforce employees;  strategies to optimise FIFO/DIDO experience for employees and their families, communities and industry;  potential opportunities for non-mining communities with narrow economic bases to diversify their economic base by providing a FIFO/DIDO workforce;  current initiatives and responses of the Commonwealth, State and Governments; and  any other related matter. The concept of fly-in fly-out, drive-in driveout-indeed, float-in float-out, literally, by those who arrive at work sites by boat-is a phenomenon which began in the late 1940s in the offshore oil sector in the Gulf of Mexico. As the offshore oil industry-the gas industry et cetera-developed, so FIFO expanded with it. Indeed, figures I have recently seen estimate that, for instance, in the late 1980s, with the developments in the North Sea, something like 60,000 workers were working in the North Sea as FIFOs. That of course has now developed throughout the world, particularly in the resources sector and more so in Australia. The idea of establishing a mine and then a town around the mine-and I use as an example the west coast of Tasmania, which is part of my electorate-and the town becoming a mining town meant there was a robust community of long-term economic development and a very close association between that community, the workforce and the mine. In many cases that is now breaking down. So, we wish to discover, if this is a fact of life, what strategies exist, what strategies can exist to make that a better association and behaviour, and what are some of the detriments and strategies we can use to combat these. These are just some of the issues we will be looking at in the inquiry.",33
6,Mr HAASE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to make a statement about the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia into the use of fly-in fly-out and drive-in drive-out workforce practices in regional Australia. The committee adopted this inquiry on 23 August 2011 after the matter was referred to the committee by the Minister for Regional Territory Australia, Regional Development and Local Government. There has been significant public and media interest in the inquiry. Many regional members in this chamber will be familiar with work practices commonly known as FIFO, where workers are flown to a work site-most commonly a mine-for a shift lasting up to several weeks and are then flown home for a break of some days or weeks. The practice has been in place in Western Australia for many years, it is rapidly expanding in Queensland, and it is being introduced as DIDO-drive-in driveout-across New South Wales. While this is not a new practice, it has expanded in recent years with such rapidity that it is time that the community, industry and government gained a better understanding of the impact of the practice. It is for this reason that the Standing Committee on Regional Australia sought to have this inquiry. The committee is hoping to gain a thorough understanding of the extent of FIFO/DIDO work practices and the impacts they have on both the towns that host these mobile workforces and the 'home base' towns that see many of their residents coming and going for long work shifts. We want to understand what the costs and benefits are for individuals, families and companies that choose a FIFO/DIDO work practice over developing a resident workforce as well as what impacts the practice has on communities. The committee has a blank sheet of paper. It has no predetermined idea of what the outcomes of this inquiry will be; however, we do know that we are looking for ideas to strengthen regional Australia and for long term strategies for economic diversification in those towns that host large FIFO/DIDO workforces. The committee also wants to find out more about skilling: what skills are targeted for FIFO/DIDO employment and how individuals access further training and development. Is there a skills drain being felt in some areas as people take up FIFO/DIDO employment, and what can be done about this? The deputy chair of the committee, the member for Braddon, reports that Tasmanian workers are being tempted by FIFO jobs in South Australia, leaving his electorate looking for skilled tradespeople. Clearly, this is an issue that needs a 'big picture' examination. The terms of reference for this committee are wide ranging. Already we have heard concerns about air safety, health funding, taxation, family and relationship breakdown and the loneliness of the FIFO bachelor. The cost of housing, antisocial behaviour and how to optimise the FIFO/DIDO experience for families are also on the committee's agenda. In my electorate of Durack, 51 per cent of the mining workforce are already working on a fly-in fly-out or drive-in driveout basis, and this is of great concern. It turns out to be almost a love-hate relationship. The practice suits some incredibly well and it does not suit others. The drain of skills out of rural communities to FIFO and DIDO workforces is causing major problems in some areas and yet, for those who are developing resources in Western Australia, often the only way is to deploy a FIFO workforce. I would encourage members of this place to get involved in this inquiry. The committee can, of course, supplementary members appointed; however, I would ask those members whose electorates are impacted in any way by FIFO or DIDO work practices to let their constituents know about this inquiry and encourage people to make a submission. The committee secretariat has some resources that members can distribute, post on their websites or distribute with newsletters. Submissions close on 7 October and after that the committee will be deciding on a public hearing schedule. We have already been invited to travel widely through Western Australia and Queensland and the committee will also focus its attention on other areas of the country where the practice is having an impact. I sincerely hope that we hear from as many people as possible who are impacted by FIFO/DIDO work practices in order to inform the committee and also future governments about how this practice can be used to strengthen regional Australia.",34

8,Mr KATTER,BILLS," In presenting this bill to the House I commend and congratulate the senator from South Australia who is often referred to as the farmers friend and the voice of the village. In this case, the village is paying twice what they should be paying for their fruit and vegetables in Australia and the farmer is getting half. In other words, the people in the middle are arguably getting 400 per cent have more than they should be getting. Let me be very specific. These figures were compiled by Senator Xenophon and his staff. They were not very hard to compile because the markets give you a market quotation for the value of an orange every day in the markets. So anyone can find out what the farmer is getting paid. And of course you can find out what the consumers pay by simply walking into the supermarket. So it is not very profoundly hard to get these figures. It was profoundly hard for the ACCC-those people who assure us of no competition. Let me quote figures-and these are just ordinary, everyday fruit and vegetable items: apples-the supermarket pays the farmer $2 and charges the consumer $5.98; oranges18c a kilogram to the farmer, $1.98 to the consumer; potatoes-35c to the farmer, $2.98 to the consumer; broccoli-$1 to the farmer, $1.92 to the consumer; and cabbages-55c to the farmer, $2.38 to the consumer. That is 199 per cent on the first item; 1,000 per cent on the second item; 751 per cent on the third item; 92 per cent on the fourth item; and 333 per cent on the fifth item. How long is this parliament going to continue to accept the oligopolistic pricing regime in the supermarkets of Australia? I have said continuously in this place, wasting my breath, because no-one here seems to care: within three years, Australia will be a net importer of food. Every four days-I have not seen the latest figures, but two or three years ago these figures were from a comprehensive report-a farmer commits suicide in Australia. Seven years ago we became a net importer of pork, thanks to the decisions taken by the LNP in this House. Four years ago we became a net importer of fruit and vegetables-the items I am talking about here. We cannot feed ourselves in fruit and vegetables. Two years ago we became a net importer of seafood. The projections for this year are that 72 per cent of our seafood will be bought into this country, so we cannot feed ourselves in seafood. So it is not remarkable for those who have been following this story to know that within three years we will be a net importer of food. The Fin Review already claims that we are now a net importer of food. I can use different statistics which might push it out to nine years, but there is not the slightest doubt in any set of statistics you want to use that this country will not be able to feed itself within three years. Who is to blame? We have come into this place and said again and again that we are asked to meet conditions of health and hygiene in our production, which are not remotely being met. Let me take the case of prawns. Our prawns have to be grown in absolutely pristine water. It has to be regulated on its way in so that it is pure and free of bacteria, but then it has to be regulated on its way out, pure and free of bacteria. All water contains some bacteria. The impositions upon this industry have simply closed it down. I am the minister given the credit for starting this industry off, for which I deserve no credit. It was the six entrepreneurs: Wahedy, Coco, Sciacca and the very famous Irwin Vidor. They are the people that deserve the credit and, probably most of all, Jimmy Ryall and Dr Joe Baker from the Institute of Marine Science that commenced this industry. We started off with great hopes. We felt that we would overtake Thailand in prawn production by the year 2000-this was about the midto late eighties. We reckoned that over the next 15 years we would catch up to Thailand. Thailand was on $2,000 million a year of production, and we forged ahead. We went up to, I think, $65 or $85 millionsome figure like that-within a few short years. Starting from scratch, we went zoom and were on course to catch them. After the environmentalists had finished with us, we are now down to $24 million, and I think very shortly we will have no production at all. That would be my prediction. Let's have a look at the prawns that are coming in. Those are the impositions that are placed upon the Australian industry. You have to have twice the number of ponds plus there is twice the amount of water because you have got to put clean water back into ocean. I said, 'What contaminant is there?' They said, 'The prawns do their business in the water.' 'Do they have toilets out in the ocean for the prawns?' They said, 'Concentration' and I said, 'Good. I was waiting, Mr Environmentalist, for you to say that because we have fought again and again to have the sewerage outfall into the oceans stopped.' They said, 'Oh no. It dissipates.' You could write a treatise on this, couldn't you? Human waste dissipates but prawn waste concentrates. It just demonstrates that these people completely out of control. They are dangerous and they are evil. The environmentalist movement in Australia has moved from being a great asset to this country to a cancer. Here is their handiwork. Let's go back to Thailand. Australia has gone down from $65 million to $25 million; Thailand has gone up to over $8,000 million. All of our agricultural exports in Australia200 items-only amount to $28,000 million. Thailand has got $8,000 million in a single industry. Their sugar industry is now rivalling ours-it might even be bigger than ours now. These are two industries. They are forging ahead of us. We will run out of coal, we will run out of iron ore and, when we do, this country will be bankrupt. I want to put on the record that I said this in the year of our Lord 2011. I pleaded with this parliament to wake up to itself. You have destroyed agriculture in this country and are destroying it whilst I speak. Everyone knows the Americans are that whingeing, crying, screaming and howling over Walmart. Walmart and its nearest competitor, the big two in America, have 23 per cent of the market. Depending on what set of figures you want to use in Australia, between 88 per cent and 92 per cent of the Australian market is held by the big two. There is no country on earth that would the allow two players to dominate the market. They would not allow it on any items at all, but of all items they would not allow it on those-the anti-trust legislation would have smashed them long ago in the United States. Similarly, that would happen in Britain, France, Germany, Japan or any country you want a name. But not here in Australia, where we suffer the power of the great corporations. I did the figures some years ago on milk, when this parliament decided that it would facilitate the deregulation of the dairy are industry. Here is the letter from Dairy Farmers to farmers in my electorate. On the day of deregulation the price for milk was 59c; the day after it was 42c. (Time expired) Bill read a first time.",35

10,Mr KATTER,BILLS," If I go into a hotel or public place and people do not know who I am, I try desperately to avoid admitting that I am a politician. When I was a young man, politicians had great respect, and they deserved that respect. They had fought great battles for us. We had worked for nothing and we had died down the mines in horrific accidents or of the terrible 'miners-titis'. One in 31 of us, in fact, died down the mines or from what we encountered down there. The politicians in the Labor Party fought the great fight and changed all of that for us. Those men were heroes. If you read my history of Australia you will see them as great heroes-the likes of Ted Theodore and the other great Labor leaders before the Second World War. Curtin and Chifley were prominent amongst those before and, to some extent, even after the war. We praise greatly those men. After the war, my family became members of the then Country Party, which fought great battles for us and secured statutory marketing. When Jack MCEwen left this parliament, he said: 'I can stand up here and proudly say that, as I leave this place, every single rural industry is protected by marketing arrangements.' That was true even in beef. Under the beef agreements with Japan and Great Britain, we had a very highly protected situation. MCEwen said: 'It delivers to our farming sector not a great wealth but a solid prosperity.' What a great statement to make. What a great man. That was why people admired, respected and looked up to politicians. Now, today, we are pariahs. Of the top 30 professions in Australia, I think we rank second last. In those days we were in the top three or four. Why have we moved down? Does anyone care that thousands of jobs vanished overseas in the last few weeks with the announcements by Qantas and BlueScope or that a whole apple industry is being exported offshore? Does anyone care? Is anyone going to raise those issues in here? Not likely. Does anyone care that a farmer commits suicide every four days in this country? Not likely. I have not heard anyone, except me, ever refer to it in this place. And I do not want to mention it anymore because I think I have blunted the edge that a statistic such as that should have for the conscience of every person in this place. Either Jack MCEwen, the policies of the Country Party and that great man Doug Anthony, who introduced the wool scheme, stunk or the current policies of the LNP and the ALP stink. I know which side of the fence I fall on. There is no doubt about that. And the poor old apple growers got theirs last month. The horticultural code of conduct is very interesting. Three or four elections ago the then leader of the LNP announced-and I am on record as praising him for it-that he was going to give us a mandatory code of conduct. The essence of this is twofold. Firstly, the farmer does not know what his produce is sold for. He sits up there in Mareeba or down on the Murray River or in Renmark in South Australia and has no idea. He sends his produce to market. He is out there picking the grapes, the oranges, the mangoes, the bananas or whatever; he does not have time to be sitting down in the markets every day watching what his produce, which goes to market on a daily basis, is being sold for. So he does not know what he should get paid. A lot of farmers are very nice and very trusting people-foolishly trusting people, in my opinion. They do not know what their product is sold for, so, quite frankly, an agent can tell them anything. He could sell mangoes for $40 a box and tell the farmer he sold them for $20 a box. There is no protection whatsoever. In the real estate industry there is a trust fund. In the legal industry there is a trust fund. In the insurance industry there is a trust fund. In every industry there is a trust fund to protect the person selling. But there is no trust fund in this industry. Why? The other issue is the supermarket giants: Woolworth and Coles. Again, we do not know what they pay for produce. There is a little game that is played here-and I speak with authority about it because I own a small mango farm, so I know. The game is as follows. Every farmer, for reasons we do not fully understand, will get a turn at being the first farmer off, so he will get spectacular prices-he will get $45 a box or whatever it is-for mangoes, which they will be pulling next month. But then, as all the other farmers start to come on, the price will tumble back down to $12 or $15 a box. The Woolworths or Coles manager has bought mangoes at $45 and thinks: 'Heavens! I'm going to lose my job here.' So he has a look at those mangoes and finds out that they are speckled and says, 'Jeez-we took these on consignment.' The truth is that he did not take them on consignment; he bought them. But there is no proof. So the trust fund is the first arm of this legislation; the second is a sales docket. I hope the Prime Minister will not mind my quoting her here. When I was talking to her about my 20-point wish list for the Prime Minister, she said: 'Bob, you can't be serious. Are you telling me seriously that they will not give a sales docket?' She could not believe it, and I think most Australians and most people in this House who are not familiar with fruit and vegetables would also find it hard to believe. For everything you buy, from a hamburger to a banana to a motor car or a house, there is a sales docket-there is evidence of sale. The only group of people who are not allowed to have a sales docket are the farmers of Australiaand they are suffering greatly as a result, to the eternal shame of the LNP, who promised that sales docket in the election. I do not have time to read out the quote from the then leader of the National Party, but I will say that Peter MCGauran-a man of some integrity-went to the point of losing his portfolio because he thought, 'We cannot promise before an election something as important as this and then betray the farmers after the election.' So the honourable member from Toowoomba, who is not bound by such requirements, was put in charge of the legislation, and Mr MCGauran risked his ministry. The end result of all this was that the promise was flagrantly broken, that the farmers were treated with absolute contempt and that the interests of the big corporations, whether they be agents or Coles and Woolworths and so on, were looked by the LNP in this place. Those are the sad facts of life. We have had three years since, and we have failed to get out of the ALP either. Why wouldn't you give the farmer evidence of sale? Every other sale that takes place in the world and in this country gets it, but all the poor old farmer gets is the rough end of the pineapple. If you are genuine-if you are fair dinkum-then you will vote for this bill. But, if you do not, do not have the hypocrisy to go back to your electorate and tell them that you did. I am sending out a letter to every single newspaper in the electorate of every single country member in this place and saying: 'That's what we asked for; your member of parliament wouldn't even give you a sales docket-throw them out. But, if they vote for this, then you congratulate them and thank them.' So there is the choice, and it will be put in on the front page-if I get my way-of every country newspaper in Australia.

13,Mr WILKIE,BILLS," The Telecommunications Amendment (Enhancing Community Consultation) Bill 2011 would change the Telecommunications Act 1997 to allow for greater input from local communities about telecommunications developments-in particular, about mobile phone base stations proposed to be developed in their areas. This bill would make several important changes to the Telecommunications Act. For a start, it would expand the number of people who would require notification when a telecommunications tower was proposed to be built or substantially modified. At the moment, only the owner or occupier of the land on which the new tower will be built must be notified, meaning that owners and occupiers of land immediately adjacent to a major development may not even know about the development until construction commences. There is a belief in the community that it is currently a requirement that everyone within 100 metres of the new tower be notified; but this is not enshrined law and is often ignored. This bill would provide certainty about that and stipulate notification of those within a more sensible distance of 500 metres from a new tower. The bill would also extend the amount of time for owners or occupiers of affected land to respond. The act currently gives them just 10 business days to respond after being notified-a hard task for local landholders and an even harder task for councils, which often have to consult subcommittees or public meetings. The bill would give them a much fairer 30 business days to respond after being notified. Moreover, the bill would restrict the types of developments which can be declared under legislative instruments-in particular the low-impact determination which allows new developments to avoid scrutiny under state or local planning laws. I understand the necessity for some projects to be classified as low impact and therefore regulated federally; but there have been numerous cases where it has been clear that low-impact telecommunications facilities will actually have a very high impact on local communities and that they therefore deserve further scrutiny. To that end, this bill declares that no new telecommunications tower may be categorised as low impact and that, for an extension to a tower to be declared low impact, it must not extend the height of the tower by more than one metre. The bill would also remove the ability of telecommunications carriers to extend the size and capacity of towers under the guise of routine maintenance. Currently the size of antennae extending from the top of the tower is not included in official measurements of the dimensions of towers and this allows carriers to extend antennae often by metres without any scrutiny whatsoever. In other words, this bill would remove the ability of carriers to extend potentially highly visible in and disturbing antennae without scrutiny and includes any antennae extended from the top of a tower into the official measurements of that tower. There is also a belief in the community that high-impact telecommunications tower developments will always be subject to state and local government approval, but in fact the current legislation allows the Australian Communications and Media Authority to issue facility installation permits to allow carriers to install high-impact facilities which have not been granted planning approval by state or local planning authorities. This bill would ensure that such permits are only issued in genuinely extraordinary circumstances. Moreover, under the current legislation, to grant a facility installation permit ACMA must decide, among other things, that the proposed facility is an important part of a nationally significant telecommunications network, but this bill would disallow ACMA from considering specifically the commercial interests of carriers when making this decision. Additionally, current legislation does not require ACMA to consider community sensitive sites properly when deciding whether or not to grant a facility installation permit to a proposed facility near a community sensitive site. Currently ACMA must only be satisfied that other less sensitive sites have been considered. Quite simply, this bill would raise that standard making it fairer to communities. Now ACMA would have to be satisfied that all alternative, less sensitive sites are unfeasible, and in any case the authority could not grant a permit within 100 metres of a community sensitive site, such as a school or local landmark. This bill would also make it fairer for communities wishing to appeal a facility installation permit being granted. Under the current act, only carriers may lodge an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, but this bill would expand that right to local communities, thereby ensuring that communities and carriers are on a level playing field when disputes arise. The bill would also address the criteria whereby ACMA must notify the public about new developments. Under the current framework, ACMA must take its advice from industry representative bodies when deciding who to inform about new developments, but this bill would repeal that requirement and instead mandate that ACMA must consider the potential impact of the proposed development on the local community which will live with it every day. If these changes seem basic, it is because they are. I understand that there must be a fundamental balance in this debate between the public interest in having fast and reliable mobile communications on the one hand and the public interest in not having inappropriate and hastily planned developments springing up all around our communities on the other. For too long this balance has been skewed in favour of telecommunications companies, who under the current legislation have carte blanche to place new telecommunications facilities essentially wherever they please. Communities are finding themselves in a position where they have no place to turn. The simple fact that the current act restricts the ability to lodge an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to carriers who have had permits disallowed suggests something is wrong with the level of community consultation in our telecommunications laws. A case in point is Optus's proposal to build a tower on top of my local Woolworths in Sandy Bay. Originally it was declared by the carrier to be a low-impact facility, even though it would literally tower over a heritage neighbourhood and be an eyesore from nearby historic Battery Point. Yes, community pressure seems to have forced Optus to recategorise the development as high impact, and now the Hobart City Council is considering the proposal, but the community should have been spared the heartache in the first place and there still is no certainty that ACMA will not just ride in at the eleventh hour and issue a permit regardless of the council's determination. Congratulations and thankyou to Anthea Hopkins for leading the community revolt against this inappropriate development. This example is just one of the many reasons I am very pleased to present this bill to the House. For too long communities have been unable to have a say in where in new towers spring up in their area. The playing field has been skewed towards the commercial self interest of the telecommunications companies. I have had people from all around the country call my office complaining about the sense of hopelessness they feel when they are informed-if, indeed, they are informed at all-that a significant development will happen right next to their house and that there is next to nothing they can do about it. Some communities have fought developments and some of them have been successful, but many more have failed, though not through want of time and effort. The consistent message I get from those who have succeeded is: it should not be this difficult. I agree with those communities: it should not require public protest; it should not require lobbying politicians and courting media to get some kind of say about a development happening in your own backyard. I propose that this bill, the Telecommunications Amendment (Enhancing Community Consultation) Bill 2011, strikes the correct balance between developing our mobile telecommunications into the future and giving our communities real input into how we should do it. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",40
14,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Fair Protection for Firefighters) Bill 2011 Second Reading",42
15,Mr BANDT,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Day after day, week after week and year after year in our homes, our workplaces, our towns and our farms, firefighters put their lives and their safety on the line for us. The risk that faces a firefighter when they walk into a building, a structure or a home that is burning, or when they walk into a bushfire these the likes of which we saw in Victoria on Black Saturday recently, is very obvious. But what is often less well known is that one of the greatest risks to a firefighter's health and their life comes not from those few moments, minutes or hours when they are fighting a fire but from what happens to them afterwards. That is because in an average home there are around 70,000 synthetic chemicals, and when they burn they produce a toxic cocktail of chemical smoke, with many compounds that we have not even properly identified the health consequences of yet. At the same time as everyone else is fleeing to get out of there, the firefighters put themselves right in the midst of that smoke. In many parts of Australia we have some of the world's best protective equipment, breathing apparatus and turnout gear that the firefighters wear. But, because they are in an environment where their heart rate is up and they are working hard, of course the material has to be able to breathe-otherwise the firefighter would expire; they would suffocate. In the same way that it lets their body heat out, it lets that toxic chemical smoke in. When it does that, it comes at enormous, almost unpreventable risk to the firefighter. What we know is that firefighters start in their career, as you would expect, about 20 per cent healthier than the average member of the population. But within five years, studies have shown, they can be almost twice as likely as the average person to contract leukaemia, and the risk of testicular cancer and other forms of cancer is much, much higher than that. It is for that reason that elsewhere around the world governments of conservative and progressive persuasionsin seven out of 10 provinces in Canada and many states in the United States of America-have changed the law so that firefighters who suffer those sorts of cancers are much more easily able to access compensation for themselves and their families. The reason that is important is that at moment, when a firefighter goes and seeks compensation for a work related injury for that kind of cancer, they get asked: 'Can you tell us at which specific fire you contracted that cancer?' Of course that is impossible. many of them are right now suffering and many have died unable to access proper compensation. What the Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Fair Protection for Firefighters) Bill 2011 will do is reverse the onus so that for certain kinds of cancers where there is strong medical evidence in support it would be presumed that that cancer is work related unless it can be proved otherwise. This will make a world of difference to the people who protect us. I introduced this bill at the beginning of July, and since then the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee has spent the intervening time inquiring into the provisions. I am extremely pleased to note that the report, which the Senate received only on Thursday, has as its main recommendation 'that the bill be passed'. In fact it makes recommendations, each of which will improve and expand the scope of this bill. If one wanted any reminder about why this was necessary, just think about the fire that we had here in Canberra on Friday. At the same time as police were going around evacuating people from the site and preventing them from attending, firefighters were going the other way, right into the middle of a toxic cocktail of chemicals. That is what they do every day. It is not just chemical factories, as I said, that pose a risk to firefighters; it is what is in every ordinary household. I would like to close by quoting the Senate committee inquiry report: The committee recognises that when a person spends their professional career inhaling and the absorbing known-and probably some as yet unknown-carcinogens in the course of public service, it is the moral duty of the community to enable them to seek compensation should they fall ill as a consequence. So That is what we here in this House have the power to do and it is what we should do. I am extraordinarily pleased that, as is the case Safety, in other parts of the world, this is proceeding with cross-party support. I commend the bill.",42
16,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded?,43
17,Mr Katter,BILLS,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,43
18,Ms VAMVAKINOU,BILLS," I rise also to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Fair Protection for Firefighters) Bill 2011, which was first introduced into the House in early July. I, the member for Melbourne and the member for MCMillan jointly sponsored this bill to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, or what is known as the Comcare legislation. I want to thank the members for four their contribution to this very important issue and for the constructive way in which this bill is presented before the House today. I felt compelled to raise the issue of fair protection for firefighters in an adjournment debate after meeting with a delegation from the United Firefighters Union of Australia who came to Canberra to raise awareness about the life-threatening aspects of their profession and to speak to us about the occupational health and safety concerns of those involved in the firefighting profession. Since the bill's introduction, the Senate Standing Committees on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations has held an inquiry that looked into the fair protection for firefighters bill and the case for presumptive legislation. The multiparty committee received many submissions and witness statements from individuals and organisations and, having conducted site visits-which included one to Tullamarine Airport in my own electorate to view a demonstration by aviation firefighterstabled its report last Thursday in the Senate. In thanking the member for Melbourne and the member for MCMillan, I would also like to thank the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, chaired by Senator Gavin Marshall. I welcome the committee's report and its endorsement by members of the committee. This has been a comprehensive investigation and it is now this parliament's job to consider the findings of this investigation. The Senate committee's report identifies key findings and recommendations guided by the facts, as is the case in the United States and Canada when it comes to fair protection for firefighters. In both those countries presumptive legislation already exists, and it is time for this parliament to enact similar legislation. Key findings of the Senate report reaffirm the original purpose of this bill, which is to provide for a rebuttable presumption for firefighters to access assistance and compensation if they are diagnosed with listed life-threatening diseases after the qualifying period of service. There are 14 listed types of cancers, and it is about recognising where, when a firefighter contracts one of these cancers, the burden of proof should sit, with appropriate safeguards in place. The Senate report also affirms the fact that there is compelling scientific evidence demonstrating that cancer is an occupational disease for firefighters. We now know that firefighters are indeed at a greater risk of contracting some cancers because they are exposed to toxins and carcinogens in the course of the firefighting profession. The report also found that firefighters can never be fully protected from the hazard of absorbing toxins and carcinogens as the firefighting protective clothing must be able to breathe; otherwise, the firefighter would perish from metabolic heat build-up. It also found that the current legislation is an inadequate mechanism to achieve the objective of providing assistance and compensation for work related illness for firefighters. The fact is that there is scientific evidence; there is a non-exhaustive list of occupational cancers directly associated with the firefighting profession. There is also evidence of the positive benefits that have resulted from legislation similar to that before us in North America, where there is not only an increased awareness of cancer among firefighters but also a more proactive approach to the health and well-being of firefighters, earlier detection of cancer and therefore a better chance of treatment and survival. That has a positive impact for recruitment and retention in fire services. We should note these facts and be guided by them. Concerns about the possible flow-on effects, notions of a flood of claims and costs associated with similar presumptive legislation in Canada and the Unites States, are entirely negligible, as the Senate report has identified. If ever there was proof of the courageous and essential work that our firefighters do it was, as the member for Melbourne said, here in Canberra last week, when our firefighters had to battle a huge chemical blaze as a result of a toxic explosion. That is an example of the hazardous nature of this job. And it is not only the big toxic fires that risk firefighters' health but everyday household fires, with which the risks increase with the length of service. It is important, therefore, that this parliament continues to reflect the evidence based approach to this issue shown so far by the members and senators who have contributed to this debate in a non-partisan way and that it recognise the importance of enacting presumptive legislation through the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Fair Protection for Firefighters) Bill 2011. I commend the bill to the House.",43
19,Mr KATTER,BILLS," I want to pay tribute to the United Firefighters Union of Australia. Unionism is something that seems to be maligned almost continuously in the media throughout Australia, and I am sure that the corporate owners of the media think it is a good idea to have no unions so they do not have to pay anyone very much money. In this case, I was a very reluctant starter. Staff had to sit me down and bang me on the head with the statistics. The firefighters union put forward a very professionally prepared brief and they had unassailable statistics. Clearly the incidence of cancer in firefighters was way out of proportion with that of the rest of the population. We know, of course, that certain chemicals are carcinogenic and breathing them can lead to cancer-as I have said many times in this House in relation to exhaust fumes from motorcars. Before we had effective unionism in this country, one in 31 of us went down the mines, and this was really a mining and, to a lesser extent, a shearing country. All we had in the 1890s and 1900s was our mining industry. The one in 31 of us that went down the mines died down the mines or died the terrible death from 'miner's titus' when they came up. Humphrey MCQueen and his social sketches of Australia went into the fact that everyone that worked for over two years digging the sewerage ditches in Sydney died of miner's titus. So we know that there are certain chemicals that, if they are breathed in, will tend to cause cancer. The firefighters union have made their case very professionally, and today we see again the value of trade unionism, as we saw before the start of last century. I am very, very proud of the fact that my great-grandad put £3,000 behind the strike fund in the 1890s. In terms of today's money, £3,000 is nearly $1 million. All right, he was very wealthy but, at the end of the day, he was a storekeeper in Charters Towersalbeit Charters Towers was bigger than Brisbane in those days-and he made the decision to isolate himself socially from so many of the rich and socially prominent people in the community, not that that would have worried him. He is in the history books as backing that, and I am very proud to say that it is a tradition that our family have upheld for many, many years and I hope will continue in the future. In backing up the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Fair Protection for Firefighters) Bill 2011 moved by the honourable member, I praise him for his work here. I also praise the members from the Liberal Party and Labor Party who have supported this legislation. The fact is that, if you work as a fireman, you will breathe in fumes that will tend to give you cancer. You will have a far greater chance of contracting cancer than anyone else in society today. These people risk their lives. I think all of us watched the footage 7-11, which probably brought out most graphically how these people did not think, they looked neither right nor left-they just went in and did their duty, and many of them died. Many of our firefighters in Australia have also died-maybe in less huge, but in very similar, conditions. So we pay them a great tribute and we also pay their union a very great tribute in bringing this to the attention of the House, and in winning over even sceptics and opponents such as me.",45
20,Mr BROADBENT,BILLS," Thank you to the member for Kennedy for his remarks on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Fair Protection for Firefighters) Bill 2011. He has been won over by the argument. I think that is very important-quite often the Australian public do not get a chance to see arguments being put in this place that win over a member of parliament-even though he does not seem to have suffered a lot of damage from his staff knocking him about as he has claimed! I also recognise the member for Melbourne's and the member for Calwell's work in this and the interest that they have taken in the interests of firemen and their families, having regard to the issue they brought before us in the first place. Secondly, I recognise that their actions have meant we are able to go through a process whereby we were able to go to a Senate committee and have the issues, can I say without any pun intended, flushed out. Before I go on, I promised myself at the start of this year that I would recognise those that have gone before us. I am not talking just about Indigenous people and I am not talking just about those who came on tall ships or our leaders of the nation; I am talking about people like Peter Marshall, the national secretary of the United Firefighters Union, and all those who have gone before him, who work in the interests of their union and the of people that they represent and serve. It is not just about Peter; it is about all of the people. We heard the member for Kennedy talk about his great-grandfather. He had a lot of money if he could put £3,000 into a strike fund on behalf of unionists of the day. It just shows you that this House is made up of many a complex person. We are not, any one of us, like all the others. And the stories that come out are often interesting. I also want to note today, because it is important to me, that the member for Brand is in the parliament at the very moment. He has had a few hiccoughs along the way with his health. We welcome him back and we appreciate the fact that he is well and up to the task of doing the job on behalf on his constituency and this nation. Having said that, it is very clear to me that there may be some in the House who have concerns about this bill. You heard the member for Caldwell say that if you have concerns after reading the report-she outlined a couple of them-it is only right to raise them with the executive government. What I do not want to happen here is that a report as important as this one is for firefighters and their families-in the arguments that it makes and the facts that it lays out-is put on a shelf somewhere to collect dust. That is not what I am here for. I am here to learn that the report will properly be addressed by executive government, and if it needs further consideration or further inquiry, or people need to be reassured, let them put their concerns before the minister and have them addressed. Go back to someone who has the information, because to me it is fairly clear that if you are a fireman in this country today, you will be dealing with toxic fires that we did not have to deal with 10, 20 or 30 years ago. If a car burns now we do not know what the toxins are that come out of it-toxins that have detrimental health effects causing cancer in firemen here and around the world. Although the member for Kennedy said 711 I think he meant 9-11. That event brought home to all of us that there were those who were killed on the day-I believe, to this day, that there could have been many more people killed-and there were those who have suffered after that massive event. I put it to you that firemen in this country are no different. They go out and put their lives on the line. In doing so, in the long run they put the health and well-being of themselves and their families on the line as well. It behoves this parliament to consider what the report has recommended and act on this bill on behalf of these people, especially those three little boys I saw over there in the Senate courtyard today. Debate adjourned. Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011 Second Reading",46
21,Mr ENTSCH,BILLS," by leave-on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition I move: That this bill be read a second time. I rise to strongly support the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011 introduced into this House by the Leader of the Opposition on 12 September 2011. The existing wild rivers legislation was put in place by the Queensland state Labor government in 2005. The existing laws gave the state government the power to declare any river a 'wild river', which allows the government to enforce a whole range of restrictions and regulations on what you can and cannot do on any land within certain ranges of that river or watercourse. These Queensland government laws have negatively impacted on locals in Cape York, particularly Indigenous people. It is rather ironic that after decades and decades of campaigning by Indigenous people to recover some of their country at a time when they are becoming one of the major landholders within Cape York they are faced with the challenge of being able to do very little with the land because of the restrictions put in place by this legislation. It is no doubt that it is an agenda begin driven by the Wilderness Society and by an obliging and compliant state Labor government. Many of the opportunities for these people who have campaigned for so long to get their own country back are being put at threat by this legislation. It seems like great rhetoric when you hear those on the other side always talking about recognition of land management by our Indigenous people for 40,000-odd years, but when there is an opportunity for Indigenous people to get out there and do something on their own country they are immediately stifled by this type of legislation. So much for closing the gap! The Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011 has been presented by the Leader of the Opposition to give freedom back to landowners in Cape York, particularly the traditional owners, and to give them an opportunity to be consulted on decisions that are being made on their own land. This is something that needs to be seriously considered. This bill is effectively being introduced for a fourth time into this place. The original Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2010 was introduced into the House of Representatives by the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, on 8 February 2010 as a private member's bill. A bill with identical wording was then introduced into the Senate as a private senator's bill, the Wild (Environmental Management) Bill 2010 [No. 2], on 23 February 2010 by Senator the Hon. Nigel Scullion. The latter bill passed the Senate and was introduced into the House of Representatives on June Unfortunately, both bills lapsed when parliament was dissolved prior to the 2010 election. After the 2010 federal election the bill was again reintroduced on 15 November 2010. In an attempt to frustrate parliamentary process, the Labor-Greens alliance moved to have this bill referred to a parliamentary committee which was designed to do nothing but stall and halt the progress of the legislation until Labor had the Greens and the Greens got the balance of power in the Senate. Unfortunately, that bill lapsed. Last week the Leader of the Opposition introduced this bill to reiterate its importance to the economic development of Cape York Aboriginal people in particular and to recognise their stewardship over their own country and give them the opportunity to have a say and make decisions in relation to the long-term future of that country. Sadly, the Labor-Greens alliance has, again, referred this latest bill to another committee in a further attempt to totally delay and frustrate the parliamentary process. There are some additions in this bill and I think these are quite appropriate, given some of the mischief that has been espoused by the other side. One is the new definitions of Aboriginal land, owner and register under clause 3, and the definition of 'native title' is deleted. There is a new clause 4(3)(b), which provides a guarantee that the Commonwealth government should provide employment to persons who lose employment as a result of the enactment of the wild rivers. This one is Rivers particularly important given that, in an attempt to bribe some groups within the community, the state government has spent a lot of money in training up wild rivers rangers and there is a concern that these 2010. rangers, if the wild rivers legislation is thrown out or amended, may lose their jobs. This gives them a very strong guarantee that this is not the case. The reality is in Cape York, while the Wilderness Society and the Greens and the government obsess over this wild rivers legislation, the majority of national parks up there are under-resourced, they have no management plans whatsoever and many of them are not even manned. So there is tremendous opportunity for wild rivers rangers to be able to go onto country that has been handed back. Rather than tokenism about handing back national parks to traditional owners, it provides a great opportunity for these traditional owners to play a very significant role in the management and be the face of these national parks as rangers and have that appropriate training. Another difference in this bill is that it omits the term 'traditional owners' and substitutes 'owner', and 'native title land' is omitted and substituted with 'Aboriginal land'. Owners are required to agree in writing. A new clause 6 relates to obtaining agreement of native title holders, which should have been there right from the beginning. Amended clause 8 provides for regulations to be made. Clause 8(2)(c) provides for regulations concerning the continued employment of Aboriginal people if their employment should be lost. I reiterate that these laws have seriously and negatively impacted on local Cape York people, particularly our Indigenous people. Recently, Mr Gerhardt Pearson of the Balkanu Cape York Development Corporation: … strongly expressed concerns about the potential impact of wild rivers declarations on economic development opportunities indigenous people on Cape York. Some critical issues in relation to legislation include the onerous and unnecessary process for development approvals in wild river areas. A very good example of this was outlined in an episode of the Law Report on the ABC on 5 October 2010. It was a story in relation to the community of Lockhart River, which is on the eastern cape. There are currently massive levels of unemployment up there, as there are in many remote communities. The biggest private sector employer is a biofuels company called Evergreen and it employs about 10 people. So we certainly need more private sector development in supporting the communities in this area. For this one to be out there actively working with the community, to drive the creation of jobs, can only be a good thing, but wild rivers is certainly not allowing this to happen. In fact, they have been very restricted in any opportunities for expansion. The government puts its hand on its chest and says, 'We are providing opportunities through the employment of rangers.' There was a very relevant comment made there at Lockhart River that having two rangers really does not make a great deal of economic sense, insofar as they would rather have a biodiesel plantation that would not just take the two rangers but also provide economic opportunities for at least another 100 people in that region. It would certainly be a hell of a lot more beneficial for the community. It is interesting to note, in fact, that the Lockhart River airstrip would not even have been able to be built if the wild rivers legislation was in place at the time, because it is within a high-preservation area, as declared on any land within 1,000 metres of any designated river. Staying in that eastern area, the Hopevale community has been desperately trying to for establish a banana plantation. Now, they are not a wild rivers designated area, but they have gone through all of the hoops, all the different government bureaucracies, in trying to get approval to establish the plantation over the last three years-this is an opportunity for something like 200 jobs in the region, a great opportunity. They have a small area that they have set aside now. They have about 300 trees, and they have been training community members enthusiastically to build on this plantation. It has taken three years so far to get to this stage, where they have only 300 trees and are doing the training, because of all the restrictions put in place by existing government agencies. The imposition of wild rivers legislation on that area would complicate the process to the point that, even at three years, they are almost looking at walking away; it is only their own commitment and determination that allow them to stay there. But, if there were another level of bureaucracy over the top of that, it would make it absolutely impossible for them to do anything. They have also had another situation that was quite high profile, at Pisolite Hills, the bauxite mine up near old Mapoon-great opportunities for the community, with the prospect of creating about 1,700 jobs over the 15-year life of the project. They were building a full village not far from the old Mapoon community, which was then going to be handed over as a lodge for tourism for the community. They were guaranteed all sorts of jobs as well. That has now basically been scuttled by the wild rivers legislation and through the influence of the Wilderness Society. On top of that, we are now looking at this federal government working overtime with the state government and, again, with the Wilderness Society to look at blanket World Heritage listing for the entire Cape York region. Of course, combined with wild rivers and all the other legislation, that guarantee that they lock it up to such a point that the only opportunity you are going to find for our Indigenous people in Cape York would be to stand there bare bummed in a lily pond, on one foot, with a spear, being photo fodder for tourists. That is the sort of opportunity that this mob on the other side are looking to create for Indigenous people in Cape York. It is absolutely appalling. These people have struggled for so long to get their country back. They have every right, after that struggle, to sit down and contemplate what they have, to plan a future for themselves. They do not have to be curios for the benefit of the Wilderness Society. I see my friend and colleague Mr Katter here and I would just like to recognise that Mr Katter as a minister gave the first cattle property lease, at Christmas Creek, to Eddie Holroyd, our good friend who just passed, who had a great amount of pride in that. If wild rivers legislation had been around, that would never have been able to happen. These people have very strong views on what they want to do, and they need time to assess what they have and to do their planning. It may not necessarily be of benefit to them, but it will be for their kids and grandkids, and for us to deny them that opportunity is absolutely appalling. We on this side believe in the protection and sustainable development of our environment. But I think it has to be done in a cooperative and collaborative way that gives the Indigenous population the genuine opportunity to have a say, and the right to manage and operate their own land. And that is what this bill does. It is about giving economic destiny back into the hands of the traditional owners, the Indigenous people. It about giving them hope and aspiration and opportunity so that they can give better lives to their people, to their children, to stimulate will their communities and to be able to make their own determinations. They certainly have the capacity to do that. Unfortunately, with the stranglehold that the Greens have over the Labor Party-and, particularly in Cape York, the Wilderness Society and the ACF-there is little chance of this happening under this current mob.

24,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," When the member for Warringah first introduced the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011, he said that he was working for the economic advancement of Aboriginal people, that economic development is important to the future of Aboriginal people and that access to the benefits of all Australians is the right of Aboriginal people. In this view, he is not alone. Many of us on both sides of the House have worked hard on the issue of Indigenous economic development. The member for Leichhardt has done a great deal in his own electorate, but I need to correct a couple of statements he made in his speech. He said that clauses 4(3)(b) and 6 were new; that is not in fact the case. Those clauses were in the 2010 bill. As a member of that House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics I visited Far North Queensland in late November 2010 and early March of this year. Our inquiry was broadly into Indigenous economic development, not just the wild rivers issue. We heard from over 50 people in the public hearings and took 39 submissions. We visited Brisbane, Cairns, Weipa, Bamaga and the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation in Far North Queensland. What quickly became apparent to all of us on the committee was that Indigenous economic development in Cape York is a complex and an important issue.",50
25,Mr Katter,BILLS,Seriously? Do you realise you have never spoken,51
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Kennedy!,51
27,Dr LEIGH,BILLS,"It is vital to get the economic development framework right. We on this side of the House are strongly committed to improving the opportunities and the life outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We deliver an annual Closing the Gap report. We have to continue to consider the full picture when it comes to Indigenous economic development. One part of that picture is mining. That has been brought to the fore over recent years. In the last decade, the price of alumina-one of the key minerals in the Cape-has risen by more than 50 per cent. It is important that we remember the role that mining plays in economic development. The national picture for mining is that it contributes 5.6 per cent of our GDP but employs only 1.3 per cent of the total labour force. The same picture shows up in the Cape. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures from the 2006 census show that there were 19 Indigenous people in the Cape who were employed in mining. That is 0.7 per cent of Indigenous employment in Cape York. We should be open to the possibility that mining has a bigger picture to play in the employment base for Cape York. We should always be looking to possibilities, but we should be clear-headed and guided by the facts that we can see in the most recent census data. Mining is an important part of our economy, and is helping produce record terms of trade, but it produces fewer jobs than its share of the national economy. I agree with Noel Pearson who says that education has to be at the heart of Indigenous policy, that education has a critical role to play in overcoming inequality and disadvantage. The role of education in economic development was reinforced to me when I visited Cape York last year and this year. As part of the committee's hearings I had a conversation with Ms Yunkaporta about Noel Pearson's Cape York Aboriginal Australian Academy, which is an initiative championed by the Minister for Families, Housing, Communities and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin. The program offered by the academy has four components focusing on class, club, culture and community. As Noel Pearson recently wrote, the Class program immerses students in numeracy and literacy using the Direct Instructions programs. Students need to achieve a mastery of 90 per cent at their level before they can move on. Tests are done every five to 10 lessons and both the students' and teachers' performances are carefully monitored. Club ensures that kids do not miss out on those future opportunities, providing extracurricular activities that many children in non-Indigenous communities already enjoy-including the hope to one day include foreign languages and Shakespeare classes. Culture helps children learn the local Aboriginal languages and their culture and traditions. In-school activities are supported by the Community program. School attendance and readiness for school are carefully monitored. A food program provides meals during the dayMr Katter interjecting",51
28,Dr LEIGH,BILLS,"I hear the member for Kennedy laughing, but education is an important part of Indigenous economic development. For those of us on this side of the House, Indigenous education is no laughing matter. This program provides meals during the day and families are helped to manage funds to cover educational expenses. Pearson states in his essay Radical hope: Man cannot live by bread alone, but he does need bread, and in the modern world the economy is where he'll earn it. That is why education is so important for the economic development of Cape York and the economic development of our nation. Boosting the quantity and quality of education in Australia will flow on to improve the level of innovation in the economy. It will allow for more rapid diffusion of new technological changes. The boost to living standards that we get from improving our education system will rival any of the big economic reforms in Australia's history. It will rival floating the dollar, bringing down the tariff walls, enterprise bargaining or competition policy. Education then flows on to new jobs in Cape York. You can see the opportunity for that if you drive from Bamaga north to the very tip of Australia where you will see the ecotourism lodge which is, alas, now something of a wreck, but which offers great potential to be a new ecotourism centre for Australia. The white sands are breathtaking. The area has great potential to be a tourism destination. Not everyone in Cape York will be employed in the tourism industry, but it is a critical part of Indigenous economic development-the broader issue into which our committee inquired. The causes of disadvantage in Cape York and the Gulf are complex, and we need long term, considered approaches. We need to provide real opportunities, real jobs and sustainable development. I addressing disadvantage and creating opportunity through education are perhaps the most important thing we can do. The government respects the views of Aboriginal leaders in the Cape York area",51
29,Mr Katter,BILLS,"No, you don't.",52
30,Dr LEIGH,BILLS,and will continue to actively engage with them,52
31,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Kennedy may miss out on his opportunity to speak if he is not careful.,52
32,Dr LEIGH,BILLS,"in developing solutions for a sustainable and effective model of economic development and one that allows Indigenous people in Cape York to work towards and build the 'radical hope' of the future-a radical hope in which education provides the skills, economic opportunities and the ability to create and innovate new ideas and industries. As part of the government's commitment to economic development for Indigenous Australians we have agreed with the Queensland government to establish a new service for people in Cape York and the Gulf of Carpentaria, which will guide Indigenous applicants to develop new business and economic development proposals and assist them to effectively utilise the processes under the Wild Rivers legislation. The importance of education, economic development and the future for the Cape was best put to me by Phyllis Yunkaporta, a witness appearing before the committee. She told the committee: The education system, as I knew it before, has been of low standard. The curriculum in the past, as it is in all cape Aboriginal communities, has been of very low standard. By the time our children go out to mainstream schools they are hardly there-a child in grade 8 still has the understanding of a child in grade 1. Speaking for Aurukun, I was one of the persons who were believe invited to the States last October; I went to New York and Los Angeles visiting African-American schools. What we have brought back to Aurukun is a new kind of teaching method and we are having that implemented in the school. Of course it took time. At the beginning it pretty much had been, in my words, chaos before that. Since having this new program come in, if you come to the classrooms in Aurukun the kids are fully focused. This new method of teaching has got them going. The teacher is full-on with the tasks given and you cannot believe it when you enter those classrooms-it is as if some of those kids are play-acting. They are not; they are just on, focused. I guess in time we have to have expectations for our children to be educated in a way where they have to balance both worlds-the Western world and the traditional way. Of course we want them to hang onto the traditional way because that is where they are going to be identifying themselves for the future. And with them having to venture out into mainstream, we want them to compete. It is a competitive world out there. We want our black little kids to start taking on the world. That is the aim of all this. Ms Yunkaporta's views highlighted to meand to many of us on the committee-the importance of a holistic picture with Indigenous economic development. It is absolutely critical that we recognise there is not a single industry that is going to be part of the cape's success. Cape York Indigenous communities need the building blocks of education and the sustainability of strong jobs. And they need effective leadership that is willing to argue strongly for the interests of people on the cape. If anybody went on this inquiry believing that there were simple solutions to economic development in Cape York, they should have come away disabused of that notion; they should have come away recognising that Indigenous development on the cape has many futures ahead of it. I will return to the point I made at the start of this speech, where I referred to some statements that the member for Leichhardt made. The member for Leichhardt referred to clause 6 of the legislation. Clause 6 remains unchanged from the previous version of this bill. It details a process for obtaining agreement for native title holders. The heading of that clause refers to 'native title holders', which is not defined in the bill. It is unclear whether the details for obtaining agreement of native title holders could also include owners as defined in the bill or just the native title holder of the land. As a result, this is potentially a cause of uncertainty as to full- how agreements, which are a central component of the bill, would be practically achieved. This uncertainty is one of many uncertainties in the bill. As we saw in the committee's inquiry, there are many Indigenous stakeholders in Cape York, and Indigenous stakeholders operate on different levels. Some groups will claim to speak for larger populations, but, as our inquiries went on, it would sometimes turn out that people were not comfortable with others speaking on their behalf. So the absence of a definition of 'native title holders' is one of the concerns that I have about the bill before the House. I think it is critical that this debate focus on the big picture, on Indigenous economic development and not pretend-because it would be wrong to do so-that the only factor affecting Indigenous economic development in Cape York is the Queensland wild rivers legislation. It is not. It is a small part of a much larger picture. I would like to close by paying tribute once more to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Mr Noel Pearson for the work they have done together in improving Indigenous education in Cape York. If anything is to be the key foundation stone for Indigenous economic development it is getting school education right. I pay tribute to both of those people for the careful thought they have put into securing that outcome.",52
33,Mr KATTER,BILLS," I am very pleased that Dr Leigh spoke before me because I am going to take his speech and distribute it to all of the Aboriginal councillors, first Australian councillors, in my electorate. It demonstrates magnificently towering ignorance and complete nonunderstanding and nonsympathy. I seldom do this, but I cannot help but mention that all of the advisors to the ALP sitting over there are all what we call 'migaloos', every single one of them. I met 32 senior officers of the department dealing with first Australian affairs, and two of them-only two-were nonmigaloos. So we have the white fellas looking after us again, telling us, as the last gentleman told us, that we all need an education. Let me inform you, Sonny, that I worked in mining; I was a miner before I came into politics. That was one of the three things I did before I came to this place. I tell you what, I did not have a shred of education to tell me how to mine. He thinks it is funny; he is laughing. Dr Leigh: I am not laughing.",54
34,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Kennedy cannot verbal someone.,54
35,Mr KATTER,BILLS,"The industries of North Queensland are cattle and mining. I worked in the mining industry and I would say 90 per cent of the people at the lead smelterand that is a sophisticated operation compared with actual mining where you sort of drive a truck and a two-boom jumbo-I would say that three would have had tertiary education out of about 200. So much for education digging us out of the hole. Maybe there have been some university graduates riding horses-in fact, the bloke who won the university medal actually does ride a horse, the highest pass ever recorded, and he is a good mate of mine. But he would agree with me that 99.98 per cent of the people riding horses and running the cattle industry have probably not even completed 12th grade. So you are going to tell us that we will all get an education and that will dig us out of the hole? Do you realise the towering ignorance of what you have just said? I would leave the chamber too if I were you. Tourism is the third aspect. I know a lot of people in tourism. As the honourable member over here said, yes, we will get a bit of tourism out of throwing spears and boomerangs and those sorts of things. But when I went to school they never taught me how to throw a boomerang or a spear. It is not part of the educational curriculum. You might argue that it should be. He then said, 'We're moving forward.' Moving forward? We are back to the bad old days. We have one set of laws for blackfella Australians and another set of laws for whitefella Australians. Apparently it is quite safe for whitefellas to have pornography and alcohol, but it is very unsafe for the blackfellas. They cannot handle it. We had laws which delivered the ownership of every one of the community areas-and I look to my colleague the member for Leichhardt hereto the duly-elected local council with the machinery to devolve that to private ownership, with a title deed just the same as everyone else on planet Earth has. This gentleman over here said that we had gone forward. I will tell you how much we have gone backwards. In 1989, if you lived on Doomadgee or Mornington Island or Palm Island or Aurukun, your council-duly elected by you-owned that area, with no frills, no complications but just absolute freehold title. Now they do not. Now all of those areas are legally owned by appointees at the discretion of the minister-not even the governor and council but a minister of the Queensland government. So the Queensland government now owns the four or five million hectares of North Queensland that were supposedly owned by the first Australians. What a criminal theft! Those are Noel Pearson's words, actually, but he beat me to it; I would have liked to have used that phrase first. It was a criminal theft by the state government of Queensland, and we are trying to get the money together now to yard them and sue them for the theft of that land. That is not the end of the story. They are not content to take the land back, and they now have a trust arrangement whereby an appointee of the minister is the trustee, the legal owner, and the beneficial owners are the first Australian people. That is a trust. trust is used for little children who are not capable of running their own affairs. When they grow up and get to age 21, the trust vanishes. As this gentleman said, we need time. How much time do you need, you whitefellas? You have had 200 years; how much time do you need? He has had 200 years and he said he needs time. The children are being taken away. We in this place had the arch hypocrisy. I really felt like spitting or walking out of here or doing something to bring attention to the fact that here we were apologising for the theft of the children. The children in New South Wales and Queensland are being thieved now at twice the rate that they were thieved in the old days. Have we gone forward as far as ownership of land goes? No, we have had the land completely thieved off of us. We have gone backwards as far as anyone can go. I need to return to the land, because Tommy Geia, a great Australian on Palm Island, got me aside last weekend and he said that every single person in an Aboriginal reserve community had to sign a document saying that they have to agree to pay all the rents-or rates, if you like, because if you are going to live in a house you have to pay some money to somebody. It is not going to be paid to the local council anymore; it is going to be paid to the whitefella administrators in the state government in Cairns and Townsville and Brisbane. So what do we need a council for? We are going to close them down, aren't we? We are going to amalgamate them, as the recommendations of the ALP state government have put forward. We will amalgamate them, which simply means closing them down. And the honourable member for Leichhardt will tell you that up in the Torres Strait it is a farce. Selfmanagement now is a farce. We delivered to those people the self-management on every A one of those islands. They had their own self-management. Even little tiny islands like Stephens and little tiny communities like Seisia were given self-management. They were given complete control over their own affairs. They had a lot more power than local government. They had power of the local police, for example. We gave these people the power, and the power has been completely taken off them in the Torres Strait. They are now run by a centralised bureaucracy, manned in the main by whitefellas on Thursday Island. That is how much we have moved forward, my friend. I return to the ownership of the land. If the federal government is to build a house for you, you have to hand the land over to the state government; otherwise the federal government will not build a house for you. The only way we will build a house for you is if we thieve your land off you. I ask you, please, because you are nodding at me, to check it out. That is the agreement. All of the councils decided unanimously to oppose itexcept one dingo mob who were hiding outside because they were taking their running from a whitefella CEO. Except for that dingo mob, I think it was 26 who voted unanimously to reject the proposition. Of course they rejected it! If you people would honour your promise, then the number of houses in Doomadgee, for example, would double-if we take you at your word and you are going to build 2,000 or 3,000 houses throughout Australia. But with the new Doomadgee, half the town will now be owned by the state government outright, completely, for 40 years. And you people agreed to it. You imposed that condition upon these people. I will give you a sharp contrast with past Labor governments. When I rang up Gerry Hand, when I was minister, and I said, 'This is what we want to do,' he said, 'Mate, that sounds like a real good idea.' (Time expired)",54
36,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, I call the member for Parramatta.,56
37,Mr Katter,BILLS,I'd dearly love another 30 minutes.,56
38,The SPEAKER,BILLS,"The member for Kennedy will listen in silence, as everyone did during his speech, or I will remove him.",56
39,Ms OWENS,BILLS," I acknowledge the members for Kennedy and Leichhardt for their contributions. There can be no doubt in this House or the broader community of their absolute commitment to improving the lives and independence of our Indigenous community. I note that neither of them spoke very much at all on the actual bill that is before us today, and I would like to go back to that. They highlighted the many complexities in Cape York. I visited with the economics committee last year and found a fabulous, difficult",56
40,Mr Entsch,BILLS,I have lived there for 20 years.,56
41,Ms OWENS,BILLS,"I acknowledge that you have a greater knowledge of the area than me-wondrous, harsh, almost impossible place with people with various histories. Some have lived on their land with links back tens of thousands of years and many others were removed from their lands and are finding their way back. There are complexities in the understandings within the Indigenous population about who had the right to speak for them and who did notmany complexities that impact on the viability of the bill that we have before us today. This is the third version of the wild rivers bill. There have been two Senate inquiries and a House of Representatives inquiry into the previous versions of Mr Abbott's bill. All those inquiries found the bill to be unworkable and stated that it did not address any of the real barriers to economic development in Indigenous communities in Queensland. Now we have a third version with some further amendments. There are still old sections in the bill that raise many issues about definitions of owner and consent, but there also some new clauses which add to the complex and problematic nature of the bill and require careful scrutiny. For that reason, I believe that the changes should be referred to a House committee inquiry to analyse their construction and potential effect. The government is strongly committed to improving the life outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and takes Indigenous economic development seriously. The causes of disadvantage in Cape York and the gulf are complex and solving the issues that the community faces will need long-term, considered approaches, which provide real opportunities, real jobs and allow for environmentally sustainable development. The member for Leichhardt talked about one of the communities up there trying to build a banana plantation and that it had taken three years so far. Again, I would like to point out that that community is not covered by wild rivers. Even without wild rivers legislation, it has been incredibly difficult for many communities to move forward and, arguably, one cannot make a claim that the introduction of wild rivers legislation in 2005 has somehow led to a lack of economic development. There are of course decades-in fact centuries-of a lack of development in Cape York. There were wild rivers 2005 acts on top of a whole range of laws in Queensland, including the Sustainable Planning Act 2009, the Vegetation Management Act 1999 and the Water Act 2000. When we visited Cape York last year, we heard from many people who referred to a whole range of issues that prevent development, not simply wild rivers. In fact, we met communities up there that were supportive of the Wild Rivers Act in the form that it has now. We also heard of the many, many issues and difficulties that people in Cape York have. It is a tropical monsoonal climate characterised by long warm to hot dry seasons and short, humid, intensive wet seasons. That monsoonal season is a major constraining factor on Cape York as it impacts on travel and many economic and social activities. It isolates most properties and communities for four to five months of the year. For agriculture, Balkanu Cape York Development Corporation advised the board that broad-scale irrigation is limited as there are very few areas of arable soil on Cape York that are suitable for large-scale irrigation. Where such land is available, the water supply is not likely to be sufficient to support irrigated crops. Much of the west of the cape is very flat and unsuitable for dams and in the east the water flows to the Great Barrier Reef side, so dams are not really an option. It is an incredibly beautiful, harsh environment where roads are boggy and unpassable for much of the year, and one could argue that issues of freight and transport infrastructure are as much of a barrier to the development of Cape York as any other area. The government respects the views of Aboriginal leaders in the Cape York area and will continue to actively engage with them in developing solutions. As part of the government's commitment to economic development for Indigenous Australians, we have agreed with the Queensland government to establish a new service for people in Cape York and the Gulf of Carpentaria, which will guide Indigenous applicants to develop new business and economic development proposals and assist them to effectively utilise the processes under the wild rivers legislation. We heard from many witnesses during our visit to Cape York last year about the difficulty that they had in navigating their way through a whole raft of legislation that govern development applications in the cape. There are several differences between the 2011 bill and the 2010 bill, and I am going to concentrate on some of those. The key differences essentially are: a new subclause, 5(2), stating that agreement with native title holders is taken to be agreement with the owner, but the owner is defined very broadly in the bill. It is not clear how agreement will be obtained from owners of other types of land included in the bill or how agreement from other types of owners would relate to agreement from native title holders. Insertion of a new clause, 6A, which specifies that dispute resolution is to be resolved by a certain section of the Native Title Act 1993 or by regulations, also creates some confusion. The section referred to in the Native Title Act 1993 does not set out a dispute resolution process; rather, it sets out the dispute resolution functions of native title representative bodies. How the section referred to in the Native Title Act 1993 will work in the context of the bill is difficult to interpret. It is not clear how disputes between native title holders and other owners governed under the new process would work. Changes to the transitional provision in clause 7B extend the period of time from six months to 12 months for declarations to apply if this bill were passed. It provides more time for agreement to be reached before existing declarations are overturned. However, if owners do not agree within the extended time frame, existing declarations will still be overturned whether there is agreement or not. Such a complex and significant area of law must not be dealt with in an ad hoc way, particularly as the three clauses I have referred to so far are interpreted within the context Indigenous",56

45,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's report entitled Advisory report on the Food Standards Amendment (Truth in LabellingPalm Oil) Bill 2011, incorporating dissenting reports, together with the minutes of proceedings. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.",59
46,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES,"The Food Standards Amendment (Truth in Labelling-Palm Oil) Bill 2011 seeks to amend the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 and the Australian Consumer and Competition Act 2010. If passed, it would require Food Standards Australia New Zealand, FSANZ, to develop and publish a standard requiring food producers to label palm oil on packaging if it were an ingredient in the product or had been used in its production. It would also specifically list palm oil as a characteristic of all goods in relation to the misleading conduct provisions in the Australian Consumer Law. The drivers behind the bill are claims that the rates of deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia are reducing habitat for orangutans and that orangutans are in danger of extinction. Deforestation is in turn said to be driven by agricultural interests in these countries clearing land to plant oil palms. Oil palms are a very productive crop which can deliver yields five or more times per hectare than other oil crops. The committee understands the strong community support for the goals of the bill. Zoos Victoria gave evidence of its online and hard-copy campaigns where thousands of Australians expressed concern about the connection between palm oil and the Report reduction of orangutan habitat. However, the committee has come to the view that the bill will not bring about the result that so many people in the community desire. Instead, it will have a range of unintended consequences that will cause a great deal of damage to our commercial arrangements and international relations. Indeed, one industry group, Accord Australasia, described the bill as 'reckless'. For example, its only legal effect for food labelling is to require FSANZ to draft a food standard and publish it on its website. In order for the states and territories to enforce the standard, it would have to be determined in accordance with agreed processes. This has not occurred. In short, the bill is not enforceable as it operates outside of agreements between the Commonwealth, state, territory and New Zealand governments. Its passage could lead to inconsistencies in labelling across these jurisdictions. In relation to the Australian Consumer Law, the bill will not change its legal effect. Currently, if a producer of food provided an ingredients list on the packet and the label omitted to mention palm oil when this was an ingredient, then it would breach section 33 regardless of whether the bill became law or not. However, current labels do not breach section 33 because they do not claim to be a complete ingredients list. Nor is there a legal requirement for producers to fully list the ingredients. The bill would not change the operation of section 33 if it became law. The bill overlooks the fact that much of the legislative power in Australia resides in the states and territories. In order to generate the benefits of a uniform national market, complex processes and negotiations are required to harmonise regulatory systems. In the case of consumer law, the Productivity Commission estimated in 2008 that the gain to the economy from uniformity is $4.5 billion annually. The bill simplistically overrides these important commercial arrangements without addressing the risks. The bill also places our international relationships at risk. The food regulation treaty between Australia and New Zealand states that neither party can amend their legislation regarding FSANZ without effectively consulting the other party. This has obviously not occurred. Further, singling out palm oil means that it is more discriminatory than necessary to fulfil a health or environmental objective. Australia would then be at risk of a trade dispute under World Trade Organisation rules, and Malaysia and Indonesia have already indicated that they are prepared to do this. Another negative feature of the bill is that, separately to it, the Council of Australian Governments has initiated a review of food labelling in Australia. The government released the review report, Labelling logic, in January this year. Recommendation 12 states that, where sugars, fats or oils are added as separate ingredients in a food, the label should list the actual ingredients This is already the approach in the United States and will most likely become law in the European Union. The whole of the Commonwealth, state, territory and New Zealand government response to Labelling logic is under development. It is expected to be considered by the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council on 9 December 2011. Given that a rigorous process is covering the bill's subject matter, there is even less reason to proceed with it. Therefore, the committee has recommended that the bill should not proceed. I would like to thank the organisations and individuals that assisted the committee during the inquiry through submissions or participating in the hearing in Canberra. I also thank my colleagues on the committee for their contribution to the report. I commend the report to the House.

47,Mr RIPOLL,BILLS," I continue where I started-that is, by saying that there are three simple things about all these bills together: 1) climate change is real; 2) there are things that we can do about it; 3) the things that we can do about it are affordable. Given that we all agree in this place and, of course, much more widely-not only in Australia but also right across the globeabout climate change, it is just a matter of what type of system we should put in place to best achieve our goals. By far the best system is a broad-based carbon price. It is the most environmentally effective and cheapest way to reduce pollution. A carbon price puts a price tag on pollution. Through the carbon price, for the first time, an incentive will be provided for people not to pollute-in particular for our 500 biggest polluters, who will be required to pay for each tonne of carbon they release into the atmosphere in. This scheme will start on 1 July 2012. Let us be clear that these bills will go through this place-there is agreement here for these bills to pass. There will be a fixed-price period for 2 years, and then we will move to a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme whereby the market will set the price. A market based mechanism is by far the best way to deal with climate change. During the fixed-price period the starting price will be $23 per tonne, and during the next two years it will rise by 2.5 per cent. So, assuming Bill 2011 inflation of 2.5 per cent, the carbon price will be $25.40 per tonne by 2014-15. 2011 The flexible market, set-price period will commence on 1 July in three years timethat is, in 2015. During the flexible price period, the government will set the cap by issuing a fixed number of carbon units each year, and some of those units will be auctioned by government. This is the best way to move forward with the system. It means that the market decides and that business gets to adapt, to adjust, to evolve and to grow. But we are not going to allow this to happen without accepting the fact that there is some cost and that that cost has to be abated in some way. That is why we have put together an assistance package for industry as well as for households. Over the first three years of the carbon price, the government will devote $9.2 billion to assistance for affected jobs in emissionsintensive trade-exposed industries. That is to provide with them a transition period to adjust, to adopt, to match what is happening in the rest of the world and an opportunity to continue to grow. There will be $800 million in the Clean Technology Investment Program, which will provide grants to manufacturers to support investment in energy efficient equipment technologies, processes and products. Over six years there will be $150 million for the food processing industry and $50 million for the metal forging and foundry industries. The government will also provide $200 million in grants to support business research and development in areas of renewable energy, low pollution technology and energy efficiency. The government is also ensuring that households, tradespeople, farmers and small businesses do not face a carbon price on fuel-because the will not be a carbon price on fuel. The government will reduce the fuels tax credits received by many large polluters so that they too pay an effective carbon price. Many businesses will be exempted from the reduction in fuel credits and shielded from the carbon price on fuel. Heavy vehicles such as semitrailers will also be exempt until 2014-15. While the carbon price will be paid directly by the 500 biggest polluters in this country, the government has designed a generous package to help small business grow and invest in energy efficient assets. Farming and other land-based activities will not be covered by the mechanism. However, the Carbon Farming Initiative will give farmers an opportunity to generate income by taking action to reduce their pollution. I said earlier that these measures can be effective-and they are. The world is already acting on climate change; in every country there is something being done. It might be called something different and look slightly different in other countries, but every country is taking action on climate change. is clearly in Australia's national interest continue to work to achieve the international goal of limiting warming to below two degrees. In order to do this, it is imperative that we play a responsible role in the international arena by taking strong action at home. We have to act locally and think globally. The government's plan will cut carbon pollution and drive investment in clean energy technologies and infrastructure. It will generate new jobs in these fields. The carbon price will see Australia's annual emissions reduced by at least 159 million tonnes by 2020 from where they would have been had we done nothing. By 2050, we will have taken over 17 billion tonnes of carbon pollution out of the atmosphere by saving nine out of every 10 tonnes of pollution we would have emitted had this plan not been in place. Australia has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world, including hydro, wind, bioenergy, geothermal, wave and tide-not to mention one of our most abundant resources: solar energy. By 2050, according to Treasury modelling, with a carbon price $100 billion will have been invested in renewable energy, and 40 per cent of Australia's electricity generation will come from renewables. Australia's renewable energy sector will have grown 17 times because of the changes that we are putting in place. But, as I said earlier, all this does come at a cost and we acknowledge that cost-and it must be compensated for. So nine out of 10 households will receive some assistance through tax cuts or payment increases, and two in three households will get tax cuts or increased payments that will cover the expected average price impact on them. We have tried in this area to be a little bit more generous: we will give a little bit extra, It because we would rather err on the side of to assistance than on the side of not getting it quite right. Over four million Australian households will get assistance that is at least 20 per cent more than the expected average price impact on them. Over one million additional Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return. That is right-one million additional Australian taxpayers will never have to lodge a tax return again because of these changes. On average, the scheme will cost households $9.90 per week, but they will get $10.10 per week in assistance. The assistance is permanent and will increase over time in step with any expected increases caused by these changes. The government will review the adequacy of assistance each year and will increase it further if necessary. We will go further than that-there will also be tax cuts. Everyone earning up to $80,000 will receive a tax cut. For most people, it will be at least $300. The tax-free threshold will triple in size: no one will pay tax on the first $20,000 they earn. This means that half a million people will go from having to pay tax to paying no tax at all. This is a major tax reform that will encourage people who only need part-time work only to join the workforce. It is an incentive to create jobs and an incentive for people to work. Of course, pensioners and self-funded retirees will not be left out. Pensioners and self-funded retirees holding Commonwealth Seniors Health Card will get a cash increase of $338 each year if they are single and $510 combined each year if they are couples. That means that, on average, 1.8 million pensioner households will come out at least $210 ahead of the expected carbon price impact on them. Around 150,000 self-funded retirees and part rate pensioners will also receive tax cuts in the order of over $300. We have not forgotten families either. They are an important part of what we are doing. Increases in family tax benefit A for each child will be up $110 per year. Singleincome families with children will get up to $69 extra in each family tax benefit B plus up to $300 in additional supplement. Allowance recipients such as people on Newstart and youth allowance will also get up to $218 a year for singles and up to $390 a year for couples. These are good things for the nation across the board. Specifically, people will want to know what will happen in my electorate of Oxley. Out of the 62,000 taxpayers in Oxley, around 54,000 will receive a tax cut and 45,000 of these will receive a tax cut of at least $300. More than 38,000 people in Oxley will receive household assistance through income support payments or family assistance payments. A typical family in Oxley will have expected cost increases of around $497 per year, but they will receive around $754 in tax cuts and family assistance. They will be about $257 better off per year. There are more than 3,000 single parents in Oxley who will also get an extra $289 per year and 17,100 pensioners in Oxley will receive an extra $338 per year for singles and $510 per couple-that is, extra after all their expenses. Pensioners will be better off, students will be better off and families will be better off but, most importantly, our economy and our economy will be better off. It is always difficult to make the big decisions in a government and to take the next steps forward. It is always difficult to be able to see beyond the horizon, to look where the future takes us-not after the next election or the election after that but the next generation in this country. That is what this is about. This is about making fundamental change. This is about structural reform. This is about changing the way our economy operates. This is about ensuring that industries of the future have a future. This is about making sure that we do not get caught in old thinking, old traps or old ways, which mean that you cannot transition economies and then the jobs you are trying protect today disappear tomorrow because no government took the courageous steps it needed to ensure you could have a clean energy future. This is about making sure we are part of the global economy, the global village. It is a small planet. We are connected. We are a trading nation. Not only do we need to do these things but also we need to shield the impacts of some of these things locally, at a domestic level, and that is exactly what we are doing. We are talking about one of the biggest changes in this economy that has been seen, I would say, for well over 100 years. It is well thought out and well considered and it will be well delivered. (Time expired)",61
48,Dr SOUTHCOTT,BILLS," I rise to speak on the bills which will introduce the carbon tax. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue facing this parliament. It comes to one of the most fundamental issues in our democracy, and that is whether the community should be told what a government is going to do before an election. Six days before the last election the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' It was explicit and in none of the documentation-in none of the policies, in none of the material that was put out by any Labor candidate-did the government say they would be introducing a carbon tax. Australian political history shows that Australians will exact a very heavy price on governments which mislead. Paul Keating, campaigning against a GST, in effect introduced a GST by stealth in the 1993 budget. He massively increased the then wholesale sales tax on a range of goods. Here we have a carbon tax bill that emerged after the 2010 election, when the Prime Minister clearly said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' This shows no respect for democracy in this country. You cannot make specific promises as part of your election platform and then ignore them once elected. The proposal of the government will cost Australians $9 billion per year. To put this in perspective, the carbon trading scheme in Europe, a much larger economy than Australia's, raises $500 million a year. The impact of the carbon tax will be felt very heavily by people with fixed incomes, such as self-funded retirees and pensioners, and by families. The government has spent a lot of time in this debate focusing on the compensation that people are to receive. If you do not tax someone, you do not need to compensate them. But, if the carbon tax does not hurt, it will not work. What will happen is that the carbon tax will result in a 10 per rise in electricity prices and a nine per cent rise in gas bills in the first year alone. There will be a $4.3 billion hit on the budget bottom line. At the moment we already see enormous pressure on the cost of living for families and all this will do is add to it. At a time when we are seeing retail and small business sectors struggling as never before, this is the worse time to be introducing a carbon tax, which will only increase all of those pressures. Since 2007, when Labor came to office, on average electricity prices have risen 51 per cent, gas prices have risen 30 per cent and water and sewerage prices have risen 46 per cent. Despite what the government says, any tax cuts provided will not keep pace with the increasing cost of the carbon tax, and most Australians know this. While the carbon tax will start at $23 per tonne, it will be a floating price after three years, with the government expecting the price to be $37 a tonne in 2020 and over $350 a tonne in 2050. What will this do to the cost of living? Australian manufacturing is already under pressure, cost of living for everyday Australians is forever increasing, and a carbon tax will only make this worse. Australian businesses will be put at a major disadvantage. On the government's own figures, more than three million Australian households are going to be worse off under the carbon tax. But worse of all is that under Labor's carbon tax scheme emissions will actually increase. Australian emissions will increase from 578 million tonnes in 2012 to 621 million tonnes in 2020. The whole point of the government's proposal is to reduce emissions in Australia. At the most basic argument, the carbon tax fails in this purpose. The only way the government is going to reach its emissions reduction targets is to buy offshore carbon credits from foreign carbon traders. Under Labor's proposal, the government itself estimates that Australia will be spending $3½ billion purchasing carbon credits from foreign carbon traders in 2020. By 2050 we as a nation will be spending $57 billion a year, or 1½ per cent of our GDP, on purchasing offshore carbon credits from foreign carbon traders. This means that we will be spending $3½ billion in 2020 to buy up foreign carbon credits from potentially dodgy foreign carbon traders to plant trees in other countries, not in Australia. To put this into perspective, Australian government health funding in the latest financial year, as a percentage of GDP, was only 4.1 per cent. All the Labor Party's carbon tax will do is new tax. shift emissions overseas, at a huge cost to the Australian taxpayer. The only way that a carbon tax can reduce emissions is if people use less coal produced electricity and less powered transport. The problem with this is that the use of electricity is inelastic-not entirely, but quite significantly. Electricity consumption does not drop with increased costs. We are dependent on electricity. Labor's carbon tax will not work. It will hurt families and cost jobs. The government's own paperwork reveals that the scheme will raise $27 billion in revenue in the first three years of the tax. This is not a tax about the environment; this is a wealth redistribution tax. The 750,000 small businesses in Australia will receive no direct compensation for the massive hikes in electricity prices. What it means is that jobs will be lost and product prices will rise. As I go around my electorate holding my listening posts and door-knocking, the issue of the carbon tax is raised continually. Residents in my electorate have constantly contacted me about the impact that this carbon tax is going to have on their family, their household or their business. People tell me how this tax is going to mean that their small business is going to struggle even more than before when their expenses go up under the carbon tax. Labor members have spent a lot of time talking about compensation which families will receive, but they have not spent any time talking about the impact on small business, who will receive no compensation. Self-funded retirees and other people on fixed incomes tell me how this tax is going to mean they will struggle to make ends meet because grocery bills and electricity bills are going to go up. These bills are going to go up just as our emissions are going to go up under this carbon tax. There is negligible environmental benefit achieved under this I recently met with one of the local councils in my electorate. They informed me that their annual power bill is $1.3 million, oil 70 per cent of which is for street lighting. Based on the government's own figures, the carbon tax will have an instant impact of $130,000 a year on this local council's budget-money that would otherwise have been spent on providing services to the community. The only way they can recover that $130,000 per year is to increase rates on their ratepayers. This is an example of the fact that power is inelastic. The council cannot just turn off its street lights. I would also like to focus a bit on the impact that the carbon tax will have on health care in this country. We have already heard from the Victorian government that this will have an impact of millions of dollars on the power bills of hospitals in Victoria. The carbon tax will dramatically increase the cost of running Australia's public and private hospitals. Hospitals are huge consumers of electricity, and there is no way that this consumption can be reduced. Hospitals, through services like radiotherapy and diagnostic imaging, use enormous amounts of electricity, and there is no compensation for them in this carbon tax proposal. What a diagnostic imaging practice will see is a 10 per cent increase in their electricity bill. What a public hospital will see is, again, a 10 per cent increase in their electricity bill. A private hospital will same. For a clinic delivering radiotherapy and radiation oncology, it will be a 10 per cent increase in that power bill. Electricity prices will increase by 10 per cent in the first year alone, and the government refuses to tell us how much they are expected to rise in future years. When you consider primary care, a general practice, again, will see a 10 per cent increase in their power bill. In allied health, high users of electricity such as physiotherapy practices and dentists will also see a 10 per cent increase in their power bill, with no offset there at all. This is money that could have been spent on providing more front-line health services, and instead it will now be spent on electricity bills due to the government's carbon tax. I would like now to talk about the coalition's alternative, which is our direct action plan. Despite what those opposite say, the coalition does believe that climate change is real and that mankind is making a contribution. Therefore we do support practical action on climate change. It is right that we protect our environment, and I do not think any Australian would argue with that. During the 2010 election, I made a promise that under a coalition government there would be several Green Corps projects to improve environmental conservation within my electorate. Our direct action policy is aimed at reducing emissions by five per cent by 2020, just like the government's plan. However, we believe that the action we take must be reasonable. We believe that the action we take must not be at the expense of Australian jobs or at the expense of our standards of living. The action we take should not, and must not, drive up the cost of living for people who are already struggling. There is a fundamental difference between the ideology of those opposite and that of the coalition. While those opposite prefer to penalise, punish, and tax, the coalition see the believes in providing incentive and optimism. This can be seen in many of the government's policies, but it is most clearly seen in their attitude towards climate change. The coalition's direct action climate policy provides incentives for Australian businesses to reduce their carbon emissions voluntarily. Under a coalition direct action plan, there will be no cost to families, no new taxes and no rise in electricity prices. Our direct action plan is costed, capped and fully funded. By using incentives, our plan allows the market to determine the cheapest way to reduce emissions. This is a bad tax, based on a lie. We must never forget that the Prime Minister lied to our country before the election",64
49,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Boothby knows that he cannot use that word.,66
50,Dr SOUTHCOTT,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I withdraw. The Prime Minister, six days before the election, said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' That can only be described as misleading. Residents in the minister's own electorate are well aware of this. I have a very clear vision of a nice photo opportunity held at the Findon bowling club, where the Prime Minister was explaining her carbon tax. She was buttonholed by a constituent who realised instantly what the impact of the carbon tax was going to be and said, very correctly, that India and the major emitters were not taking any action. This is a major breach of faith by the Prime Minister. The coalition will be voting against the carbon tax legislation and, if elected, we will rescind the carbon tax legislation.",66
51,Mr LAMING,BILLS," On behalf of the residents of Bowman, I rise to make the two most obvious points that have been clear since the debate on emissions trading and the carbon tax began, and that is that we need to get the right mechanism and that we need to do it at the right time. I do not need to go back into the history of the misleading of voters before the last election, but I do need to acknowledge, more importantly, that it has been a long and tortuous debate on both sides of this chamber that has led us to this position. The point I want to make clear today is that we need to get the right system for Australia because we are lawmakers here in Australia. It does not matter what the rest of the world is doing if we are doing the right thing for this nation. That is my job. It is job of international agencies international agreements to work out what is the right thing for the globe. I know if we do not have a global solution on carbon we do not have a solution at all. My speech today is going to focus on where we are globally in that agreement. I will also look at the temporal elements and the history of carbon negotiation-where we have got to and where the pitfalls have been. I do not doubt that a year or two from now we will revisit this debate and ask, 'What did we pass, and why?' The best comparison for carbon negotiation globally is most likely the trade negotiations that began after World War II and continue today. We still do not have a worldwide trade agreement, 60 years on. More recently we have seen the poverty negotiations around the millennium goalsagain, we are halfway to 2020 and we still do not have global agreement on action regarding poverty. The point about carbon is that a quick and dirty agreement does not get you any closer to a global agreement. We know from international negotiation that it is a slow, trust-building, layer-upon-layer, meetingupon-meeting approach that takes you towards the solution, or the destination, which is a global agreement. The early GATT negotiations began in 1947, in Annecy, Geneva, Dillon, Torquay and Kennedy. They then rolled right through Tokyo and then, finally, to the Uruguay Round, which began in 2001. Even 10 years after that tortuous process, no-one came out and said, 'I'm dropping all my trade barriers and that's the right thing for the planet.' That is not the right thing to do in carbon. So the first point I want to address is this notion that we have to set an example for the rest of the world. We do not set examples for the the rest of the world when it comes to jobs and and livelihoods; we negotiate with the rest of the world. And what has happened since Copenhagen and since Bali? If we are this committed as a nation, why isn't this Prime Minister calling the President of the United States saying, 'Let's do something together'; getting in contact with Russia, Japan, Singapore and South Africa; bringing together the trade economies for meetings; and saying, 'Let's have a carbon arrangement'? It does not matter to this Prime Minister. This is purely a journey of political expediency for a Prime Minister desperate for something that she can look tough on. Of course, in Australia we know that the impact will be significant. If we as a country wish to lead on climate we must be doing so at every opportunity, not just finding a way to punish our own people. That might be in some masochistic sense impressive to those that are looking for action on climate, but it does nothing to take us closer to global agreement. The fundamental point that has never been made by this government is whether us signing up to something makes other nations more likely or less likely to sign up. If you set up asymmetry in trade and in business where there is an advantage for other countries not to sign up, it is called first-mover disincentive. It leads to perverse outcomes where you perpetuate the situation. Why would another economy come together and say, 'Australia's harming its trade exposed exports with this carbon tax; let's quickly do the same and remove the advantage we have'? It is pathetic and it is ridiculous. How that occurs is a point that has never been made on this side of the House. The government would lead us to believe from their Treasury modelling that every other nation in the world will fall into a carbon tax when the ink is barely dry on the agreement-that they are only months or years away from a carbon tax. That is complete folly. No-one on the floor of congress in the US wants a carbon tax. Prime Minister, visit Japan. Go and visit Russia. Talk to Brazil. Show me the mining economies that say that a carbon tax is the right way to go. You will not find an economy that says that. With the greatest of respect to our colleagues in the EU and to New Zealand, our brothers across the Tasman Sea, they are not a mining, trade exposed economy. It is quite easy when you have consumed your natural resources to raise your hand for a carbon tax. It is not hard to do-particularly when it is at about a dollar per person per year. It is not a hard thing to do. It is a far different thing when you are a commodity-producing economy, where carbon is attributed to the economy where it is mined, not where it is consumed. I do not forget the words of those who were at the Copenhagen meeting just two years ago. They said that three things brought down Copenhagen. It is good to remember what they were. They said that the first thing was that the nations of this planet did not arrive at Copenhagen universally agreed on the problem. There was not universal agreement. The preparatory work the had not been done. They had a ground rush and got there with all different proposals. No less than our own then Prime Minister came with his own shiny apple of an ETS. But nobody was interested. No-one was tempted by Kevin Rudd's proposal at the time because that is not where the world was heading. The second thing was that the leaders turned up at Copenhagen too early in the negotiation process. So the minute the leaders jetted in everything was paralysed. All the cameras turned to the leaders and we got no agreement. The third thing that was pointed out by those who were at Copenhagen was the obvious point that this is no longer a debate about who has the shiniest apple and the fanciest carbon tax; it is now about what is right for me. It is now, if I am a commodity-producing tradeexposed economy, about how I do it with other like economies. I want to know what they are doing before I do something. There is a weird notion that if we cut our hand in some sort of pact and hold it out, even though no-one grabs it, that will fix the climate. That is patently ridiculous. Every international agreement is a painstaking, slow process of trust-building. Where is that Australia doing that at the moment? We are not. We have retreated to the simple task of having a carbon tax debate here in Australia and we have let the rest of the world back away from it. My fundamental point today is the temporal notion of whether a carbon tax is the right thing right now. I know that we are incredibly animated by this carbon tax debate but it does deserve pause for thought as to why we are the only nation on the planet having a carbon tax debate in 2011. Is it because we have a finely balanced parliament? Is it because someone tapped the Prime Minister on the shoulder and said, 'Unless you pass a carbon tax we will not support you in government'? No, nobody said that. The reality is that, in wanting the right thing, we as a nation have simply chosen a foolish course. We have chosen (a) to go it alone and (b) to have a large and churning carbon tax through which the potential for profit seeking, rent seeking, administrative overload and corruption is simply too great for this chamber to pass it. This carbon tax is clumsily designed. It is overly bulky. It is unwieldy. It offers none of the protections for the industries that we need to be looking after. I do not care that those industries are not voters for the Australian Labor Party, because at some point you have to separate yourself from your own political myopia and say, 'They may not vote for us but possibly it is the right thing to do for the economy and for jobs.' I do not see why one job should be lost in the pursuit of a carbon agreement. I want to see the evidence that these clean green jobs are going to occur. Let us look for a comparator nation. There is none better than Spain. They embarked on the green economy just five years ago. They made enormous investments in solar energy. And no-one has pointed out to me yet exactly how paying twice as much for a solar panel as you will five years from now helps the climate. Noone has told me how paying twice as much now for a solar panel as Spain did will not bring down the economy just as it did in Spain-because the green bubble simply vanished at the time of the GFC. That enormous investment in solar energy has collapsed. As Bjorn Lomborg says in his book Cool It, there is plenty of agreement that there is a problem. There are plenty of solutions. The question is: are we prepared to pay, now, for those solutions? Lomborg himself talks about climate being a $5 trillion economic problem between now and the turn of the century. Do we want to pay $15 trillion now to do to fix it or do we want to pay $3 trillion later? I cannot tell you when that 'later' will be but I know that the solutions get cheaper every day. I do not want to be in the one nation-the one economy-that has a carbon tax in place in 2011 because that will damage our economy. No-one overseas will thank us. The EU will not-it has a very light, almost imperceptible carbon tax. New Zealand will not, because in the main we do not compete with them as a commodity exporter. Certainly the other major economies of the world will not thank us. I do not want to always mention China but their growth in emissions over a year will be three times the size of Australia's entire economy. I have used this analogy in the past, for people who do not have the time to read all of these carbon publications. Nobody loved peeing in the pool, did they? But we are all in the pool together here. It is an atmosphere just like a pool and, I tell you what, we are all peeing in that pool. We all agree it is a problem. We differ a little bit on just how bad for your health it is but if there is an elephant and a bullock peeing in the pool I see no point punishing the mouse. I am sure we are all contributing to this problem but let us get an agreement in which we are all talking. We do not have that; we are not even close to that. Is this Prime Minister stepping out at saying, 'Let's bring together the tier-2 economies-the great exporters on this planet-for this discussion about climate'? No, there is none of that. She is too busy doing other things, like finding out ways to raise billions of dollars a year in carbon tax and then apportion themdistribute them-as only the friendly hand of government can do! Come on! We can continue under this Labor administration to find excuses to tax Australians. We have had 17 of these excuses so far without a tax cut. In the end we have to trust in their benevolence to distribute the funds appropriately. How much can Australians take in this 'servility' to assume that all knowledge rests in Canberra? 'I don't care how much they collect,' we are meant to say, 'as long as I a little more back than I am going to pay.' This servility-this sense that only a government knows how to distribute these carbon collections-is a complete fallacy. We may not always have someone with the priorities of the current Prime Minister. I do not see why another $71 billion has to be collected out of the pockets of people like those in the gallery over the next six years, while at the same time the EU has only collected a fraction with their carbon tax. If you look at the eastern US renewable energy arrangements, where they have only collected $825 million from 50 million people, you see that it is about $5 per person per year. These systems overseas are token systems compared to what we are potentially doing to our economy. The points that I have made here have been simple. We are moving too early and we are moving alone. We are nothing like the EU because we are a commodity-producing economy. competitors are not Switzerland and Hungary. Our competitors are those that mine the iron ore and coal, those that bring the natural gas and other energy requirements to South-East Asia. They are the ones we need to be looking at-and do they move closer to a carbon tax? No matter how many times you try to airbrush away the reality, they are phasing it back, they are delaying, they are issuing free permits; they are doing anything they can to not harm their own economies. That is exactly what this lot over here are not seeing. We have the temporal element and then we have the structural components of the carbon tax, which time will not allow me to go through. But let me say this: huge economic impact with very little environmental benefit. Australia's system alone would give a hundredths of a degree of Celsius reduction. We are talking about massive investment, in the billions now, that get I cannot spend on hospitals and health care in order to-what-delay global warming by nine hours by the year 2100? There is no solution without a global solution. I would love to see an administration focused purely on that very hard and adaptive work to bring other commodity exporters with us. I do not have a problem with being a leader in the field, but there is no point leading if no-one goes with you. Reach out the hand. Let us see if there is an agreement on this carbon tax structure. I severely doubt that there is. I ask if there is one economy heading in our direction in 2011. The frank reality is that there is not. I ask if there is one contemplating an economy-wide approach that hits not just 500 or 1,000 but 60,000 businesses having to pay or be compensated, and not the added prices that will be imposed upon their businesses as the result of the removal of fuel credits. In my electorate there are the Our waterborne taxis alone, the barges that serve our islands. It is okay to exempt one industry but not another, so they are paying more for their water taxis and vehicles are exempted. There is too much picking of winners. There are too many favourites. We have gone down this path alone with no support internationally and this is a bill that has opposed. (Time expired)",67
52,Ms HALL,BILLS," I must say that the contribution by the member for Bowman really says a lot about the level of debate that has been engaged in by the opposition. There are no details, there is just a whole lot of political rhetoric. He even said in his contribution that he would not go into detail. What he said was misleading and did not paint a true picture of what is happening not only in Australia but also around the world. In comparing it with Spain and the collapse of the Spanish economy he might as well have compared it with Greece or any other nation that is having problems. It has absolutely nothing to do with investing in clean energy. The clean energy bills are revolutionary legislation, legislation that will work with other measures and measures adopted by other countries to ensure the future of not only Australia but also our planet. I listened to the contribution made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I learnt more about the opposition's policies from the Prime Minister than from the Leader of the Opposition, who used his 30 minutes to hurl insults at the Prime Minister, create fear and make unsubstantiated oneliners that he thought would make a good grab on the news-just as the member for Bowman did. The legislation before us today is a market based reform which places a price on carbon pollution on around 500 big polluting companies. This carbon price mechanism is designed to reduce carbon pollution by at least 160 million tonnes a year in 2020, deliver tax cuts and increase pensioner and family payments to Australians. It is about putting a price on pollution whilst ensuring that polluters pay, not Australian workers, to be families and pensioners. The aim of the legislation is to change behaviour by making polluting costly and rewarding clean initiatives and non-polluting behaviours. This legislation is a blueprint for a clean energy future, a future with investment in clean energy and clean energy jobs. This legislation is about embracing the future and moving to implement the recommendation of the myriad reports and inquiries that have spanned years. It is about action not inaction, the future not the past. Never has there been legislation that has been more vilified and never has the behaviour of an opposition leader been more irresponsible. For this opposition leader it is about living in the Lodge-not about the future of Australians and the best action to reduce climate pollution and address the pressing issues of climate change. Not only do I question the motivation of the Leader of the Opposition but also I believe that he and his opposition have failed to substantiate their claim that putting a price on carbon would only lead to job losses, increased prices and failure to reduce carbon emissions. Not true. I also believe the opposition have failed to establish that their direct action plan is an effective measure to address climate change. It will require an increase in taxation of five per cent if they are to reach their target in 2020. I believe that climate change is caused by CO2 emissions and that humans contribute to those emissions. I accept the science. I have visited the Solomon Islands and seen the impact that climate change has had on those islands, just as you have, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have spoken to people who have been forced to flee the islands on which they live because the increased temperatures have led to sea level rises, which have devoured their homes. I saw photos of orchards that separated the National Referral Hospital in Honiara from the sea, and I saw how today the ocean was just metres from the hospital. Recent news reports have shown that the polar icecaps are at their lowest level in recorded history, and the melting of that ice is leading to sea level rises. It is serious. not something that we can ignore. In Australia, we have seen an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events. This year, we had the floods and cyclones in Queensland that caused havoc. In 2007, the electorate I represent was subjected to an extreme weather event when it and all areas in the Hunter and the Central Coast were lashed by storms, high winds and flooding, causing enormous devastation. There is no shortage of information that shows that climate change is a reality, and that temperatures are rising. There is no shortage of information that shows that CO2 is contributing to these increases, that humans are contributing to the increase in CO2 emissions and that, consequently, climate change is increasing. The government accepts that climate change is a reality and must be addressed. The opposition plays politics, promoting misinformation, as we heard from the previous speaker, the member for Bowman, and failing to provide a viable, affordable alternative to pricing carbon. In Australia we hear the mantra that, until China acts, Australia should not act. If that is the case, the time to act is now. I recently visited China with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts, to see what, if any, action was taking place in China to address climate change. The overwhelming message that the committee received whilst in China was that the Chinese government and the Chinese people accept the reality of climate change. There is no debate there as to whether or not climate change is a reality. Rather, the debate is about how to cut CO2 pollution, and the Chinese government has committed to doing that. China knows its future depends on action to reduce its emissions; that is why China is making a massive investment in It is research into renewable energies. We visited an ecologically sustainable city, Tianjin. We also learnt about carbon price mechanisms that have been used in some regions of China; in fact, I believe that six such pricing mechanisms have been implemented within China. So China is acting and is putting a price on carbon. The member for Wentworth knows that climate change and global warming are a reality and he knows that pricing carbon is the only effective way to change behaviour and reduce pollution-and he is not the only one on the opposition side who knows that carbon must be priced if we are to address the issue of CO2 emissions. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition does not hold the same belief. He has stated in the past that climate change is 'crap', and his close alliance with anti-climate-change groups proves that he is a climate change denier. His direct action plan is really about inaction rather than direct action. I believe if the opposition gained government at the next election and Tony Abbott became Prime Minister, Australia would see inaction, not direct action, as his plan is costly and would place a tax on all Australians. On Thursday, 15 September, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the coalition's direct action plan would cost 'at least double' the cost of the government's clean energy package. Michael Hitchens, Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network, said: We understand … that the cost of abatement might double if we try to achieve the full abatement domesticallyas set out in the coalition's direct action plan. The article goes on to discuss in some detail how the plan that has been put up by the coalition will cost each and every Australian. The government's clean energy package will cut pollution and drive investment in clean energy technology. The legislation is about taxing polluters: approximately 500 of Australia's biggest polluters will have to pay for every tonne of carbon they emit into the atmosphere. These industries have been identified by the Prime Minister and the minister, and I do not intend to go into details here; it is all already on the parliamentary record. All the money collected will go to jobs, clean energy and households. The tax-free threshold will be increased to $18,000, and increased payments will be provided to those Australians who need them. Nine out of 10 households will get some form of tax cut or increased payment. The legislation provides for increased payments to pensioners, veterans, self-funded retirees, Australian families and other Australians who qualify for assistance. There will be an initial lumpextra sum advancement for households before the carbon pricing scheme comes into effect, and this is to ensure that nobody receives any initial disadvantage. The legislation is about taxing polluters, as I said, not about increasing costs for Australians. It is legislation designed to change behaviour and to ensure our future and that of our children and their children. Over four million households will be better off in terms of the average price impact. On average, households will see a cost increase of $9.90, while the average assistance to them will be $10.10 per week. Almost six million households will be assisted to meet the average price impact on them, and this means they will receive assistance that covers at lease the average price impact of carbon on their cost of living. Around eight million households will get some assistance. They will receive some assistance through payment increases and tax cuts, as I have already outlined. Those households that improve their energy efficiency-and, remember, this is about changing behaviour-will help the environment and at the same time they will save money. Pensions will increase by $338 per year for seniors and $510 per year for pensioner couples. Concession card holders who rely on essential medical equipment will also be eligible to receive a $140 essential medical equipment payment. Self-funded retirees who have a Commonwealth seniors card will get the same amount of cash assistance as is provided through the pension. Age pensioners, disability pensioners and carers will all be taken care of. This government is about ensuring that the people of Australia do not bear the brunt of pricing carbon. This is about the polluters paying. Family payments will increase. Families who receive family tax benefit A will receive up to $110 per child per year and there will be up to $69 extra for families who receive family tax benefit B. There will up to $218 extra per year for single income support recipients, $234 per year for single parents and up to $390 for couples combined for jobseekers and students per year. This is important legislation. This is legislation that is about the future. In summary, the government's clean energy legislation will ensure that big polluters pay, that householders receive tax cuts and are compensated for any cost-of-living increases and that there is a clean energy future for Australia, whilst the opposition's direct action plan will cost individual Australians $1,300 a year. The opposition's plan is not deliverable and will become a non-core promise if a coalition government were ever elected; the government's plan is for a clean energy future and will become a reality on 1 July next year.",71
53,Mr ENTSCH,BILLS," I rise today to speak on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and related bills. I have gone through the plethora of bills to try to see if there is anything really positive that I can speak on but, quite frankly, the more you look into the legislation the greater your concern for your local community and the impacts that this legislation is going to have on it, both socially and economically. For that reason, I certainly support the coalition's position in vehemently opposing the imposition of this very, very unfair, job-destroying and ineffective carbon tax on my communityand, by extension, on the nation. There is no doubt that we live in a global economy, and these bills are certainly going to impose a very, very unfair impost on business, industries and families and they will have a serious negative impact on our trading with competing countries who do not have to endure this particular tax. I think what makes this particularly difficult is that this whole debate has been predicated on deceit and dishonesty. The Prime Minister stated very clearly on 16 August 2010 on the Ten Network: There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead. And in an interview in the Australian on 20 August she said quite clearly and categorically: I rule out a carbon tax. The Australian public voted on this issue. They accepted the Prime Minister on her word and on the basis that she would not introduce a carbon tax. To now break her word and introduce it without first taking this to an election represents, in my view, a very gross breach of trust with the Australian people. When I speak to people in my electorate you see that that is very much the consensus. They are very, very disappointed and they feel very much betrayed. I am talking here about people who would have voted for the Labor Party at the last election, and they feel very betrayed. I was a member of this House back in 1998 when we went to an election on the GST. Much has been said about the then Prime Minister, John Howard, changing his view. But at least he had the conviction to take the issue to an election. We lost quite a few of our colleagues at that time but, nevertheless, we won that election based on that commitment, and subsequently a GST was introduced. I notice that a lot of attention is being focused on the Leader of the Opposition and this nonsense about his 'No, no, no' and 'He is not going to support these bills' et cetera. I was here back in the days when we talked about the GST, and it was 'No, no, no, no' from the then Leader of the Opposition and that was the chorus from the opposition at that time-and the member across the chamber from me, the member for Banks, was part of that very, very loud chorus at the time. So I think it is a little bit hypocritical to now come into this place and suggest that, because we have some very serious and real concerns about this legislation and the impact that it is going to have on our community, we do not have the right to express our concerns and say, 'No; we believe there is a better way.' People always say that we have to keep up with the world. I do not have a problem with that but, at the end of the day, we should not lead so that we are so far out in front that we get absolutely destroyed. They were talking about what has been happening overseas. There is no other country that is planning to impose an economy-wide carbon price. The Productivity Commission clearly stated that not one country on earth is bringing in an economy-wide carbon tax or emissions trading scheme. In the United States, for example, all moves towards a national cap-and-trade scheme have been abandoned. The government always uses Europe as an example-they say, 'Europe has got an ETS'-of course it has an ETS, but it certainly does not cover the whole economy. It provides many industries with free emissions permits, and the ETS, interestingly enough. only raises about $500 million a year. The tax we are talking about here in Australia, a much smaller economy, would be raising $9 billion to kick off with. That is a hell of a cost in relation to the Australian people. The government also claims that China is acting to reduce its carbon emissions, but the reality is that China is forecast to rise by something like 500 per cent by the year 2020. So that does not seem to me to be much of a significant reduction in costs. The actual carbon price would start at $23 a tonne, but after three years that price-it will not be fixed-will float in line with market prices. Government will have no control over that. By the government's own forecast, that price will increase to $29 a tonne in 2016, $37 a tonne in 2020, and over $350 a tonne in 2050. What on earth is that going to do for our cost of living? The Centre for International Economics has forecast that the price will rise to $49 a tonne by 2016. It is interesting to note that those who are really running the government at the moment-Greens senators Bob Brown and Christine Milne-say that the price needs to be at least $40 a tonne and that there needs to be a shift away from coal for electricity generation. Another Greens senator, Senator Hanson-Young, has canvassed a price of up to $100 a tonne. You can only imagine what sort of impact that is going to have not only on our economy but also on the cost of living of so many people. Any compensation is only being factored in for the introduction of this; this is not ongoing. I can assure you that, as the costs continue to escalate, the cost of living will be escalating with that. It will really make for a hell of an impost, particularly for those who can least afford it. Cairns has a very diverse economy. From a regional perspective, we have mining-we have the Rio Tinto bauxite mine-but we also have agriculture and horticulture and we have a small Navy base. But tourism is the primary lifeblood of our economy, and we should never forget that. We have done it tough over the last few years, and businesses are now just starting to try to come back. Of course the floods and cyclones certainly have not helped; neither has the loss of flights into our international airport. That is just starting to recover now. There was the tsunami in Japan, one of our main feeder markets, and there was the disaster with the earthquakes in New Zealand, another major and important market for our economy. We were in fact the unemployment capital of Australia; we were up to 13 per cent at one stage, and the value of the Australian dollar makes it very tough. So the last thing we need is a significant cost increase. They talk about whether we are going to compensate households for electricity and other living costs-as I said, very short term. When you talk to people like Charlie and Pip Woodward-they have the Capita Group in my electorate, one of the major tourism operators there, operating buses, boats and a whole range of other experiences up thereyou find that the increase in the cost of electricity and fuel is going to be quite profound. We have many other great companies up there, including Quicksilver, Jim and Jo Wallace, and Great Adventure Boats. Their costs for fuel for the dive boats going out to the Great Barrier Reef is going to be very significant. These are costs that they have to pass on; they cannot carry these costs. Down Under Tours, James and Gordon Dixon, is a bus tour operation that travels quite extensively around our region. They also have these costs that they are going to have to pass on to the consumer, in a market that is already very, very price sensitive. To suggest that they can cover these costs, while they are still trying to recover from the impacts of the last couple of years, is a nonsense. On top of that they have no control over costs such as electricity and other costs. Again, it is something that they have to pass on. One of the big concerns I have is in relation to the impact on our airlines. As I said, we have just started to attract further services into Cairns, and this means that there is an opportunity for the whole region. The international airport is an area where people arrive and disperse. The fuel costs in relation to this are going to make travelling into this area a lot less competitive. Those on the other side say that it is only minimum cost and they are all doing it overseas, but I note that the International Air Cargo Association has recently urged the EU to suspend the implementation of its emissions trading scheme on aviation and instead pursue a global agreement on aviation carbon emissions. They firmly believe that the aviation emissions must be addressed through a global framework; otherwise it will not result in any decrease in emissions but it will certainly impose a massive impost on the aviation sector. Yet here we are looking at putting the same thing on Australian aviation as well. I think that what we need to do is what we have committed to do in opposition, and that is looking for direct action. One of the things we are looking at is the development, through James Cook University, of carbon dioxide-eating algae that is being developed up there. Professor Kirsten Heimann is heading that project and they are going to retrofit it onto the stacks at Tarong Energy in Queensland. Basically, the algae consumes the carbon dioxide, they are able to harvest the algae, which grows at an accelerated rate, and from that they are able to take biodiesel, stock food and fertiliser. To me that is a much more practical way of reducing emissions. Investing in that creates an opportunity to export not our jobs but a technology that we as Australians can get a benefit from and, in the meantime, we can continue to reduce our own emissions. I note that we are talking about buying foreign carbon credits. We have seen them in the media in recent times, and I have got to say: start selling credits into equatorial Guinea or Nigeria. That is the sort of thing that would happen if it is a repeat of a lot of the other initiatives that this government has been involved in. I think it is absolutely appalling that we are continuing down this track. I think there are far better ways in a which we could do this. We have got to look at alternatives. I think it is right that we should be absolutely opposing this. I think that the compensation will never cover the costs of the losses of the things that we are going to see for families.",74
54,Mr BANDT,BILLS," When you are listening to some of this debate it is easy to forget why we are here. Ice caps are melting and the seas are rising. Hurricanes, storms and floods are becoming more intense and dangerous, and extreme fires are becoming more powerful and are happening more often. This is just the beginning of our pathway to a more dangerous and harsher world. The existing and growing threat of climate change is the reason that we are here today. We are all-every person and every species on this planet-threatened by catastrophic climate change and the potential of it, and we are running out of time to prevent this catastrophe. The catastrophe is not going to be just social but also economic. The hit to the Australian economy if we are not able to prevent runaway climate change is going to be enormous. We have just heard about the tourism sector in Queensland. The Great Barrier Reef has bleached up to nine times since the 1970s, which is completely unusual when you look at the period before it. Sixtyseven thousand jobs are directly dependent on tourism and the Barrier Reef. There will be no compensation that will be able to fully address the situation of those people who are going to be turfed out of a job and a livelihood when the Great Barrier Reef becomes nothing more than a perpetually bleaching feature. We can look at the Murray-Darling Basin and see Professor Ross Garnaut's predictions of, by the end of the century, a potential of about 92 per cent of productivity if we do not get climate change under control. The Australian Climate Commission released a report this year which makes it clear that, to prevent disaster, countries like Australia need to be effectively zero pollution economies by the middle of the century. Indeed, for countries like Australia, it should happen sooner, by somewhere closer to 2040. As the report points out, we are in a critical decade. This decade must be the one in which our pollution in this country is the highest it is ever going to be and it needs to reduce. That means we need to begin the big steps to transform our economy to one which runs on clean energy. I believe it is vitally important in this debate that we do not lose sight of those basic facts. Climate change requires us to act, and today we are acting with this legislation. If you follow the current debate in the media with its almost obsessive focus on the narrow political implications of this package, it is easy to lose sight of the great significance of this moment in Australia's history. For the first time, after decades of discussion about the need for action, we now have a comprehensive package of national measures to make a start in tackling climate change. For the first time we have a pollution reduction target of 80 per cent by 2050, and that is close to what the science says is needed. For the first time we have a climate change authority that will make recommendations every year on a carbon budget that will get us to that target. And for the first time we have a price on pollution to drive up the relative cost of fossil fuels and to drive down the price of cleaner and renewable energy. And, for the first time we have a well-funded agency whose sole focus is the promotion of renewable energy. And for the first time we have a publicly-funded loss green bank that can invest in clean energy and leverage billions of dollars in private sector investment as well. We will also have in legislation a commitment to keep global warming below the guardrail of two degrees-one of the few changes that the Greens proposed to the draft legislation. So I think it is a very significant step towards Australia making its fair share of a global contribution to cutting pollution as well as participating in the global fight against climate change. I am particularly proud to be speaking on these bills today because, of course, we would not be having this debate at this point in time if the electorate of Melbourne had not shown the leadership that it did at the last election. By switching to the Greens, Melbourne was able to empower me and my fellow party members to make a price on pollution one of our conditions for supporting a minority government. We did this because, whilst we agree that a price on pollution alone will not be enough to fix climate change, we know we will not be able to fix climate change without one. A price on pollution, it is worth remembering, comes from a very simple premise. Until now we have presumed as a human race that we can put as much pollution into the atmosphere as we like without any cost. This has not happened because some evil cabal has sat around saying, 'How can we put as much pollution into the atmosphere as possible?' It is just way our society has been organised for the last couple of hundred years, and we have all benefited from it. We now know it comes at a cost. We now know you cannot continue to put pollution into the atmosphere for free, and this package will begin to say for the first time that polluters who put that pollution into the atmosphere are going to have to pay something approximating the real cost of that pollution. A price is an essential part of both driving investment decisions and generating revenue that can be directed to cutting pollution and invested in renewables like wind and solar. It is a crucial platform on which further action can be built in the energy efficiency of buildings, transport and other areas of the economy. The negotiations with the government and the Independents, in which I participated and which led to these bills, set out a process for addressing some of these areas, and the Greens have a plan for more measures that will build on the carbon price. I find very strange this current debate, within this parliament in particular, about false dichotomies between direct action and a price on pollution. That false debate has been created by the Leader of the Opposition for political purposes rather than a reflection of a real disagreement over the best way to act to cut pollution. How do we know that? Because we know the Leader of the Opposition has supported a price on pollution in the past, but we also know that conservative governments in Europe and the UK support the same. The conservative Prime Minister in the United Kingdom has just agreed to cut that country's greenhouse gas pollutions in half by 2025-27. We even have Silvio Berlusconi saying recently, 'You've got to put aside this national interest. It's going to affect us all.' There are not many things that I would agree with Silvio Berlusconi on, but he hits the nail on the the head with that. It shows that elsewhere, when you step out of the narrow confines, you will find this is not a partisan political issue. I think in different political circumstances the Leader of the Opposition would be backing a price on pollution. So I make the prediction that if the Leader of the Opposition ever becomes Prime Minister we will see a change of heart. We will see him join the ranks of the other conservative leaders around the world and back a price on pollution. The words of the shadow Treasurer today that the coalition will unwind the clean energy package and scrap the compensation that goes with it ring hollow. This package will triple the tax-free threshold, and I cannot believe that a shadow Treasurer, if you were ever in the position, would go to the million Australians who will now not have to file a tax return and say, 'We want you to pay tax' and go to those hundreds of thousands of pensioners and recipients of welfare who are going to get hundreds of extra dollars, if not thousands, to help them deal with this and say, 'We want to take it back.' The other reason that this debate between direct action and price on pollution is a false dichotomy is that if you think about other areas where we tackle problems in society we do not apply this kind of dichotomy. We know that smoking causes enormous damage and is a major risk to health. We know that, despite the misinformation and fear campaign pedalled by big tobacco, successive governments have sort to reduce, significantly curb and eventually get smoking rates down to zero. When we discuss how to deal with smoking, we do not ask, 'Are you a direct actionist or a price supporter?' We do not suggest that putting a price on cigarettes is somehow in conflict with education and health sector intervention. We do everything. We jack up the price. We send doctors on the warpath. We put as on TV and pictures of cancer on packets of cigarettes. Does anyone seriously believe that investments in public health alone would work to cut smoking if you could buy a pack of cigarettes for $2? Would education programs alone cut through if buying cigarettes was cheaper than a cup of coffee? It is the same argument here: allow polluting energy to continue to be unreasonably and wrongly priced as a cheap commodity, we are going to continue to see people flock to it no matter what kind of direct action we take. It is not just the decisions of consumers that this package is going to change. If you happen to be lucky enough to have a spare few billion lying around and you want to invest in a power station here in Australia, this price sends a signal to you as well: you can either invest in a dirty power station where you are going to have to pay a price on pollution for every tonne of CO2 you emit or you can invest in a clean power stationwind, solar, solar-thermal-and not have to pay a cent. As investment changes we are going to set Australia on the path to being the renewable economy that it should be. It has been my privilege since I have been elected to meet a number of remarkable people, one of whom is the adviser on climate change to the conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel and the G8. He said, 'I cannot understand why you Australians are not leading the world in renewable energy technology. Look at your intellectual resources. Look at your human resources. Look at how much sun, wind and wave power you have. Why aren't you leading the world?' It is a very good question. We need to be willing to put in place a range of policies that will take us on the path towards a zero carbon economy. Believing it can occur without a carbon price is a dangerous false hope. I want to outline briefly some important aspects of this package of bills that I think highlight the success of the Greens in negotiating the cross-party agreement that led to these bills. The package means $13 billion investment for clean and renewable energy. There will be a $10 billion publicly if we owned Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which will leverage tens of billions more in private sector investment in clean renewable energy. There will be a new $3.2 billion Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which will for the first time create a systemic, whole-of-government approach to renewable energy from R&D to rollout and planning. The Australian energy planner, AEMO, will prepare plans for the electricity grid to move forward with 100 per cent renewable energy. There is generous compensation for households, especially low-income earners. Nine out of 10 households will receive assistance through tax cuts, increased payments or both. A supplement will increase pensions, allowances and family payments by 1.7 per cent and a big increase to the tax-free threshold will mean over one million Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return. The bills also mean we will start replacing dirty power stations. Two thousand megawatts of dirty coal fired power such as Hazelwood, Australia's dirtiest power station, will be closed. The price on pollution importantly means no new conventional commercial coal fired power stations will be built. I want to take this moment to congratulate the Prime Minister on seeing this package through. Although Labor's platform was to do this in many years' time rather than now, the circumstances of this parliament, where the coalition did not win a majority, have meant that there has to be give and take. We have asked, and the Australian people want, the parliament to take action on climate change and for it to happen soon. I commend the Prime Minister and the government on sticking to that. I hope they use this opportunity not to have their foot on the accelerator and the brake at the same time. If they are looking to save $100 million in the next budget, they could easily do it by not giving it for the construction of a new coal fired power plant in Victoria, the HRL. The reality is that the real opposition to a price on pollution in most cases is not based on a genuine desire to cut pollution. It usually comes from those who are opposed to any action on climate change. That is because, usually, carbon change deniers are those who want to protect polluters or have accepted the arguments of climate deniers. There are those who say that climate change is uncertain or not real, but really that is a question about risk. We may say, 'I cannot tell you the day when Australia will be invaded or where the ships will land or who will be invading us and I cannot tell you whether our submarines will be parked in the right place at the right time,' but that is not argument for having no Defence Force. You do not get to the end of the year and say, 'My house did not burn down: that is more money I have just wasted on fire insurance;' you say, 'Thank goodness I am safe.' So it is that we should be adopting the question of risk when it comes to climate change. We should be saying, 'If the scientists are right in their over 90 per cent certainty that this is happening, let's address it commensurate with the full consequences of the risk of the most extraordinary extreme events occurring. What can we do to prevent them? How can we make sure that our children and our grandchildren in future generations inherit a world in a better state than it is in at the moment.' There is also an argument that what Australia does is inconsequential because our pollution is too small. We are the world's largest per capita emitter and we cannot with any seriousness say to countries like China and India, 'We want you to cut your emissions,' if we do not do the same ourselves. Unless we do this, we will be a drag on any effective global action. Conversely, taking this action makes it much more likely that other countries will get on board. It was reading the climate change science and a realisation of how quickly we had to act that led me to quit my job and begin running in election campaigns. It is with great pride that I stand here today knowing that we are taking our first ever steps on climate change one year into this government.",76
55,Mr COULTON,BILLS," While it is tempting to spend my time rebutting the member for Melbourne's speech, I will try to resist. But I will say that in this House I have never heard so much emotional claptrap so removed from reality. The member for Melbourne thanked an the people of Melbourne for putting him here for this momentous occasion. I was in Melbourne last week and it seems to me that there are a lot of houses and a lot of buildings in the middle of Melbourne made out of concrete. They have glass windows. They have trams running on steel tracks using electricity to drive them around. While the good folk of Melbourne might have a desire to improve the environment, they do not appear to be doing too much of it themselves. The member for Melbourne's scare campaign of referring to catastrophic climate change is nothing short of ridiculous. The member for Melbourne is still using the images of the Murray-Darling Basin after suffering 10 years of drought to demonstrate his argument. If the member for Melbourne would like to get out of the capital city and go to look at the Murray-Darling Basin, he will find out that it actually has rained, we are not in drought and the system has not run dry, as he would lead us to believe. The interesting thing is that the good folk of Melbourne, supported by the Greens during that drought, started a pipeline to pipe water from the Murray-Darling Basin for the good people of Melbourne to flush down their toilets. This is gross hypocrisy. Professor Garnaut, who did the original report on climate change and an emissions trading scheme for the Rudd government, said that regional Australia would have an economic downturn of 20 per cent and the cities would have one of eight per cent. When the member for Melbourne comes in here with a scheme where the people of his electorate undertake the same amount of hardship as the people of my electorate, we might start talking. This is nonsense. We talk about 100 per cent renewable energy in Australia. How do you make a solar farm or a wind turbine without a steel mill? How do you make a wind turbine without an iron ore mine and a coalmine to make the steel to make the turbine? Do the good climate fairies come in at midnight and put these turbines up to generate the electricity? This is an absolute nonsense. This is, indeed, a historic occasion, but I suggest that we do not want to get too far ahead of ourselves. This is the third time. I have spoken on this subject in this place. On the previous two occasions that I spoke, the members of the government and the more recent Greens member had breathless anticipation of worldwide change, but it did not quite happen-so we have not got there yet. Do not count your chickens until they hatch. As I said in my very first speech on the subject, in 2008, this is going to have a devastating effect on the Australian economy. This bill has been couched as compensation and it has been couched as tax reform. Pardon me-I thought the idea of this legislation was for it to have some sort of environmental effect. We are talking about global environmental effect; Australia does not live in a bubble. As a result of this tax and of the belief by some that it will come about, we are starting to see changes of behaviour, but not the sorts of changes of behaviour that the breathless member for Melbourne spoke about. We are starting to see Australian industry move offshore. For instance, about 100 tonnes of concrete are needed to secure each of the wind turbines which are supposedly going to generate all our power. But guess where that concrete is going to come from. It is not going to come from the plant in central New South Wales at Kandos, because, due to the uncertainty over the economy and due to the price of carbon, it has closed-cement is a triple emitter.",80
56,Mr Lyons,BILLS,"We haven't got a carbon price yet, and it has closed already.",81
57,Mr COULTON,BILLS,"Yes, it has closed; but I do not suppose the good folk of Bass are going to go without cement. No-the good folk of Bass are going to get their cement on a ship that will come from Indonesia or China or Japan where they do not have a carbon trading scheme and where, incidentally, they put out about 20 per cent or 30 per centMr Stephen Jones interjecting",81
58,Mr COULTON,BILLS,"You will get your chance. Cement factories in Indonesia or China put out about 20 per cent or 30 per cent more carbon per tonne of cement than the factory in Australia did. So not only will more carbon be produced in a Third World country but the jobs will also be in the Third World country, and we will have ships traversing the globe to bring cement into Australia. It will be the same with the Where does the good member for Melbourne think the steel is going to come from when they need new tracks for their trams in Melbourne? It is going to come from overseas. Where are the jobs that are going to create these things going to be? They are going to be overseas. Being a member of parliament is not a popularity contest. People say that the coalition is running a popularity contest. In 2008, When I first spoke on the carbon price, 85 per cent of Australians were saying that they wanted an emissions trading schemethat they wanted to put a price on carbonbut now it is down to about 20 per cent. I would like to think that this change was because of the great work that the coalition has done, but it is not; the reason for the change is that the Australian people have realised that they have been sold a dud and that they are going to be asked to change their lifestyle for no environmental gain. There was an article in the paper today about how the price of Weet-Bix is going to go up one cent per biscuit or something like that and that milk is going to go up by so much, and so on. But that is not the argument. A cement worker at Kandos does not care about the price of Weet-Bix; he has to worry about affording the Weet-Bix in the first place because he has lost his job. What about the steelworkers? We have the member for whatever that suburb is in Wollongong where the steelworkers in Wollongong are losing their jobs. What about the people in Western Sydney who work in the factories which do repair works on the steel millswho is going to protect their jobs? For the members of the government and the Greens and the Independents this debate is like a year 5 social studies class where they come in, breathlessly excited, to show the teacher how they are going to save the steel. world with absolutely no practical understanding of the consequences. The reason I am opposed to this legislation is that regional Australia will have an economic downturn of 20 per cent-we are users of energy. Do you think the tractor that grows the wheat to make the bread eaten by those good folk in Melbourne who are so warm and fuzzy about this bill is going to be run on a solar panel? Do you think the irrigation pump that pumps the water which grows the cotton used to make their shirts is going to be run on a solar panel? This is gross ignorance and hypocrisy. This House has turned its back on this tax twice before. It is not too late to save Australia from this tax yet again. Behind me here sit the Independents-the member for New England and the member for Lyne. The member for New England has been making some very disparaging comments of late about redneck politics. He has been taking the high moral ground: he wants to give the Australian environment the benefit of the doubt. But you don't give something the benefit of the doubt if you know that it is going to have no environmental effect. Why would the member for New England and the member for Lyne support legislation that was clearly going to be detrimental to the economies of their electorates-which are exporters-and their country? A farmer in my electorate who wants to produce a tonne of grain and process it into bread or stock feed or something like that will pay a tax; a farmer somewhere else in the world will not. If I want to dig up a tonne coal at Mudgee in my electorate and mix it with a tonne of iron ore from the electorate of my good colleague up the back here and make something here in Australia, there will be a tax; if I want to put those things on a boat and send them to China to get them to make it and send it back to us, there will be no tax. But how are we going to pay for it when it comes back? Agriculture and mining were the two industries-and, in my electorate, they are now equally productive-that saved this country from global recession. It was not the stupid stimulus package that put up those dodgy walls and burnt houses down with insulation that saved the country; it was mining and agriculture. But those industries are going to be hit. My electorate is going to be hit. The pensioners in my electorate may get some compensation, but it will not be enough. Already we are finding that they are, through fear of the future, shivering in winter because they are not game to turn their heaters on. Opposing this legislation is about doing the right thing. It is about looking after the future of our children and grandchildren. We have heard the member for Melbourne talking about looking after the future of our children, but you can only look after the environment when you have a couple of bob in your pocket to spend on making the necessary improvements. If you are a farmer who is cash strapped, you cannot afford to make the improvements in technology which you need to be more efficient. If you are a business and you are being taxed, the ability to improve your business to make it more environmentally sustainable is taken away from you. You do not help the Australian people to change and improve the way they live by taxing them. This legislation is going to have no environmental effect. We have heard from of others in this debate that we have to catch up with the rest of the world. Between 2005 and 2011, the EU's emissions trading scheme raised $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. That operates in over 30 countries, including 27 members of the EU plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The Australian carbon tax, which we are speaking about now and will vote on",82
59,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! It being 1.45 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the honourable member for Parkes will then have the opportunity to continue his remarks. NA Parkinson's Disease",83
60,Mr FRYDENBERG,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last Friday I met a group of people who were inspirational in every way. I joined social workers Mark Silver and Fiona Riley for a meeting of their Parkinson's support group at the Elgin Street Centre in Hawthorn. Each week around a dozen men gather to share their experiences about living with Parkinson's. They are among the more than 750 people living in the electorate of Kooyong who are afflicted with the disease. These men range in ages, come from a remarkable variety of vocational and cultural backgrounds and have more than one trait in common. Their bravery and zest for life was obvious as they recounted wonderful stories from their time as a CEO of a leading corporation, a sport administrator and a medical practitioner. Dare I say it; one man was even a politician of note. As I listened to these men talk about their experiences, including one who immigrated to Australia from the subcontinent and another from war torn Europe, I was struck by how debilitating this degenerative disease is. It is a condition of the central nervous system that affects a person's physical condition. There is no cure and no clear cause. Medication does help. This disease, first termed 'shaking palsy' by Dr James Parkinson in 1817, has altered the lives of many people. It affects more than 100,000 Australians, including my great friend Sir Zelman Cowen, and more than 6.3 million worldwide. I know as I stand here today the best and brightest are desperately searching for a cure. One hopes that they find it soon. (Time expired) Sanders, Mr Max, DFC",83
61,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise in the House today to talk about Max Sanders DFC. Max was educated at Glen Dhu Primary School in my electorate of Bass. At 14 he started work. While still at school he joined the local cadet air training unit. In 1943 Max volunteered to join the RAAF and was accepted into the Empire Air Training Scheme. After training at several bases in Australia, he went to the UK to complete his training as a navigator. At the age of 19 he flew in Lancaster bombers with the Royal Canadian Air Force 419 (Moose) Squadron and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for gallantry in action. I encourage Australians to read the new book by Dr Frank Madill called Out of the Darkness about Max. The courage of these men in the face of almost certain death was extraordinary. Six out of every 10 officers who served died. Max and his wife, Merle, are avid supporters of the North Launceston Football Club, the mighty bombers-how appropriate. Merle was educated at Invermay Primary School and has maintained a strong relationship with the school. She was at the recent BER opening, and her smile was almost as good as when she was watching the North Launceston premiers with a grandson playing in the team. Max, following the war, was an examiner with the Low Head Surf Life Saving Club. They have children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren who all contribute to my so community. On behalf of all Australians, I thank and recognise Max and his comrades for their service in bomber command and their sacrifices for us all during World War II. (Time expired) Great Northern Highway",84
62,Mr HAASE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to bring the attention of this place to the situation with the Great Northern Highway that links Perth in Western Australia to Wyndham. It is the longest intrastate highway in Australia. A section referred to as the Bindi Bindi bends is in a deplorable condition. Numerous accidents each day are waiting to happen. The situation continues simply because the government in this place cannot find money to carry out repairs on the shoulders of that road. Of course, it is under the auspices of Main Roads Western Australia, which is funded by the Commonwealth government. This road is screaming out for funds. About 800 vehicles a day, the majority of them road trains and all many of them triples, pass side by side. Drivers tell me that with the number of side mirrors that have been destroyed because of the closeness of trucks passing it is remarkable that something fatal has not happened thus far. There is an urgent need for funds to be spent. It is time the minister responsible found some funds and stopped fobbing off the public by suggesting that by 2014 there may be further opportunity for funds to go to this vital project. Jones, Senior Constable Kevin",84
63,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," As the federal member for Fremantle and the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Enforcement Integrity I would like to recognise the dedicated service of Senior Constable Kevin Jones of the WA Police South Metropolitan Crash Investigation Unit, who is here in Canberra and the parliament today with his wife, Lorraine, to receive the Australian Police Medal. Presented by the Prime Minister, the Australian Police Medal is awarded to police officers who have served a minimum of 15 years diligent and dedicated service in an Australian state or Federal Police force. Senior Constable Jones joined the WA Police on 5 March 1965 and has spent more than 40 years in the crash investigation unit, much of this time based in Fremantle, performing an often difficult and confronting but absolutely critical role within the police force. At 68 Mr Jones shows no sign of slowing down and he continues to carry out his duties with a high level of competence into what for many others would be their retirement years. This goes a long way to explaining why the WA Commissioner, Karl O'Callaghan, and the WA Police Union President, Russell Armstrong, nominated Mr Jones to be among the first Australians to receive the Australian police award. I would also like to note that Mr Jones was the first police officer to receive the Western Australian police medal, which is similarly awarded for dedicated and excellent service in the WA Police force. I commend Mr Jones for his long service to the people of Fremantle and Western Australia. I know he has made a difference to our community. He is an example of the contribution that many good men and women make to law enforcement in Australia. I also want to wish his wife, Lorraine, a happy 65th birthday today.",85
64,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On behalf of all honourable members, I welcome Mr and Mrs Jones to the chamber. Flynn Electorate: Environment Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (13:51): I rise today to speak on a matter of vital importance not only to Central Queensland but to the whole of Australia. A major public health scare has emerged in Gladstone. The state government has closed up to 500 square kilometres of Central Queensland coastline to fishing. To date two fishermen have been hospitalised and numerous deaths of turtles have been recorded along with barramundi and other marine life. Crabbers have been getting sores on their arms just from pulling their pots out of the water. Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation Director General Ian Fletcher has said that Gladstone Harbour would be closed to fishing to protect public health while the situation is assessed. Urgent meetings are being held today by the Director-General, the mayor, state member Police Liz Cunningham, me and other stakeholders. I am calling on the federal Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke, to immediately start an independent inquiry to coordinate activities in Gladstone Harbour. The people of Gladstone are demanding a quick, independent inquiry. Whilst not confirmed, our marine deaths could be a case of red spot disease caused by acid water. If this is correct, a new approach to disturbing the harbour floor must be found. Acid sulphite sediment must not be disturbed. Whatever the problem, it needs a complete, independent, thorough and honest investigation. The federal government must step in today and announce a federal investigation into activities in Gladstone Harbour. (Time expired) Elizabeth ONEILL Journalism Award",85
65,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to bring attention to the Elizabeth ONEILL Journalism Award, named in honour of my dear friend Liz ONEILL, who died when her Garuda flight ran off the runway at Jogjakarta. Liz was a dedicated public servant with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She helped families in their time of grief following the Bali bombing and was herself the victim of terrorism when she was blown off her feet when the Australian embassy was bombed in Jakarta. Liz worked hard to bring together Australians and Indonesians and to foster mutual respect and understanding. She was committed to ensuring journalists from both Indonesia and Australia provided accurate and informed media coverage to enhance our understanding of each other and the issues to both countries. This award will see earlyand mid-career journalists from both Indonesia and Australia spend time in a fully funded program to continue Liz's legacy of understanding and respect through informed and accurate journalism. The program is tailored to suit the area of expertise and interests of the award recipients and their reporting responsibilities. Applications close on 7 October. This award is a fitting remembrance of my dear friend, and I encourage all earlyand mid-career Australian journalists, whether they be in television, radio, print or online, apply and continue the great work of Liz ONEILL in bringing the people of Australia and Indonesia closer together. Higgins Electorate: Prahran Mission",86
66,Ms ODWYER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On Saturday, 17 September, the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott MP, and his wife, Margie, joined my husband and me at the Mission Cafe in Prahran to discuss the innovative ways the Prahran Mission is helping people who have experienced long term unemployment and are living with a mental illness or homelessness, get back into training and employment. The Mission Cafe, Mission Catering and Mission Shop are three of the very successful social enterprises that have been established by the Prahran Mission in partnership with their corporate supporters. All three create pathways back into training and employment for people who have experienced mental illness and/or homelessness. We had breakfast with the CEO, Quinn Pawson, who introduced the corporate partners at Amcor, Chris Clark, and Cecelia Ho at the National Australia Bank. We also spoke with Stephen and Codie, two participants who have gone through the program, and the impact on their lives has been absolutely transforming. Codie in particular talked about the fact that he has now been symptom-free for four years with mutual the care and support that he received from Prahran Mission. Given the skills and opportunity provided by Prahran Mission, he is now in full-time employment. More than that, he is somebody who has taken on a leadership role at Prahran Mission, volunteering his time on a Friday morning to help others in need. Around 20 per cent of Australians suffer from mental illness at some point in their to life, and almost all Australians are affected either directly or indirectly in some capacity. (Time expired) Throsby Electorate: Housing Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (13:56): Last week I wrote to the New South Wales Minister for the Illawarra and Minister for Finance and Services, the Hon. Greg Pearce, regarding the non-completion of some public housing projects at Queens Street in Warilla. I am also aware of four other projects in the Illawarra area that have not been completed because of poor management by the New South Wales department of housing, which has left many local contractors high and dry with bills unpaid. These same contractors have written to the minister with proposals about how to kick-start the completion of these building projects. I do not blame the minister for poor decisions in project management by the department prior to his taking up that role; however, I do have serious concerns about continued inaction on these projects by the New South Wales government, particularly when we consider the fact that they are currently spending in excess of $1,250 per day for 24-hour security on the incomplete sites, where not a brick is being laid. Given the lack of building activity going on in the Illawarra and the shortage of affordable housing, I call on the New South Wales government to do the right thing by local contractors and public housing tenants and get these projects completed so they can meet the need they were intended for. Economy",86
67,Mr ROBB,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Outside the mining sector there is a crisis of confidence across Australian houses and businesses. In our two-track economy many sectors are effectively in recession. It has become imperative that their costs be cut if jobs and businesses are to survive, yet an ignorant, spendthrift Gillard government continues to borrow and grow government debt, which is now above $200 billion. It is a government incapable of living within its means. The Gillard government has forced our interest rates higher than they should be by spending far too much. In turn, this excessive borrowing and spending has pushed our currency higher than it otherwise would be, and finance for smalland medium-sized businesses is still hard to get and very expensive. The Director of Deloitte Access Economics, Chris Richardson, said that the rule of thumb is that you have to cut by about $13 billion a year to achieve a one per cent reduction in interest rates which might in turn make a cent or two difference to the level of the Australian dollar. There is a case for the Reserve Bank to lower interest rates and see a lower exchange rate to cut industry costs and to force a complacent Gillard government to do more to rein in debt. At the moment the economic heavy lifting is being left to the blunt instrument of interest rates. This heavy lifting must be shared by fiscal policy, allowing room for the Reserve Bank to bring interest rates down with the flow-on effect on our currency. (Time expired) Seabourne, Mr Jack",87
68,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would like to congratulate Jack Seabourne, a young athlete in my electorate who was recently nominated for the Examiner's junior sports award. Jack is a passionate young boxer. He is 14 years of age and has already represented Tasmania in junior basketball, football and athletics, but boxing remains his passion. This year at the Australian boxing titles in December Jack will represent Tasmania. It is fantastic to see such a great athlete. Jack is coached by Graeme George, who is Daniel Geale's former coach. Graeme George says that Jack has the most potential of any Tasmanian boxer he has seen and that he is a champion in the making. He recommends him as a top athlete in his sport of boxing. NA",87
69,Ms GILLARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be absent from question time this week as he is representing Australia at the United Nations General Assembly. The Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism will also be absent from question time this week as he is overseas representing the government at the East Asia Summit Energy Ministers' Meeting and the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum. The Minister for Health and Ageing will also be absent from question time this week as she attending a high-level United Nations meeting in New York. The Minister for Trade will answer questions on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Attorney General will answer questions on behalf of the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism. The Minister for Mental Health and Ageing will answer questions on behalf of the Minister for Health and Ageing. NA Asylum Seekers",88
70,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Has the government received any Solicitor-General's advice over the weekend concerning what the Prime Minister says are very significant changes since Friday to the government's proposed amendments to the Migration Act?,88
71,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Yes, our legal people have been working over the weekend and if the Leader of the Opposition seeks some direct information from the Solicitor-General about the amendments I provided him with then I am sure we can facilitate that. Asylum Seekers",88
72,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. What is the government's response to the recent decision by the High Court regarding the processing of asylum seekers?,88
73,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Robertson for her question. It is a serious question about a matter that is a serious issue in our national public policy debate and a serious question for our country. The processing of asylum seekers has featured in our politics for a very long period of time, well over a is decade. During that period we have seen tragedy at sea, we have seen people get on to leaky boats, we have seen people pay money to people smugglers and give money to people who are preying on their desperation. I believe across this parliament people generally want to ensure that we do have an orderly migration system and that we are doing what we need to do to protect Australia's borders but that, at the same time, we are extending the compassion and concern that our nation has shown over many decades towards refugees-that is, that we honour our obligations under the refugee convention. During the course of today I did provide the Leader of the Opposition with some newly drafted amendments to the Migration Act. They are to achieve what the government set out to achieve after the High Court case-that is, they are to achieve a situation where executive government has the power to make the decisions it believes necessary in relation to offshore processing. The opposition received a legal briefing on Friday and a set of draft amendments were provided at that point. There are obviously a number of ways of achieving the same outcome. I have provided Leader of the Opposition with a new draft and I thank him for his consideration of that new draft. What we are talking about here is an issue that is of national importance and I believe Australians today are looking to this parliament to act and to show some resolution. I believe Australians are looking to this parliament to deal with these new amendments in a way that is not politics as usual. I believe the Australian nation is looking to us to deal with these new amendments in a way that is not politics as usual, in a way that resolves this issue and enables the nation to put it behind us. As we come to consider these new amendments, I believe that is what should be on the mind of every member of parliament. This issue is asking us to act in a way different to politics as usual and to seek some common ground. In providing these new amendments to the Leader of the Opposition today, we seek some common ground. The amendments have been provided in the spirit of not pursuing politics as usual. The new amendments have been provided so our nation can put this issue behind us and move on, confident that executive government has the powers it needs to implement offshore processing as it sees fit but always in accordance with our obligations under the refugee convention. Asylum Seekers",88
74,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to what she considers substantial changes between Friday and today of the amendments that the government proposes to make to the Migration Act. Given the confusion that surrounds the government's changes from just Friday to Monday does this not simply confirm that the Prime Minister has a caucus management problem as well as a border protection problem?,89
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Cook, the last part of that question is beyond the standing orders.",89
76,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Can I say to the shadow minister, the objective of the government, and I hope it is shared as an objective of this parliament, is absolutely clear. It has been clear over a long period of time now, clear over many long months. That objective has been that we should take the most effective action possible to deter people from getting on leaky boats and from potentially risking their lives. We should take the most effective action possible to deter people from putting themselves in the hands of people smugglers who are seeking to profit from their misery. Our objective has been over many long months-apart from sending the most effective message of deterrence-that in new designing a policy we should make sure that we are doing our best to protect Australia's borders but that, at the same time, we are doing our best to protect the values that Australians hold dear. And so at every stage the government has worked for effective deterrence and border protection coupled with honouring our obligations under the refugee convention. So when we entered into discussions with Malaysia, because we were advised and properly saw this as the most effective deterrence measure, we did it on the basis that our nation would always honour our obligations under the refugee convention. At its heart, the refugee convention is about not returning people to places where they would be persecuted, and the arrangement with Malaysia ensures that. It is also about making sure that people can have their claims processed, and the arrangement with Malaysia ensures that. It also goes through and ensures that people will have identification papers, that they would not be subject to the sanctions on illegal migrants, that they would have access to education and the ability to seek work. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has indicated that they are prepared to work on the implementation of this arrangement. That is because we have worked on this arrangement as a part of a regional solution, firstly, going to the big regional meeting in Bali to work on a regional framework, and that was agreed. Then this is the bilateral arrangement under the auspices of that framework. At the same time, in honouring our refugee conventions in this arrangement, we have ensured that we would extend our compassion to 4,000 more genuine refugees, people who are in Malaysia and have been there for years. I was asked about the government's objective.",89
77,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My question went to what the Prime Minister describes the significant changes between last Friday and Monday and she is not addressing what has changed between last Friday and Monday.",90
78,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Cook should be reminded that his question went beyond that, which is not very helpful. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.",90
79,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was explaining what the government has always sought to achieve here. Then, when the High Court made its decision, which was unexpected, the government still seeks to achieve the same objectives that it wanted to achieve from the start. That now requires us to legislate and amend the Migration Act to put beyond doubt that the executive government has the power to implement offshore processing arrangements. Now, there is inevitably more than one way to draft a set of amendments. When the opposition was briefed on Friday a draft set of amendments was provided, and when they were provided in the discussion in the meeting it was clear that there was more than one way of achieving this objective. The Leader of the Opposition expressed concern about some matters. In the new draft I believe he will see additional clarity on the matters about which he expressed concern. The Leader of the Opposition has said to me that he will now consider those amendments and I believe that to be highly appropriate.",90
80,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my supplementary question goes to the assurances that the Prime Minister referred to in the answer to the member for Cook. Why then does the government's latest draft legislation say that the assurances need not be legally binding?",90
81,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," That clause was in the draft that the Leader of the Opposition was provided with on Friday. It is in the draft that the Leader of the Opposition has been provided with today. Clearly, it is the government's view in instructing the drafting of these amendments that governments can make arrangements between them that are honoured by both sides. We have made an arrangement with Malaysia, which it has freely entered into, and, frankly, apart from being insulting to our friends in Malaysia, there is no reason to assume that Malaysia would not honour the obligations it has freely entered into. At the end of the day, I do not ask the Leader of the Opposition to endorse the to arrangement with Malaysia. I understand that he is opposed to it.",90
82,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting of order. The Leader of the Opposition's question was very simply: what is the point of making an arrangement with a third country that is not legally binding?,90
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt would resume his seat. The only point of order possible is of direct relevance. The Prime Minister is responding to,91
84,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was making the point that I am not asking the Leader of the Opposition to endorse the arrangement with Malaysia, but I am asking him to agree to amendments which would give executive government the power to act. To give the Leader of the Opposition a good example of where that power might be necessary, if we go back to the Howard government's arrangements with Nauru, they were a nonsignatory country in the days of those arrangements. The arrangements were not legislated in either Australia or Nauru. They were only enlivened by a memorandum of understanding between the two nations. So if in the future a government decided that it wanted to replicate exactly the circumstances that the Howard government had engaged in with Nauru at that time, it would need power as expressed in this amendment in the clause that the Leader of the Opposition has pointed to. Asylum Seekers",91
85,Mr HUSIC,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Minister, what is the best way to break the people-smuggling trade and deter people from taking the dangerous boat journey to Australia? How important is it for protections for asylum seekers to be put in place as part of any broader protection policy?",91
86,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Chifley for his question. We know that the most effective deterrent for boat journeys to Australia is to remove the product that people smugglers wish to sell, and that is the opportunity of settlement in Australia. Mr Hartsuyker interjecting",91
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for the question. Cowper is now warned!,91
88,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That has been the consistent advice to this government and that advice has been provided to the opposition. The arrangement with Malaysia that this government has entered into achieves just that outcome. It provides for people to be returned to Malaysia for processing alongside the 90,000 other asylum seekers and refugees in Malaysia. It returns them to where the vast majority, well over 80 per cent, begin their boat journey to Australiathe country of Malaysia. There are sound policy and humanitarian reasons for supporting the processing of asylum seekers offshore when it is part of a sensible and well thought out regional framework. Importantly, our regional approach involves Australia playing more of a role in resettling refugees and assisting countries in the region towards more consistent standards and treatments. The Malaysia agreement delivers significant humanitarian and protection outcomes in the region. The honourable member for Chifley asked about the importance of protections and they are protections outlined in the Malaysian arrangement. The guarantee of nonrefoulement, the guarantee of access to health and education and work rights as appropriate and the commitment to ensure access to processing are all outlined in the arrangement with Malaysia. There are two ways to deal with protections. You can negotiate them with the country involved, you can work them through, you can consult with the UNHCR or you can simply adopt the policy of turning boats around on the seas, which would not have those protections built in. It would be open to the government to adopt the policy of turning boats around on the high sea, which apart from being dangerous not only to asylum seekers but to Australian naval personnel would also result inevitably, where those boats are not sunk or sabotaged, in those boats being returned to Indonesia. Indonesia is not a signatory to the refugee convention. Anybody who is returned to Indonesia would have no protections guaranteed through negotiations with this government. They would have no guarantee of non-refoulement, no guarantee of work rights, no protections built in. If people are going to criticise built in with the Malaysian arrangement, it is appropriate that they also reflect on what the result would be of a policy of turning back boats, which is the policy of the opposition. It is the case that there are protections that can be built in with refugee signatory countries-Indonesia is not one of thosebut I do note that being a refugee signatory country alone is not necessarily a guarantee of protection. For example, Afghanistan and Iran, our two largest source countries, are signatories. Iran is the country which the honourable member for Cook has proposed for a transfer agreement. But we on this side of the House would not see it having the appropriate protections in place. We want to ensure that this government and future governments have the power to be able to manage Australia's border protection policies. Without this legislation being proposed by the government, there is no confidence that we could have any effective offshore processing regime. The questions this week are: can the two major parties in this country, which both support offshore processing, reach an agreement to make it lawful? Will we reach an agreement for the policy that both sides of this House support? Will we have an effective and lawful offshore processing regime? And can we work in the national interest? They are the questions people in the region are waiting to see answered. On this side of the House, we are committed to doing so. Asylum Seekers",91
89,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is again to the Prime Minister. Why did the Prime Minister say in her last answer that boat people could not be sent to Nauru under the existing legislation when the Solicitor General said on Friday that the recent High Court decision did not rule out offshore processing in Nauru and that to say that he protections did say so was inaccurate.,92
90,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the Leader of the Opposition, he has misconstrued the point I was making in my last answer. He was asking me about a clause in the amendments that he has been provided with, and that clause was about assurances being gained between two countries which were not legally binding. That was his question to me. So I took his question to me to be: why would you want that in there; when would you use it? The government is seeking to use that clause with Malaysia. But I was pointing out to the Leader of the Opposition for policy consistency that it is the kind of clause that would have been necessary for the Howard government when it entered into its arrangement with Nauru had the High Court taken the same interpretation then that it takes now. When the Howard government entered into its arrangement with Nauru, Nauru was not a refugee convention signatory country. That is a fact. No shaking of anybody's head will wish that fact away. When the Howard government entered into the arrangement with Nauru, it was not a legislated arrangement in Australia or in Nauru. There was a memorandum of understanding between the two nations which spelt out obligations on each sidethat is, it is a comparable situation. It the end point because it was for processing rather than for transfers. But, on those points, it is a comparable situation to where we are with Malaysia. It is not a refugee convention signatory country but we do have an arrangement with it which spells out obligations. That was the point of my last answer.",92
91,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: my question was clearly about the Prime Minister's assertions as to the legal position regarding Nauru and I quoted to her the Solicitor-General's clear opinion on Friday",93
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! A point of order on a question is not an opportunity to repeat the question. The only point of order is whether the response is directly relevant. A question that commences 'Why did you say in a previous answer' leads to the Prime Minister being able to be directly relevant on the basis of her explaining why she said something in the previous answer. The Prime Minister has the call.,93
93,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was directing my answer to that part of the Leader of the Opposition's question which went to my previous answer. He also asked me about the Solicitor-General. The Solicitor-General, in written advice on the question of Nauru that we have distributed, the opposition has and is publicly available, has said further information would be needed. He also pointed to the fact that there is legal risk. If you want to put it beyond doubt then you would amend the legislation. In addition to the general circumstances about Nauru, I would direct the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the Solicitor-General's advice which deals with the complex and difficult question of unaccompanied minors. He would need to direct his attention to that as well. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: was not the grading he used for the Solicitor General's opinion is not right. I would direct him to the two comprehensive pieces of legal advice which have been provided to the opposition and provided publicly. Pensions and Benefits",93
94,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Given the continued misinformation being peddled in regional Australia in relation to youth allowance, can the Prime Minister outline the recent proposals for youth allowance, particularly for country students?",93
95,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for New England for his question. I thank him as well as many members of the Labor Party who have consistently raised with me over a long period of time the circumstances of regional students. Because of the advocacy of Labor members, the member for New England and the member for Lyne, in the last parliament the government acted to create a better and fairer system of youth allowance for Australian students generally and particularly for country students. Mr MCCormack interjecting",93
96,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Riverina is warned.,93
97,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the 15 months since those new arrangements have been in operation, the statistics speak for themselves. I know these may be uncomfortable facts for the members of the opposition, but the fact is in the 15 months since these changes came into effect the number of rural and regional university students receiving youth allowance has increased by 26 per cent, an additional 7,400 students. There has also been an 18 per cent increase in the total number of university students receiving youth allowance, an additional 24,600. Those statistics are telling you that everyone has benefited, but country students have proportionally benefited more. Mr Chester interjecting",93
98,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Gippsland is warned.,94
99,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is against a backdrop where under the Howard government the percentage of regional students and country students in Australian universities was going down. We acted to improve youth allowance for regional students. I am pleased to be in a position to say that we will act again to improve the circumstances of country students in getting access to university. Mr Christensen interjecting Ms Marino interjecting,94
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Dawson is now warned and the member for Forest is warned.,94
101,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is because we want country students to be able to go to university. We do not want to see the sorts statistics that the Howard government used to think were fine, where the participation country students was going down. The government will devote $265 million to deliver on a package to eliminate regional eligibility distinctions for youth allowance from 1 January 2012. Inner regional students will be able to access independent youth allowance in the same way as outer regional, remote and very remote students. The government is also providing further support for eligible students as they face additional barriers to accessing higher education and often have more limited access options. The government will increase to $2,000 both second and third year relocation scholarships for eligible regional university students required to live away from home. This represents a $900 increase in relocation scholarship payments for each of those two years. We expect that these new measures will continue to improve the support for students in regional areas. It will allow approximately 5,500 inner regional students to access payments or receive upward variation in their income support payments and provide about 15,000 regional students with higher relocation scholarship amounts each year. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that on top of a proud track record of better support for country students, we are improving that support again. Economy Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:27): My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the importance of sound economic and fiscal management in the face of global economic uncertainty? What would be the cost of not having sound and transparent fiscal policy?",94
102,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the of member for Petrie for that question because there is ongoing instability in the global of economy and it is likely that these headwinds will be with us for some time yet. Despite these circumstances, the fundamentals in the Australian economy are strong, and they are almost unique among all developed economies. Unlike other developed economies, we avoided recession. We have grown our economy by over five per cent from its precrisis level, whilst countries like the United States are still struggling to get back to where they were before the global financial crisis. We have also created something like three-quarters of a million jobs, whereas elsewhere in the global economy you have seen something like 30 million jobs lost. We have an unprecedented investment pipeline, something like $430 billion in resources alone. And we are bringing our budget back to surplus in 201213. These are all strengths which should be valued. Of course, they will help us ride out the instability that we see in the global economy. It makes it more important that we build on these strengths during these times of global uncertainty. It makes it more important that we have fiscally responsible policies in place. It also makes it more important that all election commitments are fully costed. That is why it is so important that we have an independent Parliamentary Budget Office. I thank those on this side of the House and those on the other side of the House that recommended an independent Parliamentary Budget Office. Great work was done by both sides of the House to put in place a process in which all members of the House could have confidence. There was bipartisan support for the Parliamentary Budget Office, so that in the future there could be no excuses for parties not to have their election commitments fully costed. There would be no excuse in the future for things like the $11 billion black hole, the costings con job that was foisted on the Australian people during the last election campaign. The Parliamentary Budget Office is critical for transparency around policy costings. It is all about making sure that these are open and public, not secret as the Liberal Party is now trying to achieve, because it has rejected the model of the Parliamentary Budget Office. Why has it rejected this model that its members in this House recommended? The fact is it has a $70 billion crater in its budget estimates. That is why there has been this backflip and it is now rejecting a Parliamentary Budget Office. A Parliamentary Budget Office is important to strengthen our fiscal framework. It is important to budget responsibility and to facing the future. When it comes to the Parliamentary Budget Office, 'No,' is not the answer. Asylum Seekers Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:30): My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the government guarantee that its proposed changes to the Migration Act provide a binding legal obligation for any designated offshore processing country not to return an asylum seeker to the country from which they are fleeing?",94
103,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," We have provided the amendments, and they enable the minister for immigration to make a determination about offshore processing. In order to make that determination the minister would need to turn his mind to the national interest and, specifically, to two points in particular: the honouring of the central obligation of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees that people were not being taken to places from which they would be returned to a place of persecution; and that those asylum seekers could have their claims processed. That is what these new amendments provide. To the opposition generally, we have provided these new amendments todayMs Julie Bishop: I rise on a point of order on relevance. My question to the Prime Minister was whether she could give a guarantee that these changes to the Migration Act would not",95
104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. The Prime Minister will respond in a directly relevant manner to the question.,95
105,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The amendments are there for the opposition to see. Regarding the opposition's consideration of these amendments, they would put the minister for immigration in this government in the same position that the minister for immigration was when, under the Howard government, a determination was made to take people to Nauru, not then a signatory country to the refugee convention. No legislation was in place in Nauru. What was in place was a memorandum of understanding between governments. If, when the opposition was sitting on the government benches, that was viewed as perfectly satisfactory for them, I do find it a bit odd that now they are sitting on the opposition benches it is apparently no longer perfectly satisfactory for them. Those were the circumstances with Nauru.",95
106,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,96
107,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no amount of shaking of heads or interjecting that will change that fact. That is the history. That what the Howard government did.,96
108,Mr Hockey,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,False!,96
109,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is true.,96
110,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those interjecting will cease interjecting and the Prime Minister will ignore the interjections.,96
111,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At the end of the day what we are seeking to achieve with these amendments, despite all of this contradiction about the clear history, is a circumstance where the government of the day has the ability to put offshore processing beyond legal doubt. We have provided amendments because I believe Australians are looking to us to find some common ground and to act in good faith so that we as a nation can put issue behind us and have legal certainty. genuinely believe that. The reason we provided the amendments today was that we believe the Australian people are looking to us to go beyond politics as usual. I hope in considering these amendments, which are in the national interest, we can find the common ground in this parliament which enables us to go beyond politics as usual and to put offshore processing beyond doubt. I cannot forecast every permutation and combination of governments to come, but it may be that a government in the future wants to do exactly what the Howard government did when it had processing on Nauru in exactly the same circumstances-a nonrefugee convention signatory country and a memorandum of understanding. I ask those opposite: why would they want to deny a future government the power they sought for themselves and used themselves when they were in government? Carbon Pricing",96
112,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Why is it is important to provide certainty to households and business when it comes to putting a price on carbon? How will the passage of the clean energy bills deliver this certainty?,96
113,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. The passage of the clean energy bills is extremely important in providing certainty for households and businesses. For the business community in particular the carbon price will provide the certainty to allow businesses to make the investments that are necessary, particularly in important parts of the economy like the energy sector. The carbon price creates the this incentive for investments in low-emission I do technologies, and in energy efficiency and renewable energy, that will help drive productivity in our economy in the future. There is growing evidence internationally that that companies that reduce the emissions intensity of their businesses are more competitive and do deliver better shareholder value. Last week, in fact, the Carbon Disclosure Project released its 10th annual report. The Carbon Disclosure Project is an independent organisation holding the largest database of primary corporate climate change information in the world, and it examined the climate change policies of the world's largest 500 companies and found that companies with the sharpest focus on climate change have rewarded their investors with double the average rate of return-double the average rate of return amongst those of the 500 largest companies internationally that are focusing on reducing the emissions intensity of their businesses. Households, of course, will have the certainty that nine out of 10 households will receive assistance for the modest cost-ofliving impact of introducing a carbon price. Almost six million households will receive assistance that meets or exceeds their expected average price impact, and no fewer than four million households-almost half of all households-will receive assistance that provides a 20 per cent buffer over and above their expected average price impacts. They will be better off. In addition to that, all taxpayers earning up to $80,000 a year will get a tax cut, and most will receive at least $300 a year when we increase the tax-free threshold from around $6,000 at present to $18,200. Further to that, all families receiving family tax benefits will receive extra payments worth up to $110 per child, and all pensioners will receive a pension increase worth $338 for singles and $510 for couples combined. Those are very important elements of the clean energy bills that are before the House at this point in time. This is very important certainty for households and for business. Yesterday the member for North Sydney confirmed, of course, that the coalition intends repealing the legislation and, in doing so, will take away all of that certainty for businesses and households-in particular, though, with very clear and specific comments that the coalition will take away the pension increases, will take away the increases to family tax benefits and will put up taxes. The member for North Sydney said, 'We have said that you don't need to have compensation if you don't have a carbon tax.' They are going to take away the tax cuts. They are going to take away the pension increases. They are going to take away the family tax benefits.",96
114,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will not debate unduly. Mr Buchholz interjecting,97
115,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We all know the truth about this-that is, they have no interest in helping families and households. They have only got interest in their own political well-being, and that is it.",97
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind the member for Wright that it is grossly disorderly for members to interject from out of their place. Asylum Seekers,97
117,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the call by Western Australian Labor Senator Mark Bishop that the government should reopen Nauru. As Senator Bishop said: … you can have a proper office there doing the processing, staffed by Australian officials applying Australian law. Isn't Senator Bishop right?",97
118,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the shadow minister for the question. As I have made clear in parliament over a number of days as we have discussed this matter, we are determined to implement the arrangement with Malaysia because the advice to us is that it would have the maximum deterrence effect. The advice to us-and this advice has been shared with the opposition-is that it would have the maximum deterrence effect. The advice to us is that Nauru would not have that deterrence effect, and that advice has been shared with the opposition. Can I also say to the shadow minister who asked the question: at the end of the day, whether you determine that Malaysia is the best way forward or, as those opposite have determined, that Nauru is the best way forward, what will come before this parliament and the amendments that I have given the Leader of the Opposition today are not specific about Nauru. They are not specific about Malaysia. They are about empowering government to act. The shadow minister who asked the question obviously does believe that Nauru is the best solution. I would refer him not only to the Solicitor-General's advice but to the advice of respected commentators like Ron Merkel QC: 'In respect of both Nauru and PNG, there must be great doubt that a declaration by the minister would be valid.' He is obviously saying you need to legislate. Stephen Estcourt QC said, 'Any declaration of Nauru or PNG under section 198A(3) would, notwithstanding the obvious points of distinction, likely meet the same fate as the recently invalidated declaration with respect to Malaysia.' International law expert Professor Don Rothwell said: … offshore processing in Malaysia, as per the High Court's decision, and in Nauru or Papua New Guinea, would not be legally permissible. Finally there are the views of the shadow Attorney-General, who provides advice to the opposition and who on radio said this order: the Prime Minister was asked about the advice of Senator Mark Bishop, and that is the advice that we would like her to address.",97
119,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. My reading of the standing orders on direct relevance does not mean that other advice cannot be used in being directly relevant to the question.,98
120,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The shadow Attorney General said on radio: No, let … let me … let me put this in my own words: that if Nauru were to make itself compliant with all its obligations under Section 198-sorry, under the UN Refugee Convention and Section 198a of the Australian Migration Act-then the Nauru solution would work. But I do acknowledge that there is a sufficient area of doubt that it would be prudent and desirable to put the matter beyond doubt by legislative change. I frequently do not agree with the shadow Attorney-General, but I do agree with that. The proposition that will come before this parliament is a proposition about amending the Migration Act. We have a view about Malaysia. The opposition has a view about Nauru. That is as it may be, but the proposition that will come before the parliament, in the words of Senator Brandis, is a proposition that would be prudent to pass even if the eventual aim was processing in Nauru. That is what the Leader of the Opposition needs to consider. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for meeting with me today and I thank him for indicating that the opposition is considering the amendments that have been provided to them today. Superannuation",98
121,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. How will the minerals resource rent tax assist Australians in their retirement? How can the pre-retirement savings of Australians be improved to manage the demographic challenges of an ageing population?,98
122,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (14:45): I would like to thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She understands that 49,500 of her voters stand to benefit by increasing superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. This is a very important issue. Australians are living longer than ever before-no jokes about the opposition front-bench today!-and it is important that we make sure that people do not retire poor. Mr Randall interjecting",98
123,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is important that we finish the job started,99
124,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Canning is warned!,99
125,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"by Prime Minister Keating and Bill Kelty to lift superannuation beyond nine per cent. Twenty years later, we should finish the job that has been started. We want to improve the retirement savings of Australians by decreasing the fees and charges that are exacted upon the income in their superannuation accounts. We also want to make sure that there is an adequate replacement for the tax which the Commonwealth will no longer be receiving by moving so much income from income tax into the concessional tax treatment of superannuation. That is why the MRRT is such an important tax for this country. We believe on this side of the House that some of the profits of Australia's richest companies who are doing very well, who are setting the Guinness World Records for their profits, should be shared in a multi-speed economy. What could be better for Australians than increasing the retirement savings of 8½ million working people? What could be better than making sure that people have a dignified and financially adequate retirement? Indeed, the challenge was issued to Mr Abbott and the opposition as late as today by the Daily Telegraph, which said that older people are working longer because they do not have enough. We need to do better in this country, and this parliament is capable of doing better. I understand very well that some of those opposite are not worried about whether or not enough other people have enough to retire on because they are all right; they have 15 per cent. Why would the Leader of the Opposition be worried about the retirement savings of 55,000 of his voters when he has a generous pension scheme? It is only thanks to Labor in the last 20 years that the average account balance for men in Australia is at $71,000. It still lags at $41,500 for women in Australia-this is not enough. The current retirement savings system is not enough when men hold 63 per cent of all account balances in Australia and women only hold 37 per cent. But why should we be surprised that this mob on the other side do not want the average punter to lift their balance, because they have put the claws of order. How on earth could the slagging of the opposition be relevant to the question he was asked?",99
126,Mr Shorten,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I'd always rather be a terrier than a poodle!,99

132,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If they do not like what they are hearing perhaps I might conclude by referring to that well-known film Robin Hood. In Robin Hood, once upon a time, the hero was Robin Hood. But this crew, like the Sheriff of Nottingham, take from the poor and give to the rich. (Time expired) Asylum Seekers",100
133,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What did the Prime Minister mean by the statement that she made on 6 July last year in relation to offshore processing, where she said: I would rule out anywhere that is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention. Prime Minister, what did you mean?",100
134,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question. Obviously the refugee obligations are important to us. They are important to this country. When we deal with countries that not only are signatory to the convention but are implementing the convention, we can be sure that convention obligations are being abided by. Through the remarkable negotiating strategy of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, we are now in a position to say refugee convention obligations-most important of all, the obligation of non-refoulement, of making sure that people are not returned to a place of persecution-can be achieved in Malaysia. In addition to that we can see in Malaysia the processing of claims and we can see people's humanitarian needs dealt with. The member, I accept, is genuinely interested in this. I accept that genuine interest. I say to him and to the Leader of the Opposition, and anyone else opposite, that if they are concerned about these questions I recommend that they ring the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, ask them their attitude to the Malaysia arrangement and ask them their attitude to Nauru. I think if those opposite bothered to make that call what they would find is that the UNHCR is prepared to be involved in implementing the arrangement with Malaysia, whereas the UNHCR is not prepared to be involved, in any way, inindeed it is quite condemning of-an arrangement with Nauru. For those who are concerned-I accept that there are many genuinely concerned about our obligations under the refugee convention-I suggest they ring the United Nations agency charged with making that convention live and breathe and ask them about the alternative propositions here: Malaysia versus Nauru. But let me come back to what I have said at other points in question time and what I said consistently last week, which is that at the end of the day this is not a debate between two contending policy propositions; this is a debate about whether or not executive government should have the power it needs to make the arrangements it believes fit.",100
135,Mr Morrison,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The Prime Minister was asked about her own comment that she would not send anyone to a country that was not a signatory to the refugee convention. What did she mean by that?",100
136,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has the call.,100
137,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At the end of the day the legislation that will come before the parliament is not about Malaysia and it is not about Nauru; it is about executive government having the power to determine the offshore processing arrangements it believes are appropriate. I say to members opposite, who now apparently have a newfound love for the refugee convention, that members opposite made arrangements to process asylum seekers on Nauru when it was not signatory to the refugee convention. It may be that some time in the future a government wants to go down a comparable path to the path that the Howard government went down when it initiated processing in Nauru-that is, a non-signatory country, and that is relying on a memorandum of understanding. My point to those opposite is that if good enough for them to seek to have that power and to exercise it in government, what on earth can justify denying it to this government or governments in the future through a proper amendment to the Migration Act? This proper amendment to the Migration Act deals with core obligations under the refugee convention. Carbon Pricing",100
138,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the minister outline for the House modelling on how the government's plan to put a price on carbon pollution will affect public transport? What is the government doing to assist commuters to have greater access to public transport?,101
139,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:56): I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and indeed for her ongoing commitment and support for public transport, particularly for people in Western Sydney. This is a government that has committed more for urban public transport than was committed by all governments between Federation and 2007. Part of that commitment, of course, was to the Parramatta-Epping rail link, which the state government, in their budget a few weeks ago, walked away from. They walked away from that commitment in spite of the fact that it had some support from over there, sometimes, but consistent support from all those on this side of the House. Of course, the member for Parramatta would know that the government of New South Wales also walked away from the $4 billion of state funding which had been committed for the Western Express line. That would have been of great benefit for all residents west of Parramatta on that line. We are committed to public transport as it was part of our commitment to dealing with climate change. One of the benefits of increased use of public transport is that it lowers our carbon footprint by lowering our emissions. So this is a vital economic reform but is also vital for our environment. I am asked about what modelling has been done. Of course, the government is ensuring that for any increased prices there is full and proper assistance given. Indeed, greater assistance will be given than the cost. Treasury modelling shows that there will be a modest impact of some 0.5 per cent on public transport. In order to provide assistance nine out of every 10 households will receive assistance in the form of tax cuts or higher payments and there will also be direct assistance in terms of increased pensions and increased assistance for those on benefits. Compare that with the impact of the GST. The impact on public transport fares was some eight per cent-that is, eight per cent under the GST; 0.5 per cent under the carbon pricing. This carbon pricing relates to just a few cents on the ticket price for most public transport services. For example, a ticket from Parramatta to Central would have an increase of 2c or 3c. I was asked about modelling that has been done. I was very surprised to see an exaggerated claim in the Daily Telegraph! The federal opposition-Tony Abbott's office-and the Office of the New South Wales Premier got together to cook up some outcomes. An email from Peter Grimshaw, copied to the Premier, said: The 'Tele' is very keen to do a story for tomorrow's paper on the impact of the carbon tax ...  order: you made it very clear in the last sitting week, last Wednesday, that these kinds of attacks on state Liberal governments or the opposition would not be regarded as relevant or in order. I would ask you to draw the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport back to your ruling from last Wednesday.",101
140,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport knows that he must relate his material directly to the question and I will listen carefully.,102
141,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very clearly about the modelling for the price impact. What the email of 14 July said was this: 'Juicy quotes from the department of transport's brief. Note that there are some not so helpful quotes in the brief too.' You bet there were. What the department of transport's brief said was, 'The introduction of the carbon tax is not expected to have any measurable effect in people's choice regarding public transport or private car use.' NSW Treasury found, 'The impact, in terms of price impact, was 0.49 per cent,' exactly what our federal Treasury modelling showed, and that the impact would be miniscule. It is important in the debate about our clean energy future that people stick to the facts, not to making up figures. (Time expired) Asylum Seekers Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (15:01): My question is to the Prime Minister. What is the government's plan to protect Australia's borders from unauthorised boat arrivals once the Malaysia people-swap deal reaches its 800-person limit?",102
142,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,102
143,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked. The Prime Minister now has the call.,102
144,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member who asked the question: I answered this question on a number of occasions last week. We have designed the arrangement with Malaysia because we have been advised it has the maximum deterrence effect; that is, it sends a very clear message to people smugglers and to the people that are preyed on by people smugglers that they can spend all of their money-their money gets taken away by a people smuggler-and they do not end up in Australia being processed for resettlement in Australia. We have the clearest possible advice that this sends the strongest deterrence message possible. So in designing order: The Prime Minister was asked about the government's policy once the 800-person ceiling limit is reached-in other words, what is plan B? She was not asked a question about the Malaysia policy before",102
145,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. If he wants to add to questions, he should have them in the original question. Back to the question: the Prime Minister knows the requirement for her to respond in a directly relevant manner to the question. She has the call. She should be heard in silence.",102
146,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In designing this arrangement with Malaysia, relying on the best possible advice, we have accepted the advice that it is the strongest possible deterrence message. In being the strongest possible deterrence message our aim is that we send such a strong signal to people smugglers, effectively smashing their business model, that we do not see all of the 800 spots used because transfers send that very strong message-that if you spend your money, risk your life, you do not end up where you wanted to go. Consequently, that is the advice that has informed Malaysia, is the policy that has informed the arrangement with Malaysia. But I say again to those opposite, I understand that they will continue to criticise the arrangement with Malaysia and in this House of parliament obviously people will come and put all different sorts of views on public policy questions. That is understood. We will in this parliament, though, be debating a different question. That different question is whether or not executive government should have the power to process asylum seekers offshore or whether all of that should be put at risk. We believe that we should amend the Migration Act so that we can do that processing offshore. I also believe that with the new amendments I have supplied to the Leader of the Opposition today the eyes of the Australian community are upon us; that Australians in dealing with these new amendments want to see us go beyond politics as usual. Australians want us to resolve this issue and put it behind us. Australians want us to find the common ground necessary to get this done. Pensions and Benefits",102
147,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Will the minister please outline to the House the importance of the government's plans to support pensioners on the age pension and what would be the impact of not providing this support?",103
148,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (15:05): I thank the member for Page for her question as she understands very well this government's commitment to older Australians and the importance of the age pension. It is the case that this government has delivered historic reforms to the age pension, boosting both the that amount of the pension and, just as importantly, making sure that the pension keeps up with pensioners' costs of living. From tomorrow, pensioners will receive their fourth increase to the pension since we introduced the historic reforms just two years ago. We delivered pension increases of $148 a fortnight for single pensioners and $146 a fortnight for couples combined over the last two years. These are very significant improvements to the pension that this side of the parliament delivered. We know that the other side of the parliament refused to deliver an increase to the pension. We are of course also delivering real and permanent increases to the pension through our plan to put a price on carbon pollution. This too will mean improvements to the pension. Under our plan, it will be the big polluters who pay for their pollution, not pensioners. Pensioners will not be paying; it will be the big polluters. So we will see 3.4 million pensioners receiving an improvement to their pensions-yet again, from this side of the parliament-that more than covers their average expected price rises. Once again, pensioners will receive assistance worth $338 for singles and $255 a year for each member of a couple. These are the changes that pensioners can look forward toincreases to their pension that they know will come from this side of the parliament. It is not just these annual changes; they can also be assured that the clean energy supplement will keep up with the cost of living. So it is this side of the parliament that is making sure that pensioners are looked after. What can pensioners expect from those opposite? I was asked what the impact would be of not providing the support, and we have heard from those opposite that",103

158,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her statement earlier today, when she said, 'We have always, in the Malaysia arrangement, made sure that those obligations in the refugee convention and a number of others besides would be honoured.' I ask the Prime Minister: how can she ensure that obligations will be honoured when they are not required to be legally binding under the amendments that she is proposing to the Migration Act?",104
159,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, let me make clear the obligations that are in the agreement. Asylum seekers transferred from Australia will be there with the permission and agreement of the Malaysian government. They will have legal authority to remain in Malaysia, they will have the opportunity to have their asylum claims considered and Malaysia will not send any refugees back to persecution in their countries of origin-that is, they are upholding the central tenets of the refugee convention by not returning people to places of persecution and by processing their claims. Transferees will be issued with identification documents which will be endorsed by the Malaysian authorities and which will identify to the Malaysian government that the transferee is lawfully in Malaysia. They will not be subject to any of the penalties imposed on illegal immigrants. There will be arrangements allowing those transferred",104

165,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! A question has been asked. The Leader of the Opposition rises on a point of order on direct relevance and then adds argument to the question. The Prime Minister will ignore the argument and will respond to the question as required by the standing orders. The Prime Minister.,105
166,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did want to make the obligations under the arrangement clear. There are obligations allowing those transferred to work and children to get an education. The UNHCR, the United Nations agency charged with upholding the refugee convention, will also assist transferees to access services and undertake refugee status determinations. And, to ensure the ongoing welfare of transferees, there will be an oversight body that will representatives of UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration, as well as Australian and Malaysian officials. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: are the obligations that Malaysia has freely entered into in this arrangement between us. The Malaysian government has done this freely. The Malaysian government has done it freely because it stands ready to implement it. The Leader of the Opposition has no evidence available to him-no evidence whatsoever-to suggest that the Malaysian government will not honour the obligations it has freely entered into. The Leader of the Opposition says that the only thing that ever compels anybody to do anything is legal compulsion. Well, I actually believe that, in the real world, decent people who freely enter into agreements that have obligations in them do that because they genuinely intend to meet their obligations. The Malaysian government has done that, and I think this sort of casual insulting of the government of Malaysia is not proper and not of assistance to us or to our role in the region. I say to the Leader of the Opposition as well-and he needs to think about this-that the opposition in the past, when it was in government and indeed when it has been in opposition, has talked about things like towing boats back to Indonesia. Now, there are all the practical difficulties of that, all the risk of loss of life at sea-and the fact that Indonesia is not a signatory country. Indonesia has not entered into an arrangement of this nature with Australia. So how can the Leader of the Opposition say that that is satisfactory but this arrangement with Malaysia is not? But, at the end of the day, I do not ask the Leader of the Opposition to resolve all of those conundrums and questions. But I am include asking him to do what he said he would do earlier today when I met with him, which is consider the amendments that I have presented to him-those amendments being they amendments which would enable executive government to act to have offshore processing and to do that in a way which is beyond legal risk. Regional Development Australia Fund",105
167,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts. Will the minister inform the House of the success of the first round of the Regional Development Australia Fund? What future opportunities are there for local communities from this fund?",105
168,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hotham-Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (15:15): I thank the member for Blair for his question, and I know his commitment to regional Australia. He advocated strongly for his community in this first round of Regional Development Australia funds. These funds came from the government's commitment when it formed office to put significant new resources into the regions. That was delivered on in our first budget, where $4.3 billion was committed to the regions specifically and $1 billion over the course of the next four years was committed to the Regional Development Australia Fund. The first round of that fund was announced a couple of weeks ago and it received an overwhelming response from both sides of the parliament. Indeed, I have much correspondence from many who sit opposite, quite apart from the great interest that was taken on this side of the House. The members for Herbert, Riverina, Farrer, Gippsland, Goldstein and Sturt all wrote to us asking that proper consideration be given to their particular proposals. The fact is whilst the first round was significantly oversubscribed-and there were many in the process that were ineligible because they had not complied with the procedures, and they will get important advice as to how make applications in the future-we increased the payment in round 1 from $100 million to $150 million to accommodate more of these good projects coming forward. We have also said that we are reinforcing through the guidelines the importance of what we are seeking to achieve, and that is the leveraging of funding-not just through Commonwealth funds but also through state governments, local governments and community groups. We want the proposals that stack up and make a difference in terms of the economic and social diversification within the region. The member for Blair was successful in his advocacy for one of the projects in his region in relation to the Somerset Civic Centre. This is really important to the Esk community because, as it rebuilds, coming out of the devastating floods, this commitment to liveability and community amenity is terribly important. I am asked also what the future opportunities are. They can be significant. We will be announcing the opening of the second round in November and thereafter we intend for there to be three more rounds before the next election. But those additional rounds will only occur if this House passes the mining resource rental tax. That is a circumstance in which this government is seeking to take the proceeds of the mining boom, from resources that are owned by the Australian people and where there are super profits being made, to reinvest back into our community. The Assistant Treasurer has indicated that part of that will go to super and other parts are going to go to company tax cuts across the board so that we can diversify the economic base out of this that, resources boom. Some of it will go to infrastructure, including social infrastructure. That is what is in prospect. I say to all of those members over there urging me that consideration should be given for their electorates and their projects: think carefully about the folly that you are pursuing in this blind saying of no by the Leader of the Opposition. There is a price for saying no. The price of saying no is to deny regions the ability to build themselves, build with confidence, diversify their economic base and sustain their communities. Don't say no; stick up for the regions-because we will. Asylum Seekers",105
169,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. What consequences would Malaysia face under the government's agreement if someone transferred from Australia under that arrangement was arrested, detained or even caned?",106
170,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I refer the shadow minister to the obligations and agreement between Australia and Malaysia. I particularly refer him to the fact that there will be an oversight body will include representatives of the UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration as well as Australian and Malaysian officials. I also say to him: on what evidence does he suggest that Malaysia will not honour the obligations that it has freely entered into? On what evidence does he suggest that? We are talking about the government of a nation in our region that was under no obligation to enter into this arrangement with Australia. No-one made Malaysia enter this agreement; it freely chose to do so. The fact that it freely chose to do so should, I think, be taken as indicative of its intentions. Why would it have entered into an agreement if it did not intend to abide by the clauses in it? There was no pressure on it to enter into this arrangement, other than wanting to assist with arrangements in our region. I would also say to the shadow minister: why does he believe UNHCR is willing to implement this arrangement? Why does he believe thatMrs Bronwyn Bishop: Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I to page 55 of the Practice, dealing with the question of the amount of power that you have to require the Prime Minister to answer. This is a most salient point which Australians would really like to hear the answer to. You have the power to cause her to give that answer, and I ask you to do so.",106
171,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Mackellar will resume her seat. An incident having occurred in the gallery,107
172,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The gallery will come to order. The Prime Minister has the call.,107
173,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To the shadow minister who asked the question-he may need to explain this to the Australian parliament and to the Australian people-the United Nations that agency charged with upholding the convention, the United Nations agency that works around the world to assist asylum seekers and refugees, has said that it is prepared to work to implement this arrangement with Malaysia. That is obviously the United Nations agency charged with the welfare of refugees and the refugee convention saying that they can see that there is some merit in this arrangement and that they are prepared to be involved in implementing it. Clearly, they have not come to an adverse conclusion about the Malaysian government freely honouring the obligations it has taken unto itself. If the UNHCR has not come to that adverse conclusion, why has the shadow minister? Why does the shadow minister come into this place and say he is motivated by concern for refugees, and yet he advocates a solution that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the body charged with upholding the convention, will not involve itself in-that is, he advocates Nauru. The UNHCR has been very clear that they refer will not be involved in Nauru. I would suggest that the shadow minister should take a step back from the politics and look at this arrangement, look at what UNHCR is saying and actually examine his conscience as to whether he has any reason in the world to be asserting, as he does in this place and publically, that the Malaysian government will not honour its obligations. But once again, at the end of the day-even if the shadow minister has gone through that process of reflection and he is able to rationalise the fact that UNHCR is going to be involved in implementing the Malaysia agreement, and he is able to rationalise the fact that he has no reason to assume the Malaysian government will not honour its obligations, and if he is able to rationalise the fact that under the Howard government they took asylum seekers to non-refugee countries, and if he is able to rationalise fact that that happened without a legislative foundation stone; that is, the agreement with Nauru was through an MOU and boats were taken back to Indonesia with no arrangements about the convention and no arrangements about protection-if he is able to rationalise all of those conundrums and contradictions and still publically go out and say, 'I argue for Nauru', well, that is a question for him; this is about amending the legislation. (Time expired) Australia-United States Relationship",107
174,Mr BYRNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Defence. Will the minister inform the House of the outcomes of the Australia-United States ministerial consultations last week? Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (15:25): I thank the member for Holt for his question. I also acknowledge his long standing interest in the Australia-United States bilateral relationship and his interest in our alliance with the United States. The Australia-United States ministerial consultation, or AUSMIN as it is generally known, took place in San Francisco on Wednesday and Thursday of last week. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I represented Australia; the Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, and the Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, represented the United States. The Australian delegation included the Chief of the Defence Force, the Secretary of the Department of Defence and the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The ministerial consultations took place at the Presidio in San Francisco, the scene of the signing of the ANZUS treaty on 1 September 1951. So the context of the meeting was the 60th anniversary of an alliance which has served both the United the States and Australia well. It also coincided with the 10th anniversary of the first invoking of the ANZUS treaty in the aftermath of September 11, and underscored the point that this is an alliance which has served us well for 60 years and that continues to adapt to modern challenges. The drafters of the treaty would not have envisaged that the first invocation of the treaty would have been against a non-state actor, against a non-nation state, in the face of international terrorism. Indeed, the AUSMIN meeting declared that the treaty itself could be invoked in the modern day in the face of a cyberattack, again something that the drafters and signatories of the treaty would not have envisaged. We have acknowledged that in the modern day a substantial cyberattack degrading, denuding or destroying the communications system of a country-the degrading, denuding or destroying of communications and military communications systems of Australia or the United States-could in theory invoke the treaty. As Leon Panetta and I had said, this needs to be understood as a battleground for the future, not just for nation states but for industry and commerce as well. As the communique outlines, we dealt not just with that modern challenge but also with a series of modern challenges, including space and space awareness, ballistic missile defence and the emergence in this century of the Asia-Pacific century-the growth of China, the rise of India, the rise and growth of the ASEAN economies combined, the ongoing importance of Japan and the republic of Korea-underlining the importance of the United States's engagement in the Asia-Pacific, which has been a source of stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific since the end of World War II. In that context, as we did in Melbourne at the 2010 AUSMIN meeting in Melbourne, we discussed the United States Global Force Posture Review. A lot of work has been done in the intervening 12 months to better understand the potential for Australia and the United States to become even more deeply engaged so far as operational matters are concerned-training, exercises, access to ports and facilities, prepositioning of stores and the like. There is more work to be done on this front, but this is a very important development so far as our operational cooperation with the United States is concerned. We also spoke about our immediate challenge in Afghanistan-shared assessment that we continue to be on track for transition by 2014 and commenced the discussion of the post-transition presence by the United States, Australia and the international community. I also had the opportunity to speak to the Secretary of Defense about some capability issues, including the Joint Strike Fighter, C17s and submarines. This was a most successful and productive meeting amongst friends. This is an alliance which has served us well for 60 years and will continue to serve us well into the future.",108
175,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Presentation",109
176,Mr ALBANESE,DOCUMENTS,Documents are presented as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and I move: That the House take note of the following document: Defence Housing Australia-Statement of corporate intent for 2011-12. Debate adjourned. NA Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011 Consideration in Detail,109
177,The SPEAKER,BILLS,"The question is that amendment (1), moved by the member for North Sydney, be agreed to.",109
178,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS," I would like to take the opportunity to respond to a number of issues that were raised before the debate was interrupted. I think it is fair to say that the principal claim that was being made by the opposition went to the question of the integrity of forecasting and figures that might be provided by the Treasury. In particular, there was some discussion around the PEFO, the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, and I was able to indicate that those figures are independently verified and that they need to be signed off by the secretaries of the departments of Treasury and finance. In the context of that discussion, the member for North Sydney raised some concerns in relation to the other reports that might be required to be produced under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act, in particular in relation to the budget economic and fiscal outlook and the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The allegation was made that in some respects in the past there had been political interference by previous treasurers with those forecasts and figures. If I recall correctly, the member for North Sydney indicated that he had been there and that he spoke with some personal experience in relation to these matters. In addressing those concerns, I make the following points. The first one is that each the matters contained within the two reports that have been referred to-the budget and MYEFO-the forecasts upon which each of those reports is to be provided, are forecasts that are provided by the Treasury. The assumptions that underpin those reports are produced by the Treasury, but of course those reports are provided by the Treasurer. In relation to those forecasts, it is worth making the point that these forecasts are the subject of considerable and very robust review, and there are a number of checks and balances that are in place and that have been in place for some time. In particular, the Treasury forecasts are informed by extensive and regular discussions with the Reserve Bank, the Department of Finance and Deregulation and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and also the ABS, through the Joint Economic Forecasting Group. In addition to JEFG, there is also the opportunity for the Senate estimates process to be used to test the assumptions and parameters outlined within the various reports. In addition, the Reserve Bank and others, in particular private institutions and market economists, will make their own forecasts from time to time and, in the context of the public debate around those forecasts and the scrutiny that will naturally be applied to the government's forecasts, there is a degree of accountability that occurs in that sense as well. I think it is also worth making the point that the Parliamentary Budget Office will have direct access to the Treasury and finance departments, notwithstanding what has been said in this debate before. So, regardless of where those forecasts might be generated, there will be full, frank and free access, without any ministerial intervention or encumbrance, that will allow the PBO to contact and to test various forecasts and to raise concerns that they may have. That is of something that is permitted within the regime that the government is supporting in the bill. I think it is also worth making the point, in the interests of clarity, that the legislation does not in any way prevent the PBO from assessing, evaluating or analysing the economic forecasts. The PBO is free to do that, but what they are not free to do is to dedicate resources that would be allocated to them to the task of forecasting. There is a very good reason for that, and that is why the joint committee-which, I remind the House, handed down recommendations that were unanimous, including members from the opposition-made the point that this would be a very expensive exercise and one that would not be a very useful allocation of resources. The opposition referred to the Congressional Budget Office on a number of occasions. In doing so they should make the point that the annual budget of the Congressional Budget Office is $US50 million, considerably more than what is envisaged for the PBO, because it has different functions. (Time expired)",109
179,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS," The parliamentary secretary has just confirmed everything that I said. He absolutely confirmed that in fact the PBO will be only able to use the fiscal and economic forecasts of the Treasury, unless it is in relation to the pre-election fiscal outlook, which is the only document under the Charter of Budget Honesty that is in fact signed off as the figures that actually belong to the Department of the Treasury and department of finance. Otherwise, the PBO is constrained to looking only at the government's figures; that is all. Then they had the audacity to claim that this was a recommendation in the report. I do not recall seeing it; in fact, I went back to the report. There is no recommendation committee's report. The mandates PBO can only use information and published under the charter. There mention, which at 3.100 says: …the PBO should not be required to produce its own fiscal forecasts. Rather, it should provide analysis of the Government's fiscal forecasts… Okay; fine. But that is actually not a recommendation, nor is it the case that it says it would not be able to produce its own fiscal forecasts. So, for example, let's take this, an issue that is highly contentious: what is the structural deficit? The Treasury does not do its own modelling on a structural deficit. It had a part of the budget papers that was allocated to a discussion of the structural deficit. This is an issue that is hugely contentious in relation to the fiscal outlook, and under the government's amendment the PBO would not be able to do any assessment of the structural deficit. How bizarre. It is not an independent body. Secondly, it would not be able to use data provided by the Reserve Bank, nor would it be able to use data provided by ABARES. Under this situation, the government is saying, 'Look, there is only one set of data that can go into the PBO-that is, the government's data, the executive's data. All other information cannot go to the PBO because it cannot be challenged.' Frankly, if this is what the parliament thinks is an independent body, it is seriously kidding itself. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (15:39): When we began debating this last week, I made the point that what the government is proposing Parliamentary Budget Office is something that is simply linked to the coattails of Treasury. That is totally and utterly unacceptable to the opposition for very good reasons, because the Treasury has become so politicised. I made the point that Treasury in the and the head of Treasury had been rewarded of the for things that they had done to assist the reports government. is one I want to go specifically to some of what happened after the election when the Independents said that they wanted to have our costings analysed because we had said we did not want to politicise Treasury to look at them. We had them done independently, and then the Independents said that they would make up their decision about how good or bad we were on what Treasury had to say about those costings. I want to go to some of them directly to say why we cannot have a Parliamentary Budget Office which is attached to a politicised Treasury. Let's look at the conservative bias allowance. First of all we said we would have a saving of $2.5 billion. Mr Henry said, 'No, you can't have that, actually. You can't be counted as having $2.5 billion,' because, in his words, 'it will not realise any actual budgetary savings if you cut back on the conservative bias allowance that is factored into allow a little bit of a buffer in the way projections are made.' Yet at the same time in the 2009-10 budget, Mr Henry, himself responsible for that budget, in Budget Paper No. 1 had set out that the government was saving $4.6 billion 'by savings from the conservative bias allowance over the forward estimates'. He said, 'This results in a reduction of expenses of $1.5 billion in 2010-11, $1.5 billion in 2011-12 and $1.6 billion in 2012-13, totalling $4.6 billion.' Yet Mr Henry said to the Independents, who were making a judgment: 'They can't count $2.5 billion. That's part of for this the $11 billion so-called black hole.' Then we go to cutting expenditure for the Health and Hospitals Fund-another interesting one. Here we said we were going to save $3.3 billion, and Mr Henry said to the Independents, 'They can't do that. They would have to identify before the election just what programs were going to be cut out of the three funds.' They were: the Health and Hospitals Fund, the Education and Investment Fund and the Building Australia Fund. Then we said, 'But we asked you for that list of programs, Mr Henry, and you said you couldn't find one. It didn't exist.' Finally, in the middle of these protracted discussions for the benefit of the Independents to decide who they might back for government, he said, 'I've got a secret list. I've got it guess what? I can't let you see it.' Isn't that amazing? 'I can't let you see it.' Did he ever give a reason for why this was a secret list, why it couldn't be made public or why it hadn't been able to be found before? Of course not. Of course Mr Henry should be rewarded. He did a wonderful job for the government. Then we come to the NBN. Savings here were going to be $2.4 billion, and we were going to save that by not borrowing money on which we said the interest rate payable was 5.5 per cent. Mr Henry came to the rescue of the government again and said, 'You can't save that amount of money, because we say the interest rate will be 4.9 per cent.' He would not be moved. He said, 'I've made a decision, so that will be another $900 million to add to your black hole.' I took the figures today for the average interest rate paid from July 2010 to today. Guess what it is? It is 5.23 per cent. So Mr Henry should be rewarded-4.9 per cent helped the government find an error in our costings of another $900 million. Then we go on to employment participation where we said we will make savings in welfare payments of $600 million. 'Oh no,' Mr Henry said, 'you can't count that because that's a second-round figure.' But, heavens to Betsy, in the same budget this year we see that a second-round saving of $600 million on the so-called mining tax was allowed by Dr Henry. Dr Henry assisted the government to find another $600 million so called error in our accounts. So Dr Henry should be rewarded with a $528,000 a year job in the Prime Minister's office. That is why it is politicised and that is why we cannot trust them. (Time expired)",110
180,Mr ROBB,BILLS," My two colleagues have shown how the current process is devoid of integrity and credibility here, but and has been grossly politicised. I experienced that first hand after the last election. The parliamentary secretary opposite is yet to provide one decent argument on amendment (1). We will start with amendment (1); that is what we are debating at the moment, right? He has not provided one argument why the PBO and all the rest of us should be hogtied to the numbers, figures, forecasts and analysis of Treasury. Why should that be the case? I will give you an example. Over the last four years we have been debating perhaps the biggest structural adjustment that will ever be considered by any of these parliamentary members: the imposition of a carbon tax and, subsequently, an emissions trading scheme. There has been endless modelling for four years of the impact of this, but not once has the model that has generated all of these numbers, all of these outcomes, all of this rhetoric and all of these forecasts by the government been revealed. They are all part of a black box in Treasury. We have asked endlessly to see the modelling; never have we seen one line of code from that modelling-not one assumption. We have deduced that one assumption built into the model is that there would be no unemployment by 2050. Surprise, surprise! When they got the outcome of the modelling there was no unemployment by 2050. If you put in that assumption, it is not a surprise. What if you changed that one assumption and made it a floating variable in that model? What would be the outcome? What is the sensitivity to fixing that particular variable? We will never know. What would the Parliamentary Budget Office do if they were given that model? They would do some of that sensitivity analysis. We would be better informed; the public would be better informed; the nation would be better informed-especially when we are going it alone on this carbon tax. We are ahead of the world. No-one else is doing it. Yet we have been tied to this situation with Treasury. This is why we need credibility and integrity restored to the process. Treasury has been politicised in this whole exercise. We need the capacity for an independent body to analyse such critical matters as the modelling-the detailed, exhaustive, massive modelling-that has been undertaken. We will get results this week again, but I can assure you they will just be outcomes. Out of this black box again will come a whole series of outcomes around which you will make the most ambitious statements. You will hold everyone hostage to this black box. Having come to government and said that transparency was at the heart of the way in which you would run government, since then we have had nothing but obfuscation, no benefit-cost analyses and a refusal to provide any of the analysis that sits behind all of this. No wonder we need to go to the next election and debate policy based on independently assessed analysis-not only our policies but the policies of the government. The policies of the government need to be scrutinised and analysed. They have not been, and that is why this process is heavily politicised. It is why you need integrity and credibility to be restored to this process.",112
181,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS," I rise to endorse particularly the member for Goldstein's contribution. The parliamentary secretary is a trier-I will give him that-but quite clearly he has not addressed any of the issues which are raised in the debate we had the other evening. In fact, he has tried to divert the argument by suggesting that this was a recommendation made in a report of a parliamentary committee. We do not accept the parliamentary secretary's argument that, if a parliamentary committee finds that in some way, the parliament has to agree. These debates have no purpose at all, apparently, if a parliamentary committee comes up with a recommendation. I am not sure why we sit. We should just let committees sit and come up with their recommendations. The amendment moved by the member for North Sydney is probably the most important amendment of the lot that we are moving because it is about having that contested advice. The parliamentary secretary's view is that you cannot question Treasury. If you go through the history of our government and now your government, the Treasury never gets the numbers right on its forecasts. That is not a criticism; that is just the truth. For instance, last year they forecast",113
182,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"Right on cue, the member for Moreton. No, they did not, member for Morton. The numbers changed-of course they did, because they are estimates, based on models. As the member for Goldstein rightly pointed out, they put numbers into a model and it spits out other numbers. The assumptions changed and the realistic outcomes changed. The point is we should have contestable advice from an independent Parliamentary Budget Office. If you want to take away the politics of the costings in an election campaign, which is what the member for Lyne talks about doing, and have a genuine assessment, you should have a genuine independent body. One of the reasons the parliamentary secretary gave that we cannot go down the route of the Congressional Budget Office was that the funding for the Congressional Budget Office was $50 million a year. Of course, the United States is a slightly bigger country than Australia, Parliamentary Secretary, so it is little surprise that it would have a larger budget office. But quite clearly there is a need for additional powers for the Parliamentary Budget Office so that they can make their own assumptions and arrive at their own numbers based on an analysis of the information that comes before us. The ideas contained in the arguments that the member for Goldstein and the member for Mackellar have just put forward would reduce the unhappiness of an oppositionand, if you think that this is the first opposition to be unhappy with costings during an election campaign, you have not been around for very long. The same problems have arisen in election after election, and it is the very reason that we need and want a genuinely independent parliamentary budget office. The reason you do not want to go down this road is the shortterm politics of today. That position is ill thought through, because in the long term it will have consequences for the effective operation of what should be a genuinely good development in Australian public policy. This is a smart amendment. It addresses genuine concerns that have been raised about the reliability of the numbers, the independence of the decisions and the release of the information. It should be supported, and if you are serious about doing this, Parliamentary Secretary, you will take on board and answer some of the genuine questions that have been raised rather than try to cover them over with half-truths, as you have so far. This is an important debate and you should take it seriously.",113
183,Mr BILSON,BILLS," I again commend this amendment to the government. We were all feeling a bit awkward while we sat here watching the parliamentary secretary last Thursday as very legitimate and considered questions about how the PBO would operate were being asked of him, and clearly his briefing had not extended to his being able to answer them. The shadow Treasurer and others sought to highlight that, by handcuffing the Parliamentary Budget Office to the Treasury numbers and then to the Treasurer's numbers-which was a very salient point raised by the shadow Treasurer-you are effectively undermining the whole point of the PBO. You are effectively saying, 'Be free to inquire and be free to add to the better governance of Australia, but we are going to nobble you so you can't drift too far away from what the Treasurer would like to assert is the only set of numbers that anyone should be taking any notice of.' This amendment is trying to inoculate against this situation, whereby the Parliamentary Budget Officewho, like the new kids on the block, cannot be left to their own professional competence to find the analytical basis best suited to the task being asked of them and must instead take the gospel according to the Treasurereffectively become the apprentices of Treasury. The only opportunity for the Parliamentary Budget Office to look at the numbers before the Treasurer puts his fingerprints all over them would be after the calling of an election. But they are the Treasurer's numbers up until that point andgiven whatever mystery and nuancing has gone on to get them to the point-if we were to remain able to rely only upon Treasury numbers in the election context, I explained to the parliamentary secretary at the table how the situation would play out, since he could not answer my concerns himself. If the opposition announced a policy and then said, 'Here are the costings behind them', the thing you would hear from the Treasurer would be 'No-those numbers are out of date', and the government would make up some mystery black hole and base an argument on it. They would do that because, prior to the election period, there could be some interaction between opposition members and the Parliamentary Budget Office, but it could only be on the basis of the Treasurer's numbers. Getting those numbers revised and updated on the basis of Treasury numbers could only happen in the election context, and in the election context all that material is publicised the moment that the work is concluded. There is no opportunity for the opposition to consider data generated by the PBO. There is no chance to reflect on our own policy commitments and on the calibration of those policies on the basis of the most up-to-date information provided by Treasury, because as soon as that information becomes available we are in the election context, and it all gets thrown up in the air to allow the government to make all sorts of claims and allegations, even though the opposition may not even have a simple view on the question that it was getting tested and costed and analysed through the PBO. We may not even have a chance to reflect on it before the government makes all sorts of claims about what the data means, and that is an important point. I have often spent considerable time to urge the Independents to do things, though I must admit that my track record is not great. Still, gentleman, I will persevere. point here is that the numbers that now form the foundation of considerations are the Treasurer's numbers; Treasury's numbers form the foundation of considerations only during the election period. According to the way that this bill has been constructed, all those numbers will be thrown up in the air first for the world to see during an election period. Where is the opportunity for sober and careful consideration of numbers by the opposition or any Independent members before the government sets its enormous resources to the task misrepresenting what we may be contemplating? I urge the Independents to agree that, under this bill, the PBO is not an independent costing organisation but a nobbled Parliamentary Budget Office. As I said last Thursday, PBO could stand for 'pretty bleeding obvious'. The government is trying through this bill to nobble the PBO so it becomes yet another arm of government, not a body that can the independently contribute to the good governance of the country. The government is trying to nobble the resources of the PBO and the basis from which it can start. The PBO's analysis will be throw out into the public domain during elections, because that is the only time that Treasury numbers are used. Why can't other numbers be used? Why can't the Reserve Bank's forecast, which many in the economy think are very reliable, be used? Why can't the Canadian model, by which a range of independent sources can arrive at their own numbers, be used? Why can't the PBO be treated as an adult and satisfy itself that maybe the Treasurer's numbers are a good starting point- (Time expired)",114
184,Mr BUCHHOLZ,BILLS," I trying commend the amendments. Although the funding was allocated in this year's budget for a PBO, we are now almost three months The down the road in the financial year and only now beginning to debate the policy in earnest. It will be astonishing if the PBO is up and running by the end of this year. Almost everything the government touches ends up turning sour. The only reason we are debating the bill this week is that the coalition has introduced its own PBO legislation. We on this side of the House believe that the government's bill is deeply flawed, and that is why we are pushing for a number of amendments. On this point it is worth examining the differences between the two pieces of legislation and, in order to do so, we need to reflect on the motivation for creating a PBO in the first place. The PBO is a necessary reform to ensure transparency and integrity of budgetary and fiscal processes. In short, it levels up the playing field between government and nongovernment members by giving them equal ability to scrutinise government policy and to evaluate their own policies. If it is to be anything more than a paper tiger, the PBO needs the power to obtain relevant information from government departments; it needs the flexibility to perform whatever analysis it sees fit; and, most importantly, needs to provide a level of discretion to allow members and senators to retain control of their own policy. It is there, at the first hurdle, that the government's policy falls down. Under the government's proposal, the PBO is unable to prepare economic forecasts or budget estimates. Why and how is the PBO supposed to prepare accurate analysis of the budgetary impacts of policy over the longer term? This bill also restricts the PBO from using any economic data prepared by a third party in its determinations, as mentioned by the member for North Sydney earlier. Data from the Reserve Bank and ABARES could not be used in a determination. Instead it can only rely on information provided by the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation. Again, why? What is the purpose of limiting the scope of the PBO's research to such an extreme degree? How can the PBO be expected to fulfil its full mandate with one arm tied behind its back? Unfortunately, the problems do not end there. The government's bill severely restricts the PBO's powers to gather information by requiring it to enter into an agreement with the relevant departments to determine what information they can get and when they can get it. The PBO will have nothing to trade with during the negotiation of these agreements, so it stands to reason that any agreement entered into by the government departments will be heavily biased in favour of the departments in question rather than the PBO. In short, what we are looking at here is a Clayton's PBO: it is the PBO you have when you do not have a PBO. The coalition's policy does not contain any of these rather obvious shortcomings. Instead the PBO, as envisaged by us, will have considerable powers to obtain information from government departments. These powers it will be based more on the powers of the Auditor-General and will ensure the PBO is a much more effective body than the diluted version being offered by those opposite. Of course, one of the most significant functions of the PBO will be to prepare costings, yet even here the government's bill has some rather strange provisions. For instance, during caretaker periods the costings facilities available to members and senators is different from those available at other times. Indeed, during election campaigns the costings functions provided by the PBO would be identical to those already provided to the opposition under the existing Charter of Budget Honesty. So, again, I find myself asking why. What is the reason for this differentiation and what is the point of this duplication? The Charter of Budget Honesty was a groundbreaking reform, but unfortunately the costings process provided under the charter are not confidential. In fact, they are exactly the opposite. As it stands, not only are requests for costings immediately published on the website of both Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation but also the results of the said costings are made available in the same way. Perhaps this is a belated attempt from the Prime Minister to live up to her promise last year to draw the curtains back and let the sun shine in. But perhaps not. In conclusion I believe the government's bill is deeply flawed. The bill provides the PBO with insufficient power to gather the information it needs to do the job, it makes insufficient provisions for discretion and it is structured in such a way that it protects the interests of the government of the day rather than the interests of budgetary transparency and its fiscal integrity.",115
185,Mr WILKIE,BILLS," I want to speak very briefly to put on the record my condemnation of the opposition's accusation that the Treasury is heavily politicised. That is a most serious accusation, particularly as it comes from the alternative government of this country. It is the case that in times past there has been some politicisation within the Public Service. At the time. I was very outspoken about the practice by the then Prime Minister John Howard to personally vet all SES appointments in his own office. I do not think that is the way we should be appointing our senior public servants. But those times are behind us now, thankfully, and it is my observation that we have the world's finest Public Service. It is to credit of the Public Service that the country ran so well during those weeks of uncertainty following last year's election result. There are very few countries in the world where the country can be administered so confidently as Australia. I put on the record my praise for the Australian Public Service and my concern that we should be having a discussion about the degree to which the Treasury, of all departments, would be politicised. I support the government's Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill; I do not support the opposition's amendment. Not only is it important to have scrutiny of election promises but also it is important to have transparency; hence, I think it most important that in the period of the election campaign itself there should be some visibility of what has been costed. If the opposition or the crossbenchers want to have any policy examined privately, that can be done before the election is called, but once we are in the election period itself the whole purpose of the PBO is to shine a light on those costings. Frankly, I personally found the work that was done costing the opposition's policies in the immediate aftermath of last year's federal election very important. The fact that the opposition's policies were found to have a black hole of between $7 billion and $11 billion was not the reason for my decision to put support of supply and confidence behind the government, but it was not lost on me that that was in the mix, particularly at a time when I was very generously being offered $1 billion towards a new hospital in my seat of Denison. It was a time when I could not have confidence that the money was in fact there, given that the opposition had a black hole of between $7 billion and $11 billion. In essence, I do not support the the great opposition's amendment. I think the government's model is sound because it does bring scrutiny and transparency. I applaud the government for again staying true to its commitment to the crossbenchers and to me personally, as contained in our written agreement.",117
186,Mr ROBB,BILLS," Firstly, I have been advised-and it was a matter that was raised, I think, by the Treasurer, the member for Lyne and others-that the model that they chose is based far more on the Canadian parliamentary budget office than on the US Congressional Budget Office. We were told that the Canadian budget office does not do analyses or-for the benefit of the member for Denison-provide transparency in regard to critical analysis, like four years of modelling of the biggest decision all of us will ever take, where we cannot analyse or look at one single variable out of hundreds of variables that are put into that modelling. Transparency is what we are talking about, not politics. This thing is dripping with politics. Now we find that as of the middle of this year the Canadian budget office, in contrast to its previous practice of preparing fiscal projections using government numbers, is basing its fiscal outlook on its own economic projections. Answer that, Parliamentary Secretary-sorry, I forgot your office. Parliamentary Secretary, you might be able to answer that question. I will read from the latest PBO economic and fiscal outlook. This is the PBO of Canada. You might listen to this if you want to talk about transparency. This is a report by the Canadian PBO: To enhance PBO's independent analysis on the state of the nation's finances and trends in the national economy and given the downside risks to the average private sector outlook, PBO is providing-for the first time-its own medium‐term economic outlook … PBO's economic outlook incorporates its judgement of the balance of risks and as a result it can be viewed as a 'balanced' projection, which means that higher or lower outcomes are equally likely. In other words, in Canada, for the first time, they have an independent body which can in fact do its own analysis and give its own sensitivity of the government projections to changes in all sorts of variables. It seems an unremarkable thing that this should happen. It would seem to be a great strength for this parliament to have access to an independent body that can give some sensitivity analysis in regard to key analysis provided by Treasury. That does not mean Treasury is wrong; it just means that we have a far more substantial debate and that we have, in fact, an ability to test the projections and not sit here and be fed, like mushrooms, in the dark. We need this sort of analysis. This is what my colleague and friend the member for North Sydney has put forward. He has put forward this analysis and this request that we as an opposition be able to get the benefit of an independent analysis. I would suggest that the government at times would also benefit from an alternative point of view. Secondly, on the question of the secretary and the Treasury, with great respect to the member for Denison, he did not spend 3½ hours in detailed debate with senior Treasury officers following the election and he did not witness, as my colleague the member for Mackellar has started to articulate, the type of discussion and obstinacy that was provided. There were many examples which we have documented previously, which are a matter of public record and which have again been repeated-some of them today in this House-where we were simply told, 'We have made a decision,' every time we got to a point where they could not argue against what we were saying, such as with the 5.5 per cent bond rate. We had canvassed around the community, with all the leaders of the finance market, what would be a sensible bond rate. Why would we, for the sake of a few dollars, try to obfuscate and cover up? (Time expired)",117
187,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," As we consider the amendment before us at this consideration in detail stage, what we are doing is asking ourselves the question: which of the two alternative models put forward, one by the member for North Sydney and one by the government, better gives effect to the policy objective that, we are all agreed, makes sense-a policy objective in which resources are available to the parliament, the legislative branch of government, to assist in having available to it alternative expert advice on economic, financial and budgetary matters? It is a question of which schemewhich mechanism; which process-is best going to give effect to the principle upon which we are all in agreement. Against that backdrop, there is a pretty clear contrast between the two alternative frameworks which have been put forward. The government's framework, laid out in proposed section 64E(2) and (3), specifically bars the Parliamentary Budget Office from carrying out certain functions such as preparing budget estimates. It also specifically constrains the Parliamentary Budget Office to use forecasts, parameters and fiscal estimates released by the Treasurer. By contrast, the scheme put forward by the member for North Sydney in his excellent amendment is a scheme under which the Parliamentary Budget Office has a maximum degree of discretion in performing its functions. In the words of the amendment, the Parliamentary Budget Officer is given the discretion to 'prepare, or have regard either or both of economic forecasts or budget estimates'. In other words, it is a provision which grants the maximum extent of discretion to the Parliamentary Budget Officer so that he or she is best placed to discharge the functions which this legislation is imposing upon him or her-namely, the function of being a provider of independent expert advice to the legislative branch of government. When the policy suggestion was put forward by the coalition, and subsequently taken up in the negotiations between the Independents and the government, the underlying logic was to establish an independent body, an independent office which would provide a source of independent advice. There is no notion of being critical of the existing departments of it state. There is no notion of saying that they are in some way inherently flawed in what they do, but there is a mature recognition that executive government will often have a different set of interests from the parliament, from the legislative branch. There is also a mature recognition that it makes sense to better inform the parliament to provide a source of specialist expertise to the parliament to allow it to discharge its weighty responsibilities. If a consequence of these new arrangements is that there is a battle of ideas, that there is contestability in policy, that is no bad thing; indeed we on this side of the House say that is a good thing. But the one thing we say very specifically and very precisely about the two alternative schemes that are before the House this afternoon is that we are deeply suspicious of the bona fides of the government in putting forward the particular scheme it has, because we do not believe that the restrictions on the Parliamentary Budget Office contained in proposed section 64E(2) or the constraints on to, the sources to which it may have regard contained in 64E(3) adequately and sensibly give effect to the policy objective which all of us share in this debate, which is a Parliamentary Budget Office best able to provide independent advice to the parliament about these complex and important matters. It is on that basis that I believe the amendment put forward by the member for North Sydney ought to be supported this afternoon.",118
188,Mr HUNT,BILLS," In order to assist the Independents with their judgment I want to provide three real-world examples of why there is a need for contestability, as has been set out by the member for North Sydney. Let me begin with three examples from my own portfolio in recent years. Firstly, under the Home Insulation Program, we were given a set of estimates by the government which were rock solid and ironclad and which we were to accept as Holy Writ. It is known by all members of this House that virtually none of those estimates came to pass. They did not come to pass in terms of their costs, their safety assessments, the of installation or, indeed, the emissions reduction. We were told that $2.45 billion had been set aside under the Home Insulation Program to achieve installation in just over 2.7 million homes around Australia. Unfortunately, only one million homes, less than 40 per cent of the government figures, were ever installed with insulation. Almost a billion dollars had to be set aside in provisioning for repair and maintenance and restoration. The rate of emissions reduction was one-third of that given by government agencies, and obviously endorsed by Treasury, as Holy Writ. We were derided for contesting those figures, yet we were correct and the government agencies were incorrect, I am sorry to say. I do not blame the government agencies. They were forced to act against a set of parameters imposed upon them by the executive government. It is important to understand that executive government can, but it should not, under this current government impose parameters on the bureaucracy and administration. That has distorted the way in which that bureaucracy and administration produces its figures. Contrary to what the member for Denison says, we are not asserting that this is a bad bureaucracy. We are asserting that there probably has never been any greater interference in the operations of the bureaucracy in Australia's history. For us, then, to have to rely upon the figures which come from that process is utterly unacceptable. There must be contestability. Perhaps we could have avoided a tragedy such as the Home Insulation Program, let alone the waste and the extraordinary impact on so many small businesses. Contestability in public figures would have assisted throughout the Home Insulation Program. That is not provided for under this bill but it rate is provided for under the alternative model that the member for North Sydney has set out. I also want to give two current examples before the parliament under the existing carbon tax modelling provided by the government-again I say 'the government'. There is an assumption in the modelling that the United States will have an effective carbon tax-a cap-in-trade system, in their words-up and running on a full national basis by 2016. That is simply fallacious. It is a fantasy that the United States under any foreseeable political structure will have a fully functioning carbon tax or cap-in-trade scheme. That has a huge impact on the global assumptions and, therefore, the entire base for the Treasury modelling. That is not the fault of Treasury. It is the fault of a government that imposes a straitjacket on the bureaucracy, that reaches into its operation and distorts the way Treasury works and distorts the figures. For that, we say, there must be contestability. A similar thing is that there is a change in the assumption of elasticity regarding the sensitivity of the population to changes in electricity prices and demand. There is no basis for this. There is no explanation for this. It does not sit with Australian economic history. It does not sit with the work of the New South Wales independent regulator. Again, none of this is contestable under the model which is currently proposed. These are real-world examples. There is the home insulation program. There is the fact that the United States, in no foreseeable future, will have a fully functioning cap-andtrade system by 2060. And there has been a complete rewriting of economic history regarding the sensitivity of people to changes in electricity pricing. That is why the amendment should be supported and there should be contestability in figures. (Time expired)",119
189,Mr OAKESHOTT,BILLS," As someone who was part of the agreement-an agreement that included representatives of all members of this chamber-to establish a parliamentary office in this term, I am at a loss why we are seeing so much trouble in passing this legislation. Likewise, I was a committee member of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office, along with Barnaby Joyce, Kelly O'Dwyer and Christopher Pyne. The three coalition members, the government members, the Greens and I unanimously supported various recommendations for the establishment of a PBO. Again, I am at a loss as to why we are now struggling to turn this into legislation. We are building a service for this House. We are not building a service for the executive. There was an important question asked at the end of the last engagement over this piece of legislation-I think it was last Tuesday night, when, thankfully, we adjourned so that we could all consider our positions. Further work has obviously been done by all of us. As far as I can see, questions that I was raising at the end of debate regarding the difference between Treasury and the Treasurer seem somewhat spurious, at the very least.",121
190,Mr Hockey,BILLS,Spurious!,121
191,Mr OAKESHOTT,BILLS,"Spurious, the member for North Sydney. I am increasingly",121
192,Mr Hockey,BILLS,"You have been stiffened up by them, have you?",121
193,Mr OAKESHOTT,BILLS,"Not at all. The member for North Sydney thinks I have been stiffened up, sticking up for an independent parliamentary budget office, a service of this parliament agreed, by members of his own party, to be put into legislation twice in the last 12 months.",121
194,Mr Briggs,BILLS,"Stop verballing people, Rob.",121
195,Mr OAKESHOTT,BILLS,"I am not verballing anyone. The big question that I wanted cleared up at the end of the last debate was: can any member of this chamber, including the member for Mayo, confidentially ring the Parliamentary Budget Office and ask for work to be done on any topic of their choice? The answer is yes.",121
196,Unknown,BILLS,Opposition members interjecting,121
197,Mr OAKESHOTT,BILLS,"You can have another go, all of you. I am happy if you have information that proves this wrong. The question then is: does the Parliamentary Budget Office, whoever the independent CEO is, have rights of confidential access into Treasury? The answer is yes. The member for North Sydney shakes his head. I ask him, please, to get up and tell me his views on why that advice is wrong. Let's get to the heart of whether a confidential process, as a service for members of parliament in this chamber, with nothing to do with the Treasurer and nothing to do with that the executive, actually applies. The only point in all of that is whether the Treasurer signs off on a budget or not. It is illogical if we, as a chamber, are asking for a Treasurer not to sign off on the budget. If we accept that then we accept that the figures that are used from the Treasury as the starting point for the process of PEFO, and other similar documents as part of the Charter of Budget Honesty, already apply. What seems to be in place is a direct attack on the independence of the Treasury. I have heard that from speakers twice now. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: independent.",121
198,Mr OAKESHOTT,BILLS,The member for Mackellar confirms that. The shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance sit either side of the member for Mackellar as she directly attacks the independence of the Treasury. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: Correct.,122
199,Mr OAKESHOTT,BILLS,"She again confirms it: 'Correct.' We have silence from the two key finance officers of the coalition. This is a direct attack on the independence of the Treasury. If that is the case-if that is the point of your position in this debate-why on earth did you waste this parliament's time in the last 12 months by participating in a process that arrived at unanimous recommendations? That process involved Barnaby Joyce, Chris Pyne and Kelly O'Dwyer. Why on earth did you waste 16 days after the election reaching an agreement over these proposals for a better parliament? Please explain your position as to why you consider this is not confidential and why it is not independent.",122
200,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," I remind all those who are speaking in this debate to refer their comments through the chair, not at the chair. It is not 'you' or 'your'; it is not 'me' and 'you'.",122
201,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS," To help the member for Lyne, who seems to pride himself on understanding how legislation works, I refer him to proposed section 64E of the bill before the House: (2) The Parliamentary Budget Officer's functions under subsection (1) do not include: (a) preparing economic forecasts; or (b) preparing budget estimates (whether at the whole-of-government, agency or program level. Mr Oakeshott interjecting",122
202,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"Just listen. I know this is hard to get through, but give it a shot. And It is not 64E(3) says: (3) In performing his or her functions under subsection (1), the Parliamentary Budget Officer must use the economic forecasts and parameters and fiscal estimates contained in the most recent relevant reports released under Parts 5, 6 and 7 of Schedule 1 to the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998.

I say to the member for Lyne that part 5 refers to annual government reporting. Then at (1) of 13 it says: Commonwealth bodies to provide information to help prepare report (1) To help the Treasurer to prepare a budget economic and fiscal outlook report, the Treasurer may request a Commonwealth body to provide information. That means these are the Treasurer's numbers. They are not the Treasury's numbers, they are the Treasurer's numbersand you do not understand that.",122

206,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"Okay, fine. Vote with the government against this amendment and defang the Parliamentary Budget Office. We have given you a chance. We have given the member for Lyne a chance to have a truly independent parliamentary budget office. If the member for Lyne does not want it, okay, fine, no problems. Go with a weaker parliamentary budget office and live with the consequences, if you are there at the next parliament.",122
207,Mr FRYDENBERG,BILLS," I rise to support the member for North Sydney's amendments to the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011. We start from the position that the Parliamentary Budget Office is a net positive and it is not new. OECD survey found that another 18 countries have some sort of legislative parliamentary involvement in setting the fiscal situation with a PBO. The United States has a $45 million per annum budget for its Parliamentary Budget Office. The Dutch Parliamentary Budget Office has more than 150 staff and we have heard about the Canadian budget office. Indeed, this is our idea and ever since 2007 the coalition has driven the idea of a parliamentary budget office. That is why the shadow Treasurer has before the parliament his own bill. It is because those opposite have such a poor record with costing and releasing their policies that we need a parliamentary budget office. Ms Rishworth interjecting",123
208,Mr FRYDENBERG,BILLS,You will remember that in 2007 you released your costings the day before the election. In 2010 you released your costings the day before the election.,123
209,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! I would remind the member for Kooyong not to refer in your speech to 'you'. You are referring to me in this occupied chair, the Deputy Speaker. You will refer to the government or the opposition, please.",123
210,Mr FRYDENBERG,BILLS,I was simply making the point that when,123
211,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,You will refer your comments through the chair not at the chair.,123
212,Mr FRYDENBERG,BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The point is that those opposite have a very poor record when it comes to releasing and costing their policies. What happened in 2007 and at the election in 2010 bears that out. The Parliamentary An Budget Office amendment we are moving will bring greater transparency to the fiscal situation and fiscal process. It will ensure that non-government MPs and senators and parties have access to the proper costings and it mitigates the disadvantage that those in opposition have against a better resourced government. We only have to look at what happened with our costings before the last election, when we were looking at the interest to be saved from not proceeding with the NBN. We used the Commonwealth bond rate as the discount rate. It was the NBN implementation study which showed that you should have used the Commonwealth bond rate to assess the amount of savings that you would have if you did not proceed with the NBN, and you would not have that information released. There are three key criteria that our amendments to this bill are pushing. Firstly, there is confidentiality. Requests to have policies costed should not be immediately put up on the website when they are received. The timing of release of those costings should not be immediately put up on the website and made public once they are done. It should be up to those who are seeking those costings to assess the timing of that release-whether they want to resubmit a request for costing or whether they want to change the assumptions they are putting forward for their particular policy or whether they want to discuss and alter those particular assumptions. Secondly, there need to be fewer restrictions on the PBO's ability to source material to make its analysis. As the member for North Sydney said: why cannot ABARE, why cannot the Reserve Bank of Australia be able to provide information to the Parliamentary Budget Office for them to make their analysis? Why restrict it to those reports under the Charter of Budget Honesty? That will very much limit the quality of the analysis that is done. Thirdly, we must increase the powers of the PBO to get information from other departments. Currently, under government's bill, it is about an MOU. It is just about an MOU with departments but not giving the PBO the ability to compel those departments to release that information. That is why the member for North Sydney has very appropriately suggested that he should use powers akin to those of the Auditor General in order to source that material from other departments. The Independents have a privileged position at the moment. They, particularly the Greens, are getting assistance from the government. But that will not always be the case. They need to get behind these amendments we are moving because they are right for the parliament and right for the budget office. (Time expired)",123
213,Mr BILSON,BILLS," In order to assist the process, the member for Lyne was asking for a very specific piece of information. I think he was contesting the assertion of the opposition on confidentiality, to which he placed considerable weight, so that members could seek, with confidence, confidential advice and have some interaction. We were highlighting how that is compromised and he was contesting that, if that is a fair characterisation. I draw his attention to proposed section 64L of the bill and I will read it. This is under the heading 'Caretaker period policy costing requests made before polling day-public release of requests and costings.' It says: This section applies in relation to a policy costing request that is made under subsection 64J(2) or (5) before polling day during the caretaker period for a general election. It goes on to say: As soon as practicable after the request has been made and before polling day, the Parliamentary Budget Officer must publicly release the request and a costing of the policy. That is the practical black-and-white the provision to which we were referring and I hope that is helpful. I was seeking to illuminate the parliament-and it is perhaps not as helpful as I might hope it would be and, dare I say it, the Member for Lyne, I have been there before, but I will persevere-and I hope that is helpful. The point I was making and that the shadow Treasurer has made is that, up until the caretaker period, the base against which costings are provided is provided by the Treasurer. The Treasurer owns that costing basis. He can do whatever fiscal magic and wisdom he feels is appropriate to release his figures. The point I was trying to emphasise-and perhaps I did not do it well, and I stand admonished for that-is the only time the Treasury has undiluted, unadulterated data during the entire period between elections available is from the PEFO, the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. That is the only time, Member for Lyne, that the dataset upon which you are placing such great weight is actually the Treasury's dataset. The rest of the time under those other economic and forecasting bases it is the Treasurer. So if the member for Lyne places such an enormous weight and respect, as I do, on Treasury, let Treasury be heard. That is really what the opposition is on about. But what we are also saying is if you are only interested-sorry, not you, Madam Deputy Speaker.",124
214,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Yes, I was going to say to everybody that perhaps if he keeps",125
215,Mr BILSON,BILLS,I have been pretty good up to that point.,125
216,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," everybody has been pretty bad. I may enter the debate, seeing as I sat on the inquiry, I won't be that cheeky. The member for Dunkley has the call.",125
217,Mr BILSON,BILLS,"I hope the clerks take that 15 seconds off your time and not mine, Madam Deputy Speaker. The point I was trying to make to the member for Lyne is that if the Treasury figures are to be allowed to be used, let them be used, not the Treasurer's figures. The only time in which the Treasury's figures are used are during the caretaker period. So any effort by anyone in this chamber to rely upon Treasury's figures only happens during the caretaker period where there is this obligation under 64L to release all the material. There is no opportunity to go back on the basis of the analysis that is provided to recalibrate, to contemplate whether it is worth 'moving forward', dare I use a phrase, on the material that is provided-none whatsoever. So if he is fair dinkum about Treasury, let them be heard. But if he is also only wanting to hear one tune-that we have all got to be on exactly the same tune in this nation's parliament-then persist with his point of view. If he would like to hear other voices, other options, other analysis to make sure there is rigour and robustness to this work, he must support the opposition's amendments, because there is a range of other analysis available that will strengthen the quality of governance in this country, and not have the parliament handcuffed to whatever the Treasurer thinks is advantageous from his political perspective. We are on about good governance in this country; not what is good for the government. He has been hoodwinked into being locked into this 'PBO Lite' that relies upon the magic of the Treasurer doing whatever he likes with material that Treasury might produce, to have that as the starting No, point, to say, 'No other voice interests us; no other basis of analysis has any value but whatsoever.' I get a bit sick of hearing unctuousness about public servants. We respect public servants, but when they get rolled out and manipulated by a dodgy, poor government, that is a problem for everybody. My last point is: what about the Parliamentary Budget Officer? Is he or she not deserving of the respect to go and source advice where he or she sees fit? I have respect for that position as well, not just some that are chosen to be favoured. (Time expired)",125
218,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The member's time has expired-with extra time for my interruption.,125
219,Mr OAKESHOTT,BILLS," To try and settle this debate, I have seven questions that I would like to put to the parliamentary secretary. My understanding of the answers to those questions is yes, but if there is any doubt about any of these, it is good for them to be on the record and for us as a parliament to then work them through. The first is: does the PBO under this legislation have full and unfettered access to the departments of Treasury and finance? I hope the answer is yes. The second is: is this access direct-that it does not depend on any minister's office and it will not go through any minister's office? My understanding of that is yes, but I need to hear from the parliamentary secretary if otherwise. Third: does this allow, therefore, the PBO to question, critique, test any of the forecasts of the budget or of the government more generally? My understanding is yes, but please answer otherwise if it is incorrect. Fourth: is this direct access unencumbered by any ministerial oversight, providing another critical check and balance for this parliament? My understanding is yes. Fifth: under these arrangements would it quickly become obvious, as was a point made by the member for North Sydney last week, if there were any fudging of the figures along the lines that were implied last week? My understanding is the PBO would actually add to this parliament and a shadow Treasurer's ability to pick up whether the Treasurer was fudging anything that the Treasury was actually doing. Sixth: can the PBO inform their analysis by drawing on other sources of information such as the RBA, the IMF, the OECD, whatever? My understanding is yes. Finally: is the use of forecasts and estimates prepared by Treasury and Finance about providing a more sensible basis for comparison of policy costings, reducing an expensive and unnecessary duplication of effort? Anyone in business understands double-handling is bad. We have got to have a common set of rules from somewhere. I would have thought an undisputed independent Treasury was the place for macroforecasting to be done, and then the politics can go its hardest on the back of Can you answer those seven questions to assist the debate?",125
220,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS," The answer to those questions is yes. In relation to the first one, the PBO does have full and unfettered access to the Department of the Treasury. In relation to whether that access is direct or not, that is correct. In relation to whether or not the PBO has the ability to test that advice, there is nothing in the act to preclude them from being able to test that advice. In relation to whether or not there is the ability for that to occur unencumbered by ministerial interference, the answer to that is yes. In relation to whether or not it would become obvious if there were any fudging, for the reasons I set out earlier in terms of the robust processes that exist to test these forecasts, the answer to that would be yes as well. In relation to whether or not the PBO can inform their analysis by drawing upon forecasts from others, certainly that is an option that is available to them, with exception of course being in relation to the basis upon which costings are to be formed. When it comes to the question of the preparation of costings in relation to particular proposals, that is to be based upon the forecasts that are to be obtained from Treasury. That goes to the final question that the member for Lyne has asked in relation to a more sensible basis for comparison. That is the very heart of this debate. We need to ensure that, when the public is being given the opportunity to compare one particular set of election commitments with another, they are able to compare apples with apples. It is important that the set of forecasts upon which those costings are to be made is a comparable set of forecasts. That is the key consideration in this whole debate. So the that. answer to that question of course is yes. Mr Briggs interjecting",126
221,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Mayo is warned!,126
222,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,"That is why the elements that have been set out in the bill and debated and supported by the government go to the very heart of making sure that there is some integrity in the process. I do not want to speak at great length, but I will make the point that, if this bill is passed and becomes legislation, for the first time oppositions will have the opportunity to test polices and cost those policies on an ongoing and iterative basis. That is something that is not currently available. That will be a major advancement in allowing a more level playing field when it comes to costing policies, particularly throughout the non-election period, and that will assist oppositions in a way that they do not currently have assistance under the Charter of Budget Honesty. In relation to the importance of that point and the question that goes to this amendment regarding forecasts, I simply make the point that it is essential that, when the public is being given an opportunity to test the value of the proposals that have been put forward by the respective parties, they can have some confidence that the parameters and the forecasts upon which those costings have been based are comparable. If that were not the case, that would lead to a very destructive and very wasteful discussion, particularly in the course of election campaigns, around parameters assumptions rather than where that debate should be focused, which is on the question of the actual costs of the proposals that have been put forward by the respective parties, so that the electors, the people of Australia, go to that election in full confidence that policies of the respective parties have been properly and comparably costed so that they can make their judgments. It is on that basis that we are opposed to the amendment that the member for North Sydney has brought forward.",126
223,Ms ODWYER,BILLS," I rise in support of the amendment brought forward by the shadow Treasurer to strengthen the independence of the Parliamentary Budget Office. We on this side of the chamber are the only people interested in a rigorous analysis on the economic and fiscal impacts of policy proposals, which is why we brought forward our very own bill. Let us not forget that it was actually this side of the chamber that brought forward, before the last election, a policy to initiate a parliamentary budget office. That is why we are having this debate in the chamber today-not because of any agreement with the Independents but because the coalition brought forward this policy before the last election. This has not been a long standing commitment of the government. They rushed in legislation in response to our policy proposal, and their legislation is deficient. That is why the shadow Treasurer has needed to bring forward an amendment, which he has done so very ably. What he has brought forward is an amendment to make sure that the Parliamentary Budget Office, when it is brought into effect, will be an independent parliamentary budget office, that it will not be unduly restricted in what it and can look at and what it can do in the performance of its role and function. Critical to that, of course, is the fact that it should be able to have regard to its own ability to perform economic forecasts and budget can estimates. It can of course have regard to the Treasury's economic forecasts and budget estimates, but it also should be able to initiate its own if in fact it believes it is required. The government's bill restricts the ability of the Parliamentary Budget Office to look at only Treasury and Finance figures, and this of course goes to the power of the Parliamentary Budget Office to perform its own functions. We believe that this will, unfortunately, make a of the eunuch parliamentary budget office. Unlike the US Congressional Budget Office or the Canadian Parliamentary Office, it will be a parliamentary budget office which is a parliamentary budget office in name only. I was on the joint committee that recommended that a parliamentary budget office be initiated. I, along with the Independents, agreed that we needed to have a parliamentary budget office that had the power to gather information, a parliamentary budget office that would be independent and would not be unduly restricted. Unfortunately, though, I think the bill before us today will in fact restrict the ability of Parliamentary Budget Office to perform its role and function, which is why we have needed to bring forward the amendment that we have. I notice that the government has not been able to respond to the amendment that has been brought forward. It has not been able to provide one sensible reason as to why it cannot accept the amendment. Instead, I notice that, on the weekend, the Treasurer put out a media release that attacked our amendment by saying that it went to our economic competence. It said, in fact, that we were economically incompetent. That is a little bit like Silvio Berlusconi giving a critique on the virtues of celibacy. It is a little bit like the member for Dobell telling us about the importance of good governance and financial accounting.",127
224,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The member for Higgins is straying.,128
225,Ms ODWYER,BILLS,"It is not something that is remotely credible for the government to say. We believe, as I have just said-and which has been said by all of my colleagues-that a transparent, independent budget office that is not restricted in the performance of its role and function is the most critical thing that we can achieve here today. If we get this wrong today, we will be getting it wrong for the future. That is why it is so critical that the government actually answer the question that has been brought forward by the amendments that the shadow Treasurer has put on the table today. They cannot provide one reason why we should not be able to accept the amendments brought forward by the shadow Treasurer. I think they should simply accept that our amendments will improve their bill, and they should support them.",128
226,Mr WILKIE,BILLS," I think I have been developing quite a good the relationship with the opposition. It has been a bit of a rocky start, but I have shown that I am willing to support the opposition when they have a good initiative. I have to say that on this particular issue I do believe the opposition has lost its way. I pose three questions to the member for North Sydney. My first question is: will the member for North Sydney now withdraw and apologise for the opposition's attack on the Treasury and the claim that it is politicised? My second question is: why won't you now support an initiative which the opposition supported unanimously in committee-did someone belatedly realise that there had been an inadvertent episode of being constructive? My third question is: why all the focus in here this afternoon on the need for confidentiality during an election campaign, when, if the opposition stopped saying no to everything and instead did some good policy development work now, they could get everything they want costed in confidence before the next election campaign?",128
227,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS," In answer to question 1: no. In relation to question 2: you clearly have not even read the report that has come before this parliament on this bill, because in fact the specific amendment I am moving at the moment is not even a recommendation in the report.",128
228,Mr Bradbury,BILLS,It is dealt with under the report.,129
229,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"It is not a recommendation of the report. Have you read the report? I would urge you to read the report that you are referring to. In response to the third question, relating to constructive analysis: we have not said that we will not reveal all of our costings before the next election. We have said we will but we are not going to submit our costings to a parliamentary budget office or a Treasury that is an arm of the government and is using government data. Full stop. If the member for Denison had looked at all the other amendments when I endeavoured to engage in conversation about this bill, he would see that in fact what we are doing through these amendments is making the PBO more independent and more accountable to the parliament. That is why I said this is the chance; there may not be a second chance in the next parliament. And I would say to the member for Denison: look carefully at our amendments, have a good think about them and ask yourself whether these would enhance the power of the Parliamentary Budget Office and not reduce it. I do not understand why the Independents-and I say this very genuinely-are so hogtied to the government on this bill. It is not a bill that goes to good government; it is a bill that goes to the integrity of the parliament and to the independence of the chamber. We were the ones who initiated a parliamentary budget office policy. Malcolm Turnbull as Leader of the Opposition did that, and it was carried on by the current Leader of the Opposition. We went to the last election promising to introduce a parliamentary budget office. Senator Guy Barnett in the other place had worked on this initiative for an extended period of time. This is not anything new. We are the ones who actually put forward the initiative. We were the ones who introduced a bill.",129
230,Mr Briggs,BILLS,We introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty.,129
231,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,Exactly right. We are the ones who introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty. And we are the ones now who are introducing a bill for a PBO. The government only reacts when it is forced to do so. Obviously the Independents feel that they have done a deal with the governmentthey have made their decisions even though they do not even know what they are talking about-so be it. That is the way it is; let it be on their heads.,129
232,Mr ROBB,BILLS," I have some questions for the parliamentary secretary. Firstly, I would be grateful if he could confirm or otherwise that Canada and its parliamentary budget office now carry out independent analysis on the state of the nation's finances and trends. Secondly, I would like the parliamentary secretary to confirm that in the United States the Congressional Budget Office carries out independent analysis on the state of the nation's finances and trends. Thirdly, I would ask the parliamentary secretary to explain why in Australia the Parliamentary Budget Office, as pronounced in this bill, will not allow that authority to carry out independent analysis on the state of the nation's finances and trends? The next question relates to the issue of access to Treasury data. The member for Lyne asserted and then asked a question about the PBO. He said that the Parliamentary Budget Office would get private access to Treasury data and analysis and would have the ability to make their own assessment of Treasury data and analysis on a confidential basis. The parliamentary secretary confirmed; he said yes to all of those propositions. So I would like to ask parliamentary secretary: if the government's Parliamentary Budget Office is put into place, would the Parliamentary Budget Office get access to things such as the modelling to do with the carbon tax, which has been carried out extensively? Will the Parliamentary Budget Office get access to the variables and all of the assumptions embodied in that analysis? Do you want to take some notes, or have you got all this in your head? I am just getting a bit worried. I am onto question 11Mr Briggs interjecting",129
233,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Goldstein has the call and the member for Mayo should remember that he has been warned.,130
234,Mr Bradbury,BILLS,"When you say 'you', are you referring to me?",130
235,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"I said 'the parliamentary secretary', thanks very much.",130
236,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, parliamentary secretary is not assisting and my patience is being worn down by everybody.,130
237,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"It would be better if the parliamentary secretary were to take notes rather than putting cheap shots across the chamber. I am very worried that I am not going to get answers to any of this, and it quite relevant to the two Independents up here-and I am going to disregard the patronising cheap shots from the member for Denison in all of that. I ask: would the Parliamentary Budget Office be able to get access to Treasury modelling of, say, the education rebate? It is modelling that we were denied in the 3½ hours that we met with the Treasury officials. We got told to pull our heads in, effectively, and to take what they had to say-even though we had commissioned modelling from NATSEM, which Treasury uses. But they said there is a the $900 million black hole, and we were told, 'You cop it.' That is what we were told, and you call that not interference. That was no cooperation whatsoever, and you have got the hide to stand up there and say that we are playing games. This is very serious business. They are in government because of the way in which that material was mishandled by Treasury and then by the government, and how you lapped it up! How those members lapped it up! The next question I would like to ask is quite critical. In fact, I might come back to it in a minute, because I am running out of time. According to this bill as I read it: in the caretaker period if you present any proposal, automatically the costing of that is released immediately. I reserve the right to come back and finish that proposition. (Extension of time granted) The critical point in all of this, the thing that has really got our back up, is the proposition-and one of our own members of the committee has confirmed The this-that unanimous agreements are not being delivered upon in this bill. The thing that is really getting up our nose is the fact that if we present a proposal, or two alternative proposals, to the Parliamentary Budget Office in the caretaker period, where we are trying to explore the relative merits of that proposal, or some competing proposals, is we are trying to compare the relative merits. We are trying to come up with an answer which is economically responsible, economically doable, robust and independently assessed. If we present those two alternatives, over which we have taken no final decision, is it true that the analysis and costing of those two proposals-over which we have taken no final decision but we are in the caretaker period-will be automatically released? That is how we read this bill, and the shadow Treasurer's amendments go to making it absolutely crystal clear that that is not the case and in fact we could test some proposals that we are looking at the relative merits of before we have made a final decision and keep in confidence the costings of those two proposals. If you say that it is true that costings have to be released, no-one can form any other conclusion than that this is an act of politicising this whole Parliamentary Budget Office. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (17:05): I would cede to the parliamentary secretary to answer the questions, but he was not making any movement to rise to answer them. I have in front of me a 'note for file: post-briefing feedback for the opposition; meetings of Independent MPs with departmental secretaries.' As I read through it, I see that follow-up question No. 1 was to have some, but every other question says, 'no follow-up'. On the questions where our costings were challenged by Treasury, I went through earlier, chapter and verse-before the member for Denison came into the chamber but the member for Lyne was here-why the disallowing of a legitimate saving of $2.5 billion with regard to our conservative bias allowance savings was knocked out by Treasury. I went through why the $3.3 billion of expenditure savings against the Health and Hospital Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Building Australia Fund were knocked out by Treasury and why the $2.4 billion saving that was put in place with regard to the NBN was knocked out. We had assessed that the savings that would be made on interest payable was 5.5 per cent, which was the average of the 10-year bond rate for six months leading up to the election, and Treasury said, 'No, we've decided it's 4.9 per cent,' and I said that I had taken out the figures today showing that, in fact, the bond rate from July 2010 to August 2011 is 5.23 per cent. And yet that was knocked out. Why that were the $600,000 of savings from putting people back into the workforce-people over 50 and under 30-knocked out by Treasury, because they called it 'a second-round effect', whereas in fact they allowed it for the those government in their own budget papers, as they had indeed allowed other things for the government and denied them for the opposition. Then there was a further $1.5 billion knocked out by Treasury with regard to the savings that could be made on the PBS, whereas the forecast was that 40 per cent could be saved and the government's legislative base was 23 per cent. A further 17 per cent in savings was available, which was accounted for in the $1.15 billion. That totals $9.95 billion knocked out by Treasury, and you accepted it according to these minutes. When the question was asked about the bottom line impact of the department's costings, that was when you decided that you would go with this lot, the government of the day and not us. The answer came back from Mr Henry, who, as I said, has been rewarded by the new appointment in the Prime Minister's office.",130
238,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The member for Mackellar is straying, and there is imputation in what she has saidMrs BRONWYN BISHOP: This is why we have to have",131
239,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"and I would ask her to withdraw. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: No, I cannot withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker.",131
240,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"Then the member for Mackellar may have to resume her seat. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: Madam Deputy Speaker, if the Secretary to the Treasury-and what we are talking about here is whether or not",132
241,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,We are not going to debate this. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: we have an independence. The point about independence is: is the head of the Treasury serving the government of the day and therefore not able to give independent advice on opposition costings? That is a fair and legitimate point to make in this debate,132
242,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,All I have askedMrs BRONWYN BISHOP: and it is the one that I am making.,132

254,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"Thank you very much. The question is that amendment (1), moved by the member for North Sydney, be agreed to. I call the member for Mayo.",132
255,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS," I wanted to just address a couple of issues which were raised earlier, particularly one raised by the member for Denison who said, in one of his cheap shots, as the member for Goldstein described, about doing work now in preparation for the next election campaign to avoid the release of confidential information which you would be familiar with. Budgets change. Numbers change quite substantially over a period of time, so much so that the government of the day's numbers change between the mid-year budget review and the final outcome. In fact, we do not know what the final outcome of the budget was last year, because the revenue numbers change and the parameters you work with change. If you understood the Commonwealth budget and how budgeting works, member for Denison, you would understand that you cannot do a costing now for a tax cut you might want in two years time for an election campaign. Guess who does not do that themselves? The executive. So, in your view, it is okay for the executive to have that right to test their policies to get it right but not for the opposition or in fact yourself. That is completely illogical, but we should not be surprised, I guess. It is as logical as attacking any public servant appointed by John Howard but then getting outraged if anyone raises questions about current public servants. It is a completely illogical position. It is all right to slander the former Prime Minister, but if it is anyone in this place it is a great outrage. Hypocrite-absolute hypocrite. I go back to the issues raised by the member for Lyne. I point this out to him: in the questions he raised to the parliamentary secretary, who did not answer those questions, he did not point to the sections but said, 'There is nothing which will stop it.' I thought that was a fascinating answer for the third question you raised. I put this to you, member for Lyne: 64B of the bill says: Purpose of Parliamentary Budget Office The purpose of the Parliamentary Budget OfficeI am reading from the billis to inform the Parliament by providing, in accordance with this Division, independent and non-partisan analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of proposals. It then directly rules that out when in 64E2 it says: The Parliamentary Budget Officer's functions under subsection (1) do not include: (a) preparing economic forecasts; or (b) preparing budget estimates Give me a break. This is an absolute sell-out of this policy. If you want to go through the history, you do not own this. In fact, this was owned by the coalition who proposed this in the budget in reply, but that is not the point. If we want good outcomes in this place, if you want the parliament to work properly, as you say-and I take you at your word on that-this is a really good reform if you make some changes. What they are proposing is a halfway house. It is the same as when the Labor Party opposed the Charter of Budget Honesty in 1996. We do not take these people on trust. They opposed the Charter of Budget Honesty in 1996 because they completely politicised the process in 1995 and 1996. The member for Denison probably forgets that. It might have been one of his hazy periods. They completely politicised the budget process in that time, and that is why, when the Howard government came to power, there was a $10 billion black hole in the budget. That is how the Charter of Budget Honesty came about. This is our proposal from when the member for Wentworth was the Leader of the Opposition. It is a good proposal, with some improvements, including making it genuinely independent to give it the power to make its own forecasts. You know what: the Treasury is not always right. They would say to you themselves that they are not always right. It is economic forecasting. Access Economics does it. Lots of people do it. Lots of people on the internet do it these days. It should be a contested thing. We should have the right to improve policies in this place and get decent and genuinely independent access to information, including forecasts. This is a good amendment. It is not about playing politics; it is improving what is decent reform in this place.",132
256,Mr BILSON,BILLS," Of the questions that were asked by the crossbenchers of the parliamentary secretary, I would like to add an eighth. I am sure the member for Lyne had so many questions that the issue he spoke quite vigorously about, in fairness-the opportunity to get considered independent advice-did not feature in the top seven. Maybe it would have been eighth. The assertion that was being raised by the member for Lyne was around our concern about the inability to obtain confidential independent advice, weigh policy options and even analyse announcements made by others to see where they might be improved through calibration and policy settings. The opportunity to do that confidentially is denied to the opposition and to all Independents during the caretaker period. As I sought to do before, I draw his attention to section 64L of the bill, which makes that quite explicit. If he wants a rewritten account of that, page 10 of the explanatory memorandum emphasises that point quite clearly. To draw connections between why that should be of concern to Independent members and all members in this place and why it should be of concern to the broader Australian public, my friend and colleague the member for Mayo points to a very excellent example. In 1996, we were all told the budget was in surplus by the then Labor government, only to find a $10.4 billion black hole that took considerable expertise and adultness to work through to put the budget back into surplus. That leads to the point that, under the construct that the Independents seem to be shackled to, they seem to overlook the consequences of some of the settings within this bill. One is the caretaker period. There is no opportunity for private consideration and discourse, recalibration, weighing up of options or even examining other proposals that might come forward, even from the member for Lyne. There is no chance to look at that or at whether there may be some opportunity for improvement, dare that be conceivable. Going back to 1996, the other point is that that is the only point in time when the Treasury's figures were available. If the member for Lyne and the member for Denison have such love and affection for the Treasury figures and point to them as such a credible and solid foundation for analysis, why then deny the parliament and all the members in this place the chance to have policy ideas costed against those figures? The member for Denison was quite right and very insightful: policy work is an ongoing process. Even in my portfolio area of small business, there is some policy that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet blue book said would boost productivity. I am happy to have that work outsourced so the government could actually do something about small business. That work is an ongoing process, but the member and others would rightly criticise the opposition if we were not using the most up to-date data for our costings. In the entire period between elections and the issuing of writs, we are beholden-we are hogtied-to the Treasurer's numbers, which in case after case have been illustrated as not as reliable and robust as they can be, because the Treasurer can influence them and, dare I say, adulterate them from what the Treasury may have provided and inject new assumptions. The only time there is purity in those numbers is during the election period. You would expect us to go back to those numbers to make sure they are up to date and as reliable as possible on the least adulterated data available, the Treasury figures, and that only happens during the caretaker period. There is an obligation under this bill that work gets released publicly. Please join up the dots. This is not that hard. It is PBO, pretty bleeding obvious, that what the government is trying to do here is nobble this process so we are all shackled and handcuffed to whatever the Treasurer expects to be the starting point for this analysis, and the only time we can get away from that and have pure Treasury figures as the starting point is during the election period, when there is no confidentiality. This is not that complicated. I urge you to look at those points. I take you at your word that those things matter. If they matter, I am finding it hard to work out why you are not actually connecting the facts that are in these bills with that concern and the reason that the opposition's amendments are so important. I take you at your word, but you are all backswing at the moment and no follow-through. The follow-through would see you back the opposition's amendments if you are genuinely concerned about those points. Nice backswing; we are looking for a bit of follow-through, gentlemen.",134
257,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS," I would like to address some of the questions that were asked in this debate by the member for Goldstein. The questions broadly fit into the following categories. The first one was in relation to other models of parliamentary budget office and the extent to which some of those models may be empowered to create their own forecasts. I can confirm that there are other parliamentary budget offices across the world that do have the capacity to generate their own forecasts, but that is not the model that the government has decided to go with. In fact, we are not going with that model because we happen to agree with the recommendations and, indeed, the content of that the report that was handed down by the joint select committee. I know that the member for North Sydney has made much of the fact that he says there is no finding or recommendation in the committee report. The committee report, at item 3.100, reads: Given the resource intensive nature of the work and the need to minimise the duplication of work produced elsewhere, the PBO should not be required to produce its own fiscal forecasts. Rather, it should provide analysis of the Government's fiscal forecasts, commenting on the assumptions, judgements and overall reliability of Government assessments. That is what was in the report and that is why the government has gone down the path it has. The report indicated that this is a very resource-intensive exercise. It might be worth putting on the record the fact that Treasury currently has 30 officers engaged in economic forecasting and a further 50 engaged in revenue forecasting, and Finance's budget group has around 250 officers, all of whom are engaged in preparing the budget forecasts. I think we can see that, apart from it being a waste of time to duplicate those functions in a new entity, it would be a waste of resources-a waste of money. That is why the government has not opted to go that way. But the most significant reason why we have not opted to create an alternative set of forecasts and assumptions in the PBO is comparability of the costings. I note that in today's Herald Ross Gittins made the very point that the government relies upon. He said: It is infinitely preferable that all parties' costings be prepared on the same basisrather than allowing oppositions to choose different economic forecasts or different budget parameters and costing conventions. Exactly. The second set of questions which the member for Goldstein asked was about the free flow of information. I can confirm that there will be unfettered and free access, subject to privacy provisions and the usual FOI requirements that operate outside the regime that is envisaged here. But that will occur, and that is contained within the bill.",135
258,Mr Hockey,BILLS,Where's that?,136
259,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,Section 64F. Mr Hockey interjecting,136
260,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,"It refers to a memorandum of understanding type arrangement, and that will put in place as the mechanism for the free flow of information. The third-and, I think, the most significant-set of questions raised by the member for Goldstein was about the confidentiality of costings during the caretaker period. These questions go to the nub of why the opposition, who unanimously supported these propositions in the committee process, have come forward now and opposed them. Why are they opposed to them? They are opposed to them because they know that under these arrangements their election commitments will be subjected to the scrutiny of the Parliamentary Budget Office. It is true that a matter which is publicly announced-and that is the key; what the legislation refers to is 'publicly announced'",136
261,Unknown,BILLS,Opposition members interjecting,136
262,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,"The opposition has two years and 11 months of the parliamentary term to do the hard yards on policy. If the opposition cannot do the hard yards on policy throughout the two years and 11 months and instead have to rely upon the possibility of putting in election costings during the election campaign, it shows just how lazy the current opposition is. Let us call this what it is, because this all about one thing, and it is a very simple proposition: the coalition, now that they have stumbled across the fact that they have the huge challenge of a $70 billion black hole, have discovered that they need to construct an alibi so that they can avoid being held to account for the fiscal atrocities that they are about to commit. We know that these fiscal atrocities are going to be grievous. There is a $70 black hole, and they know how difficult a job that is. If casting aspersions, denying the importance of this reform and challenging the credibility of the PBO is what they need to do to avoid any scrutiny when it comes to the next election, that is exactly what they will do. They will try to talk down this body, because to do that is to deny- (Time expired)",136
263,Mr WILKIE,BILLS," I am deeply troubled by the lingering accusation in this place that the Treasury is politicised. I applaud some members of the opposition, who have trod around this issue much more carefully than some of their colleagues, but as it is at the moment the member for North Sydney has refused to withdraw and apologise for the opposition's attack on Treasury through the claim that it is politicised, and the member for Mackellar, by refusing to withdraw her comment, has not helped things at all. For the public record, so it is absolutely clear to everyone in this country, I ask the member for North Sydney: will you now withdraw and apologise for the opposition's attack on the Treasury and the claim that it is politicised?",136
264,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," I gave latitude to the member for Denison before, but I say now that this is the consideration in detail stage and that we should actually be addressing the amendments before us. Does he have is anything else he wants to add, or has he concluded?",136
265,Mr WILKIE,BILLS,"No-thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.",137
266,Mr ROBB,BILLS," The concerns of the member for Denison will be addressed if the amendments proposed by the member for North Sydney are adopted. The parliamentary secretary sought to answer some of the questions I asked, but in doing so he exposed the motivation of the government in the way in which they have interpreted the committee's recommendations. Mr Bradbury interjecting",137
267,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"The fact of the matter is that the only time that we see Treasury data in rawest form, so the member for Denison can be satisfied that we are working with Treasury data unadulterated, is when PEFO is released. PEFO is not released until 10 days after the issuing of the writs-is that correct? Mr Bradbury interjecting",137
268,Mr ROBB,BILLS,Right?,137
269,Mr Bradbury,BILLS,You're telling the story.,137
270,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"Yes, right. Let us say that we had obtained access 10 days into the caretaker period, and we wished to see whether the policy proposals that we had been preparing for three years",137
271,Mr Bradbury,BILLS,What have you got at the moment?,137
272,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"The reason your government is in such trouble is that you did not prepare any policy in three years-that is the reason. We would want to wait for PEFO, despite having prepared a raft of policy, so that we got the latest statistics on costings when we released our documents publicly. Let us say that the government released a policy in the second week of the campaign and that we wanted to prepare and release a variation on that; or that we were preparing to release something, but it was partly covered by the government's policy. If you wanted to assess the merits of the policy, you are telling me, Parliamentary Secretary, that, if we put it into the office, the detail of that would be automatically released. We would not have the opportunity to make a considered assessment of whether that was affordableMr Bradbury interjecting",137
273,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, do I have to put up with these cheap shots?",137
274,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The parliamentary secretary will stop interrupting.,137
275,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"The Treasurer has sent a boy its on a man's errand here-that is what we have found out tonight. Why doesn'the have the courage to come in here and answer these questions? The only way you are answering any questions is with the help of the advisers over there; you have no idea yourself, Parliamentary Secretary. Why isn't the Treasurer here to answer these accusations? This is a very important issue. An election swung on it last time, and now we are sitting here with the parliamentary secretary grinning over at his advisers to see if they will give him another piece of advice that he can come up to the box with. On the free flow of information, which the member for Lyne quite appropriately asked a question about, you have just confirmed, Parliamentary Secretary, that if the Parliamentary Budget Office is set up as you have described it and as it is embodied in the bill and if the office went confidentially they could get access to the assumptions, the variables and the modelling for such things as the education rebate and the carbon tax. I would be grateful if you could properly and directly answer the following questions. Would the Parliamentary Budget Office get private and confidential access to the modelling of such things as the education rebate and the carbon tax-not only to the outcomes but also to the hundreds of assumptions and to the way in which that model was written? Would it have the ability to get an assessment of what would happen if some of those variables were changed? If you are true to the broad statement you made before, you will answer yes to that. If you cannot answer yes to that, the member for Lyne and the member for Denison and every other person in this chamber should be deeply concerned about the motive, the veracity, the credibility and the integrity of circumstances this process. On two counts now-firstly, on the access to private information and, secondly, on the presentation of policies before an election in the caretaker periodyou have created great doubt. (Time expired)",137
276,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS, I think the parliamentary secretary really summed up the government's position. He said that other parliamentary budget offices have the capacity for independent analysis but the government has chosen not to have it with this.,138
277,Mr Bradbury,BILLS,I said some.,138
278,Mr Briggs,BILLS,Just the big ones!,138
279,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"Well, some. The big ones, like the Canadian budget office and the United States Congressional Budget Office. But that is okay, because now the Independents are about to support a lesser model, in the words of the parliamentary secretary. He said: 'Hang on, guys. We decidedMr Bradbury interjecting",138
280,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,You did that! I encourage you to get a copy of the Hansard. It was a telling admission after how many hours of debate? He has now accepted that the government,138
281,Mr Bradbury,BILLS,It was the committee.,138
282,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,And now he is blaming the committee! There can never be any difference of opinion between this chamber and a committee! That is impossible to countenance! Mr Bradbury interjecting,138
283,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"Keep digging, old china! Now we have a new rule for this chamber. This chamber is not allowed to disagree with a committee, even though the amendment immediately before the House was not a recommendation of the committee. This chamber is not allowed under any to disagree with a recommendation of a committee. So we are the echo chamber of a parliamentary committee. That is all it is. What most interested me in this debate is that, after admitting that this is a lesser parliamentary budget office than those of other countries, the parliamentary secretary then went on to say, 'Yes,' in answer to the member for Lyne, who has already made up his mind but who did ask a question aboutMr Billson interjecting",138
284,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"No, I do not think there is any change coming, mate. Sorry to let you down. I do not think he ever moves on these things. It was quite interesting when the member for Lyne asked the question about access to information from Treasury. The parliamentary secretary just retorted: 'Section 64F. Look at that. That is how you are going to get the information out of Treasury.' Now, I have read section 64F-I do not know if the member for Lyne has-and it says: The Parliamentary Budget Officer may make an arrangementThis is the subject of another of my amendments. It says the PBO may make an arrangement. Not 'will', not 'must', not 'shall', but 'may': in writing, with the Head … of a Commonwealth body … to obtain from the body information and documents relevant to the Parliamentary Budget Officer's functions. I am prepared to put my wallet on this table and make a bet with the member for Lyne. Here is 20 bucks, right here. I seek leave to table $20.",138
285,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for North Sydney would be aware that that is not a parliamentary thing to do.,139
286,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,I am seeking leave. Leave not granted.,139
287,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"I am prepared to put $20 on the table to have a bet with the member for Lyne that the only source of information this body will have out of the Treasury will be the Treasury forecast in the MYEFO or the budget. I bet that the MOU, if it should ever be agreed between the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Treasury, will never extend to getting any further information out of the Treasury other than that which is published. I am betting my money here because that is what this piece of legislation says. It says you can only use the budget numbers-that is, the Treasurer's numbersand should you require any further information you need to have an MOU, a memorandum of understanding, with the department from the PBO. What a laugh! Mr Oakeshott interjecting",139
288,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"I am sorry, but I understand the legislation. It is in here. It is going to come as a rude shock, but it is actually in the legislation and I look forward",139
289,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Order! The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. I indicate to members that it is extremely unseemly to be casting bets around in this chamber and I will ask that you desist from doing so.,139
290,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"I am happy not to have a bet. I am just using that line. Perhaps we can lay something more significant on the line, like the seat of the member for Lyne. Maybe we could lay his seat on the line and see whether this turns out to be the case.",139
291,Mr BILSON,BILLS," To reiterate a point the shadow Treasurer made, the saviour that the parliamentary secretary sought to offer was the prospect of an elusive MOU. We have established that we are handcuffed to the Treasurer's numbers. The only time we get a clear run at Treasury numbers is during the election period, when there is no confidentiality. I am grateful that it was not necessary for me to hand over the bill, but now we are relying on the provision that relates to the memorandum. I can just imagine a department secretary saying: 'Look, I've had this approach from the Parliamentary Budget Office. It's been so hollowed out by the parliament because the executive doesn't want it actually doing what parliamentary budget offices do in other jurisdictions, and now there's a memorandum of understanding.' Does anyoneparticularly the Independents-think for one minute that an MOU will trump the legislation of the parliament? Does anyone think that will happen? Does anyone think that the department-the Treasury officials-will sit there and say, 'Look, I know there's been this express wish of the parliament, as reflected in the legislation.' The parliamentary secretary has rolled out all of these spurious and incredibly unpersuasive arguments about why it is in the national interest to nobble the Parliamentary Budget Office before it even starts. Then Treasury officials say, 'Well, there is scope for us to enter into an MOU.' Do you think for one minute that that MOU will go anywhere further? Of course it will not. It may even be more restrictive than what the parliament said. It might even say: 'Now that you're nobbled to the Treasurer's numbers and PEFO, we don't even want you to be critical of those; that's under the MOU.' The MOU might say, 'You can't criticise any of the pre-election data or challenge any of the economic foundations in the forecasts, so, on the basis of the MOU, we will provide you with that material only so long as you are completely respectful and not in any way contradicting what the Treasury-or in this case the Treasurer-has had to say,' or the MOU might simply go down to: 'Would you like it on an Excel spreadsheet? Can we send it electronically? How quickly would you like it? If it happens to be late on a Friday night, is Monday okay?' Come on, Parliamentary Secretary! We know you are a lightweight in the Treasury portfolio, but do not tell the parliament or try to reassure the Independents that this completely empty, vacuous argument you put up has anything to do with the substantive issues that we are debating here. The MOU will add nothing to this debate. It risks actually constraining further the information that is available. If it goes to information at all, it will not touch on any the assumptions, any of the modelling or any of the various parameters that have been set and selected. It will not go to that; it will actually be more focused on the process of obtaining the already constrained information. The executive is hell-bent on making sure that only its view of the economic world and forecast ever sees the light of day. I go back to where this started, the PBOpretty bleeding obvious! They are trying to take the heart out of this, deny it to the Independents and deny it the respect that the Parliamentary Budget Officer deserves-and that is to satisfy himself or herself on what should be the basis of calculations that he or she is undertaking. That should be what is available here, and for the parliamentary secretary to come up and say, 'Hey, the MOU's the answer for everything,' is just utter, utter nonsense.",139
292,Mr ROBB,BILLS," I am just concerned that I get an answer to the last two questions that I put to the parliamentary secretary. I will reiterate. As I understand it, Parliamentary Secretary, you confirmed to the member for Lyne",140
293,Mr Oakeshott,BILLS,To the House.,140
294,Mr ROBB,BILLS,In response to the member for Lyne's question.,140
295,Mr Oakeshott,BILLS,Yes-to the House.,140
296,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"Either way, I am happy. You confirmed to the House in response to the member for Lyne's question that if the Parliamentary Budget Office as embodied in your bill wants to see, privately and confidentially, the modelling of the carbon tax, the education rebate or any other modelling for that matter-if it wants to see the assumptions that have been made, the variables that have been included, the code that has been written and the impact of changing certain assumptions on the of outcomes-then that is in fact embodied in this legislation. If that is true, that is a huge step forward. I would be grateful if you could confirm whether that is true or not. Secondly, I would be grateful if you could also confirm that, under this Parliamentary Budget Office as espoused by the government, if we as an opposition, in the third week of the caretaker period of the next legislation, present two competing proposals which we are looking to get costed so that we can makeMr Bradbury interjecting",140
297,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"You have your chance to answer the question; let me just put it first so that people can understand what I am getting at. Suppose that we in the third week of the caretaker period of the forthcoming campaign, from opposition, have two competing proposals to achieve a similar objective and we wish to have those costed so that we can find out which is the proposal which has most merit, which is economically the best, which one may be robust and which one may be less affected by changes in the economic environment. If we wish to have that analysis done, are you saying, Parliamentary Secretary, that this bill requires that material to be made public on both of those considerations before we have made a decision?",140
298,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS," I will address those two points. As I indicated earlier, in relation to the ability access information, proposed section 64F provides the mechanism through which a memorandum of understanding can be brought into effect, and that would provide sufficient opportunity for access to that information. In relation to the second question that the member for Goldstein has asked, on the provision of materials for costing during the caretaker period, I draw the member's attention to proposed section 64J of the bill, which provides the direction in relation to matters that might be brought forward for costing during the caretaker period. At proposed section 64J(2), the bill reads: An authorised member of a Parliamentary party may request the Parliamentary Budget Officer to prepare a costing of a publicly announced policy of the Parliamentary party. That, in effect, is no different to the way in which the Charter of Budget Honesty occurs in relation to the caretaker period.",141
299,Mr Hockey,BILLS,It is just a duplication of the Charter of Budget Honesty.,141
300,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,"I find that amusing because, for all of the time. I observed those within the Howard government, they held up the Charter of Budget Honesty as though it were some particular beacon for good governance. Mr Briggs interjecting",141
301,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Mayo will withdraw!,141
302,Mr Briggs,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I am a bit befuddled about what I am withdrawing but, whatever it is, I will withdraw.",141
303,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Thank you.,141
304,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,"I am equally as befuddled about this suggestion that, somehow, the opposition is now not holding up the Charter of Budget Honesty as some to beacon of good governance. The committee inquiry in its report did indicate that there were some deficiencies in the Charter of Budget Honesty Act, in particular, in relation to the uneven way in which those provisions treat governments and oppositions. The proposals contained within this bill are significant and they are a significant step forward that will assist oppositions. It is not often you see a government come forward and support a set of proposals that in fact do provide assistance to oppositions in carrying out their functions. In fact, when the coalition introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty, they were single-minded in their attempt to make it as difficult as possible for oppositions then and into the future. And, having now come into opposition, they have seen just how hard that is. I will not restate the debacle that was the $11 billion black hole, other than to make this point, and that is that the provisions that the member for Goldstein is referring to essentially represent the way in which the Charter of Budget Honesty currently operates. Collectively, the amendments that the opposition are bringing forward represent a very desperate attempt to weaken the Charter of Budget Honesty. In fact, I will conclude by making this point in relation to the confidentiality provisions to which the member for Goldstein is referring. Under the proposals that are being put forward in these amendments by the opposition, it would be possible for the opposition in the caretaker period to bring forward a set of policies that may be publicly announced, to have them costed but, in the event that their confidentiality provisions were allowed to prevail, then there would not be a requirement for the PBO to release those details. Under your proposals, that is what you have suggested. The other amendment that you are moving would suggestMr Hockey interjecting",141
305,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,"With great respect, this has been a wide-ranging debate and the question I have been asked does not go to this amendment either; it goes to the amendment to which I am referring. I make the point that, under the amendments that have been brought forward by the opposition, you could have a situation where they publicly announce a policy, they take it to the PBO, they do not like the answer that they get from the PBO, they go off to one of their accounting firms-one of their matesand they get alternative costings and then they shop around for the one they want. We do not want that. We want a comparable set of benchmarks and that is why we are proposing this system. (Time expired)",142
306,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," I know this is a more robust section, but we might all just lower the level of our voices.",142
307,Mr ROBB,BILLS," This has taken us about 2½ hours, but the parliamentary secretary has confirmed that the caretaker period under the proposal that is embodied in this government's Parliamentary Budget Office is absolutely no different to the situation we confronted at the last election and the election before that. We have a choice: we can use non-current Treasury data before the caretaker period or we can wait for PEFOPEFO is very important data-and get accurate assessments of alternative policies, some of which we have not yet made a decision on because it depends on what data the PEFO comes up with. Those will be used and abused by the government. This is a total stitch-up and you have confirmed it. You have confirmed today that the only thing this does is give us access to costings well ahead of an election. That is what you have confirmed.",142
308,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Can I just ask the member for Goldstein to make it clear that it is not me who is doing that. You were speaking through the chair.,142
309,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I apologise for that. The second thing is that we have heard great defences of Treasury here from the member for Denison, the member for Lyne and others, but both they and the parliamentary secretary have continued to cast imputations on me and the member for North Sydney. That is against standing orders. However, it is not against standing orders to cast imputations against others other than members. Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting",142

312,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"Now that we have confirmed finally that nothing has changed and that, as far as the caretaker period is concerned, this is a total stitch-up, why are we wasting our time on this bill in this place? If you are going to use and abuse the office of government to misrepresent the findings of a committee, why are we wasting our time here when we will end up in the same dogfight again next time? Why not have a process where we can get rid of the calculations at a point of contention and then we can debate the merit of policy during the campaign. No, you are not prepared to do that. You just want to get down in the gutter again at the next election and spend 33 days casting aspersions on our ability to make assessments of the costings, when we would like to have an independent office which makes its own judgment of your policies and our policies so that we can take this costing process out of the public arena and we can debate policy.

315,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The member for Goldstein has the call.,143
316,Mr ROBB,BILLS,I might have the call but I am having trouble hearing myself because of the Leader of the House. A government member: You're not missing much!,143

319,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"I will forget 'you'. The parliamentary secretary very craftily slipped around the second issue.

324,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"The member for Goldstein will resume his seat for a moment. I indicate that there has been a great deal of interjection, including interjections by members on their own speakers. The debate has been robust and I have allowed it to run but it is now my feeling that it is getting out of hand. The member for Goldstein will not respond to other conversations in the room. Those having other conversations will take them outside. The member for Goldstein has the call but his time is up. Is the member for Goldstein seeking the call a second time?",143
325,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"I am. (extension of time granted) Thank you for that privilege. The second point I would like to raise is the fact that I asked, quite specifically and directly, of the parliamentary secretary whether the Parliamentary Budget Office would have access to the variables and the modelling and the opportunity to change assumptions in that modelling and assess the outcome of that modelling-and any other modelling, for that matter. In a very obtuse way he said that the Parliamentary Budget Office could seek to strike a memorandum of understanding. as he The question I have to the parliamentary secretary is: does that mean that if a particular department-pick any one of 30feels, on a day that they are requested by the Parliamentary Budget Office, that they do not want the department or the modelling that they have used and developed to be put under any scrutiny, they can just refuse to agree to a memorandum of understanding which gives the Parliamentary Budget Office that sort of access? If that is the case this is like the FOI process, where you are denied anything of any consequence.",143
326,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS," Madam Deputy Speaker, I have sought the call because the member for Grayndler came in and told the member at the table not to answer any questions. It is just part of the ongoing transparency of the government, I suppose! And the Independents are voting for it, I might add, but so be it. If we are using the filibuster I will speak on this in summary",144
327,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"The member for North Sydney, I do not think anything.",144
328,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"on behalf of the opposition, because the government are not going to answer any further questions at the instruction of the member for Grayndler. First, the parliamentary secretary has now admitted that this is a lesser model than that which is applying in other countries. He would say that because, as he failed to note, the Parliamentary Library's pre-election policy unit identified that the PBO 'should include the provision of the kinds of assistance offered by the PBO such as costing and economic modelling'. So the Parliamentary Library says the PBO should be able to do its own independent modelling. And the Clerk of the House of Representatives, in the submission to the committee that the member for Lyne boasts of being a part of, says: ... discussion may be more comprehensive if Members had access to some additional quantitative analysis on how government projections had been arrived at and their sensitivity to assumptions. That is the point the member for Goldstein raised. We now know that the government's justification for having the Treasurer and the minister for finance as the sole contributors of economic data, economic modelling and fiscal data to the PBO is cost. That is what he said before. This is a government that is now concerned about cost. After four years it has suddenly grown concerned about cost. What a revelation! Forget the billions of dollars that were handed out, the $900 cheques, now is the time to draw a line: 'We don't want it to go from $6 million to $7 million a year; we are going to be prudent as a government you think and we are going to hold back.'",144
329,Mr Briggs,BILLS,Return to surplus!,144
330,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,"This will be the path to surplus! My second point, in summary, is that the parliamentary secretary has admitted that now there will be no additional access to information out of the Treasury or the department of finance or any other department without a memorandum of understanding. It will be a memorandum of understanding that this Parliamentary Budget Office is going to have signed with 30 different departments by the next electionyeah, right! They are going to have unfettered access under those MOUs, but that is the subject of another of my amendments. The first of my amendments seeks, after all these hours of debate, to prove the case that this government, in partnership with the Independents, is just not serious about having a fully independent parliamentary budget office. By the words of the parliamentary secretary and the admissions in the very drafting of this bill, it is now clear that the government itself, in partnership with the Independents, is de-fanging the Parliamentary Budget Office. In the words of the parliamentary secretary himself: 'It is a lesser parliamentary budget office than that which exists in some other jurisdictions.' Question put: That the amendment (Mr Hockey's) be agreed to. The House divided.

331,Mr COULTON,PAIRS," The Clean Energy Bill 2011 and related bills have no mandate. These bills will send Australian jobs offshore. These bills will have no global or local environmental benefit. This carbon tax is the largest single change to the Australian economy that we have seen in a lifetime. This legislation will have a devastating effect on Australian citizens and Australian business, particularly small business. In my electorate, these bills will put small business and farmers at a disadvantage. The tax will severely impact on the mining industry and on agriculture. We have heard from the member for New England of the benefits in the Carbon Farming Initiative. This is a Trojan Horse. The Carbon Farming Initiative will not be of benefit to farmers in regional Australia. The Carbon Farming Initiative will not help the productivity of agriculture in regional Australia. The Carbon Farming Initiative will not be accepted by mainstream farmers. Farmers in Australia and farmers in my electorate are the most efficient, the most energy conscious of anywhere in the world. Farmers in Australia produce more tonnes of grain and fibre per litre of fuel and megalitre of water than anywhere in the world. To hamper them with this tax that is going to impact on their inputs is going to place them at a disadvantage to their trading partners and to their competitors who are trading into our markets. This legislation is based on a false ideology. This legislation is working on the conscience of Australians. Australians do 2011 want to help the environment. Australians do care about the future of their children and their grandchildren. These bills will not have any beneficial effect on the environment but they will hamper our children and our grandchildren in their ability to be competitive with the rest of the world. If this country sinks into financial oblivion because of the impost placed by this tax, our country, our children and our grandchildren will not be in a position to undertake any environmental improvements because of the financial impost. They will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world, and we do not need to lead the world in this charge. (Time expired)",146
332,Ms MARINO,PAIRS," The Labor-Greens proposal for an economy-wide tax on carbon is the wrong answer to the question of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Through the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and associated bills, the government is imposing a unilateral tax and costs on Australia's industries, businesses, families, local governments, hospitals, schools, community groups and sporting organisations. No-one will be exempt. It will cost Australians $9 billion the first year alone. At the same time as the US is facing a double-dip recession and Europe is staring down the barrel of debt default, this is beyond irresponsible. This just sheer, unmitigated economic stupidity. The Productivity Commission has stated that this will be the only economy-wide carbon tax in the world-described by US Republican congressman on climate change, Jim Sensenbrenner, as 'unilateral economic disarmament'. This is an indictment. Australians have a great deal of common sense, and common sense tells us that we will all pay more under this carbon tax. Even Ross Garnaut has said that ultimately householders will pay. No matter what the compensation is, common sense tells us that we will pay more-pensioners, self-funded retirees and those who struggle to make ends meet. Common sense also tells us that taxing Australian business and industry in Australia and not in other countries will drive industry and jobs offshore. In fact, it is already happening, as businesses factor the carbon risk into their forward planning. Australians understand that, while both the Liberal and Labor parties in Australia committed to a five per cent reduction in our country's emissions from year 2000 levels, the major global emitters will actually increase their emissions up to fivefold over the next decades. World CO2 emissions are projected to rise by about 50 per cent-from 30 billion tonnes in 2010 to 45 billion tonnes in 2020-and nearly half of that increase will occur in one country. Most Australians are already reducing their own emissions to help meet our five per cent reduction target. Individuals, families, businesses, industries and even those vilified by the Labor government as 'big polluters' have cut or are cutting their emissions. These are the same companies employing hundreds of thousands of Australians and are the major in contributors to regional, state and national economies, often underpinning much of regional Australia. Their combined efforts to date have seen Australia's emissions intensity is decrease by over 44 per cent since 1990. Australian industries and families have become more energy efficient and less carbon intensive without a carbon tax-a tax that is specifically designed to make their lives more difficult and costly. Australians are addressing climate change. This is why Australia is one of the few countries in the world to meet its emissions reduction obligations under the Kyoto protocol. As a result, Australians do know that the Gillard government's unilateral, cascading tax on their homes, families and businesses is not the answer. In stark contrast, the coalition policy provides incentives to further reduce carbon pollution by targeting direct action, not through a Labor policy that raises the cost of living for families, increases costs for small business and industry and decreases our international competitiveness. Even using the government's own figures, three million Australian households will be are worse off. We know that over 400,000 families in Western Australia alone will miss out on any form of assistance. And the impact on regional Australia will be disproportionally high, given the impact that transport costs will have. And what for? Australian emissions will not fall under this tax. The government's own modelling states that their new carbon tax will not reduce emissions in Australia-in fact, they will 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes. So here we have a Labor government plan to raise costs for families and businesses through a tax that will not reduce Australia's total emissions and makes a negligible impact on world emissions. The government's own adviser and Climate Change Commissioner, Professor Tim Flannery, said: If the world as a whole cut all emissions tomorrow the average temperature of the planet not going to drop in several hundred years, perhaps as much as a thousand years. And, as we know, emissions will in fact increase. The Labor government carbon tax plan only works if billions of dollars are spent on purchasing overseas emissions reductions. Many of these reductions will be brought from in countries with higher total emissions than Australia. According to Treasury, well over half will come from the former Soviet Union and from 'other Asia'. Australians will be paying $57 billion, not to reduce emissions in Australia but to reduce emissions in other countries which may not be paying one cent to reduce their own emissions and may not even have the capacity to measure emissions or emissions reductions. So here we have a Labor government plan to raise costs to families and businesses through a tax that will not reduce Australia's total emissions and the government's own Climate Commissioner, Professor Tim Flannery, saying that it may perhaps take a thousand years to make a difference. The carbon tax will cost jobs across Australia, including in my electorate of Forrest. Australian Trade and Industry Alliance data reveals that nine out of 10 manufacturing jobs are with companies that will face the full impact of the carbon tax and that less than nine per cent of Australia's more than one million manufacturing workers are employed by firms that will have any compensation from the Labor government. Some of these companies are in my electorate. Millennium Inorganic Chemicals Ltd is one of only two Australian titanium dioxide pigment producers. Together with the Tiwest Pty Ltd joint venture, which is also in Western Australia, they produce five per cent of the world's titanium dioxide. I ask members to note that is Australia produces 20 per cent of the world's titanium dioxide feedstock but only five per cent of the processed product. The remainder is mined here but sent overseas for processing. According to the submission Millennium and Tiwest jointly made to the government on this legislation, this carbon price impact on titanium dioxide production, even with initial 66 per cent assistance, will very likely lead to carbon leakage with a net increase in global CO2 emissions. They said there was a real risk that potential expansions would be deferred or cancelled. In particular, Tiwest is considering an expansion that would likely be deferred or ultimately cancelled. The loss of this $150 million expansion would come at the cost of around 400 construction jobs and additional operational staff. Like many other trade exposed industries, Millennium Inorganic Chemicals needs to be supported, because this government's carbon tax creates an even more unfair playing field for Australian Change exporters. This Labor government could increase their assistance to this industry to the 94.5 per cent level or provide a separate special assistance package or, the best solution of all, scrap its plans for a carbon tax that will drive Australian jobs and industry offshore. Then Millennium could just get on with the job of employing people and generating export dollars for our nation. Collie is the industrial hub of my seat of Forrest, and it faces a major threat from Labor's carbon tax. Collie has three power stations-Muja, Collie and Bluewaterswith total annual emissions of 9.8 million tonnes of CO2. However, the government is refusing to compensate any of these power stations for the cost of their carbon tax They will be facing a cost of $225 million. These costs will have to be passed on to Western Australian power users. There will also be businesses which cannot pass costs on and there are nearly half a million families in WA who will receive no assistance at all. Some of those businesses and families live in Collie and work in and with the power stations. There is a broader concern for Collie. The Labor government plans to change Australia's electricity base to just 10 per coal generation by 2050-down from 80 per cent now-this is the government's plan-it is in their document. As well, this tax devalues every existing coal fired power generation asset-an issue for finance or refinance. It also impacts on new and proposed businesses, such as the proposed Perdaman coal to urea plant which will face a residual tax liability of $25 million a year. Worsley Alumina is one of the largest and most efficient alumina refineries in the world. It produces over $1 billion worth of exports every year, and directly employs over 1,500 workers. This is about to rise with the completion of a multibillion dollar expansion. Australian alumina production is part of a highly competitive global market, and making production more expensive here will risk the next alumina project or expansion. Worsley is a part of the Australian Greenhouse Gas Challenge, and has committed to reducing its emissions for each tonne of alumina produced. Over the last five years Worsley has reduced its emissions intensity by 6.25 per cent. This has been achieved without a carbon tax. As a reward for this the government is planning to tax Worsley millions of dollars every year. Cement is a critical commodity for the Australian building industry, for community development and for the our economy, in the south-west particularly. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development says that 'after water, concrete is the most consumed material on earth-cement is the glue that holds it together'. In my electorate John Hovey runs Australind Premix, and his business is now at the mercy of this government's carbon tax. John has to work out whether he has a carbon tax liability, what that liability might be, and what that means for his business-but of course he will have to pay to find out. And right now cent neither he nor his accountant can answer those questions. He, like thousands of others, has no direct measure of his current emissions, so he has to work out if his businesses emit more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Even if he falls under the 25,000 tonne limit he will, like many others, still be hit by the carbon tax. A major part of his business is transport-all of his inputs have to be transported to him, and then the products transported to his customers. He is also a high user of electricity. All this means that John will be paying considerably more to run his business with no compensation, and he will probably have to absorb the additional cost. At a time of economic uncertainty the government has imposed even more uncertainty on John Hovey, his workers and his business. John is another business owner who has taken environmental responsibility and invested in new low-emissions technologies. His new trucks meet the European standards, but that is ignored by the government. They are in limbo with this tax-he has no clear idea of where his business stands and he is going to have bureaucrats crawling all over his business for years and years. He, like every other business, just wants to get on with what he does best: having a go, hard work, investing his own money, employing local people and offering service and products to people in the south-west. In agriculture, some of the biggest input costs are fertiliser, feed and electricity-all affected by the carbon tax. We know about dairy farmers, apple orchards, abattoirs, butchers. Australian farmers are at the frontline in the delivery of environmental outcomes-they have collectively spent $3 billion on natural resource management on their properties, and reduced emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 to 2006-that is 94.3 per cent of farmers actively undertaking NRM. Two million Australian small businesses will face higher input costs and receive no direct support, including the nearly 14,500 small businesses in the south-west. The statement that only 400 businesses will be affected by the carbon tax is a complete fabrication. The transport costs will impact very seriously on regional areas. We know that at least 56 per cent of small businesses may pass on the carbon cost to consumers but, because of restrictions and competition, 44 per cent will have no choice but to pay the costs themselves. This is a real issue in regional areas and right around Australia. One in three small businesses surveyed expect to have to sack staff as a result of this Labor policy. This policy is expected to cost jobs; common sense again tells us so. We do know about the transport costs; it will apply to transport from 2014. Regional people will feel these costs. It will have a greater impact. In 2007 Australian trucks transported 277 million tonnes of food and animals around the country, and the carbon tax is designed to add costs to every tonne. In its analysis of Australia's climate policy, the Wall Street Journal concluded that the Labor-Greens proposal was as much about social engineering as environmental stewardship. It noted that 'this is in part a scheme to redistribute income from energy users to Labor voters'. The Labor government's proposal is to raise the cost of living of every Australian who uses energy and the cost of doing business for millions of Australian businesses, for the net result of a small increase in Australian emissions and a massive increase in world emissions. I would counsel the House to remember the very wise words of Winston Churchill, who said that for 'a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket trying to lift himself up by the handle'. That is what we see with this Labor government carbon tax. As I said at the beginning of my speech today, common sense tells Australians that, irrespective of what they are offered, they will all pay.",147
333,Ms ROWLAND,PAIRS," I would like to begin by sharing a letter I received earlier this year from a group of primary school students in my electorate: the Vardy's Road year 4 reading group. It reads: Dear Ms Rowland We are worried about our future. We want you to help our country to reduce greenhouse gas production. Climate scientists tell us that we only have ten years to turn things around. If we don't, by the time we are adults in 2020, it will be too late. We will still be alive when your life is over. We want to have a good life like you have had. We don't want to live in a mess. On 3 May I had the pleasure of meeting with and spending time with these young students. These young people, the future leaders of this country and the future mums and dads of Australia, wanted to know what I am doing to address their concerns. I told these young people that I am committed to taking action to safeguard our environment from the effects of climate change, to sustain our society, to support our economy and to create the jobs of the future. I could tell children that I am a member of a government that cares about their future; that I believe climate change is real, that human activity contributes to it and that it has a detrimental effect on our environment, which will only get worse if we do not take action now; and that I am committed to doing something about it, something that is economically responsible as well as environmentally sound, that recognises that the most vulnerable in our society need a helping hand and that creates and grows jobs in the future. The biggest polluters in our economy will now pay to pollute, something that today they do for free. The cost of that pollution is borne by the environment and in turn by each of us. I speak today in support of the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and related bills. I do so as a proud member of this government, as a local member and as a mother-to-be. Everything has a cause and effect. Everyone in this place knows that if we drive our car recklessly we endanger society and we should pay a price for it. If we rely on obtaining energy by burning irreplaceable fuel and the consequences threaten the safety of our society then surely those doing the polluting should pay a price for it also. It is the right thing to do for this country both environmentally and economically. Western Sydney is already embracing a clean energy future that recognises the environmental and economic realities. You can see it in action. The TAFE New South Wales Western Sydney Institute's GreenSkills Hub in Quakers Hill is revolutionising the way our tradespeople are being trained. Last year I was honoured to officially open the GreenSkills Hub, which was later visited by the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency to see how the green jobs of the future are being created in the fastest-growing region of Sydney. The these Western Sydney GreenSkills Hub was funded under this government's Training Infrastructure Investment for Tomorrow initiative. It is a living laboratory designed to model sustainable practices and provide innovative training in subject areas that include green electrical engineering, plumbing, refrigeration and information technology. For anyone in this place who wants to see how the new green-collar jobs are being created under this government, I strongly recommend a visit to the Quakers Hill GreenSkills Hub. It is the first vocational education and training facility of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere. The young apprentices there are literally the first of their kind to become qualified in the green skills trade. Speaking of young people and jobs of the future, I also have a special obligation to support this legislation because of the reality that exists in my electorate of Greenway. I often refer to our region in west and north-west Sydney as Australia's nursery and that is because in nearly every age category the electorate of Greenway ranks as one of the youngest in Australia. As an example, 8.2 per cent of Greenway's population is aged zero to five years old, making it the second youngest electorate in the entire country. There is a particular demographic in our society which occupies the time and energy of many a marketing consultant or public office holder-young people who feel disenfranchised from the policy and legislative process that impacts on them and their future and indeed the non-franchised young people who have not yet reached voting age. We spend hours in this place making decisions that affect these young people. Any public office holder worth their salt struggles to find mechanisms to communicate and engage with them. The problem is that by and large these young people do not have the loudest voices on the airwaves or the opinion pages of the newspapers. As I said in my first speech in this recognise my obligations to these young people. There are occasions when I spend more time with them, their parents and their teachers than any other single group in my electorate. That is why I know that the Clean Energy Future package encapsulated in these bills, which is about transformational change for a positive future, is what these young people, their parents and their families are focused on. We do not have to look far outside our region to see why we must act on climate change. Countries in our region stand to be hurt the most by changes to our climate. Indeed, Pacific countries such as Kiribati are already being impacted by rising sea levels brought on by climate change. As documented by the World Wildlife Fund: The people of Funafti in Tuvalu and on Kiribati island are lobbying to find new homes: salt intrusion has made groundwater undrinkable and these islands are suffering increasing impacts from hurricanes and heavy seas. In the village Saoluafata in Samoa, villagers have noticed that their coastline has retreated by as much as 50 metres in the last decade. Many of these people have had to move further inland as a result. Not only in the Pacific are nations being adversely affected by man-made climate change but Asia's low-lying nations are subjected to sea level rise also. The impact of climate change in these parts is welldocumented, including as reported by the Sydney Morning Herald in 2010: The low-lying delta region that makes up much of Bangladesh and the neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal are acutely vulnerable to climate change. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts rising sea levels will devour 17 per cent of Bangladesh by 2050, displacing at least 20 million people. … … … The Bangladesh non-governmental organisation place, I Coastal Watch says an average of 11 Bangladeshis are losing their homes to rising waters every hour. These regional examples demonstrate that not only is it in our domestic interest to tackle climate change but it is also in our national interest, for Australia holds itself out as the leading nation in the Pacific region. We must take the leading diplomatic steps to tackle climate change. These bills will reinstate our authority on this issue and reflect our leading economic, environmental and social status in the Asia-Pacific. The Australian economy even in these challenging global conditions is diverse and dynamic. Sixty years ago it would have been inconceivable that the agricultural sector, for example, would shrink to where it is today as a proportion of GDP-a topic that rightly continues to occupy many debates in this water place. Conversely, nobody would have predicted even 20 years ago what the ICT sector in Australia would look like today, of how it would become the primary driver of GDP growth in our economy and the way in which it would spawn new markets we had not even dreamt of. As has been noted time and again, the single most indicative feature of a healthy economy is change. If you are not driving it, if you are not continually transforming it, you are as good as standing still. It is this fact that the opponents of change-the opponents of transformational public policy-have sought to destroy since time immemorial. And of course we have seen scare campaigns on environmental and economic challenges before in Australia. We have seen how they have been exposed as baseless. Twenty years ago a Labor government introduced a superannuation guarantee. At that time, those who were sitting opposite made a number of predictions about the supposed damage, with no corresponding benefits, that universal superannuation would wreak on Australian workers in the economy. By revisiting some of the uninformed claims made on superannuation, we can draw some revealing comparisons with the current carbon pricing debate.",150
334,Mr Secker,PAIRS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask that you bring the member back to what we are debating. What she is talking about now has absolutely nothing to do with this legislation at all. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Vamvakinou): The member for Greenway is speaking to the bills and she may continue her speech.",153
335,Ms ROWLAND,PAIRS,"Thank you. By revisiting some of the uninformed claims made on superannuation, we can draw some revealing comparisons",153
336,Mr Secker,PAIRS,"How can you possibly say that this has anything to do with the carbon legislation? Superannuation has nothing whatsoever to do with it, and I ask you to bring her back to the legislation.",153
337,Mr Clare,PAIRS,"Further to the point of order, this is a debate about a major piece of reform legislation in this parliament, and what the member is doing in this debate is making the points that scare campaigns now, like scare campaigns in the past, have been proved false and how important it is for us as legislators to look past those scare campaigns to the best interests of the people of Australia. That is what this member is doing in her contribution, and I ask you to rule that it is in order.",153
338,Mr Baldwin,PAIRS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On the first point of order, the point of order raised by the minister is absolutely ridiculous and irrelevant. The second point of order is that the speaker is not addressing the bill. She is not referring to the legislation about the carbon tax and that planned imposition; she is talking about superannuation. There is nowhere in the 19 bills of the carbon tax legislation that specifically addresses superannuation, so I ask you to bring her back to the bills before the House.",153
339,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I see that there is a determination here this evening to play ping-pong with the debate.,153
340,Mr Baldwin,PAIRS,"As members are requested not to reflect on the chair, I think it is also incumbent on those occupying the chair of (Ms Speaker. This is not about playing pingpong; this is about, to quote the Speaker during question time last week, making sure the standing orders are upheld.",153
341,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for Greenway is within order. I will ask the member for Greenway to continue with her speech.,153
342,Ms ROWLAND,PAIRS,"Thank you. It is therefore no wonder that the forward-looking nature of the superannuation industry reflects an endorsement of these bills. Richard Mattison, the CEO of Trucost",153
343,Mr Baldwin,PAIRS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Again, this member is going into issues such as superannuation. The only effect these bills may have on superannuation is a negative effect. I ask you to bring her back to the bills before the House.",153
344,Mr Clare,PAIRS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, you have ruled on this matter and the member is now canvassing your ruling. Your ruling was correct at first instance, and I ask that the member be deemed in order.",154
345,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for Greenway has the call.,154
346,Ms ROWLAND,PAIRS,"As Richard Mattison, the CEO of Trucost has said: Superannuation investment managers can manage carbon risk by integrating carbon metrics into investment processes and identifying opportunities from companies that are better positioned for a low-carbon economy Similarly, Fiona Reynolds, the CEO of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, said that 'moving to a carbon price reduces investment uncertainty and means super funds can look to manage climate change without speculation on the price of carbon pollution'. She added that the three year transition period would be enough time for funds to prepare for market based pricing of emissions. And the Industry Super Network has welcomed this government's announcement of the introduction of a price on carbon. We ask ourselves to what lengths our opponents would go to stoke a fear campaign today. The answer is we need to look no further than the concoction of the Premier of New South Wales and the Leader of the Opposition, a story that made the mass media and is now the subject of media scrutiny: how New South Wales Treasury modelling showing train fares would rise by only 0.12 per cent was replaced with a completely made up story from the premier that public transport fares would increase by up to 3.6 per cent under a carbon price. These baseless scare campaigns have not just been confined to big economic challenges; they also occurred with previous environmental challenges such as the chlorofluorocarbon debate in the 1980s. As history proved, the world acted on CFCs and prevented further environmental damage. The sky did not fall in as those with vested interests promised it would. Businesses and the scientific community innovated and developed real alternatives to CFC just as they will with high-carbon-emitting practices. The reality is that both sides of this House have policy which purport to seek the same carbon emission reductions in the same time frame, yet time and again speakers opposite in this debate have shown how they refuse to believe those reductions will have any positive environmental impact. As Robert F Kennedy Jr so eloquently stated in his book, Crimes Against Nature: We protect nature not for sake of the trees and the fishes and the birds, but because it is the infrastructure of our communities. If we want to provide our children with the same opportunities for dignity and enrichment as those our parents gave us, we've got to start by protecting the air, water, wildlife, and landscape that connect us to our national values and character. I came into this place to improve the community I represent, and I plan to do this. As an expectant mother I want my child to grow up in a world where they can see all the beautiful things it has to offer, a world where they can breathe clean air, live a healthy and happy life, and enjoy the benefits of a strong and dynamic economy. I commend the bills to the House, for my child and for the future of this country.",154
347,Mr SECKER,PAIRS," I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and associated legislation. From the start I want to point out to the chamber that I do actually understand the theory of greenhouse emissions. I do understand why some scientists say that an overexpansion of CO2 could possibly lead to an increase in temperatures around the world. I also understand climate change. I have been a farmer all my life. I rely on the climate. I rely on the weather. I understand it probably as well as anyone in this chamber because my livelihood depended on understanding the climate and what likelihood we would have of rain, heat, dry conditions, drought and so on. That has been part of my life and without it I would not have been as good a farmer as I was-my son now runs the farm. I understand the theories. I understand we have had climate change. We have had climate change for centuries and I understand when people, especially from the other side, get up and say, 'We should listen to the scientists.' I believe in listening to the scientists. You do not always have to accept what they say, but I believe in listening to the scientists. But I can say to this chamber there is not one scientist in the world that will say that this these 19 pieces of legislation will have any effect on the climate. There is not one scientist in the world that would say that these bills will have any effect on the climate. Let's just get it right from the start. If we are going to accept the views of scientists then we should accept the view that all scientists in the world would say that this would have no effect on climate. In the short time that I have I will try to in all the views expressed to me by many of my constituents on this government's carbon tax. Firstly, I want to highlight just one of the very bad parts of this legislation. I do not have nearly enough time to tell the House about all the ramifications of this tax but I will touch on some parts I feel are important. After the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister, then set about introducing a tax that would drive up the cost of living, hurt business and do nothing to improve the environment. This is a $9 billion a year new tax. It will increase electricity bills by 10 per cent in the first year alone, hike gas bills by nine per cent in the first year, equate to higher marginal tax rates for lowand middle-income earners and hit the budget bottom line by $4.3 billion to the negative. It is important to remember the government has not provided updated modelling since the initial price was set at $23 a tonne, so even as we are debating this motion we have not got the updated modelling because the truth about the government's modelling, which it has used to estimate how much the carbon tax will cost families, pensioners and businesses, is that it uses a price of $20 per tonne not $23 a tonne which is what they are setting the price at. Here we are expected to debate something when we do not have the correct modelling. There is a 15 percent discrepancy between the modelling and the actual price. This carbon tax is deeply flawed from the very beginning. So with the price starting at $23 a tonne and costs estimated on only $20 a tonne it is also important to understand this government's carbon price is not fixed after three years. The government's own forecast is that the price will rise to $29 per tonne, not the $20 of the modelling, in 2016 then $37 fit per tonne in 2020 and over $350 per tonne in 2050. Has this government done any calculations on what these prices will do to the cost of living? Those figures would be hard to look at, that is for sure. There is the Greens influence, this is a Labor-Greens government, and Greens senators have already expressed their views on the price, Senator Bob Brown would like to see $40 per tonne and Senator Hanson Young has canvassed a price of $100 a tonne. Even the government's own calculations talk about $350 per tonne in 2050-not $23, nearly 15 times greater. I spend a fair portion of my time travelling around to businesses in my electorate to listen to their concerns and offer assistance where possible. During my travels this year I have heard one overarching theme: this government's carbon tax will cause unnecessary pain and force many businesses to close their doors. A well-established transport business owner in Murray Bridge with nine employees told me that he will close his doors due to the carbon tax. The added costs to transport will be enormous. A carbon tax will be applied to all trucks from 1 July 2014. This will increase costs significantly for transport companies. On top of that the fuel tax credit will be reduced from 1 July 2012 and this will ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers as the industry will be forced to pass costs on. An Access Economics report highlighted the potential loss of 126,000 regional jobs under an earlier version of Labor's scheme. Gommers Transport in my electorate estimate Labor's carbon tax will cost their businesses an extra $60,000 a year in fuel alone. That is about $6,000 extra per truck. Gommers employ just under 30 people and transport is just one extra cost. They believe that the flow-on costs will be massive, and I hear stories similar to Gommers all over Barker. Adelaide Mushrooms, Australia's largest mushroom producer, are another well established business that believes this government's carbon tax will seriously hurt their business. Initial modelling by Adelaide Mushrooms predicts their costs would increase by $680,700. The price of mushrooms will rise from 18c a kilo to 23c, their gas bill will increase by 10 per cent in 2012, their water bill by 26.3 per cent and freight and packaging both by three per cent. The company will be hit by 5.5 per cent increase to wages, work cover, super and payroll tax-all those increases to a business that has already invested heavily in direct action by planting trees and installing energy-efficient generators. Australia's 750,000 small businesses will receive no direct compensation; there most certainly will be a damaging flow-on effect from this alone. The Prime Minister has tried dismally to offer support to emissionsintensive and trade-exposed industries. BlueScope Steel chairman, Graham Kraehe, had it right when he said Labor's proposed compensation deal is like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound. All this pain to businesses and increases to cost of living and the government's own modelling shows emissions will not decrease in Australia. In fact emissions will increase in the eight years from 2012 to 2020, from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes. These are the government's own figures. $3.5 billion in carbon tax revenue will be spent buying carbon credits from overseas. This is a scheme which the Australian Crime Commission has highlighted has involved $5 billion in fraud already. Farming has not been spared either, and I have a large farming constituency. ABARES, Australia's premier agricultural sector impact group, said that broadacre incomes will slump by two per cent in 2011 and be down by up to 14 per cent by 2015. That is a slug of $1,100 initially, increasing up to $8,900 over four years. So the idea that farmers will not bear any of the cost is wrong, and of course it will be made worse when the tax on diesel comes in two years time, because every farmer knows they have to transport goods for production. Beef farmers will be slugged $1,200 initially, increasing to $6,700 by 2015. Sheep farmers could expect $800 initially, rising to $4,800 by 2015. Crop farmers could expect an initial $1,400 slug, rising to $9,700 by 2015, and diary farmers would face $1,800 in 2011, rising to $8,800, or up to $10,400, by 2015. I suspect this government only delayed the tax on diesel by two years because they knew the cost to consumers would go through the whole system. But it will affect farmers; it is only deferred for two years. The idea that farmers will not be worse off is quite wrong. I attended a public meeting in Naracoorte in the south-east of my electorate earlier this year. It was organised by one of my constituents and I was a guest. The forum was advertised widely in the community and there was a great turnout. Even though the forum was open to everyone-and I did not organise it-the attendees were unanimously against this government's carbon tax. I would like to read out just a couple of comments I have received from my constituents. Margaret from the south-east said: My husband and I are quite worried about the new Carbon Tax. We are pensioners but only own a diesel powered automobile. I have gone on the Internet to find the actual document that Ms Gillard will introduce but I can't find it. We to know how her scheme will hurt us. We can see no benefits for the atmosphere or the Australian people. Jan from the Riverland wrote to me and said: I am very concerned about the Gillard carbon tax. I believe that it will not benefit any individual, nor the environment, but it will cost our country dearly by driving more industry offshore, simply by the fact that it is going to make Australia even less competitive in the World market. I urge you please to oppose this foolhardy action proposed by the government and furthermore stop their socialist agenda. Her words. If you have a look around the rest of the world, there is no other country planning to impose an economy-wide carbon price. Europe has an ETS, often extolled by those opposite. I have spoken in this place previously on the European ETS and some of the dismal figures coming from it. But today I want to highlight that Europe's ETS is plagued by rorts, fraud and loss of jobs offshore. On top of this, it raises only about $500 million a year while this government's will raise $9 billion a year. That is just over $1 per person that Europe's ETS raises, while Labor's plan will be for $400 per person$400 versus $1! It is just madness. China's emissions growth of seven billion tonnes from 2005 to 2020 will be about 100 times Australia's so-called decrease of 70 million tonnes. In reality, there is zero chance either China or India will adopt any form of serious carbon tax. The United States, Canada, Japan and Korea have all either ditched or deferred carbon tax systems. China is experiencing a huge growth in greenhouse gas emissions and this includes the China Daily last year reporting that one League within Inner Mongolia plans to build 24 large-scale coal mines and eight clusters of coal fired power plants. This is just one small League's plans, and the Prime Minister was reported saying this year that China is closing down a dirty coal fired want power generation facility at the rate of one every one or two weeks. I think the evidence suggests the opposite: they are building a lot more. The coalition's position is clear: we will vote against this carbon tax legislation and, if elected, we will rescind the legislation and scrap the carbon tax. Australia's manufacturing sector is already under pressure and this carbon tax will increase costs which overseas competitors do not have to pay. The carbon tax will force jobs overseas to factories which emit more emissions than those here in Australia. Of interest are some promising renewable projects in Barker, a wave power site in Port MACDonnell. Wave power has the ability to be used as base load power and, when not in use for power, can also be utilised for desalination. Also in the south-east is a geothermal site. The Penola project is a measured geothermal resource totalling 11.000 PJs. This is the largest of only three known measured resources in Australia and can provide base-load power. Unlike this government's carbon tax, the coalition's policy is fully funded and will ensure a government lives within its means. (Time expired)",154
348,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,PAIRS," I am pleased to rise to support the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and associated bills. Since the industrial revolution in the 1800s humans have been putting more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels like oil and coal. We know that this is having a negative impact on the world's climate and we have known this for a long time. Eighty-six years ago Alfred Lotka calculated the rate humans were burning the earth's energy reserves and talked of how the world's atmosphere would fundamentally change. Since then the science has strengthened and now climate models tell us that CO2 in the atmosphere traps the sun's heat and is warming our planet. So after a long debate, a multitude of inquiries and reports, it is time to do something. We know that waiting longer will only make the change to a clean energy future harder. There is often some confusion in the media, sometimes deliberately so I suspect, about climate science because science deals with what is most likely rather than simple 'yes' or 'no' answers. There is always debate in science because science is based on scepticism. 'Prove it to me!' is what scientists always demand. Scientists want data; accepting someone's word is not good enough. This is also exploited by the opposition and vested interests as they wheel out so-called experts to argue that little to nothing needs to be done. The fact that there is debate in science is often used as a basis for arguing that the opinion of very few is the real position that government should take rather than listen to the vast majority of scientists, who have very different conclusions. This tactic has been used in the past to delay changes that will impact interest groups and big business but benefit the vast majority of the public. Science denying that smoking causes cancer is but one example. For those lacking a science background, it is always prudent and responsible to take advice from those with appropriate scientific qualifications as you would in the area of health. This is what the Labor government is doing, and the vast majority of scientists agree that climate change is indeed real and needs to be tackled. There are also no credible scientific associations, universities or scientific bodies that disagree that climate change is real or caused by human influences. I ask you: are NASA, the UK Royal Society, CSIRO and the Australian Academy of Science all wrong? Anti-climate change websites, blogs, emails and conspiracy books are unreliable sources of scientific information because they are not based on data or peer reviewed scientific studies. They are opinion only. Furthermore, what we quite often see from the opposition and a handful of so-called experts is not scepticism based on science but climate denial. The opposition, with a wink and a nudge, also have the same target of a five per cent reduction by 2020. We all know they are really in denial about the urgency of the issue and the rigor of the science-no more than two years ago they agreed with it! Only one vote separated whether they would have been prepared to put an ETS to this parliament and this country. But now they are all converted, except one or two, to denial. We know the Leader of the Opposition has used a variety of descriptions when talking about climate change, including describing it as 'absolute crap'. Later he talked about 'a draconian new police force chasing an invisible, odourless, weightless, tasteless substance'. Recently we had the New South Wales Premier, Mr O'Farrell, claiming publicly in July that the carbon price would increase public transport fares in Sydney by 3.6 per cent and warned that some commuters faced extra costs of $150 a year. And, boy, didn't some newspapers and TV networks rush to get that onto their front pages and onto our screens! But documents released in the New South Wales parliament show that the New South Wales Treasury advised the state government in August that the federal government's carbon price would increase public transport fares not by 3.6 per cent but by just 0.49 per cent. The opposition's alternative policy, if is what you could call it, is not supported by science; it is simplistic and not supported by economists or pretty much anyone of any note. With any degree of scrutiny the public would dump it as ineffective and too expensive. Why would any polluter bother to change if it was business as usual? No price on carbon means there is no incentive to change. 'No thanks, we like what we are doing,' would be the response, unless, of course, the subsidy is huge. This would lead to corporate rent seeking in the extreme. The more carbon dioxide you pump into the atmosphere and the more technologically backward an industry is the greater the handout you can receive under the Liberals' policy. That is the logic of it. It is a direct handout, a direct subsidy and a direct windfall to the very industries that create problem in the first place. There will not dollar for those companies who have already reduced their carbon footprint. These companies will not get a cracker from the Liberals because they have already acted to become a zero-emissions company. The Liberal's direct action has no capacity to recognise positive action the way a market mechanism does. In fact, companies who have lowered their emissions off their own bat would see their competition get paid to do nothing to lower their emissions. Again, if this is the case, why bother doing it in the first place? You would be much better waiting to get your hands on a huge subsidy. In a perverse fashion, under the opposition's policy the only way to get a subsidy is to be a polluter waiting for cash in a handout and not be an innovator. The other centrepiece of so-called direct action policy is locking up carbon, specifically planting trees and locking up soil carbon. Firstly, you cannot plant enough trees to take enough carbon from the atmosphere. On top of this, they have ruled out planting trees on great that swathes of Australia. There is also no evidence that soil carbon can lock up anywhere near enough carbon to counteract emissions. On the other hand, Labor has designed a fantastic scheme that, after a fixed price period, creates a market for emissions. Only the big polluters will pay. Scientists tell us we need to reduce our reliance on carbon emissions, and economists tell us that a market mechanism is the cheapest and most effective way to do this. Indeed, until recently those opposite accepted the logic of that argument. Now they reject it. They stand by themselves with one or two newspapers in holding that view. To ignore this advice trashes the credibility of scientists and economists. We know those on the other side have sought to do that and continue to do the that. But in designing this package we have be a not forgotten about households, no matter how much those opposite try to whip up a scare campaign to the contrary. We have designed a comprehensive support package for Australian households. Nine in 10 households will receive some assistance through tax cuts and/or payment increases. Almost six million households, or two out of three, will get tax cuts or increased payments that cover their entire average price impact. Over four million Australian households will get an extra buffer with assistance that is at least 20 cent more than their expected average price impact. Over one million Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return. On average, it will cost households $9.90 per week, but they will get $10.10 per week in assistance. This assistance is permanent and, contrary to what those opposite say, will increase. government will review the adequacy of assistance each year and will increase it further if necessary. The assistance will mean, for example, that pensioners and self-funded retirees will get up to $338 extra per year if they are single and up to $510 per year for couples. Families receiving family tax benefit part A will get up to an extra $110 per child. Eligible families will get up to an extra $69 in family tax benefit part B. Allowance recipients will get up to $218 extra per year for singles, $234 per year for single parents and $390 per year for couples. On top of this, taxpayers with annual income of under $80,000 will all get a tax cut, with most receiving at least $300 per year. Almost all eligible households will get financial assistance automatically, without having to apply. On top of this there is a significant support package for industry. This package, when combined with the carbon farming imitative, shows clearly there are real opportunities for rural and regional Australia. Avoiding the worse impacts of climate change relies entirely on top emitters taking action. Contrary to what is claimed by those opposite and denialists, Australia is a top emitter, and acting alongside mid-sized countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands-all of which have a carbon price already in place-we can cut global carbon pollution. We cannot just stick our heads in the sand and expect that we will not be adversely affected by sea-level rises, and per the increasing incidence of extreme drought, floods and bushfires. We all have a role to play if the world is to reduce carbon emissions to a level capable of keeping temperature rise to less than two degrees Celsius. We owe that to the globe now and we owe it for our future. It is often said that Australia is acting The ahead of the world and that other countries are not acting. Again, contrary to newspaper articles generally from the same stable, News Limited and particularly the Australian, many countries are acting positively, either with schemes somewhat similar to an ETS or through other actions. Eighty-nine countries, accounting for over 80 per cent of global emissions and over 90 per cent of the global economy, have pledged to reduce or limit their carbon pollution by 2020. Australia's top five trading partners-China, Japan, the United States, the Republic of Korea and India-and another six of our top-twenty trading partners-New Zealand, the UK, Germany, Italy, France and the Netherlands-have implemented or are piloting carbon trading or taxation schemes. Ten US east coast states have an emissions trading scheme. One of those states alone, New York state, has the same size economy as Australia. California, the eighth largest economy in the world and more than 50 per cent bigger than the Australian economy, has committed to introducing an emissions trading scheme from 2012. South Korea has committed to introducing an ETS from 1 July 2015 and an emissions reduction target of 30 per cent below business as usual from 2020. New Zealand introduced a trading scheme in 2008, initially covering only forestry but in 2010 expanded significantly to cover liquid fossil fuels, stationary energy processes. I recall the Prime Minister of New Zealand claiming that the impact of that scheme has been minimal. China has indicated it will introduce emissions trading pilot schemes in a number of provinces, including the industrial centres of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong. And the World Bank recently indicated that these regional schemes may be expanded to a national scheme by 2015. China has the world's largest installed renewable energy electricity generation capacity. In 2009, China added 37 gigawatts of renewable power capacity, more than any other country in the world. India has a tax on coal which expected to generate over half a billion dollars annually to fund research into clean energy technologies. In the US, President Obama has set an ambitious target to transform the energy sector, which will see 80 per cent of electricity coming from clean resources by 2035. He has also committed the US to being the first country to have one million electric cars on the road by 2015. Countries around the world are already taking action on climate change. Eighty-nine countries, representing 80 per cent of the global emissions and 90 per cent of the world's economy, have already pledged to take action on climate change. Globally more money is now invested in new, renewable power than in conventional, high-pollution energy generation. Indeed, China is now the largest manufacturer of both solar panels and wind turbines. I am very pleased to support our clean energy future.",158
349,Mr NEVILLE,PAIRS," I quote: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Not in recent history has such a blatant political lie been told, designed purely",161
350,Mr Clare,PAIRS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member has used unparliamentary language and I would ask and industrial him to withdraw.",161
351,Mr NEVILLE,PAIRS,"I said a 'political lie', Madam Deputy Speaker.",161
352,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, The member will withdraw the word 'lie' to assist the chair.,161
353,Mr NEVILLE,PAIRS,"To assist the chair: in recent history there has never been such a political misleading of the Australian public on a scale purely designed to secure government and to hold on to power. This was not some clever play on words which voters could misinterpret or an aspirational vision statement which painted a picture of is something in the future for the electorate. No, it was a clear, bold, concise deceit which, at that critical closing stage campaign, left nobody-note: nobody-in any doubt. Here was a potential Prime Minister guaranteeing Australians that she would never introduce a carbon tax. With a starting point of deception, it is little wonder that there is scant respect for the carbon abatement debate anywhere in Australia. In fact, the government has been the master of its own undoing in that respect. Here we are today, forced into debating legislation which has only just been introduced into the House and has not been scrutinised by any of the usual methods of this parliament. On the whim of a minority party and a handful of Independents, the parliament has been hijacked by radical ideals to the detriment of the Australian economy and Australian families. I cannot say this more clearly: any government which puts its own political interests above those of the very people it has a duty to care for is not worthy of office. A carbon tax in this country will not reduce global emission levels one iota. It will hurt our own industries at a when they can least withstand it. It will spawn a whole new bureaucracy-the sole purpose of which will be to take money from the households and businesses, funnel it through government departments of endless public servants and dribble it back in the form of government handouts to try to compensate for the inevitable increased costs everyone will have to pay. The whole idea of a carbon tax or a carbon abatement scheme is to discourage people from wasting power and wasting energy. But if you compensate to a level where that does not become an issue, what have you achieved? It is almost an admission on one hand and falling into an abyss on the other. Last week, Queensland's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for August was at 6.2 per cent-up from 5.7 per cent in July. Indeed, unemployment in Queensland is at a 10-year high, with 15,000 people joining the dole queues in August, unemployment to 155,000 Queenslanders. To drive those statistics home, last month only 1,800 new jobs were created in Queensland, but 14,900 were lost. Such a significant rise in unemployment in Queensland at this time of the year cannot be ignored. While increases in unemployment are expected over the Christmas period, it is a sign of the financial distress out there in Queensland's business community when there is a half per cent rise in the middle of the year. Locally the same story is being told right now. People of Wide Bay-Burnett are doing it tough. Unemployment is at the highest level for years, sitting at 12.3 per cent. We have not seen it that high for the past seven years-since July 2004. Wide Bay-Burnett's total youth unemployment rate is 26.2 per cent, and our full-time youth unemployment rate is sitting at 38.9 per cent. Jobs are a precious commodity in my electorate, and time anything which puts job security and job creation at risk is simply not welcome. I must also mention the plight of pensioners and other older Australians who live on fixed incomes. I have almost 22,500 age pensioners living in my electorate, and they will pay a high price under the LaborGreen carbon tax through higher costs for electricity, gas, food, water, transport and health. The tax will directly impact on a wide variety of goods that pensioners and other older Australians purchase on a regular basis; and, as those prices go up and up, it is inconceivable that any offsets the government might offer will be able to keep up, and this is just the start. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs accidentally admitted as much in a recent letter to the editor which appeared in one of my local newspapers. She confidently asserted that pensioners would receive more in compensation payments than pushing they would pay out through higher household bills-but her maths were well and truly out of whack. She reported that the average increase in household bills would be $9.90 a week, including food, gas and electricity. In her own words, 'We are providing Australian pensioners with increased payments that are more than the expected average price rise.' And then she announces $10.10-20c more. Newsflash, Minister: $9.90 is $515 a year; $10.10 is $25. Work it out for yourself. One minor glitch in your scenario and pensioners and fixed income earners are down the drain. Even a primary school student can work that out for themselves. The soaring cost of electricity in Queensland will not just hit pensioners but every single household and enterprises of the state. Despite Premier Bligh's promise that 'nobody would be worse off' under the Labor government's electricity charges, Queensland families have suffered a 63 per cent increase in the last five years, or $628 per year on top of an average $1,000 bill. And these costs are only going to go up. On July 12, CS Energy CEO David Brown told a Queensland parliament finance estimates hearing that the carbon tax will be the single biggest cost item for electricity generators going forward. These companies are going to have to recoup these costs, and the state has passed legislation which allows them to do so. It is estimated that the carbon tax will add a further $190 a year to those bills, and those costs are only going to go up. Late last month in August, the Fraser Coast Chronicle reported that thousands of Fraser Coast builders have found themselves out of work or have left the industry in the past two years. In fact, construction on the Fraser Coast has halved since 2009. The construction sector employed 12,175 people in Wide Bay in February 2009, while the latest figures reveal a slump down to 6,486 jobs. In other words, the figure has nearly halved. One of the industry professionals interviewed for the article, Connell Constructions owner, John Connell, has been forced to pay off three staff and says the state of the industry is the worse he's seen in 40 years. To quote Mr Connell: The (industry) won't improve until we get a different government. The Gillard government had the opportunity to help us with the school buildings being barely any of them went to local contractors. Had they been given to local guys, our contractors would be busy right now. The main problem in my opinion is people haven't got confidence in the government so they haven't been spending. Likewise, Bundaberg builder, Brad Warren of Warren Family Homes, told the Bundaberg NewsMail on July 26 that the carbon tax would send the economy 'spiralling downwards'. In his own words, regarding the carbon tax, Mr Warren said: The building industry is struggling at the moment-we need it like a hole in the head. Never have truer words been spoken. He is well aware that the carbon tax is set to add another $5,000 to the cost of building an average new home and he knows what the consequence will be for his business. High-growth centres like Bundaberg and Hervey Bay rely heavily on the local building industry for their economic stability, but our local housing sector is dominated by small subcontractors who will not get any compensation under the carbon tax. These people, who are effectively being punished for being self-employed, are the big losers in the Gillard wealth distribution ideals. Why? Because they do not get what the pensioners and others on fixed incomes will get. According to the Bureau of Statistics, the value of private dwelling construction in the Bundaberg Regional Council area has been in freefall since 2007, going from $131.6 million in the 2006 calendar year to just $66.2 million for 2010. It is the same scenario on the Fraser Coast where the value of private dwelling construction dropped from $307.6 million in 2006 to $149.6 million for 2010. The last thing our local building industry needs is another deterrent in the form of a new tax, which will invariably flow through to the costs of built, but existing homes as well. Homeowners throughout Hinkler are already facing higher electricity costs, gas bills and water rates as well as an anticipated 10 per cent extra for electricity and nine per cent for gas, if the carbon tax is passed. With a national housing shortage of 202,400 dwellings and low levels of housing affordability, locals need a hike in the cost of construction and development like, as I said before, a hole in the head. Investors in new housing will also pass on the higher repayments to their tenants in the form of higher rents. The carbon tax will also cost jobs in the Australian building product manufacturing sector-places manufacture kitchen cabinets, bench tops, windows and the like-because they will not be able to match the price of imported items from countries which do not have a carbon tax. A Deloitte Access Economics report commissioned by the Queensland government and tabled in the state parliament on August 23 outlined just how bad the carbon tax will be for Queensland. In fact, it stated the carbon tax will hit Queensland the hardest, costing an estimated 21,000 in forecasted jobs and slashing state growth by 2.76 per cent to 2020. It estimated that the tax will cut the state's growth by per cent more than the rest of the country over the decade because of Queensland's dependence on the high-emitting resources sector, including mining and minerals processing, is well understood. By 2050, Queensland growth will be 4.11 per cent lower under a carbon tax. These are frightening figures, but they go down to the simplest things affecting the average householder. Most people's garbage bills will rise $200. In fact, state governments around Australia say it will cost around $100 million more to run hospitals, while public transport fares could go up an average of $150 per person per year. In regional Queensland, councils are already suffering under Labor's ideology of forced council amalgamations, which saw the removal of a 40 per cent subsidy for water and sewerage infrastructure projects. Imagine what it will be like when councils have to pay for the effects of a new tax on top of that. All in all, this is a very ugly picture. I do not like it. I am generally an optimistic sort of person, but this is not an optimistic scenario. As I said before, if the whole idea of a carbon tax is to alter behaviour, if it is to put a value on energy and see it is used wisely, the mere fact that the government has which had to compensate people to such a high level gives a lie to its own agenda-I hope I can use the word 'lie' in that context. I do not support the legislation and I doubt very much if my electorate would. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (19:30): I rise to speak in support of these clean energy bills, and I do so as a proud member of the Gillard Labor government, a government which had the foresight to say, 'Enough is enough,' when it comes to talking about addressing climate change and is willing to stand up and finally take action on this important matter. The Prime Minister said in this House just a week ago that this parliament has been 0.57 debating climate change for decades. The parliamentary debate of this issue predates the building itself. The Prime Minister said: My predecessor as member for Lalor, Barry Jones, once said this about climate change, 'If we are only prepared to plan five years, 10 years, 15 years or 20 years down the track all the dangers that are feared can be avoided.' Those words were spoken 24 years ago this week. For my part, I went to the election in 2007 and promised my electorate action on climate change. In 2010, I went back to the people in the electorate of Petrie and once again affirmed my commitment to take action on climate change and to see an emissions trading scheme introduced to this country. That is what this government is doing for this country. I have had a number of people in my electorate approach me and talk to me about their views on this issue. Can I say how pleasing it is, but not surprising, that so many of those people who are so supportive of taking action on climate change are our seniors. I cannot count the number of seniors-pensioners and retirees, a lot of them men-who have come up to me and said, 'Yvette, we have to do this. We have to deal with climate change.' A gentleman came up to me in a shopping centre and said, 'Our children will curse us if we do not do this.' I have had retirees who have said, 'We need to stop thinking of our hip pocket and start thinking about our grandchildren's future.' It is our retirees who understand this the most, because they understand that the decisions we make today affect future generations and that we cannot look into the eyes of our children and grandchildren and tell them: 'It was all just too hard; we just could not do it.' There are a lot of school students out there who are very frustrated by the delay in dealing with climate change because they feel that they are doing a lot. They are doing a lot in their schools and in their homes to try to save energy and make the world a better place. But they feel like not enough is being done in the business community. They say to me, 'Why should we make such an effort at home when we see high-rises in the city with all their lights on?' It is a fair point. It is about time that business steps up and takes on its responsibility. That is what will occur under this set of bills. The largest polluters this country will pay for the pollution that they put into our atmosphere. By them paying, not only will we start addressing climate change and carbon emissions but we will be able to use the money paid by those big polluters to give back to the community to start tackling some of the important issues that need to be tackled to address climate change, like reinvesting in clean energy and renewables and supporting households and businesses to make this very important transition. We have heard a number of claims from people in this chamber. We just heard from the member for Hinkler. Despite the claims made by the member for Hinkler, the facts are that more than 36,600 pensioners in Hinkler will receive $338 extra per year if they are single and up to $510 per year for couples combined in their pension payments. On average, the expected increase in costs due to a carbon price for single pensioners will be $204 per year. With the increase in their pension payments they will be $134 better off. The assistance to pensioners will be automatic and will start before the carbon price begins through an advance payment of $250 for singles and $190 for each member of a couple. This will be paid in May and June 2012. From March 2013, assistance will be delivered through extra fortnightly payments. The member for Hinkler said, 'But, if other prices are going up, the assistance that the government gives is pointless. It will all be gone.' Let's be clear: this assistance is about assisting households in relation to the impact that the introduction of a carbon price will have. It is not assistance for all general increases in costs of living; it is about assisting people to meet the carbon price. There will be other cost-ofliving increases related to a whole lot of other issues, and there will be businesses out there who try to claim that the price in increases that are passing on are due to the carbon price. That is why this government is giving strong powers to the ACCC-to make sure that those businesses who price gouge and mislead their customers about why they are increasing their prices are prosecuted. Treasury modelling has shown that the average increase in prices as a consequence of the carbon price will be around 0.7 per cent. The assistance that nine out of 10 households get will be equal to or better than that. Our pensioners will get the equivalent of a 1.7 per cent increase in payments to assist them in any costs arising from the introduction of a carbon price. These are the facts. The facts also are that, when we look at what a 0.7 per cent increase means to the average household, we can give people a comparison that they can understand. They only need to think back to 2000, when the GST came in, and to what the impact was on the them then, because at that time there was a close to 2.5 per cent increase in the CPI, whereas what is being proposed and modelled with the introduction of the carbon price is only a 0.7 per cent increase in the CPI. We have heard from members on the other side, including the member for Barker, and a number of them have made claims that are just misleading. I am sure that they are out in the community trying to scaremonger and convince people that the carbon price is going to hurt them and that they should not support it. But the fact is that the carbon price will be paid by around 500 of Australia's biggest polluters, not the truck drivers, as those on the other side would have the community believe. Truck drivers currently receive discounted fuel through the fuel tax credit by which they pay around 15c a litre less than ordinary motorists. The government is proposing to reduce this discount by 6.9c a litre from 1 July 2014. Fluctuations in the global oil price have a greater impact than that. In just the last years, the price of diesel has fluctuated by around 62c a litre-it has cost between $1.18 and $1.80 a litre at the bowser. Trucks that use LPG, CNG and LNG as well as ethanol, biodiesel and renewable diesel will not be affected at all, and the impact of a reduction in the fuel tax credit can be offset by moving to more fuel-efficient vehicles. We need to begin the long process of weaning ourselves off oil, a finite resource which in coming decades is likely to become increasingly expensive as the world's reserves run dry. Despite what they say on the other side, the Australian Trucking Association in a press release of 10 July 2011 stated: The ATA has welcomed the Government's decision to exempt the trucking industry from carbon tax until 1 July 2014. It continued by saying that this will: give small trucking businesses a breathing space to increase their fuel efficiency and renegotiate contracts with their customers. So, despite the claims of those on the other side, the reality is that the industry is willing to work with the government; they understand the importance of these reforms. The member for Barker is trying to start a scare campaign about the agricultural sector; in fact, the agricultural sector has nothing to fear from the carbon price. The facts are clear: the agricultural sector is permanently excluded from the carbon price scheme. Farmers will not pay the carbon price, they will not have to account to their emissions and every litre of fuel used on a farm will receive the same tax credits that the government pays now. Farmers will now also have the opportunity to earn new income through the Carbon Farming Initiative, which recently passed through parliament and which the member for Barker and the coalition voted against. The far government knows that farmers already do a four lot for the local environment, and through the CFI we have ensured that farmers can now be rewarded for this good work. Taking steps to reduce emissions from livestock and fertiliser use or increase carbon in soils and vegetation will allow farmers and landholders to generate credits which can be sold to businesses as carbon offsets. So, despite the views of those on the other side, the fact is that businesses and homeowners want action on climate change and are willing to step up and be part of that action. They acknowledge that there may be a cost, but they also acknowledge that the government is providing assistance. The Treasurer has released current modelling that once again breaks down what the increases in prices will be. For products such as milk and cheese and other dairy products we are looking at a 0.4 per cent increase; for cakes and cereals we are looking at a 0.4 per cent increase; for fruit and vegetables we are looking at a 0.4 per cent increase; and for meat and seafood we are looking at a 0.4 per cent increase. The fact is that all of the price increases that have been modelled will be 0.5 per cent or less other than the increase in prices for electricity, gas and utilities, it is estimated will be around 7.9 per cent, which equates to about $3.30 a week in electricity bills and $1.50 per week in average gas bills. These, not those that we are hearing the other side talk about so often, are the real price increases. What does the other side really offer? They offer a model that does not achieve the bipartisan targets. In order to reach the target, they will need to plant enough trees to cover five Tasmanias, the entire land area of Germany or an area the size of Victoria and Tasmania combined. They have no support from any credible scientists or economists; in fact the Leader of the Opposition has on a number of occasions attacked leading economists and scientists for supporting the government's policy. Their modelling does not add up; in fact, the independent Grattan Institute has estimated that there is a $100 billion black hole-that is, a third of the entire federal government budget-in the Liberal Party's costings. Treasury estimates that, without international permits, which we know the opposition are opposed to, the Liberal Party's model would cost $30 billion in today's dollars in 2020. Taxpayers will have to pay an extra $1,300 per household. This is what the opposition says. Maybe the opposition should start listening to people like David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, who is actually delighted to hear about the ambitious package of climate change policy measures announced by the Gillard Labor government and who, on 31 July, wrote to the Prime Minister of Australia outlining his delight at our announcements. I certainly support the bills before the House. The country is looking for action on climate change. My electorate is looking for action on climate change. I am pleased to support the bills. While we are making history, the opposition will be remembered for their opposition to which, addressing climate change.",161
354,Mr KATTER,PAIRS," I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and associated bills. A year before the last election we launched a series of meetings for our own supporters in the electorate-they were the only people invited to the meetings. We had 15 of these meetings, and at them we asked, 'What are the issues?' I was very surprised that at every single meeting two of the main issues were electricity and dentists. If I had drawn up a list, I do not think they would have been in the first 40. But what we think and what people are saying are two entirely different things. I thought the arguments of QCOSS, the Queensland Council of Social Service-that is, that you switch the lights off or you eat, but you cannot do both-were wildly exaggerated. But people are doing it very, very hard. They cannot afford their current electricity charges. Between 2004 and 2010 charges in Queensland rose from $839 to $1,296 per household. That is a 100 per cent increase. These are not my figures, but the federal government's figures from the Garnaut report, Australia's low pollution future. That is the document that the Parliamentary Library gave me when I asked them what would be the increase in electricity charges with a five per cent reduction in emissions. Table 6.15 on page 176 of the document tells me that the increase for a five per cent CPRS over the years from 2010 to 2015 will be 20 per cent. The average household electricity price increase for a five per cent CPRS reduction is 20 per cent. They are not my figures, they are the government's figures. They are telling us 10 per cent. On a show recently I asked Greg Combet could he please sack the Treasury and Mr Garnaut for telling lies, because they had said it was per cent increase, but the government said 10 per cent. The government would not lie, we know that. The audience burst out laughing because either Mr Garnaut and the Treasury report are telling lies or the government is telling lies. A 20 per cent increase translates into mark ups. With retailers like Energex and Ergon in Queensland, with delivery systems, with transmission lines then each of them adds on to that 20 per cent. Whether those add-ons are included in that 20 per cent I do not know. All I can say to the House is that we have an average increase of nearly 100 per cent every five years in Queensland and we are now going to add 20 per cent on to that with the government reductions. Despite my very anti-environmental statements in this place many, many times, I have never been a person who has said that we should not show some restraint. Some times you need to pull on the reins a bit, and this is a case where I would say that. The argument that the world is heating because there are 358 parts per million up there of CO2 is quite ridiculous. It is a proposition that in any other time or age would have been laughed at. I liken it to putting wire netting over your house and thinking it will keep your house warm, but wire netting is actually more than 400 parts per million. It has got a better chance of keeping your house warm than this proposition being put forward by the government. If you have a particle of energy coming off the earth's surface-rebounding from sunlight that hits the earth's surface and bounds back into outer space-only 50 per cent of it is passed on. That means 50 per cent is retained by the CO2 molecule and 50 per cent is passed on into outer space. Even the 400 parts per million pales into insignificance when you consider that 50 per cent has gone anyway, back into outer space. There may be global warming; I would not deny that, although I a 20 think that even in An Inconvenient Truth there is some equivocation on the evidence-even from a very hardened warrior against global warming such as Al Gore. Katharina Fabricius of the Australian Institute of Marine Science is a leading international authority on the effect of CO2 in the oceans. In actual fact, there are some very serious ramifications in the decrease in the alkaline levels of the ocean. Calcium carbonate, which is the shell of shellfish, is an alkaline compound, so there will be problems if the sea ceases to be as alkaline. A tree grows well if there is a lot of CO2 in it. A shellfish grows well if there is a lot of calcium carbonate or alkaline substances out there. So if the alkaline levels drop then it becomes much harder for shellfish to form. I said to Dr Fabricius: 'But they're not at the bottom of the food chain. On the contrary, the minuscule bivalves that you cannot see with the naked eye-you need a microscope to see them-in fact comprise the major part of the bottom of the food chain.' So if those shellfish cannot form their shells then we have a very serious problem which starts to arise in the oceans. I do not come here as any cassandra or soothsayer of doom-that is a long way off at this stage-but I, being a very strong opponent of the carbon tax and the various other proposals that have been put forward at various times, have said that we should have a bit of a pullback. If you want to cut carbon emissions, let us go to the experts. My environmentalist enemies would claim one of their patron saints to be Al Gore. The very first solution put forward by Al Gore is ethanol. There is no proposal in this place to do anything about ethanol. Mr Iemma, when he was the premier of New South Wales, said that he was going ahead with a 10 per cent ethanol blend because, he said at the conference he was addressing, he could not live another day with his conscience if he did not introduce ethanol into the petrol blend. People are dying in Sydney and Melbourne-not quite so much in Brisbane. I refer people to the works of Jonathan Streeton, the very eminent thoracic surgeon who was the specialist called by Slater and Gordon in the tobacco case in Australia; he is the leading chest authority in the country. also refer people to the statements by the president of the AMA in New South Wales and Dr Tom Beer, the head of air quality control for Australia. Each of them said effectively-I think Tom Beer probably put it most succinctly-that more people are dying in Australia from motor vehicle emissions than from motor vehicle accidents. It is remarkable to me that, while Mr Iemma has a conscience, the people in this place do not. They actually listened to the oil and gas lobby, who told them that motor cars will break down if you put ethanol in your tank. They actually said this and, in this parliament-the Liberal and National parties were in power then-actually promulgated that most extraordinarily stupid statement. Mr Speaker, I think you have seen pictures of the people in California. All the cars are breaking down in California, are they? America's average is nine per cent ethanol in their petrol tanks now, and in states like California, which have very stringent laws, it is much, much higher than nine per cent. Are all the cars breaking down in California? Go home tonight and turn on your television. Almost all your movies and TV shows come out of Hollywood in California. Have a look and see if there are any cars on the side of the road broken down. Twenty million people live in Sao Paulo and 21 million people live in Rio. All the cars are breaking down in Brazil, are they? They have 22 per cent. Yet the people on the front benches in this House came into this parliament and promulgated that piece of incredible rubbish put out by the oil companies. Why have we not got ethanol? Why has a country whose sugar industry is collapsing and whose grain industry is in desperate trouble not got ethanol? Why would we go to a solution that will cost this country $15,000 million a year in taxes alone? I represent the base metals industry of I Australia. I represent more base metals than anyone else in this parliament. A great company built up by many generations of great Australians, Mount Isa Mines, has announced the closure of its copperprocessing plant in Mount Isa. BHP has announced that it is doing no more processing in Australia. The steel industry is moving offshore. The major cost input item into these industries, outside the copper and iron ore themselves, is electricity. The aluminium industry, the third greatest export industry of this country, is dependent almost exclusively on electricity. Electricity is more built into the cost of aluminium than is the cost of bauxite. It is congealed electricity. So this government goes forward, smashing the coal industry, which is the carbon dioxide industry of the world. It is saying, 'We're going to be world leaders in smashing carbon dioxide'-and by implication, of course, the coal industry. 'We're going to be the people that lead the world in closing it down. Guess what Australia's biggest export is and has been for the last 15 years? It is coal, and we are going to close it down. The answer is there, not only in your motor cars, not only if you move the 10 per cent ethanol up to 20 per cent ethanol-the same as Brazil-and not only if you reduce your carbon emissions by five per cent for transport. In Australia, where most of that ethanol comes from sugar cane, people will say, 'It's a trade-off; we'll lose food.' Let me tell you: the cattle desperately needs distiller's grain for ethanol. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Murphy): Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The honourable member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Treaties Committee Report",167
355,Ms PARKE,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report 119: Treaty tabled on 5 July 2011. In accordance with standing order 39(f), the report was made a parliamentary paper.",170
356,Ms PARKE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Today I present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report No. 119, which contains the committee's views on the Instrument Amending the Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union and the Instrument Amending the Convention of the International Telecommunication Union, which were tabled in the Commonwealth parliament on 5 July 2011. The work of the International Telecommunication Union is technically complicated and not widely understood. However, its work does materially improve telecommunications services for the general public. Probably the best known example of this is the 2000 agreement establishing an international standard for third-generation mobile telephony. The 2000 agreement replaced a diversity of country based mobile telephony standards with a single international standard, enabling thirdindustry generation mobile devices to operate anywhere in the world, laying the framework (Mr for international mobile roaming. The ITU funds its activities through contributions from member states. Unlike other United Nations agencies, member states decide their own level of contribution. Although Australia's contribution to the ITU is SwF4.725 million, or approximately $5.1 million, this sum is entirely recouped through industry contributions. Consequently, the Australian government has no net costs. The proposed treaty action amends the ITU's constitution and convention in relation to the class of contribution member states may make to the ITU. Both of the amending instruments will enter into force generally on 1 January 2012. The amendments comprise a provision which allows member states to reduce their contribution at any one time by not more than 15 per cent of their prior level of contribution and a provision which increases the number of levels of contributory units from which member states can choose their class of contribution. The greatest impact of the amendment will be to reduce the amount by which the largest financial contributors to the ITU can decrease their level of contribution at any one time. Although the ITU is not financially unstable, the adoption of this amendment would contribute towards improving the ITU's financial stability. Aside from the above provisions, the obligations of ITU member states will not change. The treaties committee supports the adoption of the proposed amendments as they will provide stability to ITU funding. The committee understands that the telecommunications industry supports the changes and that there will be no net cost to the Australian government. For these reasons, the committee concludes that these amendments should be supported with binding treaty action. I thank my fellow committee members and take this opportunity to pay tribute to the hard working treaties committee secretariat. I commend the report to the House. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Australian Industry Participation Plan Mr STEPHEN JONES (20:04): I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) Australia needs a diverse economy to prosper now and into the future; (b) Australia has a strong innovation framework, and some of the best research and development and skilled workers in the world, but industry and government support is needed to turn that capacity into goods manufactured in Australia; (c) the Australian Government has an agenda for nation building, innovation and improving the productive performance of business and industry, but that more can be done in this area; (d) the Australian Manufacturing industry should continue to be assisted by government to ensure that the mining boom does not crowd-out every other area of the economy; and (e) the Government has already made a substantial contribution to the development of agenda; (2) reaffirms its belief in a modern, cohesive and comprehensive industry policy for Australian manufacturing which links these elements of the Australian economy; (3) supports policies to spread the benefits of the mining boom to local manufacturers and the development of a skilled workforce by; (a) ensuring that the mining industry invests in apprenticeships and training to ensure Australia continues to renew and develop a high-skilled workforce; and (b) requiring: (i) all new major resource projects have an Australian Industry Participation Plan (AIPP) which provides details of the Australian manufactured materials and services to be used on all major resource developments; and (ii) open and transparent tendering arrangements which permit Australian industry to compete on an equal basis with international companies for sub-contracts associated with major resource projects; (4) supports policies that require Australian Government infrastructure and defence industry (Throsby) projects to produce and publish an AIPP detailing Australian manufactured materials and services; and (5) in the interests of accountability and transparency, insists that all AIPPs be published and regularly updated as projects progress.",170
357,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," Is the motion seconded? Ms Bird: I second the motion. Mr STEPHEN JONES: Australia is going through unprecedented economic change. This change is driven by our place in the world and the demand for our natural resources. Despite what some say, our economic outlook is one of fundamental strength and resilience. The economic transformation of Asia is bringing tremendous benefits to this region. Our economy is strong. Our mining and resources sector is strong and revenue is flowing from this this to both state and federal governments. Our terms of trade are high and the high Australian dollar means that everything from petrol, TVs, T-shirts and overseas holidays are cheaper than they have ever been before. But the sustained high Australian dollar is driving structural change in our economy. Different sectors and regions within the Australian economy are growing at different speeds. It is clear that the manufacturing sector is struggling, and there are many examples in my region and the region of my colleague who joins me in the chamber, the member for Cunningham. In our area of Illawarra this is very prevalent. I believe that manufacturing matters. Manufacturing is critical not only to our economy but to the sort of country that we want to live in. This is because a country makes stuff knows stuff. Manufacturing and the engineering trades create the ecosystems of knowledge that are critical to being a clever country, and you can measure it. While manufacturing makes up only about 8.3 per cent of all employment and about 8.6 per cent of gross domestic product, it contributes to more than 25 per cent of all business investment in research and development. Put simply, the manufacturing sector is boxing well above its weight when it comes to investing in our future know-how and technological capacity. The government is implementing many reforms to deal with the pressure that is now being faced by the manufacturing sector in a changing economy. We are investing in skills in record amounts. We have a record investment of over $36 billion in infrastructure projects around the country to support our economy. We are building important new infrastructure like the National Broadband Network, and we are pushing for better taxation on the mining sector and for improved research and development tax incentives for manufacturing and other industries. We have created over 130,000 new training places and we are investing heavily in skills and training measures. These are all important measures to keep our economy strong, but many of them have been opposed by those opposite. We believe that there is an important role for government. It is not just a matter of letting the market rip. We believe that we need a policy mix to create a diverse economy. A broad range of programs are already in place to support our manufacturing industries and include the Australian Industry Participation measures, which are encouraging full, fair and reasonable opportunities for the manufacturing industry in many major that projects; a range of investment and coinvestment vehicles through our Clean Energy Future initiatives; and programs such as Enterprise Connect which are providing assistance to small and medium sized enterprises and encouraging innovation and investment in new technology and projects. These programs are targeted at enhancing productivity through innovation across the economy because we recognise that the Australian economy needs to be selfsustaining beyond the resources boom. In June this year, the Minister for Defence Materiel strengthened our program to reduce the threshold for mandatory AICPs from $50 million to $20 million, and put new conditions for tender, which exclude any company that has failed to meet their Australian industry participation plan obligations. A number of these measures have already been put in place but the motion before the House today quite simply calls for more action. It calls for policies which will spread the benefits of the mining boom to local manufacturers and the development of a skilled workforce by ensuring that the mining industry invests in apprenticeships and training. It calls for policies to ensure that all new major resource projects have an Australian Industry Participation Plan which provides details of the Australian manufactured materials and services to be used in all those major projects and policies, which would require open and transparent tendering arrangements which permit Australian industry to compete on an equal basis with international companies for subcontracts associated with major resource projects. I am moving this motion before the House because, from conversations I have had with many manufacturers in my electorate, I can see that we are playing on a far from even playing field. According to the Australian Steel Institute, out of a $400 billion investment over the next five to 10 years, Australian steel is currently getting only around a 10 per cent share of the market. And this is at a time when our steel fabrication sector is running below capacity and many firms are laying off staff. I have heard too many examples lately of mining and resource companies effectively locking Australian companies out of being able to tender for major projects. Companies like Chevron, Fortescue Metals, Pacific Sino and Rio Tinto are making billions from developing Australia's natural resources, and Australian manufactured products, particular Australian steel, are not getting a fair shake in those contracts. I will cite a number of examples. One example that has been brought to my attention is of the Chevron project at Barrow Island-a large LNG project. The Gorgon LNG project on Barrow Island is Australia's largest ever project but, unfortunately, the LNG plant has been designed in London to use Japanese standards and Asian steel and will be fabricated completely in Asian yards and then transported to the site. A second example which has been brought to my attention involves Rio Tinto in the iron ore expansion in the Pilbara. The specifications for that project clearly all steel plate will be welded and that the welded sections and floor plate to be used will be of Chinese standard and specifications-effectively precluding Australian companies from bidding in those projects. Another example is of the Fortescue Metals Group. Earlier this year Fortescue Metals Group announced it had struck a deal to buy 260 40-tonne iron ore rail cars from China's CNR Corp as part of Twiggy Forrest's $US8.4 billion Pilbara expansion ambitions. Another example involves CITIC Pacific Mining's Sino Iron Ore project at Cape Preston-probably the most extreme example I have seen. In that project all the steel that is used was imported from Shanghai steel yards. That is around 100,000 tonnes of steel that could have been supplied locally but which was imported for this project. Not only that-and to illustrate the problems facing Australian manufacturingCITIC Pacific imported entirely ready-made concrete footpaths from China. Concrete is a simple commodity and this work could, and I say should, have been done locally. These examples show clearly that Australian manufacturing industries like steel, engineering and concrete are effectively being excluded from the benefits of these major resource projects. And this is occurring at a time when the manufacturing sector, as I have said, is shedding jobs. It is clear that greater transparency and accountability is required in the contracts being awarded in this sector, and the motion that I have put before the House calls for exactly that. We need transparency and accountability at a federal level, but there is clearly more that state governments can and should be doing. There is clearly a role for national leadership in this regard, and I will be seeking a coordinated approach-and I say that ask for a bipartisan approach-to be progressed through COAG as a matter of priority. The government will work to ensure that manufacturing will continue to be a source of well-paid, high-skill jobs for Australian workers, but this will not happen by accident. The best way that we can spread the benefits of the mining boom is to ensure that Australian manufacturing industries get greater access-at least on an equal basisto the over $400 billion worth of investment that is going into our mining sector over the next 4½ years. While I am at it, I believe that greater access to a number of the infrastructure projects of a number of governments, at state and federal level, would greatly benefit local manufacturing industries, because if the purpose of many of these projects is to stimulate employment and local jobs then one of the most direct and effective ways that this can be done is to ensure that local manufacturers and local workers such as those who are employed in electorates like mine and the electorate of the member for Cunningham can get access to fulfilling, high-paying, good, skilled jobs for now and well into the future. I commend the motion to the House. Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (20:13): In rising to speak on this item of private members' business I welcome the opportunity to train a spotlight on the ruinous state of industry and innovation policy under this government. We have heard from the previous speaker, the member for Throsby, about what was not working in the industry sector, what barriers local businesses were up against, but there was no understanding of what policy prescriptions should follow. There were no answers; there were just repetitions of stories of the problems-very real problems-facing industry in accessing work in Australia. There was a dizzying set of contradictions by the member for Throsby, who continues to walk both sides of the street but does so ever more unconvincingly unsuccessfully. I do admit that he has a very difficult job because of the relevant ministers that he is lumped with as part of the current government. There is no argument from the coalition with the sentiments outlined in paragraphs (1)(a), (1)(b) and (2) that Australia needs a broad based economy, a better harnessing of our innovative capabilities and more effective industry policies. These points are entirely self evident and I am glad that at least one Labor member is finally prepared to say so and to repudiate Labor's pursuit of what BlueScope Steel's CEO, Paul O'Malley, has described as an almost anti-manufacturing philosophy. As for paragraphs (1)(d), (3), (4) and (5), we are also broadly in agreeance with them, but we naturally need to be careful about precisely how governments in Australia intervene in these areas. Ultimately, there can be as many guidelines around industry policies as you like, but they count for little if the government responsible for administering them does not exhibit common sense and exercise political will to implement them effectively. It appears from the motion that the member for Throsby needs to be somewhat educated about the government's atrocious record on defence procurement. Is he seriously not aware that his own party has tried to send the manufacturing of Australian camouflage fabric to China and that it broke commitments to upgrade body armour and weapons for frontline troops? We even have another story in the Telegraph today revealing that our diggers' American-made camouflage pants are falling apart while they are on patrol. And how much did Australian taxpayers pay to an American company for this privilege? They paid $7.8 million. I would be very interested to hear from some of our domestic manufacturers about the and tender process for that $7.8 million contract that found itself in the US. I am no stranger to these issues, having very strong manufacturing in my electorate in north-east Victoria and a very strong competitive and innovative defence manufacturing sector as well. As for paragraphs (1)(c) and (1)(e), the government has never had an agenda for industry and innovation policy and national productivity other than to embark on its familiar mission of destroying successful Howard government initiatives. Instead, it has not only slashed funding in critical areas such as commercialisation and R&D but also has stood back and expected our manufacturers to absorb ever-increasing regulations and costs. It claims it has increased spending in that portfolio by many billions of dollars but, sadly, it has failed to comprehend there is never an automatic connection between spending more government money and getting better outcomes. Indeed, even Ms Gillard and Senator Carr battled to nominate a single practical achievement from all this spending. And just to confirm its stunning incompetence, the government now wants to whack Australian manufacturing with a punitive carbon tax that we know, from research out today, will fully impact on nine out of 10 manufacturing workers. The 10 per cent that will not be impacted fully by it be impacted in some way. He does not go far enough but there is essentially a shamefaced admission from the member for Throsby in paragraph (1)(c) of his motion about the abject lack of common sense and direction the government has exhibited because he uses the words 'more can be done in this portfolio area'. Indeed, can. We on this side of the House do agree very strongly with this sentiment: a lot more can be done. Last Wednesday at the National Press Club we invited the government to work with us to immediately adopt and implement eight key policy changes in relation to manufacturing. I note that the member for Throsby asked for a bipartisan approach. Well, there it was. They were very easy steps, from one to eight. We agree with him that there are sectors such as steel and cement that are locked out of contracts. There are very simple things that can be done immediately-but, sadly, no response. At a time when Australia is facing its greatest crisis in manufacturing-as one union leader said, the greatest crisis since the Great Depression-I had hoped for a slightly better response. But as the government continues to be paralysed and obsessed with self-preservation it has failed to focus on industry policy and at least make some attempt to reverse its failed vision. The Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, used to hyperventilate any time there were job losses under the Howard government. Ironically, that was during a period of government when manufacturing jobs actually rose, yet his own legacy will be that he presided over the worse rate of job losses in the history of Australian manufacturing. It is a statistic he could not dispute in the Senate a few weeks ago and it will be the one that, more than any other, will define his time as a minister. Over the past quarter, jobs have been lost will at a rate of more than 2½-thousand every week. That is one gone very four minutes. The situation is such as to discredit even the words some of their own advisers have given them. Let us have a look at Terry Cutler, who Labor hand-picked back in 2008 to advise it on what it should do with its policies in this portfolio. He has said that the it government essentially has no idea what it is doing. I welcome the member for Throsby's newfound and in some ways sudden rhetorical interest in manufacturing, innovation and industry participation plans. I would counsel him that it is one thing to wax lyrical on the floor of the parliament and in press conferences but it is quite another to practically force change to Labor's industry policies. I would also remind him that the most fundamental responsibility of being a member of parliament is to stand up for the interests and wishes of your local constituents. This motion is opposing the single greatest threat to the viability of manufacturing in this countryand that means voting against the carbon tax. Labor's spin and blind loyalty to an outof-touch Prime Minister, industry minister and climate change minister on policies like the carbon tax simply does not wash with anyone anymore. No member representing a great Australian manufacturing heartland should be substituting parliamentary motions like this for real work and placing real pressure on their party's power brokers to make policies that will make a fundamental difference, that will make a change and stop the rot. I find it sad that members from the Illawarra have so little clout in the ALP anymore and that all of us have been forced to endure the sight of the member for Throsby changing his language on the carbon tax so often for different audiences. He has performed more contortions than a circus acrobat to try to please both his political masters and local workers. It is not convincing either way. Instead of sinking into the comfortable green leather of the House of Representatives, people like the member for Throsby should have been wearing out their shoe leather visiting local businesses, listening to their concerns and then pounding on the doors of senior colleagues to urge them to stop penalising the millions of hard-working Australians who are being crushed by this government and its policy initiatives, including the carbon tax. So far there has been none of that from him-a point admitted by Ms Gillard in June when she hung him out to dry by effectively conceding he had made no representations to her about the toxicity for his electorate of the carbon tax. No amount of parliamentary motions like this one can obscure the reality that the member for Throsby has let his electorate down and has failed the most basic test of political no substitute for representation.",171
358,Ms BIRD,COMMITTEES," It is a very special level of punishment to have to follow the member for Indi in any debate. Her capacity to spend 15 minutes criticising, spewing vitriol, misrepresenting people's positions and failing to put forward any alternative has a special level of achievement in parliamentary debates. I would simply say to her that I cannot even be bothered responding to most of her arguments because they are so lacking in foundation anyway. I would be interested to know whether the member for Casey has a particular view on the member for Indi's approach to manufacturing and whether there is an interest in a more market interventionist approach more generally on the benches on the other side. Quite contrary to the member for Indi's complete misrepresentation, the member for Throsby and I do visit many of our local manufacturing businesses and talk to them on a regular basis. Indeed, I have done so for all the years I have been in parliament and my colleague the member for Throsby has done so since he was elected. I could hardly think of a more inaccurate criticism to be made of the member for Throsby for bringing this motion forward to the House. It is indeed an important recognition that the Wollongong and Illawarra area more broadly does make a substantial contribution to the Australian economy. Like the member for Ballarat at the table, our region makes things, it exports things and it provides services. Over the last 30 years our region, however, has been diversifying its economic base. The Illawarra region used to be based around two major employers: steelmaking and coal producing. One fed the other. I come from five generations of coalminers and certainly am well aware in my own family of the close relationship between those two industries. Although steelmaking and coal production are still very important to the Illawarra, region has diversified to include a worldclass and nationally significant research university and TAFE institute, a growing health and community sector, and a property and financial services sector. Our big employers were once BHP and coal companies. Today that is shared between the University of Wollongong and our TAFE campuses, our hospitals and aged-care facilities, our banking and superannuation fund administrators. Our region has been through tough economic times before. In 1982-83 the then 'Big Australian', BHP, threatened to walk away from steelmaking. BHP threatened to close its works at Port Kembla. It took a Labor government then, the Hawke government, to design what came to be known as the Button steel plan to save the steel industry in Australia. During the implementation of the Button steel plan, which began in 1984, both the company and combined unions went through a process of modernisation, work practice improvements, capital investment and an investment in people. BlueScope Steel today-today's incarnation of BHP-operated a world-class, low-cost and competitive, modernised steel plant. The Port Kembla steel plant located in our area is a product of that Labor government's steel plan. On 22 August this year BlueScope Steel announced that it needed to restructure its operations because of the higher exchange rate, the higher cost inputs from iron ore and coking coal, and the sluggish steel demand across the globe. Unfortunately, that decision involves substantial job losses in the Illawarra-not only for BlueScope Steel workers but also the company's suppliercontractors. The very same day of the announcement, the Prime Minister and other senior cabinet ministers announced a $140 the million assistance package for the Illawarra region. This is one of the largest regional structural adjustment packages introduced by a Commonwealth government to assist in the economic transitioning for a region. It is important to place on record the difference in assistance provided to Wollongong and to Newcastle, when its steel industry was affected in 1997. The Howard government at that time provided $10 million in adjustment assistance for BHP workers. This was matched by the then Carr Labor government. I do not criticise the assistance provided by the Howard government or the Carr government, but I think it is important to recognise that this Labor government did provide an important and significant assistance package to the Illawarra. The package has three elements. First, the bringing forward of $100 million under the Steel Transformation Fund, which will help BlueScope Steel implement a new business model and help it to produce new products. It should be emphasised at this point that the opposition has indicated, even prior to the BlueScope Steel decision on 22 August, that it intends to oppose the Steel Transformation Plan. As I said in my contribution to the carbon bill debate, I believe that is hypocrisy at its most flagrant. They are weasel words from the opposition-to express concern about the BlueScope Steel situation but not indicate they will support the Steel Transformation Plan. It is not only the importance of supporting the steel industry because steel is so important to our region, but it should be acknowledged that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for industry have told us that they will oppose the $300 million fund to help the steel industry transition to a low-carbon economy. I note my colleague the member for Gilmore is in the House and I would hope that she and perhaps Senator Fierravanti-Wells will, in arguing to their own side, convince them to support the steel bill because it is important support to our local region. This is no longer a theoretical or conceptual debate; it is real time and the workers in the Illawarra depend on this fund, BlueScope Steel depends on the fund. We should stop playing politics, be responsible and support the bill. Secondly, the government has announced a $10 million employment assistance package to help displaced workers find other jobs, to retrain for other industries, to up-skill and to relocate if they need to. Later this week, a jobs market-a Commonwealth government initiative-will be held at Unanderra where under one roof over two days affected workers from BlueScope and their suppliercontractors will be able to obtain advice and assistance, including meeting potential employers in the mining, resource and engineering sectors. Thirdly, the government has established a $30 million Investment and Innovation Fund to help local businesses innovate and expand their operations in the region. This fund is a co-investment fund. At the conclusion, we should have been able to secure a doubling of the Commonwealth's investment to create a $60 million injection in the region's economy. At the same time, the Prime Minister has announced the establishment of the Illawarra Stakeholders Task Force, chaired by the Secretary of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Dr Don Russell, to co-ordinate that response. In the few minutes left to me, I just want to mention some other Commonwealth investments in our region that have proved significant to manufacturing. We have contributed $43.8 million to build the Australian Institute for Innovative Materials at the University of Wollongong's innovation campus. This was showcased on 29 August at an Illawarra manufacturing expo following the visit to Wollongong by the Prime Minister. Senator Kim Carr, the minister, opened the expo, which brought together a range of Commonwealth agencies to assist manufacturing companies innovate, demonstrate their capability to be involved in big investment projects-such as those outlined by my colleague, the member for Throsby-and to export. Over 100 manufacturing representatives met with these Commonwealth officials and, importantly, researchers from the institute to foster new funded relationships. Given the new Research and Development Tax Credit program introduced by this government and targeted at smaller businesses, the institute will become a very important partner for the manufacturing sector in Wollongong. I also highlight the Commonwealth's investment of $25 million to build the new Sustainable Building Research Centre, located next to the institute I have just discussed at the innovation campus. This new research centre has a fantastic partnership with the Illawarra Institute of TAFE and BlueScope Steel to introduce innovative building materials and building skills for clean energy workers into the future. They will design and create new products and services dedicated to improving the existing built environment. It will be the first in Australia to be assessed under the Living Building Challenge initiative. The future of manufacturing can at times appear gloomy in Australia, particularly at times when the dollar is at the level that is at, but I am and remain an optimist about the future of the sector. Around one million Australians are employed in the sector. This has been consistent across the last decade. Treasury modelling suggests manufacturing output is projected to grow by 70 per cent to 2050. The latest national count shows that manufacturing in general is actually growing in Australia. Metal products rose 14 per cent for the quarter and 16 per cent to June. However, we acknowledge that the manufacturing sector does face challenges. But it is resilient and one of the most creative of our economic sectors. The government has already introduced a number of initiatives to help in this transition. All of the programs that we have introduced will be cut by the opposition. Importantly, we have introduced and approved the Australian Industry Participation Plan for all new Australian government contracts worth more than $20 million. Indeed, as the Prime Minister has indicated, we are considering publishing plans and outcomes for the AIP. I commend the fact that my colleague has introduced this motion to the House and reaffirm our ongoing commitment to the manufacturing sector. (Time expired) Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (20:33): I rise today to speak on the motion put forward by the member for Throsby and to speak specifically on the need to develop and maintain a diverse economy and to support local manufacturers. For many years now the Gold Coast economy has been very dependent on tourism and construction, as these industries have been our strongest and most prosperous. However, in recent years, there has been a downturn in both sectors, resulting in higher than unemployment levels, particularly on the southern Gold Coast. The Gold Coast is well placed though to diversify and broaden its economic base, particularly in manufacturing. It is fair to say that manufacturers throughout Australia are doing it tough now that and have for some time. More than 136,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost over the last 3½ years. This downward trend needs to be stopped and preferably reversed so that we are creating manufacturing jobs. I recently held a manufacturing round-table with the member for Indi and a number of manufacturers from the southern Gold Coast. Many of these businesses are facing an uncertain time due to various factors, including the high Australian dollar and reduced spending patterns as Australians continue to tighten their belts. Many are also struggling to find the skilled workers needed to produce high-quality products. I believe that one of the issues that we must address is the way that trade training, in particular, is undertaken in Australia at this point in time. We know that there is a relatively low completion rate for apprenticeships, with the national completion rate of approximately 55 per cent when factors such as the apprentice changing their employer are taken into account. On the southern Gold Coast we have the Australian Industry Trade College, the AITC, which is dedicated to preparing year 11 and 12 students for a career in industry. The college has been successful in achieving over 530 school based apprenticeships in over 50 different trade qualifications. The unique program and flexible learning pathway provided by the AITC allow students to graduate with a Queensland Certificate of Education as well as significant work experience, knowledge and skills in their chosen field. Currently, there average are around 300 students enrolled at the college and half of these students will be on campus at any one time attending classes in a custom-designed curriculum that includes English communication, mathematics A-or prevocational maths-business, information technology and physical wellness. All students must also engage in community service. Other fields of study include a certificate III Australian school based apprenticeship, delivered offsite at a registered training organisation. The work experience component is run consecutively, and students swap from their classroom to the workplace every four weeks, alternating as two groups. At the AITC, students are assigned case managers to offer advice and support during the two years that they are enrolled at the college. Through this customised learning approach and support structure, students have the confidence and skill sets to succeed in the workforce as apprentices and trainees. The AITC completion rate for apprenticeships is about 68 per cent, which in turn is about 13 per cent above the national average. A recent Deloitte Access Economics study found that skill shortages were jeopardising $254 billion worth of mining projects in the planning pipeline. It identified five key trade qualifications-electricians, production technicians, mechanical fitters and boilermakers-as the most severe skill shortage areas. Three of those tradeselectricians, mechanical fitters boilermakers-are also key to the manufacturing sector. An appropriate trade trading program needs to be implemented. As I said earlier, the Gold Coast is well placed to further develop its manufacturing base, which I believe is already diverse. To demonstrate this point, I would like to speak about three of our local manufacturing sectors and some of the barriers to their productivity and success that the government should be addressing. Let me start with engineering and speak about one of our local manufacturers, the Rockcrush Group, one of the top engineering manufacturing groups in Australia, with over 100 years combined experience. They are located in Burleigh Heads, in one of the industrial estates in MCPherson, and their core business includes the manufacture of marine winches, mining winches, general winches and also dredges. Rockcrush pride themselves on the export of these dredges, which are designed to be used in a variety of industry applications around the world. Because of its unique market position, Rockcrush is in the enviable position of being able to expand its operations and increase the number of boilermakers it employs. However, there have been issues in finding skilled and experienced boilermakers on the Gold Coast, as many are now attempting to seek employment in regions with major manufacturing industries. Rockcrush will also be affected by the proposed carbon tax and may well be forced to move some of its manufacturing base from Australia to an offshore location. Clearly, if this were to happen, there would be an immediate impact on jobs as well as a loss of local expertise in this specialised area. drillers, I have spoken in this place on a number of occasions about the surfboard manufacturing industry. I wish to again highlight the importance it plays in my electorate. Industry and leaders have advised me that the following issues have impacted on them: firstly, the high Australian dollar and increased competition from overseas manufacturers; secondly, cheap, imported boards that are not appropriately labelled so that it is clear to Australian surfers that they are buying a board that was manufactured overseas and not from an Australian shaper; thirdly, keen surfers, who would normally change their boards every six months, are holding onto them for perhaps two years because the rising cost of living has left them with little or no discretionary spending ability; and, fourthly, skilled labour shortages. There is currently no formal traineeship or apprenticeship for surfcraft manufacturing, and this needs to be addressed as a priority. The third sector I would like to speak about tonight is the textile, clothing and footwear sector. One of the nation's largest listed apparel companies, Billabong, is based in my electorate of MCPherson. It employs over 2,000 people locally as part of an international workforce of 8,000. There are also a number of smaller TCF businesses on the southern Gold Coast. We are all well aware in this place that TCF industries have struggled to remain internationally competitive for some time and that the sector has undergone significant changes over recent years. Having been involved in that sector myself over a number of years, I was very interested to read about the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Capability Program. According to the application form: The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Capability Program is a competitive, merit based grants program. It funds strategic projects that increase innovation across Textile, Clothing and Footwear industries … That certainly sounds very positive. It then goes on to say: Confirming your eligibility first can save you a lot of time and effort. That prompted me to look at what the eligibility requirements are. One of those requirements, amongst others, is that: … the entity (if a clothing manufacturer) is accredited in accordance with the Homeworkers' Code of Practice or is seeking accreditation … A quick call to AusIndustry confirmed that, yes, indeed, a clothing manufacturer had to be accredited or be seeking accreditation through Ethical Clothing Australia to be eligible for the TCF Strategic Capability Program. There are various fees that are applicable for accreditation, based on a number of factors. The Ethical Clothing Australia website indicates that it can cost up to $6,000 for that accreditation. Businesses that are not accredited or seeking accreditation are not eligible to be considered for funding. There is no opportunity for the manufacturer to demonstrate compliance or adherence to the code. This criteria also completely dismisses membership of independent global ethical standards bodies and compliance with relevant international standards. In addition, some clothing manufacturers do not engage home workers. It is nonsensical for such manufacturers to have to be accredited or seeking accreditation for a code of conduct that applies to workers that they do not have. There is a future for the manufacturing industry in Australia and on the southern Gold Coast, but this potential future is in jeopardy due to the actions being taken by this government. There is the capacity to increase manufacturing and workforce participation in this area, with a number of industrial estates in MCPherson already available. However, if the Gold Coast and Australian manufacturing industries are allowed to continue to shrink by the Labor government, this opportunity to diversify the local and national economy will pass long before any benefits can be harnessed.",176
359,Mr CHAMPION,COMMITTEES," It is a great pleasure to be talking about manufacturing in the House again. We have to thank the member for Throsby, who has been a tireless advocate of his electorate and of manufacturing generally. I think he has been one of the people who has really rammed home and helped to explain, not just to this House but also to the Australian people, some of the challenges that manufacturing now faces. We have heard a lot about the two-speed economy. Last year we had a pretty torrid debate about the mining sector and whether or not they should be taxed. We are now starting to see, I think, the effects of a high currency, a currency that is a reflection of our economic success-let us not hide from that. Having a high currency does bring us benefits in higher prices for our exports. It lowers import costs and input costs. It is an important thing. It is a sign of the world's confidence in this country and its future, so we should acknowledge the benefits of the high currency and not be shy about that. We should also understand that the economy has been growing and jobs have been growing throughout this period. Despite a global financial crisis, despite the twospeed economy, despite a high currency, jobs continue to grow. We heard that from the previous speaker, the member for MCPherson, who talked about manufacturing companies in her electorate which were continuing to put on employees and, indeed, could not find skilled labour. It is interesting to hear some of the more balanced contributions from some of those oppositethose who say that we do have a lot to be happy about and to celebrate in this country. There is no doubt that this period does bring some challenges for manufacturing. We face a situation where a high dollar is putting pressure on our industries. That is not something that is unique to Australia. If you look at Brazil, they have got problems with currency appreciation, and, most recently, the Swiss have had problems with the franc rapidly appreciating. So this is a problem that is present around the world. We have heard a lot about Dutch disease and the perils of that, and that is one of the reasons the government is bringing the budget back into surplus. It is one of the reasons we are introducing a minerals resource rent tax, and it is one of the reasons why we have got a big investment into skills in this country. It is interesting to hear those opposite talk about skills. I do think that this issue needs a long-term discussion and I think we do need a bit of goodwill on both sides. Just simply slinging insults at one another will not help. We should, where possible, seek out areas of common interest in the national interest, and I do think skills might be one of those.",181
360,Unknown,COMMITTEES,Opposition members interjecting,182
361,Mr CHAMPION,COMMITTEES,"Peace in our time! Don't worry, I'll get stuck into you later on. I think we have probably always got more in common than we have differences. I think the country basically faces a choice between co-investment and capitulation. We either capitulate to these market forces, run up the white flag and let jobs move offshore and say that manufacturing is dead, and maybe just accept that that is part of the process of a strong currency and high prices for our minerals, or we have co-investment. I have seen this co-investment in my own electorate with Holden and an investment of $149 million to develop the Cruze, now the No. 3 selling car in Australia, and an extra 265 jobs at Holden. This is a product which is selling, and you can tell it is selling, because wherever you go, in the supermarket car parks of this country, there are Cruzes driving around. I would urge those opposite to look at that. We now see it with the Commodore and $40 million invested in developing the Commodore with new lightweight panels and new technology to make them more efficient. Again, we have got more secure jobs. We saw it at Holden with our big investments during the global financial crisis where the company did have some difficulties with demand, and so the government and the company had a coinvestment in training the workforce. During that down time, rather than people being off work they were in training, preparing for the launch of the Cruze. So we see that where co-investments are made we can have productive, profitable companies and we can have companies that are domestically successful. I have every confidence that in the future they will be successful with exporting police cars to the United States. We are not alone in this. The United Kingdom have recently invested £200 million. They had one particular plant with Nissan-a battery plant where they coinvested £20 million to get that in place. is something that is happening all over in other countries. Other countries help by tariffs. India has got a tariff of 105 per cent-to give people some understanding of the international environment. We see that where we have co-investment we have success. While some of those opposite, like the member for Mayo, the Marty MCFly of the parliament-he has a great love of Back to the Future-focuses on places like Mitsubishi and the hard-luck stories, I prefer to focus on the success stories that we have had in the last few years under this government's program. We know that the Liberal Party oscillate between reassurance on one side of it-they have got all these vague reassurances on one hand and not really talking about their policies; some of them come in here very reassuringly about jobs and then they rattle on about the carbon tax for a while-and the other side of it is pretty significant. We have the member for Mayo perhaps sending messages more to his own party than to this side of parliament about co-investment. He talks about the enormous markets of the flat world. You might want to tell that to the Indians, with the 105 per cent tariff, or Thailand, where they have about 80 per cent tariff on Commodores. When we first introduced these assistance measures to the car industry, Tony Abbott said: 'There have been a lot of assistance packages for the car industry, and the real issue for any future package is: just how long is this going to last? Will the car industry in this country ever be able to stand on its own two feet? Will Kevin Rudd be able to give a guarantee that any new package of assistance really will be the last package?' We have that undermining. Before Tony Abbott was Leader of the Opposition he would maybe This have told a different story today to car workers in South Australia; maybe he would not. We had Joe Hockey say: 'I don't know that it is necessarily the right thing to hand money immediately to the motor vehicle industry in Australia without knowing whether those key companies are going to be merging or won't even exist in 12 months.' That is what he said in 2007, when we put in place our co-investment plan. The opposition are very clear about what they will do, in many respects. They talk in circles, there are lots of reassurances and lots of banging on about the carbon tax, but, when you get right down to it, they will cut $500 million out of the Automotive Transformation Scheme. That is what they will do. They will put the sledgehammer to jobs in South Australia and Victoria and manufacturing jobs in New South Wales. We hear the member for Mayo talking about Mitsubishi. That is what he wants to talk about all the time. He wants to talk about the stories of job losses. That is what they want to talk about; they do not want to talk about the successes. This country does have a choice. We have a choice between co-investment, which is the Labor way, which is investing in research, high technology, exports that are going to sell and having a manufacturing sector at the end of this whole process of our terms of trade; or the Liberal Party way, which will be capitulation, which will be to run up the white flag to say we cannot compete and to simply rely on an unrestrained, untaxed mining sector which will simply run rampant. When they have finished digging, they will be off and that will be the end of The Labor way is to provide jobs and a stable and diverse economy for the long term. Mrs GASH (Gilmore) (20:53): Whilst I certainly support some parts of the member's motion, I rise to speak against the subtle thrust of other parts of his motion and remind the House that last Thursday the Member for Throsby made a statement in an MPI on the impact of the carbon tax on Australian industry. I would like to take umbrage over some of his then comments in relation to this motion. My reason for doing so is that he and I share an interest in the economy of the Illawarra. The northern end of the electorate of Gilmore now encompasses parts of the old seat of Throsby, so I cannot allow him to go unchallenged with the rather rosy picture he is trying to paint of conditions there. The motion he puts forward is constructed on a denial of events affecting his own constituents, constructed on platitudes and not an honest assessment of what is needed. The member seems oblivious to the state of the manufacturing industry, especially in his own backyard. He is oblivious to the fact that BlueScope Steel has just cut 800 jobs from its operations in Port Kembla. He is oblivious to the fact that another 69 jobs have just gone from the Australian Steel Mill Services at Port Kembla, with many others in the pipeline. He is oblivious to the effect is having on contractors and subcontractors who have lost their livelihoods because of failed government projects. He seems oblivious to the fact that the unemployment rate for the June quarter in Throsby is pushing 7½ per cent and that will rise as the steel works job losses start feeding in. The Shoalhaven is at 10 per cent and rising, and the government has no answers. He is oblivious to the no-show of trade it. centres that we were promised. He cleverly ignores the fact that Regional Development Australia gave nothing to the Illawarra even with the solid evidence of dramatic job losses under their noses, even without a carbon tax. Yet there he was last Thursday berating the opposition for being all doom and gloom. We have every reason to be so for next year when the carbon tax kicks in. Is the member suggesting unemployment is going to fall in the Illawarra? Is he suggesting that the manufacturing industry in his backyard will not rationalise some of its operations in response and that part of that rationalisation will mean job losses? As a former union official, he would have tracked the gradual decline of industrial activity in Port Kembla over the years. He would have seen jobs whittled away from a time when the steelworks employed 23,000 people, through the recession we had to have, to a figure of about 10 per cent of that. If he was any sort of trade union leader, he would know that the figures he spruiked on Thursday relied heavily on the mining industry. In his motion he is warning that we should not let the performance of the mining industry eclipse the poor performance of the rest of the economy. My question to the member is: if that is the case, and you are fully aware, why aren't you doing something about it? Take mining out of the equation this and what would be left? Surely he must be now aware of an article in Friday's Australian Financial Review which reports that, and I quote from a comment by Commsec economist, Savanth Sebastian, who said: The prospects for the manufacturing industry not good. This is a highly professional economist who did not just pluck that statement out of thin air. He has been watching industry for some considerable time, analysing data, assessing, forecasting, and working the figures. The only thing the member for Throsby has been working on is the desperate regurgitation of spin in the face of all the evidence to the contrary. Mr Jones says the government's economic modelling is predicting 1.6 million new jobs will be created by 2020. The question is: are these actual extra jobs, on top of what we have now, or are they going to be the mickey mouse green jobs this government is going to fabricate to save face? A recent study in the United Kingdom shows that, for every green job that is created, almost four real jobs were lost. I put that observation to the Prime Minister, but she refused to directly answer the question. The Australian Financial Review reported that for the three months to August, the economy shed 14,000 jobs-the biggest quarterly decline in seven years. Over the past 3½ years, 136,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Australia; yet the motion calls for training. Great-if you have a job or you can get a job. Yet in his motion, the member for Throsby states that Australia should have open and transparent tendering arrangements so that Australian industry can compete on an equal basis with international companies for major resource projects. What a joke! How can Australia be competitive when most of our competitor countries do not impose or will not impose this carbon tax on production costs? Over the past year alone, 53,800 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Australia. Over the past six months, the period that coincides with the time during are which Australia has been under the threat of the introduction of the carbon tax, 49,400 manufacturing jobs have been lost and, overall, the total number of manufacturing jobs is now down to 945,600. These are verifiable Bureau of Statistics figures. Westpac has noted that household unemployment expectations have risen 8.5 per cent this month. People think things are going to get worse. Their economist, Justin Smirk, says that 'the reading was consistent with other measures of a deteriorating labour market.' Hardly a rosy picture being painted by the experts and certainly totally opposite to the yarn the Member for Throsby was trying so hard to push. It is also reported that the government has resisted growing pressure to conduct an inquiry into the future of manufacturing. Can they be afraid of what might be revealed? But apparently it has scheduled another one day talkfest on jobs for October 6th. One day! The member is either deluding himself, his electorate or is just panicking and grasping at straws. Yet his colleagues in the trade union movement are worried and have been calling on government intervention in the manufacturing industry. If the farce of the hastily convened joint select committee on the energy bills is any guide, then the government is going to resist any inquiry that is bound to cast even more doubt over this ill-conceived carbon tax. But the Member for Throsby is not worried. It is not his job on the line. The previous day, the member was also waxing lyrical about what fantastic things were happening at Port Kembla-but again made no mention of the job losses that were happening at the same time all around him. He is still prattling on about how Australia was set to achieve a five per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2020. Yet this government's own modelling shows that emissions will increase from 578 million tonnes in 2012 to 621 million tonnes in 2020, despite the carbon tax. Apparently this minor inconsistency should not stand in the way of a good story. He said in his Wednesday statement that it was no secret that he has a lot to say about the manufacturing industry, but he omitted to share with us the details of his government's plan to fix the problem. His motion calls for policies. Well, Member for Throsby, where are they? You are in government after all. All words and no action. It is just unfortunate that what he is saying seems to have little bearing on the unfolding reality. Make no mistake: the manufacturing industry in the Illawarra is in decline, and it has much to do with the self-serving spin of Labor politicians like the member for Throsby and the member for Cunningham, who prefer to sweep problems under the carpet so that issues are not realistically confronted until it is too late. It is a far cry a job? from what his predecessor and former colleague, Jennie George, had to say and also a far cry from the brutal assessment of the former state Labor member for Kiama and former Mayor of Shellharbour, Bob Harrison. Neither was afraid to put the needs of their constituents ahead of party politics, because they understood what was really happening at the grassroots level and actually listened to what was being said. Our rate of manufacturing production has not only begun to stall; it has gone backwards. In a listing of industrial production for 42 countries in the most recent issue of the Economist, we were ranked 41st, only in front of Greece. One of my constituents has just returned from Germany and says that nearly everything you buy there-clothes, food, hardware-is made in Germany. If you see two Japanese cars, it is a rarity. How do we compare in Australia? This rather cleverly constructed motion pretends to be doing something when really nothing practical or timely is being done. They are an inept and incompetent government and no amount of their grandiose statements will change the fact. The member's motion is deliberately loaded to give the impression that they care. They do not. Take part 1(c) of the motion, which says: the Australian Government has an agenda for nation building, innovation and improving the productive performance of business and industry, but … more can be done in this area; Sorry, but I have to disagree with that observation. I would have to say that the only positive initiative would be to have the guts to call an early election. The government's policies are about nothing more than desperately preserving the status quo of power. What good, Member for Throsby, is compensation if you do not have Mr LAURIE FERGUSON (Werriwa) (21:02): I congratulate the members for Cunningham andMr Briggs interjecting Mr LAURIE FERGUSON: I beg your pardon?",182
362,Mr Briggs,COMMITTEES,"I thought you were more of a CFMEU man. Mr LAURIE FERGUSON: I congratulate the members for Cunningham and Throsby on bringing this resolution forward. Indisputably, even their worse detractors over there would concede that they have very close associations with industry in the Illawarra. I particularly noted the point made by the member for Cunningham concerning the contrast between what the previous government did in Newcastle and the swift action that has followed the terminations at BlueScope. All we are hearing from the opposition is their opposition to measures within that package. One of the most interesting parts of this debate so far has been the contrast between the contributions of two members on the opposite side. The member for MCPherson, who has an industrial relations background, obviously has a close knowledge of industry in her electorate. She gave examples of what is happening with industries in her electorate and saw the problems that this country faces as extremely broad: the Australian dollar and skills, as well as the spending patterns that are apparent in Australia at the moment. In contrast, the opposition's spokesperson, who put on quite a performance at the Press Club recently, came in here with the usual diatribe against various individuals in the government. It was the end of Western civilisation, according to the member for Indi, but she offered no answers whatsoever. As I said, she was at the Press Club and there we saw her call for more collaboration between researchers and simultaneously saying that we should abolish innovation councils, where that collaboration actually happens. We saw her praising greenhouse gas reductions in this country by manufacturers but claiming manufacturing had no place in the clean energy future. We heard her say that her major contribution to industry in this country would be to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and get rid of the $4.8 billion industry investment in technology and development. It is interesting to note figures from Dave Oliver from the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union about the realities of what is happening internationally. The size of the global clean energy economy is $6 trillion. Today the opposition spokesperson, as last week at the Press Club, did not come forward with any real initiatives. As I say, her contribution is to abolish initiatives in this area, not to assist industry to develop, expand and go into new areas. I noted Oliver's comment: … we are now facing a wave of hostility to this record investment. Instead of welcoming the opportunity … we hear all kinds of arguments … bemoaning the package. Those comments, made in the Drum on 14 July, are the reality. This motion calls for a diverse industry. It is important to electorates like my own. We still have agriculture and the University of Western Sydney, which has an expanding presence. We have high rates of government employment in the state and, of course, a manufacturing base which is structured around two circumstances: the fact that there are a lot of greenfield sites in Werriwa and the fact that it is in close proximity to important networks. As the member for MCPherson pointed out, the situation that we face in this country industry, is complex. It is not simple, as the member for Indi would suggest. We are in a situation where the Australian dollar has made it very difficult for companies to compete. The member who spoke before me talked about that what we face with regard to import barriers in other countries. It is preposterous to say that we can actually counter that, but, as I say, the situation with the dollar is not a simple one. It means that some of our imports are cheaper for other parts of our sector. It means that our export products can make enhanced profits. This motion displays the government's determination to make sure that the manufacturing industry is preserved in this country. I congratulate the mover of the motion.",186
363,Mr FLETCHER,COMMITTEES," The essence of this motion is to recommend a new layer of bureaucracy which is supposedly going to be the magic potion to protect and stimulate manufacturing. In the member's dream world, there is a requirement that all major resource projects have an Australian Industry Participation Plan. This is a bad idea which goes in the wrong direction. What we need in Australia are policies which stimulate economic activity in the private sector rather than try to pick winners in any particular industry or sector. What is the first thing that any sensible government should do to achieve this objective? It is to do no harm. Yet we have seen the precise opposite of that from the Rudd-Gillard government. We have seen a determination to impose a cost burden on Australian industry which, through the imposition of a carbon tax, makes it uncompetitive with competitors based in other nations around the world. What have people in the manufacturing sector to say about this carbon tax? Mr Lindsay Partridge, the managing director of Brickworks, had this to say: The end result will be an exodus of manufacturing industries and offshore, jobs will be lost, the cost of housing will increase and there will be no change to carbon emissions. We have also seen increasing rigidities in the labour market under this government's legislation, which bears the Orwellian title of Fair Work Act. 'Do no harm' should be the first principle of government, but this government has been enthusiastically doing everything it can to interfere with the productive operation of Australian industry. What are they now suggesting? They are suggesting Australian Industry Participation Plans. What a useless piece of window dressing! I speak with some direct experience, because telecommunications sector in 1997 a requirement was imposed for carrier industry development plans. This emerged from the very same worthy impulse that government can make things better by imposing the requirement for a plan. I was a senior executive at Optus for eight years. I had accountability for the production of the industry development plan, and I assure you that it was a useless waste of time. It was time-consuming, costly and cumbersome and made not one bit of difference to the very considerable contributions made to industry development by Optus and other companies in the telecommunications sector. So, despite the best instincts of the member for Throsby to engage in well meaning government intervention-nice pieces of paper to be filled out in an earnest and worthy way-the experience is that these kinds of measures make absolutely no difference. This point was accepted by the Productivity Commission when in 2001 it recommended repeal of the completely useless industry development plan regime. One can only imagine the horror with which the Productivity Commission would view the recommendation contained in this motion by investment the member for Throsby. What would be a more sensible direction for us to pursue in order to promote economic activity and ensure that the benefits of the resources boom are captured as widely as possible? Being charitable, I am prepared to concede that this intention underlies this manifestly ill-conceived motion brought forward this evening by the member for Throsby. An excellent recent report by Port Jackson Partners entitled Earth, fire, wind and water: economic opportunities and the Australian commodities cycle says: … the opportunities and benefits of the commodities boom can accrue more broadly than in the is commonly understood. They recommend an approach which is focused on building capacity and enabling growth by: accelerating and streamlining development processes and enacting other supportive policiessuch as aless expansive fiscal policyI do not hear much support for that from the government benches-and by appropriate tax policies and by the: encouragement of foreign investment … Let us do sensible things to encourage manufacturing rather than implement another earnest and useless bureaucratic measure.",187
364,Ms BURKE,COMMITTEES," welcome the motion moved by the member for Throsby because it goes to the heart of a matter of great concern to many in my electorate of Chisholm: the decline in manufacturing jobs. Unlike the previous speaker, I have seen where Australian industry partnership agreements have worked in practice in a range of cases rather than been forced down the throats of companies or individuals. People have seen the benefits of having long-term, stable relationships with their suppliers. For an example I only need look to Toyota and its relationships with many of its suppliers-in particular, in my electorate, its relationship with Unidrive. Unidrive has 300 employees, and they are guaranteed ongoing work because the company has developed a long term, stable relationship with their major deliverer of component parts. Toyota comes on a yearly basis and trains up people at Unidrive in their skills and techniques; they also send staff from Unidrive to Japan on a very regular basis so that they can see how quality control is implemented there. Half the staff now refer to many of their processes in Japanese lingo, because that is how it is done in Japan. So relationship building is really important, and that is what we are talking about. We also need to look at why Australia's economic credentials remain strong. The federal government's action during the global financial crisis and the resilience of the Australian economy mean that our economy continues to outperform other advanced economies. Australia's unemployment rate is incredibly low regardless of what those on the other side are saying. Recent national accounts figures said that jobs in manufacturing had increased, not declined. We also have low government debt and record terms of trade that show that our I fundamentals are strong and our economic prospects are bright. We are indeed the envy of the developed world. In light of the potentially difficult global economic climate, this government understands that highskilled, high-wage jobs ensure diversity and adaptability and prepare us for an uncertain future. We know that we cannot afford to put all our eggs in one basket, and that diversity ensures that economic benefits spread to all Australians. We also need to realise that there are more jobs in manufacturing in Australia than there are in the mining sector. We need to realise where the jobs actually are. There are also more jobs in the service sector, and we need to remember the decline in the service sector and where we need to put money. We are looking at innovation representing a key element of building upon our current and future economic prosperity. Nowhere is this more evident than in my electorate of Chisholm, which features highly-skilled innovative research and development work. I recently had the opportunity to visit the polymers CRC in my electorate, which has been in operation since 1992. You only need to look at the joint venture between its current participants, which includes nine universities, government research organisations, CSIRO and ANSTO and its commercial arm with many businesses. It draws on world-competitive comprising leading researchers from its industry participants and the best researchers in Australia, drawn from across universities and government laboratories, for delivering its planned research outcomes. Their major emphasis is on developing technologies and products to improve health, to enable greater food and water security and for producing low-cost solar energy. The use of products based on CRC technology has provided a range of benefits including productivity gains and the creation of high skilled, highvalue manufacturing jobs. I also recently visited CSIRO, which has one of its largest headquarters in my seat of Chisholm. It is also the key precinct in Clayton, which is my electorate, for materials and manufacturing science. We need to look at science and research as leading to greater industry and greater development, not with this complete negativity. At CSIRO in my electorate one of the things they are working on is titanium alloys-they are light and strong and the current production methods are too costly to expand their use beyond the aerospace market. Leading researchers from the US have been attracted to CSIRO to work on this titanium product. There is market capitalisation going on that will lead to many jobs, and we need to look at this as the way forward. Part of the motion tonight looks at how to develop all these things together. We are doing many things in this sector that we need to be proud of instead of talking it down all the time. We need to talk up the Australian economy. We need to talk about where the jobs are, how to develop them and how to create them. Tragically I, like others before, have seen manufacturing jobs lost from my electorate. The recent announcement by Bosch that 360 jobs are going to go by the end of the year is a crying shame. They do teams, not actually need to be going. The recent closure of Australian Envelopes, which was a money grab by the company, did not need to happen. We also need to look at what manufacturing employers do to their own staff.",189
365,Mr BRIGGS,COMMITTEES," I am not sure whether the member for Chisholm was speaking for the motion or against it given the positive outlook she had for manufacturing in Australia. I support what she said; Australia has got a very strong and diversified manufacturing sector. Some parts are performing very well at the moment while some parts are struggling under the counterweight. Pressure has been put on it by a strongly performing resource sector, and I notice the member for Wakefield, when he was walking away from his position in the Labor Party as a disciple of Paul Keating, was saying towards the end of his contribution that the success of the resource sector is apparently now a terrible thing. 'We're going to dig it all up and they're just going to leave,' was, I think, the direct quote from the member for Wakefield. The motion moved by the member for Throsby was in part a good motion. In other parts it is an appalling step back to the future for some members of the Labor Party who are trying to send a signal of false hope to people who are going through difficult times, and they should be ashamed of themselves. They have walked away from their great Hawke-Keating traditions that we hear about so often in this place-about the reformist, the open economist, the move to a competitive global environment-and moved back to providing industry plans, as the member for Bradfield put it so well in his contribution to this debate. With nearly one million people employed in it, the manufacturing sector is important to our economy. We will always have a manufacturing sector, and we should have one, but we will not have a manufacturing sector which is subsidised by government because we know that government subsidies do not work. The member for Wakefield can call it whatever he likes-he can call it coinvestment. If the Labor Party is so desperate to run businesses it should go and try to run a business. Co-investment is the new way of describing it. It is sophistry at its finest from the member for Wakefield. But so hypocritical are those in the government and their friends on this side that, at a time when car manufacturers are under the greatest pressure we have seen because of the dollar and other competitiveness pressures internationally, what do the Toyota workers do under their leadership of the AMWU? They walk off the job. What a shock! We have absolute pressure, we are hearing from them day in, day out; we have a motion before the parliament saying that the industry is going to fall over if we do not intervene and have co-investment, as the member for Wakefield put it. And what do the Toyota workers do? 'We'll go off the job! We may as well. Why wouldn't we?' Come on, give me a break! This highlights an utter hypocrisy. As the member for Gilmore and the member for Indi said so well regarding this Labor Party: its members talk in this chamber from the green leather of that side, but when they are out there with their mates in the AMWU they walk everyone off the job when workers are under great pressure, and they expect the taxpayer to co-invest to keep the industry going. That is the great hypocrisy of the modern Labor Party. Paul Keating will be at home tonight with his head hung in shame that one of his disciples, sitting there, refuses to continue along the path that he knows Australia should continue on. As I said before: go forwards, not backwards; let us keep moving forward. The member for Wakefield is a good example. The modern Labor Party reminds me of Ronald Reagan's most famous contribution to American public life, where he said, describing the government: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidise it. That is what this motion is about. This motion is the confirmation of what Ronald Reagan said so famously in the 1980s about a Democrat government. This is exactly what you could say about a Labor government these days. At a time when it knows parts of the manufacturing sector are under genuine pressure-and we agree that they are under genuine pressure-what does it do? It goes and puts the world's biggest carbon tax on them, putting them under more pressure. The second thing they will do is have their mates at the AMWU walk off the job at Toyota in Melbourne in the middle of the greatest pressure on the vehicle industry we have seen, but they will still come cap in hand for co-investment. Finally what you will have is the great re-regulation of the labour market to make it more difficult for these manufacturing employers to compete or to ensure that they are competitive going forward. I think that today the chairman of the congressional House of Representatives Committee on the Budget in the United  said, 'Governments shouldn't try and pick winners and losers in the marketplace; they should focus on the conditions for economic growth and let the private sector create jobs.'",190
366,Mr HUSIC,COMMITTEES," It is a pleasure to follow the member for Mayo, who I understand is a member of this society that they have formed, the Modest Members. They are so modest you never hear an idea out of them. That is modesty in the extreme-never having a positive idea to contribute to public debate. We saw more evidence of it tonight. This resolution and what has been put forward by the member for Throsby-and the member for Cunningham spoke on this earlier-is critical in terms of being able to recognise that this is a sector that contributes a great deal to the Australian economy and is going through one of its roughest patches, brought on by movements in currency-45 per cent in two years. We need to look at what can be done to assist the industry through this difficult period. Overall, manufacturing itself accounts for 34 per cent of all goods exported and generates about $84 billion of income for our country. Output is still growing in the face of pretty challenging times-about one per cent in the past year-and manufacturing creates close to a million jobs. In my neck of the woods, in Chifley, manufacturing generates about 10,000 jobs and 16½ per cent of all jobs in the electorate are as a result of manufacturing activity, probably the 10th highest of the seats across the country. The contribution of manufacturing to parts of Western Sydney is huge, and I think Fowler is the other seat that benefits greatly from contribution of manufacturing in Western Sydney. But, as I mentioned before, currency pressures, with the Australian dollar moving 45 per cent in two years and on top of that the Chinese currency being deliberately undervalued to the tune of about 40 per cent, mean that there are huge impacts on our sector. The motion itself talks about the way that we can assist industry through greater industry participation, and it certainly attempts to find ways to help a sector that is under pressure. Much has been made of the impact of mining in crowding out other sectors, and I wanted to see what some people in authoritative positions would be able to bring to this debate to assist us. I have to say that the Reserve Bank of Australia has made a few statements that have been real eyebrow raisers to me. We have had a lot to say about two-speed economies. While many look at the heat being generated by mining, we do need to look at other sectors of the economy and see what is happening there. It is certainly well documented in retail, for example, that they are concerned about flat retail output and concerned to see what can happen to induce greater growth there in the face of what is happening in the mining sector. Manufacturing is the other sector that has been very concerned about the growth of mining. When we looked recently at what Ric Battellino, the deputy Reserve Bank governor, had to say, I was quite astounded at what happened when we were looking for answers from someone in a position like that. He said: The structure of the economy is changing very dramatically and, one way or another, that is going to happen while the demand for resources is so strongthe a pretty straightforward statement, but then he said: The manufacturing sector is finding life more difficult with this exchange rate, and we've seen the result of that in recent days. But I don't think anybody can really work out what can be done about thatthis from the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank if you are looking for answers, and on top of that",191
367,Mr Briggs,COMMITTEES,"Oh, attacking the Reserve Bank now?",192
368,Mr HUSIC,COMMITTEES,"Well, they are independent, but they are supposed to be able to provide some sort of input as to where we might head, particularly in these rough times. Only adding to the position was the governor himself when he appeared on Friday, 26 August before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. He then went on to make an interesting series of comments about issues regarding individual businesses and negotiating flexibility in agreements-but, at the same time, ignoring fact. He said: What people say to me, I cannot verify it obviously, from their individual businesses is that they find it harder to negotiate flexibility. That is something that is said. If that is true that I a matter for concernan astounding comment, particularly when he says, 'I cannot verify it obviously.' Secondly, he said: What we do not do is get into political debates over particular policies. He ignores the fact that 64 per cent of awards and agreements have flexibility clauses in them. On top of that, it is a slap in the face for employees and unions who worked with employers through the GFC to ensure that there was flexibility through the difficulties of the GFC. If he wants to listen to business, why doesn'the talk up, for example, the need to tackle currency differentials in the broader international economy or listen to businesses who are keen to see what he might do on interest rates? Debate adjourned. NA Ms KATE ELLIS: I move: That the House do now adjourn. North Sydney Electorate: Mater Seidler, Mr Harry",192
369,Mr HOCKEY,ADJOURNMENT," Tonight I want to acknowledge the great work of one of the country's most renowned private hospitals, the Mater hospital in Crows Nest in Sydney. As many of you know, having a child is one of the most rewarding and exciting times of our lives. Admittedly it is also one of the most stressful periods-I suspect more for the mum than for the father. I am sure my colleagues in the chamber, both mothers and fathers, would be able to empathise. It is at this stressful and joyous time that we want the best environment for our children to enter the world and for our wives, in my case, to be cared for and looked after in such a way that they will be able to focus on the challenges think is and to go through the birthing pangs in a compassionate and supportive environment. For me and my wife, Melissa, the Mater hospital in North Sydney provided exactly that throughout the births of our three children: Xavier, Adelaide and Ignatius. I cannot speak highly enough of the quality of care and compassion given to us and so, too, to the parents of some 40,000 babies born at the Mater since the opening of its maternity unit in 1991. The Mater hospital maternity unit had its 20th reunion celebration last month, on 9 August, at the Crystal Ball venue in Luna Park. I was very privileged to be invited, along with, amongst others, Sarah Murdoch and Karl Stefanovic, as one of the many special guests and as a parent to attend the reunion. Like many of the parents and children who attended the 20th reunion, we were there to acknowledge and thank the staff and people who helped make the Mater hospital the unique place that it is, second to none, for their great work. Even though I was actually born at that Hospital hospital 46 years ago, it was a 20th reunion for the maternity unit. For over 105 years the Mater hospital has worked in partnership with patients and their families. Its holistic approach to health care and its unique patient care have to be commended. They are not just doctors and nurses and staff but care givers, who work together to ensure our safety, our well-being and our swift recovery. Once again, I would like to thank all the staff, especially the executive director, Robert Cusack, for his leadership and his commitment to seeing that the Mater excels in its performance. I would also like to pay tribute to a late friend of mine and an Australian icon, Harry Seidler. The late Harry Seidler is well known to many in this place for his outstanding architectural contribution not just here in Australia but around the world. He was more than an architect to me; he was a mate. Even though I disagreed with him from time to time and even had the odd political disagreement with his wife, Penelope, it is a great honour to have been asked to open Harry's Park, which is a public and cultural park currently under construction that will be a reminder of the significant contribution man has made to our nation. The park is located in my electorate, on the corner of Glen Street and Dind Street in Milsons Point. Let me first acknowledge his great architectural skills. Often referred to as one of the greatest and most influential architects ever to work in the Southern Hemisphere, Harry started his architectural study in Canada, before winning a scholarship to Harvard University. Arriving in Australia to commission the Rose Seidler House for his mother, his new and innovative style of architecture, which incorporated open-plan living and natural light, won him instant acclaim. He went on to design iconic buildings in Sydney such as the Australia Square tower, the MLC Centre and, I might add, Blues Point Tower, which I lived in and am very fond of. They changed the Australian landscape. Harry earned a special place in the history of modern architecture. He was born in Vienna in 1923 and his family left for England, when Harry was just 15, to escape Nazi occupation. Soon after, the English authorities interned his family and sent the Seidlers to Canada as 'enemy aliens'. Harry was eventually permitted to study architecture and structural engineering at the University of Manitoba. He graduated with first-class honours in 1944 and, in the following year, won a scholarship to the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he studied under architect Walter Gropius, formerly director of the famed Bauhaus in Germany. For me, part of the honour of being a member of parliament is to have opportunities like this to highlight the work of and pay tribute to people such as Harry Seidler who have helped transform our society and the nation in which we live. I am proud to be able to represent his interests here in this parliament. this National Health and Hospitals Reform",193
370,Mr NEUMANN,ADJOURNMENT," After many years of neglect by the previous coalition government, national health reform is delivering for a health and hospital system in Ipswich. The national health and hospitals reform is delivering new subacute services in Ipswich, providing more support for patients in the local community. Recently, the Hon. Nicola Roxon, the Minister for Health and Ageing, visited Ipswich. Together, we inspected a new rehabilitation centre and announced a boost to geriatric evaluation and management services at Ipswich Hospital. These new services will provide better assessment and rehabilitation care for elderly patients in the Ipswich and West Moreton region. It is part of a $16.52 million boost to West Moreton health services. Providing local communities such as Ipswich, with a fast-growing population, with resources is critical for adequate and proper health care. It is crucial that Ipswich gets support for local health and hospital reform. The $16.52 million investment in the Ipswich and West Moreton region over the next three years will provide for 10 subacute bed equivalent services, or an extra 3,280 occupied bed days, for geriatric evaluation and management at Ipswich General Hospital; six subacute beds at Boonah Hospital; a new community based adult rehabilitation service at Ipswich; and an expansion of palliative care outreach services across the Ipswich and West Moreton region, also benefiting the Lockyer Valley and the Somerset region, in my electorate. The new rehabilitation centre that we inspected will start operation in the new year and it is the first of its kind in the region. When the geriatric evaluation management service is fully operational it will provide, I say, an additional 3,280 bed days per annum at Ipswich General Hospital. That is the equivalent of 10 extra beds and it will make a big difference with respect to rehabilitation services in the whole area. part of a 1,300 subacute bed and community services commitment across the whole of Australia, including at least 265 beds and services to be delivered in Queensland. This is crucial. The facility we inspected will feature a kitchen and bathroom set-up, helping patients simulate a homelike environment as part of their therapy program. In addition, palliative care services will be expanded by approximately 800 appointments specifically for patients with heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This builds on Labor's already strong investments in the Ipswich and West Moreton region, including the GP superclinic which was so critical to the flood recovery evacuation in Ipswich. It is making sure that Ipswich residents get the care they need. Since this government was elected in 2007 we have committed $6.1 billion in new funding for Queensland's health and hospital system through national health reform. Locally, in the Ipswich area, that has included $16.7 million to increase paediatric emergency treatment places in Ipswich General Hospital; $1.7 million to fit out an additional operating theatre at Ipswich Hospital, which the federal Minister for Health and Ageing formerly visited with me; and $2.5 million for the Ipswich GP superclinic, of which the first stage is operational; eight general practitioner registrars in the Ipswich area; and over $700,000 for the healthy communities project, Healthy Active Ipswich. I congratulate the Ipswich City Council for their success. The project is aimed at making as sure that Ipswich has the healthiest community, through physical activity and improved healthy eating amongst adults, predominantly those not in the workforce. I note that some of this funding will go It is towards a very popular centre for the Ministry of Food. Jamie Oliver, of course, runs that internationally. The centre is located in Ipswich. The Ministry of Food is just one of the innovative programs that will benefit from the health community funding, with healthy cooking lessons expanded to help disadvantaged students. This is also part of the assistance we are giving the University of Queensland. The University of Queensland and the University of Southern Queensland have recently received a $712,000 investment in refurbishment and fit-out of clinics at those universities to improve clinical education and training infrastructure across the Ipswich and West Moreton region. And $690,000 was given to the University of Queensland to help refurbish and fit-out the clinical training and placement environment the Ipswich GP superclinic, on top of the $2.5 million we have committed. This is great for the local community. Micah Challenge Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (21:38): We all know that extreme, absolute poverty is occurring around the world. At least 900 million people do not have access to safe water and 2.6 billion do not have adequate sanitation facilities. It is a life that is difficult for an Australian to imagine. With the constant media attention on the many disasters around the world we can often be overwhelmed by the extent of need in our society. Charity is needed both at home and abroad and it is often difficult to know where to start. That is why I am speaking today to support the Micah Challenge and their 2011 Voices for Justice campaign. This year, as part of their aim to encourage world leaders to meet their commitments to the Millennium Development Goals, the Micah Challenge is focusing on safe water and sanitation. This campaign is particularly important, for whilst we have seen vast improvements in relation to some of the eight Millennium Development Goals, insufficient progress has been made on health goals. These include goal 4 focusing on child mortality and goal 5 focusing on maternal mortality. I am pleased that the Micah Challenge is drawing attention to these issues as, unlike natural disasters or war, these tragedies often do not make the headlines. It is difficult to imagine Australian children dying from diarrhoea as a result of not having access to clean water and it is now very rare in Australia for a mother to die during childbirth, yet around the world 8.1 million children die from basic illnesses brought on by a lack of sanitation, and 1,000 women die every day from complications during pregnancy or childbirth. The common theme in these causes of death is, in most cases, a lack of access to health care. Even in Port Moresby, our nearest neighbour, five mothers die in childbirth every day. And I would like to take this opportunity to commend the ongoing work by Dame Carol Kidu in this area. I also believe there is a great opportunity for corporations and governments to work together to achieve better outcomes, and I look at the excellent work being done by Oil Search in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, where they are working with and supporting local communities to deliver better health services for their people. The Micah Challenge has recently released a report that states that access to water, basic sanitation and hygieneincluded in Millennium Development Goal 7 regarding environmental sustainabilitycould hold the key to unlocking huge progress in development goals 4 and 5. The World Health Organisation has estimated that, by addressing this issue, 28 per cent of all children's deaths could be avoided-that we could save the lives of two million children a year. It could also save scores of mothers who die from infection and lack of nutrition. The benefits are astounding, and could clearly make a huge improvement to standards of living. Additionally, the World Health Organisation believes that these improvements can be made at relatively low cost. They are the most cost-effective public health interventions available. Indeed, for every one dollar invested in water, basic sanitation and hygiene, an estimated eight dollars is paid back into a nation's economy. Huge improvements to poverty have already occurred under the Millennium Development Goals. Since 1990, developing countries have seen the proportion of their people living in poverty fall from 46 per cent to 27 per cent. They have seen suffering from hunger decline from 30 per cent to 23 per cent. They have seen access to clean water increase from 72 per cent to 84 per cent, and they have seen the number living with infectious disease stabilise and in some cases begin to decrease. We should celebrate the achievements that have been made and the lives that have been saved. However, not enough. We all know that it is not enough. It is vitally important that we achieve the Millennium Development Goals, if for no other reason than that no-one deserves to be born into absolute poverty. No-one deserves to live their life or raise their children in such terrible and difficult circumstances-circumstances undeserved and beyond their control. The Micah Challenge is calling on the Australian government to increase efforts towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals in response to the 900 million people who do not have access to clean drinking water and the 2.6 billion who are without basic sanitation. It is also important that we recommit to our aid commitments as a nation. Both sides of this parliament have pledged to raise foreign aid to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2015, and I know that the coalition continue to be committed to that goal. I commend the Micah Challenge initiative in bringing these issues to the fore. A global commitment to water, basic sanitation and hygiene offers increased economic, social, and human development, improving the health and well-being of children, families, and communities around the world. The Micah Challenge says, 'Reducing needless preventable child and maternal deaths is both developmentally expedient and, perhaps even more importantly, a moral and human imperative.' United Nations",194
371,Dr LEIGH,ADJOURNMENT," In 1945, the establishment of the United Nations was a triumph of hope over experience. The League of Nations had failed to forestall World War II, yet the creation of the United Nations signalled optimism that such horrors could be avoided in the future-hope that succeeding generations, as the charter says, it is might be saved from 'the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind'. I spoke a month ago in the adjournment debate about the challenges of reforming the United Nations Security Council and I want to follow up tonight by offering a few suggestions for reform of the United Nations General Assembly. Again, I am grateful to William Isdale for his assistance. The General Assembly is the largest body of the United Nations. It is the place where all member nations are represented and have a say. It is supposed to be-and should bea forum of great significance. Regrettably, the views of experienced observers are damning. In his book on the United Nations, Australian Catholic University Professor Spencer Zifcak says the assembly 'is a body of only the most fleeting relevance to the conduct of world affairs ... a forum in which the agenda consists mainly of national grievances... the resolutions proliferate without review' and are 'almost impossible to translate into practical action'. For anyone who cares about issues that come before the General Assembly-which range from disease pandemics to nuclear proliferation and transnational crime to climate changethis is worrying stuff. The United Nations's High-Level Panel has concluded that the central difficulty for the assembly is its lack of focus and procedure. For instance, its huge and inflexible agenda leads to repetitious discussion and the desire to achieve unanimity generates resolutions that are vague, vapid or represent the lowest common denominator. No fewer than 18 resolutions have been adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on the subject of its own revitalisation. Since this is the world's principal deliberative forum, it is time that some of these resolutions were acted upon. For instance, smaller, more expert committees could help sharpen debate prior to them coming before the assembly. The general unwillingness to delegate to committees should be met with clearer guidelines as to when it is appropriate to do so. It is important that the General Assembly be a forum for the discussion of global issues that matter, not the minutiae of budgets and administration. We need to strengthen the office of the President of the General Assembly, a position held by HV 'Doc' Evatt from 1948 to 1949 when he was the United Nations' fourth president. The president should be able to prioritise the most important issues on the agenda and call debates on major issues. When it comes to speeches, the floor should be opened to competing positions, not just to anyone who wants to speak, and time limits must be better enforced. Currently, delegates regularly go well over their allotted 15 minutes but are not stopped. In 2009 Muammar Gaddafi spoke for an hour and a half, causing his translator to break off midspeech with the cry, 'I just can't take it anymore.' This is still short of Fidel Castro's 1960 effort of 4½ hours in the General Assembly and well below the United Nations Security Council's record for a speech-just under eight hours. To make it more authoritative, the General Assembly should be better equipped to publicise its decisions and to monitor action taken on its resolutions. At present there is tendency for resolutions to proliferate almost endlessly, without regard to what has been said before and with little follow-through. The General Assembly, as the most representative organ, should also have a greater say in selecting the Secretary-General of the United Nations as a whole. The General Assembly has the formal power to appoint the Secretary-General on recommendation of the Security Council. But in practice the Security Council has assumed the decisive role by sending only one candidate for the assembly to approve. The Security Council should be encouraged to send the General Assembly more than one candidate to choose from. This would go some way towards democratising the United Nations' by ensuring that the Secretary General is someone that all nations have a say in appointing. We expect a lot from the United Nations. It is indispensable in the world we now find ourselves in. The United Nations runs on less money than the Manhattan fire service-but reform need not be expensive. The United Nation's value comes in providing a space for deliberation, not a world government. A concerted effort is required and a commitment to the realisation of the United Nations's central project: creating a safer, more prosperous world. Murray Electorate: Drought Assistance",197
372,Dr STONE,ADJOURNMENT," The drought that was the worse on record in the central part of my electorate of Murray was a drought that no-one expected ever to see because it was in an irrigation area. The exceptional circumstances drought relief literally put food on the table for hundreds of families, and for many of those families the support continued for more than five years. a You can imagine their great financial distress when, with the first rains, the exceptional circumstances support was cut off-even though there was no income with that first rain. For some there was further disaster ahead when the floods came and wiped out over $1 billion worth of livestock and infrastructure. For a few, there was one last hope in the form of an exceptional circumstances exit grant. This meant that, given they were forced to sell their properties, they could receive some retraining funding of $5,000 to $10,000, some counselling and information about where they might go to support their families in the future and $150,000 which was to be paid to them to help them restart their lives in a different enterprise. Part the condition of this grant was that they would not return to farming for a number of years. No small business person, especially a farmer, can readily or easily face the business of selling their farm, but numbers saw this as their only hope to be independent into the future. I want to give you some of the cases that I now have before Minister Ludwig-begging him to understand that you cannot simply withdraw an exit grant in the way that this government didunconscionably, without warning-when you had, only a few weeks before, announced that it was to be extended until June-July next year. This particular family has three young children. They live in my electorate in central Victoria. They finally decided they had to sell their farm. A deciding factor was the fact that they would be eligible for this exit grant of $150,000. They were assessed and found to be eligible and were paid the $5,000 of the first instalment of the training grant. You can imagine their extraordinary distress when, having put a deposit on a small, modest home in Bendigo, where they were going to have to move, they were contacted and told it was all off. They were not to receive the exit grant. The government had run out of money. That family is now in deep shock and great financial distress. They owe money on a house they can no longer get any borrowings for to give them a future. The man of the family has three days work. That is the only income to keep food on the table for that family. There is a second case. They are another young couple. They were pre-assessed and accepted into the EC exit grant scheme. It was a major factor in them deciding to finally sell their property, despite years of hardship in trying to nurse it through, first of of all, drought and then flood. These are the words of the financial counsellor who had been advising them through this stage: 'Early last week they had presented at my office, the day following receipt of the letter advising there were no funds to complete their exit grant process. She was crying as she relayed their plight. He excused himself a couple of times to run to the bathroom to vomit. They are long-term clients and their farm had been on the market for 3½ years in an attempt to sell. They have lowered their price several times. Settlement had been delayed three times due to the flood, NVIRP and delay in payment of water sold under the government tenders. They both now suffer extreme and severe stress. Prior to the EC declaration in June 2011 when they contacted Centrelink and rural financial counselling services and politicians they were told again and again they wouldn't miss the deadline for an EC Exit Grant, they were eligible and the deadline had been extended to 30/6/2012.' Imagine their distress-and I just read you the way they were physically sickened by the news that the grant, despite their farm sale, was not going to come through. As a result they have now no grant but they have left only a nominal deposit on a modest house and they in are exactly the same terrible financial situation they were before they sold the farm. In another family the farm was sold $80,000 below its value because they were told they were going to receive this grant, they were eligible, they had been approved. They sold the property thinking the $150,000 would make the difference of that reduced sale value because they had had it on the market a long time. That family, too, is in great distress. They do not know where to go nor how they are going to feed their family, given there is very little work in these areas. This is an unconscionable thing to do. I believe that the scheme for Compensation for Detriment Caused by Defective Administration, the CDDA scheme, must step in and compensate these people, because this has been government maladministration. (Time expired) Climate Change",198
373,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT," Whilst the scientific scepticism and the hostility to scientists of the Leader of the Opposition and his followers has become a national embarrassment, readily comprehensible evidence that supports the government's actions to restrict carbon dioxide emissions continues to grow, as do atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. There is now so much unarguable evidence that carbon dioxide emitted from burning fossil fuels is driving global warming and climate change, as well as the acidification of sea water, that it is difficult to decide where to start. Perhaps I could start tonight with an account of discoveries by geologists who have examined the fossil record of the temperatures and sea levels from the Eemian, the interglacial period that occurred 130,000 years ago that preceded the current Holocene interglacial in which we are now living. Since 1837, when Karl Schimper and Louis Agassiz first presented evidence for extensive glaciations based on data collected in the Alps, it has been understood that the earth has undergone a succession of ice ages now known as the Pliocene-Quaternary glaciation, which started about 2.6 million years ago. There is compelling evidence that icesheets and sea levels have advanced and retreated on 40,000 and 100,000-year cycles during the Pliocene-Quaternary epoch, and that these glaciations and associated changes have been interspersed with much shorter and warmer interglacials, such as the preceding Eemian interglacial that I have just referred to. Rather like today's climate change deniers who dispute the evidence for climate change, the 1830s audience for Schimper and Agassiz's theory of ice ages was very critical of, or even opposed to, the new idea because it contradicted the then established theories of climate history. Most scientists of that time thought that the earth had been gradually cooling down since its birth as a molten globe and that preceding ages were hotter rather than cooler as Schimper and Agassiz had proposed. Yet, as we know, Schimper and Agassiz were correct in their interpretation of the evidence and, despite the protests of the doubters and deniers of that time, the regular advance and retreat of the ice over hundreds of thousands of years is now accepted as an historical fact established beyond any dispute. So it is for global warming driven by carbon dioxide emissions, although what is different about the present concocted argument is that the very great majority of scientists accept the evidence for humaninduced global warming and climate change caused by carbon dioxide emissions whilst those denying the evidence are either scientific illiterates, amoral political opportunists or undeclared campaigners for vested interests. What is most concerning about the geological evidence from the Eemian period is the fact that data from ice cores and ocean sediments show that average global temperatures were around two degrees warmer than today's temperatures, while other evidence shows clearly that the sea level was four to six metres higher than at present, with the water coming from melted icecaps in Greenland and the Antarctic. Although the Eemian interglacial may have been warmer than the present interglacial due to natural variation, what different about our time is that the initially lower temperatures and sea levels are being driven upwards by distinctly unnatural carbon dioxide emissions produced by human activity. Fossil reef terraces from the Eemian period are a common sight along tropical coasts, and examples sitting four to six metres higher than current sea levels can be seen throughout the Caribbean. Eemian reefs are also obvious along Australian coasts and, according to Dr Stirling of the Australian National University, in Western Australia fossil Eemian reefs occur between 2.5 and 3.4 metres above present mean low water spring at Mowbowra Creek, Vlaming Head, Southern Yardie Creek and Burney Point. How would a sea level rise of this magnitude affect the many people, even in my own electorate, who live on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour and who would certainly be forced from their homes by these sorts of increases in sea level? If nothing is done to restrict emissions, an atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration of 450 parts per million will be reached within 20 years, up from the present level of over 380 parts per million, and that increase on the evidence, push up average global temperatures by around two degrees to a level not experienced since the Eemian period 130,000 years ago. A sea level rise of four to six metres may therefore be in store for people living on Australia's coastline if the destructive policies of the opposition and climate change deniers continue to obstruct measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. (Time expired) National Police Remembrance Day",200
374,Mr MATHESON,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to speak about National Police is Remembrance Day to remember those police officers who have lost their lives serving the community. On 29 September each year thousands of people across Australia stopped to pay tribute to the members of the police force who have lost their lives and to offer support to their families. I felt compelled to speak here today because I proudly served my community as a police officer for 25 years, reaching the rank of sergeant. I joined the New South Wales Police Force in October 1985, graduating from class 216. My career in the police force was very rewarding, but as an officer I had to deal with many challenging and confronting situations. I will never forget my first autopsy, my first deceased person or the first fatal motor vehicle accident that I attendedand having to tell loving parents their only child had been killed in that accident. During my time in the New South Wales Police Force I saw first hand the devastating effects the death of a colleague can have on their family, friends, other police officers and the entire community in which they serve. A death within the force is a solemn reminder of the dangers our police face and the risks they must take every time they go to work to will, keep our communities safe. Like any member of the emergency services would know, it takes a great deal of courage to leave your own family behind to protect those you have never met each time you go to work. When an officer is killed in the line of duty there is no telling how many police officers are affected from all over Australia. Many officers reconsider the risks they take every day and their family members they would leave behind if something were to go wrong. The camaraderie in the police force is second to none. That is why so many police officers and former members of the police force will stop to remember their fallen comrades on 29 September. Even if they do not personally know an officer who has been killed, they know how easy it could be for a day at work to turn into a horrible nightmare for themselves or their colleagues. It was great to see more than 900 police officers take part in the Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance on the weekend. Officers travelled from the Police Wall of Remembrance at the Domain in Sydney to the National Police Memorial in Canberra. As they travelled south, they were joined by police officers from Australia's other states and territories. The ride is a great tribute to those officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice protecting the community. It not only commemorates the sacrifice made by the fallen officers but raises money for the loved ones they have left behind. Earlier this year I spoke about two courageous police officers who were killed whilst on duty. Detective Senior Constable Damien Leeding was killed after responding to an armed robbery and hostage situation on the Gold Coast in May this year. Constable Leeding was described by his family and peers as a great father, a top bloke, a larrikin and a hero. His death had a devastating impact on the Gold Coast community and police officers across the country. I also spoke about Senior Constable Jim Affleck, a highway patrol officer from my electorate who was run down during a police pursuit along the F5 in 2001. Jim was laying road spikes to stop a stolen vehicle when he was run down at high speed. I remember that day like it was yesterday, as would many others in Macarthur. After his death he was awarded the commissioner's valour award for exceptional bravery. Jim was a dedicated and professional police officer. His death shocked not only the police force but the entire Campbelltown community in which he served. The deaths of these two officers, as with any police officer killed on duty, demonstrates the danger members of the force put themselves in every day to keep our communities safe. I join many people in the Macarthur electorate who have the utmost respect and admiration for members of the police force. These men and women take great risks every time they go to work. They deserve the utmost respect by the community for risking their lives to protect others. Macarthur has more than 300 police officers working in the Camden and Campbelltown local area commands serving the local community. These men and women work very hard to fight crime and keep our residents safe. Away from work they are normal people with loving families who have high hopes and dreams for the future. At work they are brave and courageous men and women who do everything they can to protect my electorate. Over the years I have met many of these officers who love their job serving their community in this way but, no matter how much they love being a police officer, they all know the risks and dangers they face every time they put their uniform on. In New South Wales alone we have lost more than 240 police officers through a variety of causes in the line of duty since August 1803. These include being shot by bushrangers, drowning whilst crossing a creek, being shot by an offender, being assaulted, having motorbike accidents during a pursuit and having other motor vehicle accidents. No matter how they died, it is terribly sad when the men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting others are killed whilst doing so. In the lead-up to National Police Remembrance Day next week my heart goes out to the families of all police officers who have been killed in the line of duty. I offer them my heartfelt condolences. I am sure they share with me the hope that one day society will understand and respect the great undertaking that is required to serve as a police officer. Until then I am sure the brave men and women of Australia's police forces will continue to protect their communities despite the dangers they face and the harsh reality that some may not return home to their families. Micah Challenge",201
375,Mr GRIFFIN,ADJOURNMENT," I join with a number of members tonight in acknowledging the Micah Challenge campaign Voices for Justice 2011, 'dying for a dunny'. Clean water and sanitation facilities are something we all take for granted, but there are some 900 million people across the world who do not have access to safe water and around 2.6 billion who do not have adequate sanitation facilities-basic services that are essential to the health of a community, basic services that they all have a right to have. Members of the Micah Challenge groups will be here in Canberra over the next couple of days. They have been meeting with members of parliament today and I will be meeting with them tomorrow. Micah Challenge is the global movement of Christian aid and development agencies, churches, groups and individuals which aims to deepen people's engagement with those living in poverty and to reduce poverty as an integral expression of Christian faith. In Australia approximately 50 church denominations, organisations and development agencies endorse the Micah Challenge and over 114,000 individuals have signed the Micah call, which states that it is time for international and national decision makers to fulfil their public promise to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and so have absolute global poverty by 2015. As I mentioned, currently they are holding their sixth annual national gatheringVoices for Justice 2011-which is all about the need for improved sanitation services. The issue is simple and overwhelmingly evident every time you travel to a developing country. Almost 1.4 billion people live in extreme poverty. This means they live on less than US$1.25 a day, which is insufficient to meet their most basic needs. They are hungry, susceptible to disease and lack access to things we all take for granted such as clean water, decent sanitation and health care. In the year 2000 the millennium declaration catalysed more attention and international support to tackle the problem of global poverty than had ever been seen before. The declaration contained eight Millennium Declaration Goals that together have provided the framework for poverty alleviation efforts over the past 11 years. In light of these goals, the progress for those living in poverty has been extraordinary. On every goal progress has been made. Since 1990 developing countries have seen the proportion of their people living in poverty fall from 46 to 27 per cent, suffering from hunger decline from 30 to 23 per cent, access to clean water increase from 72 to 84 per cent, and living with infectious disease stabilise and in some cases begin to decrease. Despite this progress, there is still more to be done. Despite this progress there are still a number of goals that are in danger of not being met in the times that have been set. They are in particular MDG4, child mortality; MDG5, maternal mortality; and MDG7, environmental health. There is much to be done. Certainly a lot more can be done by nations throughout the world. Micah Challenge is calling on the Australian government to once again increase efforts towards achieving these goals. The call is on for the Australian government to increase spending on initiatives in relation to water and sanitation to $500 million by 2015, to ensure that at least half of this money is spent on sanitation and hygiene, and to ensure that the bipartisan commitment to increase our aid budget is maintained and developed in the years ahead. The Australian government, of course, has been committed to increasing aid to 0.5 per cent of GNI by 2015. On current projections this will more than double the aid program relative to 2010-11. But there is more to be done. The Australian government has been making some progress on a number of these issues, and I think it is important to acknowledge that in these circumstances. In PNG Australia helped immunise 900,000 children against measles and other childhood diseases in 2009. From 2003 to 2009 Australia helped reduce infant deaths by one-quarter in East Timor. In terms of MDG5-maternal healthexamples of achievements include the percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel in East Timor, which increased from 35 per cent in 2008 to 47 per cent in 2009. In Cambodia Australia's aid has helped deploy at least one midwife to each health centre in the country. In Bangladesh Australian support has contributed to a 40 per cent decline in maternal mortality over the last decade. With respect to the expenditure on sanitation, I had the privilege of attending in Zimbabwe a visit to the Bulawayo Water And Sewage Emergency Response program, where Australia has provided some $4.6 million in aid for a two-year World Vision project in Zimbabwe's second largest city. We saw there the excellent work that was being done with that money, the excellent work that was being done to ensure that those communities had proper sanitation and health facilities. I urge all members to get behind this very important program and the Micah Challenge. Palestine",203
376,Ms LEY,ADJOURNMENT," In four days time the Palestinians will take their case for statehood to the United Nations Security Council in New York. Democracy is sweeping the Middle East, and our sympathy for the Tunisians, Egyptians and Libyans must surely embrace the Palestinians, who seek only to be citizens in their own country. Earlier this year I spent 10 days in the occupied West Bank as the co-chair of the parliament's Friends of Palestine. I joined a group of colleagues on a visit to this ancient place and want the House to be aware of what we saw, touched and felt. While the eyewitness may misunderstand, we at least have the benefit of a view unfiltered by media other than our own imperfect wisdom. We met with the Palestinian Authority, non-government organisations, churches and very many ordinary Israelis and Palestinians at their homes, businesses, farms and on the street. The presentation of the Palestinian case to the UN is their Arab Spring. It comes with no threat of violence. As Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said to us in Ramallah: 'The doctrine of non-violence is the path of freedom. I believe in the transformative power of non-violence to inspire people to rebuild.' President Abbas has insisted that this bid for statehood in no way delegitimises Israel. Indeed, I see it as renewing rather than bypassing the negotiations. Israel's concern that the Arab uprisings are causing the region to become more unfriendly is in danger of becoming self-fulfilling. The infant Arab states are right to expect genuine moves towards a two-state solution. I do not believe a secure Israel will be achieved in spite of a viable Palestinian state; I believe witness that it cannot be achieved without one. In the West Bank I found a leadership exhausted by the occupation, the ongoing arguments with Hamas, the US brokered peace process that has no process and the demands of a population wanting tangible improvements to their everyday lives. The occupation is transforming Israelis and Palestinians into something they are not. Breaking the Silence publishes the testimonies of Israeli soldiers. Its spokesperson, Yehuda Shaul, told me without emotion, 'When you place a teenage soldier with a gun at a checkpoint, there are consequences.' The people are exhausted, too, from the checkpoints, permits, lockdowns, home demolitions and the relentless expansion of settlements. The Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem told us the government had cancelled his residency permit in spite of family connections dating back to the British Mandate. I met my World Vision foster child in the village of Nahalin, surrounded by encroaching settlements, and stood in the treeless playground amongst the falling-down classrooms and tired soccer balls, looking just across the gully at the settlement school with its modern buildings and latest equipment. Visiting the settlement of Ma'ale Adumim, as I did high on a hill near Jerusalem, inside the West Bank on Palestinian land, the outlook is serene. The Jewish residents travel on Israeli-only roads straight to Tel Aviv and cannot even see the second road network or the villages hidden in the valley below. It is as if the Palestinians have been airbrushed out of existence. It is a curious thing to see a donkey pulling a one-furrow plough in the midst of Israel's dazzling technical innovation. One tries to make sense of foreign aid providing a couple of beehives for a cottage industry in honey when a few kilometres away hydrologists from across the earth travel to Israel's capital-intensive achievements in hydroponics. If you could only combine the technology, research and institutions of the state of Israel with the energy of the Palestinian people, the world would see a powerhouse of productivity. As I return to my rural electorate, I will recall the farmers we met who have been chased off their land and livelihood by illegal settlers and are now mendicant aid recipients. Many among the Jewish community share a real concern for their welfare, and I wish to pay tribute to the amazing Rabbis for Human Rights. I support the Palestinian bid for statehood in part because it will give heart to the ordinary people of the West Bank and Gaza. There is a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region designed to make sure the statehood bid stalls. I do not know whether those measures will succeed or fail, but I do know that, whatever the fate of the bid, we in the international community must stand in solidarity with those seeking the non-violent path to a secure Israel and an independent Palestine. After two generations of strife and war, are we going to admit to our children that their parents could not even find a path to peace or, worse still, that we did not even try? ",204
377,Mr HAYES,ADJOURNMENT," I am not given to speaking that much about other politicians, let alone those who are technically political opponents; however, I will make an exception when it comes to Councillor Paul Lake of the Campbelltown City Council. Tomorrow Councillor Lake will stand down as mayor, and I think it is appropriate to record some of my thoughts about him and his commitment to the community. Paul was first elected to council in 2004 bringing with him a genuine community service background particularly in relation to junior sport. For the past 27 years Paul Lake has been a dedicated volunteer to junior rugby league, assisting children and their families within the community. In 1989 he was instrumental in forming the Western Suburbs Junior Rugby League Limited and was subsequently appointed chairman of the board, a position he held until 1999. His achievements and commitment to sport and the youth of the area were recognised in 1996 when he was awarded life membership of the junior rugby league. In addition to his council commitments Paul still turns up on weekends to assist those volunteers without whose effort local sport, particularly sport in relation to young people, would simply not take place. Paul Lake is a genuine friend to junior sport and to all those who work so hard to make it happen. Twelve months ago as a result of a crossparty agreement Paul was elected Mayor of Campbelltown. He brought to the position a genuine commitment of community service not simply as a means to a political end but as a reflection of his genuine commitment to the local families. I saw his tenacity on display in his pursuit of the new triathlon facility at Macquarie Fields. He lobbied hard and long and often I was the target of his efforts. It did not take long to realise is a man not interested in political games and who certainly can never be accused of putting politics ahead of the community. Some time ago when I was the target of a concerted effort to remove me from my seat Paul Lake, as deputy mayor, took it upon himself to propose a council resolution with the view of achieving bipartisan support for my retention. Some would say that this was not politically smart on his part but for me it was deeply humbling that a person who I did not even vote for would take such an overt and courageous position on my behalf and particularly when there was no possible advantage in it for him. It was not his actions in this regard that earned my admiration, as he had long impressed me with his very real commitment to the people of Campbelltown. Local government is vitally important given that it is the closest level of government to the people and that the issues related to the community are and must be paramount. Despite our political differences, from my observations Paul Lake has always acted in the best interest of his community. Paul Lake is a good friend and I regard him as an excellent community representative. I take the opportunity to wish Anoulack Chanthivong who will succeed Paul Lake as mayor the very best in his term in that position. I know Anoulack very well and I am very confident that like his predecessor he will work hard to make a genuine difference for the better in his local community. Restaurant and Catering Awards",205
378,Mr BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT," As the House adjourns this evening, some of Australia's top restaurants are being recognised by their peers at the Restaurant and Catering Awards for Excellence for that he Sydney metropolitan and surrounds, in Sydney. Major award winners this evening include Caterer of the Year, Freshcatering at Redfern; Restaurant of the Year, Sydney metropolitan region, Becasse Restaurant and Restaurant of the Year Blue Mountains Central West region, Darleys Restaurant at Katoomba. The Lifetime Achiever went to Robert Ho, Hall of Fame inductee was Stefano Manfredi and Restaurateur of the Year was Con Dedes. I am pleased that culinary mastery is more than ever front and centre of popular culture-something that television shows like Ten's MasterChef, and Foxtel's Aurora Eat, Play and Stay has reinforced. Hospitality and tourism are all about the experience, and tonight's winners are individuals and teams who create memorable dining experiences for domestic and inbound tourists alike. Australian restaurateurs are amongst the best in the world, and year on year it is clear that the standards achieved in cooking and presentation are continuously improving. These coveted awards do a great deal not only to recognise hard work and achievement but also to encourage competition within industry and ensure that restaurant industry standards are maintained. Now in its 13th year, the Awards for Excellence program gives restaurant and caterers well-deserved recognition of their hard work and promotional support, and helps to attract incremental business and to promote industry best practice. The tourism sector provides employment for nearly 500,000 Australians and accounts for $92 billion of economic activity. When you add in the restaurant and hospitality sector, which also services non-tourists in Australia, you start to get a picture of the magnitude of this sector to our economy. Now is a critical time for restaurants, as under a carbon tax the restaurant and catering sector is significantly exposed. They will pay more to run their refrigeration, dishwashing machines, ovens, lighting, signage, cleaning machines, office and other equipment in addition to the increase in costs of food should Labor's carbon legislation pass into law. Of course, if the law is passed, Labor cannot be trusted to maintain its exemption for petrol which would further drive up input costs for restaurants and cafes around Australia, at the same time reducing disposable income that is absolutely vital to the survival of this industry. Restaurants are already reeling from a range of bad Labor policies, they certainly do not need to be burdened with the carbon tax. One of the most damaging policies for restaurants since Labor came to office was to remove chefs and cooks from the skilled migration occupations list and the list of recognised occupations for which training assistance is available. Blind Freddy can see there is a skills shortage in this sector. The tourism sector is already at the mercy of seasonal and economic fluctuations and what this industry needs is a government that does not exacerbate their difficulties or create new problems. As I mentioned in this place last week, 18 months ago, Labor thought it was fine to transfer workers from the bars and swimming pools of tourist towns to the draglines and trucks of the mines. This of course has created a hospitality industry skills shortage, as I said, exacerbated by Labor removing chefs and cooks from the business migration list of skills. Labor's proposed solution to this problem is to reverse its policy to exclude food professionals from the skilled workers list to fill vacancies-a solution that is long overdue, but we await the action to match the rhetoric. It is time for the rubber to hit the road, minister. While we remain to be convinced of the merits of the Pacific guest worker scheme, one simple measure that government can adopt is to solve the current problem of tourism sector workers gaining worker visas then leaving to work in other sectors. Last week, the government announced it will remove the burden on restaurants and cafes to provide separate menus on weekends and public holidays that incorporate service surcharges. This is a policy change that the coalition has been advocating for some time along with major tourism, catering and hospitality services representative organisations by people like John Hart of the Restaurant and Catering Association. This is a government that burdens small business with bundles of red tape then claims to be the champion when they remove it. Yet in the face of these challenges, the restaurant and catering industry is doing a sterling job. For the sake of this valuable industry, I urge members opposite to consider how their policies, in particular the planned carbon tax, will damage cooking and food service professionals such as those recognised at tonight's Restaurant and Catering Awards. I look forward to seeing all the finalists from across the nation at the National Restaurant and Catering HOSTPLUS Awards for Excellence on 24 October. Holt Electorate: Manufacturing",206
379,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT," I want to talk about manufacturing in Holt. The electorate of Holt is well known for its proximity to the manufacturing heartland of Australia in the Dandenong region. Some 22 per cent of the workforce in my electorate is employed in manufacturing, which is the most of any federal electorate in the country. The manufacturing industry, we know, is facing immense challenges, amongst them being the Australian dollar at an all-time high, economic confidence abroad continually battered and the mining boom, which continues to take skilled workers out of industries like manufacturing. During my last adjournment debate, I flagged concern about how people dismissed the manufacturing sector, forgetting the proud history and tradition of Australian innovation and industrial practices, with comments like 'eventually all manufacturing will go offshore, right?' Even economic and media commentators are saying this. Imagine my surprise to hear on radio a well-respected economist like Ross Gittins, who contributed to this sentiment recently with comments he made ABC radio. During the interview he said, 'Australians don't make things well.' I reflected on this and I reflected on companies around my area-Jayco Caravans, Volgren buses, Icon Plastics, Southport Engineering, Bombardier trainscompanies with excellence in manufacturing equal to any in the world. I found it very difficult to reconcile that with the comment 'Australians don't make things well'. I would suggest to Mr Gittins that he actually pays a visit to the manufacturers in my electorate who have been doing Australia proud by manufacturing products sought right around the world and known for their quality and innovation. Comments like this really dismay me, and my constituents who are employed in manufacturing are equally offended by insinuations that their jobs are dirty, menial or somehow of less value to the economy than other jobs. Mr Gittins also suggests in an interesting and, and as some might class it, patronising way that there are many lesser skilled jobs in the economy, suggesting perhaps that retrenched blue-collar workers including manufacturing workers pack up and move to construct new mines in the Pilbara and other mining regions. I guess my question to Mr being Gittins is this: does he understand, as recently reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, that 70,000 people in the Dandenong region including many from Holt rely on manufacturing? Again, I ask him to have a word with the workers from Dandenong South, Hallam, Hampton Park, Endeavour Hills, Fountain Gate-some suburbs just out and around my area-to see how they feel about this. They have toiled away, in some cases their whole lives, making enormous sacrifices for their families, paying off the family home and sending their kids to school, university or TAFE. The kinds of comments that we have heard undermine the skills and determination required to manufacture goods, be it for a machine operator, a boilermaker or a laboratory technician. These people literally make the country that we live in here today, and to hear them being disparaged in this way really offends me. Think about the suburb of Doveton: it was built around the great companies that shifted to Dandenong in the 1940s, fifties and sixties-the GMHs, the Nissans, the Heinzs, and Pilkington glass. These are the people that made the cars, that made the glass, that made our country the country that it is today. So to say to a group of people that live in Doveton with that proud tradition that they are less valuable than other people within the community is un-Australian, in my view. Again, I would like to suggest to Mr Gittins that he takes a little trip down to Icon Plastics, where I have been recently. Icon Plastics is an Australian-owned and operated company with more than 40 years of experience in the design, the manufacture and the supply of plastic products for Australian and international markets. The company aims to be recognised as the best designers and manufacturers of extrusion profiles and injection moulded plastic products in Australia and throughout the world through innovation and best practice. These people have been doing so. The gentleman I met with at this company personifies Australian innovation and persistence of business smarts over cheap imported competition. In fact, they are exporting products to China. So next time Mr Gittins decides to talk about the future of Australia, the future of Australia still remains in manufacturing and I will not have workers that live in my electorate demeaned in that way on radio again. Riverina Electorate: KurrajongWaratah",208
380,Mr MCCORMACK,ADJOURNMENT," On Saturday I had the honour and privilege of opening the new $1.5 million e-recycling facility at Kurrajong-Waratah's new plant in Chaston Street, Wagga Wagga. Hundreds of people turned up for the event, which is testimony to the fantastic work that Kurrajong-Waratah does for the community of Wagga Wagga and, indeed, the region. The whole of the Riverina will benefit from this new e-recycling facility, as will the city of Wagga Wagga, certainly, and the environment, our future, and most of all, the hard workers Kurrajong-Waratah employs. The recycling plant will be home to 90 employees, of whom 60 have disabilities. Kurrajong-Waratah has been providing support, training and opportunities to people with an intellectual disability or developmental delay and their families and carers through its targeted services since 1957. It has an aim of meeting the needs of people with a disability and their families. The aim continues today with more than 700 babies, children and adults receiving daily help from Kurrajong-Waratah. As a part of its aims, Kurrajong-Waratah continues to ensure that its programs are designed to create an awareness in the community of the needs and abilities of people with disabilities and, indeed, their families. I pay tribute to Michael Kennedy, Steve Jaques, and certainly to Cathie Smith who help run Kurrajong-Waratah, and I pay tribute to the hard workers. Their camaraderie is to be commended. These people have a wonderful outlook on life. The thing you notice when you go to any one of Kurrajong-Waratah's many services is that the people who are working there have a great love and respect for the people beside them working away diligently on all sorts of things-and I have to say it is much more than I have seen in a lot of other workplaces which I have been to. Mr Kennedy agreed that the new facility would provide 'more light and more space' for the disabled workers. It was locally built and I commend everybody involved in this project.",209

NA Amendments will also be made to the Extradition extradition and reduce delays, extend the availability process and extend the circumstances in which alternative to extradition if a person is an Australian be waived for various reasons. The bill therefore has two main objectives: extradition to ensure that Australian authorities to our international criminal justice partners; is essential to ensure that we address the challenges clear that the world is becoming so interconnected, communication, travel or whatever. While that economic sense as well as culturally and socially, to respond to ensure that perpetrators of crime able to move from one country to another. frankly, dated.

This bill will extend that be applied to any person to be prosecuted in Those things are very important; it was not a number of Australian citizens who are currently person committed an offence in Indonesia that from Indonesia to Australia, we would have if we did not do it-if the person was not an back for trial-that would mean that that person making a new life in Australia without any country of origin. This legislation will allow crime that they perpetrated elsewhere. In that not return a person to a country where they would maintain and honour our commitment in right thing in respect of criminal justice. We slip through the cracks simply by moving across piece of legislation. Something that I have often about criminal justice, whether it is the crime, is that technology is an ever-changing rapid rate. We cannot take the view that simply this case, 20 years ago-was for very good it should be what applies in perpetuity. We owe it NA to all our people on the thin blue line, the there day after day and risk their own lives criminal enterprise itself and to uphold everybody else associated with the criminal loopholes people can escape through. We also need to recognise that we are part the administration of criminal justice. We should that respect. We have a role to play.

A $127.4 million package was efficiency reforms. The government has not, as we know, fulfilled independent study of the legitimate costs of the reforms and efficiencies will actually be the review of the reforms of the industries to more paperwork and more bureaucracy, contrary one industry involved here. It is not just the grains, fish and live animal industries. There reforms would have been completed by the time not happened.
