2,Mr NA BROWN,PRIVILEGE,"With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, could I raise with you a potential matter of privilege understanding order 95?",10
3,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,The honourable member may proceed.,10
4,Mr NA BROWN,PRIVILEGE,"I am indebted to you, Mr Speaker. I wish to raise a matter that was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday, on 15 May 1990. I will not detain the House by a recital of all of the facts but merely provide you with a copy of an article published yesterday in the Sydney Morning Herald. I should say at the outset that, although it is a matter for you entirely, of course, I am not suggesting that it is a breach of privilege by the Sydney Morning Herald. What I am suggesting is that there was a breach of privilege by the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, or by somebody else. Briefly, the matter relates to a letter that I wrote to Senator Bolkus concerning one of my parliamentary entitlements. That letter, not to make, too fine a point of it, has been leaked to the press, obviously by him, someone in his office,路 a public servant or the postman-or me, and I can assure you that it was not me. You will understand that when you see the article. So also has been leaked Senator Bolkus's reply. I should say that I have not yet received his reply; so whoever was responsible for this is beating the gun.",10
5,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,He may not have been able to post it because his postage was held up.,10
6,Mr NA BROWN,PRIVILEGE,"Perhaps. He knows as much about the reliability of the postal service as I do. However, there was certainly an attempt to get ahead of the mail. Put it that way, Mr Speaker. The revelations contained in this article were, with respect-although it is a matter for you, of course, and your interpretationdesigned to denigrate me. More importantly for the purposes of this House, they were intended clearly to denigrate me and by that means to inhibit me in the proper exercise of my parliamentary duties. The third point is that this is something that all members and, indeed, the House collectively should be very concerned about. This House cannot function and members of parliament cannot perform their functions properly without there being absolute confidentiality with respect to correspondence passing between members and Ministers. The fourth point is that this is not the first time that this has happened, and it is time, with respect, that an end was brought to it. For example, you might recall that after the recent postage allowance case in the High Court there were suggestions attributed to sources that a number of members of the Opposition had in fact exceeded their legitimate postage entitlements. Of course one can speculate on where that information came from. Mr Speaker, to assist you in this matter-although again I 'say that it is a matter entirely for you-there are two cases reported in House of Representatives Practice, one on 20 October 1982 and the other on 20 August 1985. However, in the present case that I am raising, the point, with respect, Mr Speaker, is that there was a leak which was clearly deliberate and which was intended to hamper and prevent me from performing my proper parliamentary functions and to inhibit me in performing them in a proper and legitimate way. I make the final point-and in one sense this is why it is important-that if Senator Bolkus or his staff were not responsible- for this attempted inhibition of me in performing my functions, then, of course, some public servant or servants must have been responsible. If it was not Senator Bolkus, or if he denies it was him, that clearly puts a cloud over those public servants who handle representations passing between members of this House and Ministers about their own entitlements and, for that matter, about other matters. I respectfully submit that you, sir should conclude that it is a breach of privilege, because clearly the act concerned was intended to denigrate me. I am not so concerned about that aspect of it, but what I am concerned about and what all other honourable members should be, concerned about is that, by denigrating me, the attempt was clearly made to prevent me from performing my parliamentary functions in a proper and legitimate way. That is the basis on which, in my respectful submission, it is a breach of privilege. I ask you to consider that, Mr Speaker.",10

9,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I take on board the points raised by the honourable member and I will report back to the House at a later time today. SUPERANNUATION BILL 1990 [COGNATE BILLS: NA AMENDMENMT BILL 1990 NA (SUPERVISORY MECHANISMS) BILL NA SUPERANNUATION (REASONABLE BENEFIT LIMITS) AMeNDMENT BILL 1990] Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 May on motion by Mr Willis: That the Bill be now read a second time.,11
10,Mr SPEAKER,OCCUPATIONAL,"I understand it is the wish of the House to debate concurrently the Superannuation Bill 1990, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 199-, the Superannuation Be,nefits (SupervIsory Mechanisms) Bill 1990 and the Occupational Superannuation, (Reasonable Benefit Limits) Amendment Bill 1990. There being no objection, I will allow course to be, followed.",11
11,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,OCCUPATIONAL,"The fact that we are debating cognately the Superannuation Bill 1990 the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Bill 1990 and the Occupational Superannuation (Reasonable Benefit Limits) Amendment Bill 1990 highlights the manner of cont-mp- in - hich this very complex legislatIon IS being treated. We are expected to deal with four superannuation Bills in just under one hour. It is quite likely that some honourable members who want to speak on these Bills will be denied an opportunity to do so. Mr Tim Fischer-Legislation under duress.",11
12,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,OCCUPATIONAL,"It is certainly under duress, and that is the first point that I make. The purpose of the Superannuation Bill 1990 is to establish a new superannuation scheme for Commonwealth employees, to be implemented as from 1 July 1990. The Government believes-although the Opposition does not necessarily agree-that this will bring Commonwealth superannuation arrangements substantially into line with the private sector. The new superannuation scheme has a number of financial impacts because of: the change in the form of primary benefit 1990 from a position in the current Commonwealth sup-rannuation scheme (CSS) to a lump sum m the new scheme; the funding of a 3 per cent 'productivity' benefit in the new arrangements from 1 July 1990 - nwards; changes in the timing of taxatIon revenue arising from the funding of the 3 per cent 'productivity' benefit; in' creased administrative costs associated with changeover and provision of advice to members about their options' the extension of superannuation cov-rage to those people presently not eligible to join the CSS; and longer term effects on Commonwealth outlays for both the existing work force and future staff. Currently, the member contribution rate is a minimum 5 per cent of salary. Under that the new scheme, members will be able to contribute between 2 per cent and 10 per cent of salary. In committee, the Opposition intends to move an amendment to provide that the minimum contribution rate be 5 per cent of salary. In connection with vesting, after. four years' membership, employees will be entitled to the full amount of employer benefits accrued based on the number of service years, on retirement. Thus, all members will receive a Commonwealth superannuation benefit on retirement, even if they had resigned from Commonwealth employment many years before. Broken periods of service will no longer adversely affect benefits. The new scheme will be funded primarily by tightening existing invalidity arrangements. The invalidity rates in the current scheme have been five to 10 times higher than the private sector rates, and are indeed a national scandal, which was brought to light earlier by the coalition's Waste Watch Committee. In the new scheme invalidity benefits will路 be more closely aligned to age retireGovernment ment benefits. It should also be recognised that the co stings are dependent on assumptions made about future circumstances, many of which will not be able to be tested against actual路 experience for many years to come. . The Occupation-l Superannuation (Reasonable Benefit Limits) Amendment Bill enables implementation of the 1989 Budget announcements regarding the maximum retirement benefits a person may receive with concessional tax treatment and allows the taxation implications of excess payments. The reasonable benefit limits (RBLs) will apply to all concesin sionally taxed benefits regardless of whether they are provided from the private or the public sector, by superannuation or roll-over funds, or whether they are funded or unfunded. The only concessionally taxed benefits not subject to the limits will be bona fide redundancy, genuine invalidity and approved early retirement scheme benefits. RBLs will allow most members of superannuation funds to save a sufficient amount on a concessionally taxed basis to provide for a consumer price indexed life pension or annuity of up to 75 per cent of a person's highest average salary over any of the three previous consecutive years. I have given just a basic outline of the two main Bills but this superannuation legislation is extremely complex. As I said before, it is an absolute abuse and路 contempt of Parliament that we have less than one hour to debate them. 'In this limited time. I first comment on superannuation under the Australian Labor Party and its record over the last seven years. There has been an increase of 1,000 per cent in the taxation of superannuation. This Government's retirement policy is taxation driven. In the last Budget the anticipated receipt from superannuation funds-this one item alone-is $885m and does not include the capital gains tax and other taxation involved in taking those retirement benefits. The retirement income policy of the is taxation driven. It is not about proper and adequate planning for retirement; it is about taxation. If one looks at that aspect one easily determines that the amount of taxation will also drive down路 the final retirement benefit of an individual or it will increase the contribution from the employer and the employee. Taxing that additional contribution is like the cat chasing its own tail. Labor has made 20 complex changes to superannuation laws, making an art form of legislatjon by press release. It has shown an arrogant disregard for not only those industry but also, more importantly, the four million superannuants who wish to plan their retirement with confidence and security. Superannuation is now as complex and confusing as the tax base it serves and the tax laws in this country. No wonder a greater part of my workload as a representative is being involved with people seeking information on this. I defy anyone to read the explanations that the Australian Taxation Office gives with any clarity and understanding. I do not think they would be any less confused after reading them than they were at the start. There is an integration between these superannuation Bills and those tax laws. I will comment on the manner in which taxation is taken from this industry. fore 1983, 5 per cent of a benefit was taxed. I understand that there will now a 15 per cent tax on the contributions a fund and then a 15 per cent investment income for those superannuation funds against which the franking arrangements will be allowed. That still gives an effecWales tive rate of tax of between 6 per cent and 8 per cent. One also has to take into account the capital gains tax, which is in effective and paid separately. The, taxatralia tion on superannuation does reduce the incre-se final benefit. When the benefit is paid, a buying series of taxation payments have to be that made.' When one looks at the lump sum opthing tion, what we are concerned about in this new Bill is that it is directed to a person taking a lump sum. Apart from the taxtime ation aspect, there is no encouragement to take one's entitlement as a pension an annuity, or to roll it over. Those ticular things should be observed. Cercent tainly what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has done in this regard has enabled him to accelerate tax payments through the superannuation scheme; instead of getting them at the end, he gets them on the way in, on the way through and on the way out and this of course has prettied up his Budget surplus. But retirement incomes are being depleted in the course of that, plundered by the Treasurer and his greed. Labor has obliterated small perannuation funds by imposing massive administrative costs. It is estimated that by 1995 the 156,000 small business superannuation funds will be forced out of business. I believe that in itself will calamity and a loss to small business. bor has conned people into joining union dominated superannuation funds, over which they have no control, and they no guarantee of security for their funds. Freedom of choice in superannuation funds is rapidly diminishing under Labor and compulsory unionism could be reinfreedom forced just through this aspect alone. Laon the wane. bor has delivered unions an inordinate amount of financial muscle through their control of industry based superannuation schemes. In his policy speech during the election Becampaign the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) claimed that superannuation and the inbe tended increase in productivity contributo tions from 3 per cent to 6 per cent was a benefit which all businesses, large and small, could afford. Small business, of course, sees it differently. The New South President of the Australian Small Business Association said on 27 February: For those able to survive this intended increase operating costs of conducting business in Ausit will mean at the very least a mandatory in the price of goods and services to the public, and at the very worse it wi-l ,me-n the number of small bus-nesses remaInIng In Australia will be greatly reduced, and at this critical time in the Australian economy the one we do not need is less small business, Also in his policy speech the Prime Minister claimed that there was, for the first a national superannuation scheme which all people covered by industrial or awards can enjoy. And the Treasurer parclaimed in the wage-tax deal that 77 per of the work force was not covered, due to the introduction of productivity superannuation. But in actual fact the statistics do not bear out the statements, that were made; they were untrue. According to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, by August 1989 less than half the work force had received the first 3 per cent productivity superannuation and the total coverage of the work force was just under 58 per cent, not the 70 per cent business suclaimed by the Treasurer. The Prime Minister refers to superannuation as a national savings scheme. This is remarkedly similar to what is said in be a the Australian Council of Trade Unions' LaAustralia Reconstructed document, which calls for the establishment of a national development fun9 in which 20 per cent have of superannuants' money would be used by governments-and who would trust this Government? While union control of superannuation funds is on the increase, of choice for superannuants is The coalition supports the extension of occupational superannuation so that eventually the whole work force will be covered by adequate and genuine superannuation. However, we do not support the Industrial Relations Commission's arbitrary, automatic and across the board increases in superannuation contributions. Instead, the Commission's role should be restricted to assisting the parties to reach agreement by conciliation and to ratifying agreements and consent awards. The coalition is against union domination of superannuation funds. We have been very concerned at the way in which many employers and employees have been denied any real choice about into which funds their contributions should be paid. We think it is outrageous that employees who choose not to join a union-and they are 60 per cent of workers-have been forced in many cases to pay into union run schemes, and the implication is that they will probably join the union itself. The coalition's policy on this is very clear. ,All employees should have the freedom of choice to join whatever superannuation scheme they wish and not to be dictated to by the unions. Additional superannuation contributions over and above the 3 per cent should reflect fairly the circumstances and capacity to pay of each individual, each enterprise and each industry. At present the 3 per cent is productivity based, but my own experience in this is it is very difficult to get that 3 per cent productivity in the work force, and any future contributions will only be an additional cost to small business when that productivity cannot be achieved. The only recourse small businesses will have if they want to survive in these times of economic peril is to discharge workers and employees. Realising that 12 per cent is recognised as the percentage necessary to achieve an adequate equivalent to the age pension, if this percentage is forced on them there will not be very many businesses left to bear the cost. This is why it is absolutely stupid for the Government to come into this House and say that this package is to reconcile the differences between the Commonwealth and the private sectors. That is just not the case. The coalition's Economic Action Plan has committed us to abolishing the capital gains tax on superannuation fund assetsI believe that is a must-and also to raising the lump sum tax-free threshold from $60,000 to $125,000. These two measures would significantly enhance superannuation's attractiveness. The coalition's superannuation policies will restore freedom of choice to workers and lead to superannuation growth, notably through our retirement savings accounts. This will extend superannuation coverage to sections of the work force that Labor has continually ignored, especially women in part time and casual employment. I would like to look at the current Commonwealth scheme. The Budget Papers indicate that it costs the Commonwealth $896m just to maintain the current scheme. In the current scheme employees are asked to make a contribution of 5 per cent, but the Commonwealth's share, which is estimated to be 18 per cent, is not funded through a trust and the funds are not set aside and not invested. In fact, it is estimated that there is an equivalent of $50 billion in uncosted liability for superannuation in the Commonwealth, the States and other authorities. We hear the Treasurer talking about the gross debt and denying any responsibility for it, but the people of Australia must realise that if Australia Incorporated were to liquidate tomorrow there would be a $50 billion debt owing just on superannuants. One wonders how it can be contended that the Treasurer is really guiding this economy in the direction it should be going. The option to transfer leaves open the question of how long it will take for that debt to reduce to an amount of any consequence. I think it is very important that we should look at the generosity of the present scheme and the inability of this Government to plan for its payment other than by transfer to the new superannuation scheme which, as I said, is optional. The legislation encourages lump sum payments, it encourages early retirement, and it also encourages double dipping. In other words, there is nothing to prevent a person of 55 getting out with a lump sum from getting back into age pension entitlements. Really, this is quite the reverse of what a retirement incomes policy is all about. We have to come back to the question of whether Australia or the Commonwealth can afford this type of generosity in the new scheme. I therefore move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a reading, the House: (a) deplores the determination of the Government to support a mandatory second 3 percent employer contribution unrelated to productivity or capacity to pay; (b) condemns the Government for its capitulation to ACTU demands for deferred wage increases in the guise of superannuation payments and its refusal to link preservation to pension age, and (c) criticises the Government's double standards in preferring pensions in the private sector and lump sums in the public sector"".""",11
13,Mr SPEAKER,OCCUPATIONAL,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Connolly-I second the amendment.,15
14,Mr WRIGHT,OCCUPATIONAL,"I am quite surprised that the Opposition would pursue a vendetta against superannuation in this House, as it did during the last election, although perhaps I should not be surprised because during thatelection period National Party and Liberal Party members ran around trying to destroy the very fabric of the new superannuation system that this Government introduced. One needs to place on record the seriousness of the situation that faces this country. There is a critical need to ensure that people who retire in the next two decades have an adequate retirement income. That is what this superannuation legislation is about. It is not really an issue of whether workers should be compelled to become part of a superannuation scheme or whether employers ought to contribute to that scheme. That is not the real crux of the matter. The crux is that we as a country are ageing very quickly. I saw fit to pull out some figures which show just how serious this problem is. By 2021 we will have 3.9 million people over the age of 65. They will be eligible for a pension. That means that one out of five, or 20 per cent, of our people will be eligible for pensions. If one looks at the figures today one starts to realise just how serious the prob- ' lem already is. We are already contributing $10 billion per year to age and veteran pensions. If one looks at the number of second people in the work force today, one sees that there is an elderly person for every six still in the work force, but in about 30 years time there will be one elderly person for every three in the work force. The figures shock and startle one. Those figures must be presented to the people of Australia to convince them of the importance of having a proper retirement income policy, which this Government has initiated. At the moment 2 per cent of the population is aged over 80 years, but by 2031 it is estimated that that figure will skyrocket to 6 per cent. This will lead to additional support costs because there must be support services for the elderly. It is not just a matter of throwing them a pension and saying, 'Look after yourselves, mates'. There must be support systems, a safety net structure, backup facilities, and they cost money. The question arises: Who shall pay? As I pointed out, there will be fewer people in the work force and more elderly people. A larger proportion of the population will be ageing. We are an ageing country; people are living longer. The Parliament has an obligation, as have those who lead this nation, to ensure not only that there is an adequate income for those who are already retired, and an opportunity for those people to supplement their income by changing the tax laws and ensuring that there is an opportunity to earn, but also that those in the work force now have an incentive and opportunity to save for their own retirement. That is what the Government has been all about. Our whole philosophy for the last six years has been projected towards that goal. This massive cost burden will have to be picked up by whoever is in government when we pass the turn of the new century. We will face this crisis of an ageing community. We have to ensure that people have more money to improve their quality of life. At the moment 33 per cent-one in three-of all pensioners have only $10 extra income above their existing pension. Nearly 60 per cent of single pensioners have an income of less than $160 per week. That is not a lot of money. When one considers that the pension makes up 81 per cent of that income, one sees that there is a need to ensure that there are better saving mechanisms. Superannuation is the most direct form of saving for retirement. Prior to 1983 it was used as a rort. We had all sorts of rarts in place where employers, instead of paying proper remuneration on a weekly or annual basis, built into the system superannuation structures whereby at the age of 45 or in 10 or 20 years time those employees would walk away with a golden handshake. If they were in the top level of management in private enterprise they could walk away with half a million dollars. . Before 1983 only 40 per cent of em-. ployees across this nation had a superannuation entitlement. Very few of those employees were women. It is this Government that saw the need and also came up with the solutions. The Government, in consultation with the Australian Council of Trade Unions-I notice the Opposition condemns this cooperation and this partnership which ought to be applaudedrealised that the system lacked appropriate portability. People were forced to stay in one job because if they moved they lost their superannuation entitlement. There was no right to shift from job to job. There was no flexibility. This has had an impact on our labour market. The tax concessions then were unbelievable. Even today, it costs this nation $4 billion a year in tax concessions for the superannuation scheme. The Government has tried to encourage people to plan for their own retirement, to work now earning that money, but saving it. As I said, superannuation is the most direct form of saving for retirement. At the same time the Government has made a commitment in writing. It is on the record that the people shall have the right to choose a lump sum on retirement. I heard Opposition members-particularly the Nationals in my area during the election-running around saying, 'Your right to get a lump sum will go'. It is nonsense. It is in fact untrue. It is a lie. It is on the record. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said it. The previous Minister said it in his superannuation policies. It has been on the record from every Government Minister. People have the right to choose to take a lump sum. But the Government has introduced incentives to encourage people to 路take a mix of a lump sum and an annuity. Use of the reasonable benefit limits will achieve that. We want the right for people to have a lump sum because when they retire they want to pay off the home. They want to buy the new car. They want to take that holiday. They need the dollars in the pocket. We also do not want a situation where people blowout their $150,000 payout or whatever it might be. At the moment the average superannuation payment across the nation is only $100,000. Compare that sum with what some high fliers in business get and people will appreciate why we have had to get tough on the reasonable benefits limit-the maximum amount people can take that is tax concessioned. At the same time the Government has worked at the bottom end. Whilst it has set a limit at the top so anything people take over that amount will face the normal tax rates-people can get tax concessions up to it-the Government has also raised the threshold where there is no tax. From 1 July no-one shall pay tax on any lump sum up to $64,500. Before 1983, people paid tax at a marginal rate on 5 per cent of the lump sum they received. Then it was changed so that, people paid 15 per cent up to $50,000 and 30' per cent after that. That has now been changed so that a person can take on retirement the first $64,000 and pay no tax whatsoever. Then there are tax concessions right through to their reasonable benefit limit which is calculated based on the salary they were earning and the highest salary, which they select, they earned over three consecutive years in which they have a multiplying factor. The Government has provided incentives. It now says to people, 'If you were on $30,000 a year and your multiplying factor was seven'-previously the tax concession stopped at seven times 30, being $21O,000-'and if you were in a private fund before such as Australian Mutual Provident Society, National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd or some of those reputable firms, and you had invested in a private fund and your eligibility was for $210,000 but you had actually been buying a superannuation scheme worth $300,000 under the Liberal and Nationals, you lost the other $90,000. You forfeited it. It went back into the fund. This Government路 has now created the scheme whereby you can take the extra. You can take the other $90,000 but you pay the normal marginal tax rate on it'. This is the fair way to go. Mr Deputy Speaker, it has been this Government that raised the threshold so there is no tax on the first $54,500. It this Government that has brought in incentives-what we call the half and half incentive-where if people take half annuity and half lump sum they can multiply not by seven times their salary but by 11.25 times their salary. That is a considduction erable amount of money. , The other thing that is most praiseworthy of this scheme-and I have not heard a comment of praise coming from the Opposition; not just in this debate but in the past-is that it has been this Government that sorted out the problems for the spouse. Before there was a deterrent. A person would take the lump sums because he believed if he took the annuity and died then his wife missed out and his kids missed out. Now there are provisions whereby his wife takes 85 per cent of what the annuity was and if she in turn dies then a large proportion of what he would have got over a 10-year period now goes into his estate. But people do not understand that. I want to come to that point in conclusion. There is a need not just to fine tune the legislation as we are doing but also because a couple of anomalies arose out of the Budget last year. I am pleased that the new Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has addressed these by applying the law from 15 February; it is this Government that has picked up all the problems and has fine tuned them. We need to explain because the confusion out there is unbelievable. I do not mention this to get sales-I am not running a commercial-but prior to the election I wrote a book which I have entitled Security in Retirement-a New Understanding. I have already distributed 5,000 of these and now I am looking to go commercial to try to meet the demand. Why is there a demand? Because people do not understand; they do not understand the terminology; they do not understand what vesting means; they do not understand what the RBLs are; they do not understand the rules; they do not understand the mUltiplying factors in the formula. I know people can go to accountants is and I know they can talk to the superannuation representatives, but there is a need to have a basic understanding. So I would urge the Minister, as he carries these changes through the House and finally through the Senate, to consider the proof easy to read simple English books using case by case studies so that people can understand their rights and their responsibilities. I think, in jUdging from what the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) is now putting forward by way of amendment, that we need to go out and sell again the importance of compulsory superannuation. We need to let the people realise that they are the beneficiaries. It is not government. There are many, many advantages and we understand that. It means that there will be better retirement incomes, but it means also that this nation shall have enormous wealth, a pool of money that the nation itself can borrow from. One of our reasons we have this international debt crisis is that people have been borrowing overseas. We do not have the resources in financial terms, in dollar terms right here in this country. But the superannuation pool, by compelling workers to contribute' to this scheme and having employers contribute, means billions of dollars will be available right here in this nation for economic growth. It means also that because of the changes in terms of having a unified system of superannuation there will be great labour market reform taking place, greater mobility and flexibility in' working patterns. But importantly there are economic advantages for the individual and I am surprised that the Opposition would come forward today trying to break down what has certainly been the most historic change ever, the most progressive changes in superannuation. I make the final point, Mr Deputy Speaker: this is about the quality of life of the elderly and the retired, and those in the Opposition who oppose superannuation as they have been doing are opposing the quality of life of ordinary people.",15
15,Mr CONNOLLY,OCCUPATIONAL,"Bradfield) (10.39)Mr Deputy Speaker, this should be one of the most important debates before Parliament this year. Regrettably only a handful of people are here and even more significantly the Government has guillotined the debate to a mere one hour for four Bills. After hearing the rhetoric of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), one could rightly therefore say of Government members that they are hypocrites and humbugs. While Government members talk about the significance of superannuation, which we totally support, while they talk about the need for people to be protected in their old age, a factor which we totally support, the reality is that over the last seven years of constant change, despite dubious claims of people who have claimed that everyone will be better off, we have now reached the situation where an ordinary income earner on less than $30,000 a year, or people on average weekly earnings, is in all probability ing as a result of the impact of inflation and a myriad of superannuation tax changes introduced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) over the last seven years. This is a criticaL point. Is it right, is it just,' is it appropriate for any government to go to the Australian people and claim that its superannuation changes are good for everybody, when the realities are that average workers-the very people that this Government claims to want to assistare, in fact, worse off because of the implications of the total taxation regime introduced in recent years? Therefore, it is appropriate that my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) should make the point that the changes to superannuation laws in recent years have been far more directed towards the collection of revenue than necessarily towards the establishment of a regime which will truly protect all Australians in their retirement. The previous speaker spoke of the need to maintain quality of life in retirement. No speaker has yet referred to the inexorable reality facing Australia, that we are a growing population and are becoming an older society. The facts are before us today. They are facts which, I regret to say, the Government has failed, in so many areas of this most important subject, adequately to respond to. On the one hand, there is the clear belief of the Government that superannuation offers to the trade union movement the capacity, once again, to influence the future of the nation. I am delighted to see that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is a previous President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), is in the House today. I want to say this about the activities of the trade union movement in this particular regard: I believe that the trade union movement did the right thing by Australia in emphasising the need for superannuation. I believe that no man or woman can stand in this Parliament and deny the reality that the welfare of aged Australians now and in the future cannot be los- adequately guaranteed primarily on the basis of the provision of a national pension scheme. The fact is that we must now encourage all in the work force to play their part in maintaining a national savings capacity, on the one hand, while at the same time having the opportunity to draw on those savings for their own benefit in retirement. However, the issue before us is whether the changes we have seen in recent years, and the changes proposed in the legislation before the House today, are in fact adequately achieving those overall objectives. I turn to the first question, about the expansion of the 3 per cent so-called productivity increase to 6 per cent. It is appropriate to put on the record the interesting fact that, whereas the 3 per cent was initially linked to productivitywhether, in fact, there was any productivity to show for it is entirely another ter-the expansion of that 3 per cent to 6 per cent has now taken place without any semblance of productivity increase whatsoever. In fact, the word 'productivity' did not even appear in the context of the Government's proposals at the time of the last election. Nor have I heard any mention of it made in this Parliament by any member of the Government in this debate so far. Mr Crean-You should read the agreement again.",18
16,Mr CONNOLLY,OCCUPATIONAL,"Therefore, the difficulty we are facing is that, while the accord, as the Minister obviously wishes me to be aware of, does refer to productivity increases in that context, the reality is that many of the increases which have gone through over the last year or so have not been on the basis of clear productivity gains but, rather, as the result of a flowon arrangement through the award process. Therefore, the question we are facing at the macro level of this economy is to what extent can additional wage increases be added on-whether they be direct or indirect, as is currently the situation with superannuation-without effectively reducing the opportunities of employment for many people. This leads me to the next important point. Last year the Government introduced into this House amendments to the superannuation Bills which had as their objective expanding the access to superannuation so that it would be available. to all income earners. It talked then about employees who were part time, temporary, casual and so forth. The realities are that the Government did not go far enough in that direction because the measures do not effectively pick up those hundreds of thousands of workers who for various reasons cannot be adequately catered for in the context of either' unionbased schemes or employer-based schemes. It was precisely to help those people and to attract them into self-saving mechanisms that the Opposition developed the concept of the retirement savings account specifically so that people who may not mat- otherwise be covered would have access路 to the same levels of taxation support and benefits and the incentive to be able to save for their own retirement. But it does not matter which road one goes down. The inexorable reality is that because of the existing taxation regime on superannuation and because of the realities of the impact of the new taxation schedules on superannuation, workers on incomes of less than $30,000, which is the vast majority, can be shown to be net losers. There is also the question as to whether the actual net dividend yield on those funds over a period of time will be adequate to compensate for those levels of tax. The. Treasurer (Mr Keating) on previousoccasions has gone on record as saying that no superannuant will be worse off by one cent. I have brought material into this chamber to show, and the industry has emphasised through the media, that that statement is fundamentally flawed. No attempt has been made by the Government at any time .to justify the statement made by the Treasurer. I turn now to the question of the capacity of the workers to be truly protected in relation to their investment. The Minister for Science and Technology would no doubt take the view that the current arrangements in relation to the provisions for protection through the trusteeship arrangements are adequate for workers in industry-or union-based schemes. Two years ago we put forward in this House and in the Senate proposals to amend the superannuation regulations to give ordinary workers the right to nominate and elect their representatives to the boards of trustees. It is a matter of the greatest concern to me and to the Opposition that the Australian Democrats united with the Government on that occasion to vote against that proposal. It seems quite extraordinary that one can be a shareholder in a company with a right to vote 'for one's board of directors but apparently, as a de facto shareholder in a superannuation scheme, one has no such right. I emphasise the point that that right should be absolute. It should not just be a right relating to superannuation schemes run by unions or industry. It should be a right enshrined in the regulations which covers industry-based schemes and employer-based schemes. That is not the situation at present. I refer to an article by Daryl Dixon in the Sydney Morning Herald last week in which he emphasised the fact that more employees should join superannuation boards. He made the point in this article, and it is absolutely correct, that there are too many examples of companies which get themselves into financial difficulties, of companies which have, in fact, exceeded the limit laid down by the Office of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner (OISC)-namely, a 10 per cent limit on the amount of funds of the superannuation scheme which may be invested in the company-because there are ways of getting around those regulations. - I am particularly concerned about a press report which appeared only last week that a significant number, if not a majority, of funds apparently are not yet meeting the OISC requirements. That is a matter of great concern. It is not adequate for the Treasurer or for other Ministers to come in here and say, 'What a wonderful thing superannuation is. We have our four million people cover(,!d'. According to the Treasurer, we are going to have between $600 billion and $800 billion in national savings by the end of this decade' and at the same time we will not have in place an adequate administrative system which protects the fundamental rights of the contributors to those schemes. As the honourable member for Dawson also said, we have seen over the last eight years an increase in superannuation taxation of approximately 1,000 per cent. It is, as I said earlier, a tax-driven policy. It is dressed up to be attractive to all the workers of Australia. I support absolutely the right of every worker, regardless of whether he be permanent, par- time, temporary or casual, to achieve a degree of financial independence in his retirement. But there are legitimate reasons why the Opposition parties in this House and at the time of the last election have been prepared to debate the fundamental issues in this area. An examination of the Government's record and the statements made by its Ministers over recent months give cause for concern. I draw attention, for example, to comments made by the then Minister for Social. Security, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe). He made the point that the 'investment strategies of superannuation funds would be the political issue of the 1990s'. I asked the Minister and the Treasurer on that occasion to explain to this House precisely what those words meant. What the Minister said last year will probably be absolutely correct because one cannot have a regime which collects from the workers of Australia some $600 billion or $800 billion and which will give to industry based schemes, especially to the unions, enormous political and financial clout and at the same time try to confuse the issue and ignore the implications. It is very interesting that the Treasurer said on 26 Septembt'r last year to a meeting of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in Sydney: If the trade unions at any time are placed in a hostile political environment they will face it not only with their negotiating power in the labour market. They will face it being a significant controlling element of that $600 billion of savings. But who owns these savings? They are the savings of the Australian people. They are the savings of you and I and hundreds of thousands of working Australians who ask only one thing, and that is that the investment they make in superannuation schemes, whether they be employer-based or industry-based, be secure. They ask that the decisions made will not be decisions which will result in the loss of their savings. They ask that the tax forgone by every other taxpayer in Australia, whether they be superannuants or not, will not be lost because of dubious activities from whatever source. Those activities may be by employers, as I said, fiddling the system in relation to the 10 per cent rule or by unions using the undoubted muscle which they are going to have through this massive investment which the Treasurer rightly identified as a means in the future of being able to say to employers and to entire industries, 'We will tell you what you will produce. We will tell you how it will be produced. We will tell you where it will be sold and we will tell you what will be sold'. There will be honourable members here, including no doubt the Minister for Science and Technology, who will regard that as fanciful. The unfortunate fact is that when one gives enormous and virtually unbridled power to a few it is usually the rights of the many which are transcended and crushed underfoot. It is for that reason, above all, that we have raised here today the issues which concern the administration of superannuation in Australia. We are seeing now a significant change in the status of the industry. We are seeing the National Mutual takeover by the ANZ bank. There are other proposals before us of other superannuation funds which are being combined. I confidently believe that within the decade there will be as few as three major superannuation funds in this country. I say to the House: This is the time to start seriously considering whether it is in the national interest that we should have a handful of people, accountable virtually to no one, with the right in their hands to determine the investment patterns of this nation. This will be the case, whether or not that power be held by a small group of trade union representatives as: trustees on boards, put there by the unions, not by the employees for whose funds they are responsible. The other extreme is that there will be a group of investment managers who will also have enormous power over investment portfolios and directions of investment in this country. In this event, the very future of long-term savings in this land would be in doubt. There is a point beyond which the Government cannot pass in its efforts to say, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Capricornia, did, that superannuation contributions should be compulsory. Just as we talk about compulsion in relation to health insurance, there is a case to say that people in employment should be expected to make a contribution while they are able so that they can have a higher level of income in retirement. There is a case for that. There is no case for government, of any colour, to come in here and argue on the specious grounds that the end justifies the means, because the responsibility before this House and before the Government is that we must ensure that the funds contributed by at present four million Australians, and hopefully six million Australians in future, are secure and well invested in a manner that is in the best interests of those people and, ultimately, in the best interests of the nation, through the development of a more effective system of domestic savings. We know, as does the Government, that the levels of domestic savings in this country today are thoroughly unsatisfactory. We know that one of the reasons for that is the effect that Government economic policies have had over the past next seven years, which have made it very difficult for many millions of Australians to adequately save for their future. We know, and the Government should know, that saying to a young person today that he is required to take out superannuation while at the same time asking that person to save for his first home is unrealistic in the face of current interest rate levels. It is an impossible goal to achieve. For that reason, I say to the House that the time has come to take a much wider approach to this whole issue. The questions of health insurance, at one extreme, retirement income, closely related to it, and the capacity to save for one's first home should be integrated in a total package so that people will know at an early stage after going into the income cycle precisely how they can best contribute to their financial independence, to give them the capacity to have access to a home, to have a family and pursue their right to be able to house that family and maintain an adequate standard of living in retirement. These are all part of the process of life. It is not sufficient to say that superannuation simply applies at the end of the day when one leaves employment. I have noted that much has been said by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, by Gary Weaven in debates that I have had with him, by Mr Crean, and by others, over the last few years, ori the whole question of domestic savings and superannuation. However, the fact is that superannuation today is seen by the trade union movement as a way of increasing its power over many hundreds of thousands of Australians who are not even members of trade unions. It is their rights that we must protect. Mr LES SCO'IT (Oxley) (l0.59)-The Superannuation Bill 1990, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Bill 1990 and the Occupational Superannuation (Reasonable Benefit Limits) Amendment Bill are important Bills. I am amazed at the Opposition using this debate as an opportunity to attack the trade union movement, rather than really getting to the issues involved. There is little doubt in this country that the issue of superannuation should have been addressed by the Government many years ago, and certainly back in the 1950s when honourable members opposite were in government. They have certainly failed over many years to look at the issues that we are addressing today and that ,is probably now why they are in opposition. Other speakers have already pointed out that the reason we need to look at superannuation today is because of an 'ageing population looking towards, say, 2021. A couple of the points raised by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) certainly need to be addressed, particularly in relation to the 3 per cent level of contribution. The discussion at the moment in relation to wages-",19

27,Mr NA BROWN,COMMONWEALTH LEGAL AID,"Menzies) (10.10)The Opposition supports the Commonwealth Legal Aid Amendment Bill 1990. It is not necessary to go into the provisions of the Bill in any great detail, especially as there is now a premium on time. I join with other honourable members who have quite properly criticised the Government for the way in which this' series of debates is being conducted. Debate has been truncated on many very important Bills. We register the strongest objection to this being done. That having been said, the fact remains that this Bill is not contentious. With the economy of time that might be able to be achieved with respect to this Bill, that time saved may be able to be invested in the debating time available on other pieces of legislation. I will now speak briefly about the provisions of the Bill. On many occasions the Government does not explain in clear, simple language just what a Bill is seeking to achieve. It is therefore appropriate to set this out so that people who read the Hansard in the future will at least get some inkling of the objectives of the piece of legislation. I also wish to point out some problems with the drafting of the Bill but, as I say, the Opposition will not be opposing the Bill. The Bill makes amendments of a technical drafting nature to the Commonwealth Legal Aid Act 1977. The purpose of the amendments is to complement the arrangements between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory for the establishment of the proposed Northern Territory Legal Aid Commission. The Bill will amend section 3 of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Act 1977 by redefining the expression 'State' to include the Northern Territory. The second major amendment is to section 20 of the Act. It will remove the reference to the Northern Territory in paragraph (b) of the definition of 'approved Legal Aid Commission'. The substance of the amendments is to place the proposed Northern Territory Legal Aid . Commission in the same position as State Commissions so as to preserve the various rights under part IV of the Act that current employees of the Australian Legal Aid Office have and will be able to take with them when they transfer to the proposed Northern Territory Commission. It is a fairly simple and straightforward notion, which flows from the establishment of the proposed Northern Territory Legal. Aid Commission. The objective is quite reasonably to preserve and protect the rights of employees who will be transferring to that body. As I have already indicated, the Bill has some shortcomings in its drafting. Although we do not oppose the Bill, we live in hope that by repeating these points time and again one day, who knows, we might get some clear Commonwealth tant drafting. We therefore record thatthis Bill seeks to redefine the word 'State' so that it includes the Northern Territory. doing so, it constitutes one more example of drafting which does not measure up to Romania. the standards we could reasonably expect. In this respect, the definition of 'State' to include the Northern Territory flies in the face of some pretty well established constitutional and legislative principles with respect to the meaning of that word 'State'. The next thing that will happen we start defining the word 'State' to inBill, clude the Northern Territory will be that the Northern Territory will be asking for days. 12 senators. I gather that hints of that have been made over the last few years anyway. To put it at its 19west, there no need for encouragement. Although the aspirations to statehood are quite legitimentary mate, it is not appropriate to take that great leap forward in a Bill of this sort. We believe that it would have been better to draw differently the definition of 'legal aid commission' in section 3 of the Act or to add a third definition to the phrase 'approved legal aid commission'. We ask, rhetorically: would that not have been better drafting? If this course action had been taken, the desirable obportunity ject of this Bill would be achieved without upsetting well-established principles on the meaning of the word 'State'. Nevertheless, having said that, we will not be moving amendments and we believe that the vathe lidity of the amendment Bill will not affected by what we regard as shortcomsome ings in its drafting because, despite tempts made to achieve what would seem to be a different objective, the meaning ends up being reasonably clear when one studies it. We therefore think the Bill probably does achieve the purpose in this tended for it, so we support it and send it on its way.",24
28,Mr COSTELLO,COMMONWEALTH LEGAL AID,The honourable member .for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) has more than adequately outtant lined the position of the Opposition on the Commonwealth Legal Aid AmendWe ment Bill. We take the opportunity to that indicate to the House how unfortunate it is now that the legislation which is importo the administration of justice in this country and indeed important to the administration of the nation can be rushed In through in such short periods of time.,25
29,Mr NA BROWN,COMMONWEALTH LEGAL AID,It's like being in,25
30,Mr COSTELLO,COMMONWEALTH LEGAL AID,"It is worse .than being in Romania. We take extreme umbrage at the fact that the guillotine is falling all over legislation in this particular sitting and for that reason we do. not seek to prolong the debate on this Bill. If we can if make the guillotine fall earlier on this it may fall later on legislation which will be coming up in the next couple of The Bill does give an opportunity, is however, to sound a note of warning to parliamentary draftsmen and to ParliaCounsel, that it is in the interest of everybody that Bills be worded in clear and unambiguous language. It is undoubtedly true that, if the Parliament says it wants State to mean Territory and Territory to mean State, it can do so. It would be much simpler for all concerned, however, if State were to mean State and Territory were to mean Territory, so that of those who pick up Bills do路 have an opat first glance, on first reading, to know what legislation is all about. I would not have thought in the circumstances that it is consistent with a desire which we hear from time to time to make law accessible to the citizen to engage be in convoluted definitions which may have short circuit in the drafting but ulattimately do not lead to clear and unambiguous legislation in this place. It would be much better, too, if when Bills are brought路 before the Parliament all aspects can be considered so that we do not have piecemeal picking up time after time in disjointed sittings of particular problems that shquld have been ironed out long before they came to this House. Commonwealth legal aid is an impormatter. It is something that we on this side of the House very much support. believe it is of the utmost importance every citizen have access to the courts and that every citizen have adequate representation, so that they can have their rights respected before an independent judiciary. Over recent years, however, it has become a problem for many people in our community to receive adequate provision of legal services, and in part this is because legal services are so labour intensive. We all know the cost of labour these days. In courts of . law where people are arguing for many hours, sometimes days, sometimes weeks and sometimes months, the cost of labour can add up. So it is important that there be that opportunity for citizens to receive adequate access through the Commonwealth legal aid system. But we should not think that Commonwealth funding and Commonwealth legal aid is the only mechanism by which people can have adequate access to the administration of justice. I welcome recent indications, particularly from the New South Wales Bar and from other legal groups, encouraging members in the legal profession, where possible, to donate their services on a voluntary basis for part of their time. I must commend the New South Wales Bar Association. This is an initiative in the very highest traditions of the legal profession-an initiative for those who have a respect for a profession to put something back in for the public and so to increase the honour and the standing of their profession at the time when they provide to the public a very valuable service. I would commend the Bar Association in looking at that scheme and I would urge it to encourage fellow 1;>ar associations and law societies in that regard. That is an example where, through the voluntary provision of services by those engaged in a profession, the public can be helped and an important principlenamely, access to justice-can be facilitated. Commonwealth legal aid, of course, is another avenue. Unfortunately, the scheme has developed now to a situation where only those in special circumstances, or only those who come within means tests which mayor may not be fair, have access to the scheme. This has meant that in some situations the Commonwealth can be funding one party and not the other. and in some ways this can lead to rather an imbalance. We would do something about this imbalance, if we encouraged the voluntary acceptance of responsibility through some of the schemes that I have already discussed in these brief remarks. As it is, the Commonwealth Legal Aid Amendment Bill, which comes before this Parliament, is merely attending to machinery matters. As it attends to those machinery matters we have no in-principle objection to the substance which it achieves. We do have objections to the way in which it comes, and the way in which it is drafted. We put the point, as we put the point time after time in plea to the Department, to the counsel, that it would be far better if there were adequate time to consider these matters, if there were straightforward drafting, and if all of those parts of a particular scheme which need to be implemented could be implemented at the same time. Having made those important remarks and having put . in that plea, I restate the position of the Opposition on this Bill and I hope that this becomes part of an ongoing review of the legal aid scheme so that it admits of the purpose for which it was created and contributes to that very important aspect of justice.",25
31,Mr WRIGHT,COMMONWEALTH LEGAL AID,"Capricornia) (11.23)As was explained when the Commonwealth Legal Aid Amendment Bill was first introduced by the Hon. Michael Tate and subsequently in the House here, this is really the culmination of long-term negotiations that have been taking place between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory and I am pleased to see that it has been welcomed generally by Liberal, National and Labor party members alike. We all understand the importance of having a legal aid structure in this riation. One harks back to the initiative taken by Lionel Murphy as the Attorney-General in the Whitlam Government. I notice the smile on the face of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), but we must give credit where credit is due: it was that man who had the foresight to undertake a major structuring of a legal aid system right across this nation. I also think he had the foresight to ensure that it involved the States. We can have something imposed from the highest possible level, but .legal aid is something that is needed by people in the ordinary towns and cities of the nation and, in my personal opinion, it is best administered by the States. But it has needed State and Territory cooperation and this Bill is going to finally achieve the second last stage of that ongoing program that has. been pursued by the Commonwealth to ensure that we have a national structure. Once the Northern Territory sets up its legal aid commission, there will be only Tasmania without one, and there is some optimism that within seven or eight months we will also have the Australian Legal Aid Office (ALAO) in Tasmania closing down and its functions being picked up by a Tasmanian legal aid commission. It is important that people realise that this is their money that is being used. The Commonwealth contributed in the last year over $100m directly to the States to fund the legal aid services. One could add to that millions of dollars-in fact, I think it is something like $ 12m-that was'spent on Aboriginal legal aid. Then one can add again the other assistance that has been given to the community legal aid network. In Queensland we have the Caxton legal aid service, in which our own Premier, Wayne Goss, played a very significant role. The honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) has also had a working relationship with it over a long period in his professional capacity as a lawyer. Wayne Goss, one might say, cut his teeth in community legal aid, in the Caxton Street, as it was then called, now the Caxton legal aid service. It has helped thousands upon thousands of people, as have the other services throughout this nation funded by the Commonwealth, by the people of Australia, because they recognise that people need access to the courts, access to justice and, importantly, access to legal advice, and I will make some final comments on that later. The Commonwealth makes the major contribution. In this arrangement with the Northern Territory, the deal will be 90 per cent for 10 per cent. This will gradually be eroded from the Commonwealth contribution over the next six or seven years. Throughout the nation there is a general agreement that the Commonwealth picks up 55 to 60 per cent and the States pick up 40 to 45 per cent of the costs. But whoever meets the costs, then is clear recognition within the communit; that the costs must be met. I take on board what the honourable member for Higgins said about the role played by the Bar and by the profession. One ought to give credit where credit is due, for certainly if it were not for the early initial actions of the legal profession we would not have had any sort of legal aid system. It was the lawyers who gave of their time and provided their services, one might say on the cheap-certainly cheap in terms of price but not in terms of quality-to assist those people in need. We have seen :.:ommittees set up in various towns where the law societies have had their officers turn up as duty solicitors. The payments made to these lawyers have been a pittance. The legal aid system in fact depends on the cooperation of the legal profession because, as again most people would appreciate, the lawyers who participate in the legal aid system do not get the full professional fees that they might be able to demand if路 they were to deal with commercial enterprise or the private sector alone. So this is a comb i- . nation, a cooperative measure. It is one that involves the lawyers, the legal pfllfession generally, the Bar, the barristers, the solicitors, those who are working at a shop front level helping those in need, those working in the Aboriginal area, those working in the ethnic field, and those who are at an administrative level working in the State commissions. In all, I believe we have a reasonably good legal aid system. There will always be criticisms. I had a criticism put to me the other day by a fellow who is going to have to travel to Tasmania to contest a variation in maintenance action that his ex-wife is bringing because she can get access to legal aid, he cannot. He cannot apply in Queensland but must apply under the legal aid system in Tasmania to see whether he can get any sort of assistance. He is going to have to travel down there to be路 on the spot in that court to contest his ex-wife's actions to try to treble the maintenance for the children. I will not debate the quantum of maintenance because we all accept today that the first responsibility of the breadwinner or income earner is to those children and parents must maintain that responsibility. It is a worry sometimes to hear stories of someone abusing the legal aid system so that they can get at the free l-gal advice and then free legal support to take on an ex-husband or an ex-wife just to incur costs. This same person had to do this once before and it cost him $8,000 in travel costs, accommodation and legal fees to contest the maintenance action. He said to me the other day that he may as well cop it because he will probably' be better off in the long term and not have to meet these costs.' This comes back, I suppose, to the quality of administration and the willingness of the local committees and then the State commissions to ensure that the system is not being abused. We need to ensure in this Parliament that the funds are always forthcoming because' the cost of justice is enormous. People have a right to access the legal system. They understand how costly that can be. Many people will not find justice unless some of those costs are met. We need to ensure that the assistance, however, is given to the needy and not the greedy. I said I was going to make a final comment in relation to legal advice and I shall do that because it is vitally important that we do have a litigation mechanism where people can nceive that financial assistance to contest a matter in the court. I am finding more and more as a member of parliament dealing with grassroots problems that the most important requirement today is simply access to adviee. That requirement is coming not just from needy families but from business people as well. I see a need for the Parliament and the States and the legal aid system generally to rethink the role that they play in providing legal advice. The provision of legal advice is becoming more and more important and it may well be that a further agreement will have to be arrived at with the States so that greater moneys can be allocated, particularly to that area. Giving correct legal advice can solve a lot of heartaches. In fact, it stops people getting to the courts. It is going to solve many problems if people can hear what their rights and responsibilities are. They often say that lawyers are usually half wrong. I do not cast any aspersions on the honourable lawyers in this House, but clearly, if a person goes to a lawyer the lawyer will always tell him yes, he has an excellent chance of winning. What one needs to remember, however, is that the other party to the dispute has also gone to a lawyer and that person has also been told,yes, he has an excellent chance of winning. But only one ever wins. What surprises a lot people, I suppose, is that the costs are incurred, the actions continue, all the procedures are put in place, but on the day that the debate, the real brawl, the conflict is going to be fought out in the court arena, the settlement is made. I feel that had better advice been given at the outset, then those costs would not have been incurred as the issue proceeded. Legal advice is important. It is important to be available not only at some capital city level; it also has to be available to people on a regular basis. I am not sure whether it is feasible, but it seems to me that we need to consider the concept of a 008 call system so people can get basic legal advice at minimum cosF-the cost of a local call. I appreciate also, having dealt with many aspects of consumer law and represented many people in small claims tribunals in that area, that one needs to see it in writing, to sit down with a person to see what the substance of his case is. The substantial matters cannot always be picked up on the phone. Again there should be some initial access, some reasonable system set up so that if people have a problem, they can pick up a phone, ring the legal advice bureau, or whatever it might be called, and find out whether they have a case at all. The legal aid officers at the moment very careful. They do not say, 'Yes, are going to win this, come in and we will fund you'. They make people think of through the obligations they have, the that at the end of the day they might to contribute, because people do not derstand that. They feel that legal aid some bottomless pit of funding. They do not realise that they could be required to contribute. I think once the information is known to a lot路 of people, they would rethink some of the actions they take The present system has worked well. Whilst a lot of money is being spent by the Commonwealth-$120m-odd in to9 tal-it is certainly money well spent. I hopeful that this legislation is nearing ultimate objective of having a national system of legal aid whereby the States have their legal aid commissions and that the funds will come in a supportive on a 50:50 or 60:40 basis from the ComAct, monwealth, and that at the end of the we can claim in this country that people do have access to justice, that justice available to every Australian.",26
32,Mr DUFFY,COMMONWEALTH LEGAL AID,"in reply-I thank the honourtier able member for Menzies (Mr N. A. That Brown), the honowable member for consequences Higgins (Mr Costello) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) for tributors their contributions. I particularly thank the honourable member for Capricornia for his brief reference to the history legal aid in this country and the tribute that he paid to a former Attorney-General who, of course, as the honourable ber mentioned, looked far enough ahead to realise the need to involve the States in legal aid. In respect of the matters raised by the honourable member for Menzies and the honourable member for Higgins, it is pleasing that they looked the amendment as attending to machinery matters. They have路 no objection to the amendment in that sense. Their comI ments were directed more towards some criticisms of drafting and some other general observations. In respect of the drafting, the question of the wording 'State' and 'Territory' was referred to by both the honourable memare ber for Menzies and the honourable memyou ber for Higgins. This amendment is consequential to the change in definition 'State' to include the Northern Terrifact tory. The Commonwealth Legal Aid have Amendment Bill is necessary because it unamends the Commonwealth Legal Aid is Commission Act 1977 to ensure that part IV of the Act dealing with the preservation of various rights applies to officers of the Australian Legal Aid Office who transfer to the proposed Northern Territory on. Legal Aid Commission. As that Commission is due to commence on 1 July, fO.llowing the execution of the agreement of May between the Commonwealth and am the Northern Territory, the date for the the commencement and transfer of staff cannot be deferred because planning and commitments are at an advanced stage. Without the proposed amendments to the way, Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission staff transferring to the Northern day Territory Commission would not be eligible persons for the purpose of division is 3 of part IV of the Public Service Act. This would mean, of course, that they would not become. persons to whom division 3 of part IV-that is, the second of the mobility provisions-apply. would have all sorts of unfortunate because the second tier coverage enables those staff to remain conto the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, continue to apply for Australian Public Service vacancies of notified in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and have access to special avenues of return in the event of termimemnation of their employment. The Bill, as I said, is uncontroversial. It contains the amendments that I have referred to which are supported by the Opposition, despite the fact that both the at honourable member for Menzies and the honourable member for Higgins have made some criticisms of the drafting. As said earlier, the amendments are consequential to the change to the definition of 'State' to include the Northern Territory. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

33,Mr ROBERT BROWN,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,",-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. A central plank in the Government's cro-economic reform agenda for restrucration, turing the public sector is that government business enterprises (GBEs) should be efficient as possible. and responsive to consumers' needs. The GBEs within Transport and Communications portfolio, in addition to producing final goods and services for consumers, also produce termediate inputs for the rest of the econvided omy, with a resulting impact on Australia's overall cost structures and the ability Australian businesses to compete internalance tionally. The Government sees the combelieves mercialisation of GBEs as a necessary and fundamental pre-condition to improvethat ments in efficiency. GBEs such as the Aviation Authority and the Federal Airwill ports Corporation (FAC) are therefore being placed on a more commercial footreplacement ing, bringing them more into line with disciplines traditionally associated with private sector enterprises. This Bill, together with the Civil AviaMinister tion Amendment Bill 1989, represents legislative changes necessary to finalise Government's reform of its aviation dustry enterprises. The reform package unacceptable. accords broadly with reform packages for other enterprises in the Transport and Communications portfolio which were announced in the ministerial statement 25 May 1988 entitled 'Reshaping the Transport and Communications Government, ment Business Enterprises'. However, as a relatively recent piece of legislation, Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 already incorporates a number of measures which accord closely with changes be made to other public authorities through the GBE reform process. For example, the Act establishes corporate planning and financial targets as the basis for Government oversight of the F AC. To some extent, therefore, the Bill rep1990 resents fine-tuning of the existing strategic controls over the Corporation to bring them more closely into line with other reform packages agreed by the Government. It also removes a range of detailed which the Government still exercises over the activities of the Corporation. In addition to presenting a package of mireforms for the Federal Airports Corpothe Bill includes provisions which will allow the Corporation to participate as in arrangements to prevent or deal with hijacking or other acts of unlawful interthe ference with civil aviation. I now turn to specific provisions con.:. intained in the Bill. A major change profor in the Bill is the scrutiny of proposed statutory charges levied by the of FAC under the Act by the Prices SurveilAuthority (PSA). The Government there is a need for visible checks and balances to be put in place to ensure there is no perceived misuse of the Civil FAC's monopoly position. The Minister retain the formal power to disallow charges and be given the power to set charges. The provisions are the intended to enhance the effectiveness of the Minister's present power. to approve or disapprove charges, by providing the with the opportunity to consider the any report of the PSA before making a the decision and by enabling the Minister to inset charges to replace those which are In Hne with the philosophy of moving from oversight of day-today operations to an emphasis on results and Board acof countability, the Bill removes a range of day-today controls exercised by governincluding controls over the terms and conditions of individual borrowings, the the approval of individual contracts, the purchase of shares and the establishment of subsidiaries and partnerships. These are now appropriately the responsibility of the Board. The Bill provides greater recognition the role and purposes of the Board, and greater emphasis on Board accountability for the performance of the Corporation. It also provides for an increase in Board size from seven to nine members. Other provisions in the Bill relating to appointment .and dismissal of Board members, conduct of Board meetings and the appointment and powers of the Chief Executive Officer reflect more clearly the respective roles of the Minister and the Board and clarify issues of administration of the Corporation. The Government is fully satisfied that appropriate scrutiny expenditure by the FAC will be maintained through the strategic oversight process. Although the FAC currently pays a range of Commonwealth and State taxes and duties, it is exempt from payment of Commonwealth sales tax and Commonwealth income tax. This Bill removes that exemption and provides for the FAC to be fully subject to Commonwealth sales tax with effect from 1 July 1990 and Commonwealth income tax with effect from 1 July 1991. The Bill has no immediate financial implications for the Commonwealth, although, over time, the reforms路 of the Federal Airports Corporation included in the Bill are expected to enhance the efficiency of the Corporation and improve its returns to the Commonwealth. The imposition of income tax on the Corporation for the 1991-92 financial year is expected to result in increased revenue to the Commonwealth. The amounts cannot be accurately quantified at this time, as they depend on a number of factors, including the profitability of the Corporation, the extent of tax deductions obtained and the tax rates prevailing in the 1991-92 financial year. Liability for payment of Commonwealth sales tax, with effect from the beginning of the 1990-91 financial year will result in increased revenue to the Commonwealth. The amounts will depend on actual purchases by the Corporation and cannot be accurately quantified at this time. 1 commend the Bill to the House for and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

34,Mr ROBERT BROWN,CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. of A central plank in the Government's micro-economic reform agenda for restructuring the public sector is that government business enterprises (GBEs) should be as efficient as possible and responsive to consumers' needs. The GBEs within the transport and communications portfolio; in addition to producing final goods and services for consumers, also produce intermediate inputs for the rest of the economy, with a resulting impact on Australia's overall cost structures and the ability of Australian businesses to compete internationally .. The Government sees the commercialisation of GBEs as a necessary and fundamental pre-condition to improvements in efficiency. GBEs such as the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Federal Airports Corporation are therefore being placed on a more commercial footing, bringing them more into line with the disciplines traditionally associated with private sector enterprises. This Bill, together with the Federal Airports Corporation Amendment Bill 1990, represents the legislative changes necessary to finalise the Government's reform of its aviation industry enterprises. The reform package accords broadly with reform packages for other enterprises in the transport and communications portfolio which were announced in the ministerial statement of 25 May 1988 'Reshaping the Transport and Communications Government Business Enterprises'. However, as a relatively recent piece of legislation, the Civil Aviation Act 1988 already incorporates a number of measures which accord closely with changes made to other public authorities through the GBE reform process. For example, the Act established cor- . porate planning and financial targets as the basis for Government oversight of the CAA. To some extent, therefore, the Bill represents finetuning of the existing strategic controls over the Authority to bring them more closely into line with other reform packages agreed by the Government. It also removes a range of detailed controls which the Government still exercises ov-r the activities of the Authority. In addition to presenting the package of reforms for the CAA, the Bill also includes provisions relating to the carriage of dangerous goods, clarification of the provisions relating to statutory liens on aircraft and protection from State laws where the CAA performs a function directly related to the regulation of air safety. The Bill also implements two amendments arising from recommendations of the first report of the Air Safety Regulation Review Task Force. I now turn to specific provisions contained in the Bill. A key element in establishing an environment within the CAA which will encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency is the proposal to remove Public Service Act coverage of its employees, thereby making the CAA Board the direct employer and allowing a more flexible and business like approach to the management of the Authority. Transitional arrangements contained in the Bill provide that existing staff will continue to be employed, initially, on the same terms and conditions. Mobility provisions of the Public Service Act will continue to apply. Another major change provided for in the Bill is the scrutiny of proposed statutory charges levied by the CAA under the Act by the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA). The Government believes there is a need for visible checks and balances to be put in place to ensure that there is no perceived misuse of the CAA's moncpoly position. The Minister will retain the formal power to disallow charges and be given the power to set replacement charges. The provisions are intended to enhance the effectiveness of the Minister's present power to approve or disapprove charges, by providing the Minister with the opportunity to consider any report of the PSA before making his decision and by enabling the Minister to set charges to replace those which are unacceptable. In line with the philosophy of moving from oversight of day to day operations to an emphasis on, results and Board accountability, the Bill removes a range of day to day controls exercised by government, including controls over the terms and conditions of individual borrowings, the approval of individual contracts, the purchase of shares and the establishment of subsidiaries and partnerships. These are now appropriately the responsibility of the Board. Other provisions in the Bill relating to appointment and dismissal of Board members, conduct of Board meetings and the appointment and powers of the chief executi ve officer reflect more clearly the respective roles of the Minister and the Board and clarify issues of administration of the Authority. Although the CAA currently pays a range of Commonwealth and State taxes and duties, it is exempt from payment of Commonwealth income tax. This Bill removes that exemption and provides for the CAA to be fully subject to Commonwealth income tax with effect from 1 July 1991. As I indicated earlier, other provisions in the Bill, unrelated to the reform measures outlined above, include measures to implement, as far as practicable, the recommendations of the Air Safety Regulation Review Task Force first report that the cost to industry of proposed standards of aviation safety should be taken into account by the Authority, and that significant offences in the regulations relating to crucial areas of air safety should the included in the Act. The Bill also strengthens the role of the Authority in specifying conditions for the carriage or consignment of dangerous goods and provides for the establishment of dangerous goods training programs for air operators and freight forwarders. The Act currently requires the Authority to grant individual permissions to carry or consign dangerous goods and to specify conditions in respect ofeach such permission. The section does not enable the Authority to grant general permissions. The amendments will empower the Authority to grant general permissions, in addition to the specific permissions currently provided for. Such permissions would be specified in civil aviation orders or the civil aviation regulations and would be subject to such conditions as the Authority specifies in the orders or regulations, as the case may be, in relation to the particular permission. In order to ensure the effective screening of dangerous goods the Act will be amended to provide that an air operator must not carry air cargo and a freight forwarder must not accept any air cargo unless it is accompanied by a declaration of the contents of the cargo. Provisions in the Act relating to statutory liens on aircraft have been amended to rectify a deficiency in the definition of that term, and to extend the existing protection offered to the Authority and its officers to cover actions brought for recompense of economic loss suffered as a result of seizure of aircraft under the statutory liens provisions. The Act already provides that when an aircraft has been seized l\nder a statutory lien then neither the Authority nor its officers may be sued for loss of, or damage to, the aircraft. The Bill also provides that a state law will not apply to the Authority or its property where it is necessary for the Authority to perform functions directly related to the purpose of regulating air safety. The particular functions are the provision of air route and airway facilities, air traffic control and flight on aerodromes, rescue and fire fighting services and search and rescue services. It is intended that this particular provision - ill only be used where the matter is essential to the performance of the Authority and negotiations with a State or local government authority have been un, able to result in resolutions. On the recommendation of the Attorney-General's Department, the Bill amends existing pecuniary penalty provisions to bring the Act into line with recent amendments to the Crimes Act 1914. The Bill has no immediate financial implications for the Commonwealth"" although, over time, the reforms of the Civil Aviation Authority included in the Bill are expected to enhance the efficiency of the Authority and improve its returns to the Commonwealth. The imposition of income tax on the Authority for 1991-92 and subsequent financial years is expected to result in increased revenue to the Commonwealth. The amounts cannot be accurately quantified at this time, as they depend on a number of factors including the profitability of the Authority, the extent of tax deductions obtained and the prevailing tax rates.

35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Hollis)I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate the Federal Airports Corporation Amendment Bill 1990 concurrently with the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1990. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",33
36,Mr JULL,CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Opposition will not J?e opposing the Federal services Airports Corporation Amendment Bill 1990 and the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1990. However, I would like to spend some time this morning drawing to the attention of the House some of the difficulties that we see facing this vital area of the Australian economy in the next few years. There is no doubt that this legislation is needed. The position we are reaching today, as a result of this Government's legislation, is that which was proposed by the Opposition when the decision was first made to establish the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) three and four years ago. Our position then was that we should have put those organisations straight into this position of being full government business enterprises (GBEs). We feel that many of the difficulties that have arisen in the aviation area in the past few years could well have been overcome had that been done from the beginning. But we welcome the fact that we have got thus far. We feel that many of the difficulties that have arisen in the aviation area of the last few years could well have been overcome had that in fact been done from the beginning. But we do welcome the fact that we have at least got thus far. Today we embark on yet another episode in the long saga of Australian aviation. Most members in this House would realise that the Australian aviation industry was tremendously well respected and the administration of civilian aviation in Australia was regarded as the best in the world prior to about 1974 when the decision was then made to incorporate that particular department into the Department of Transport. While not wanting to be critical of all administrations since that time, it is a fact that civil aviation to a great degree has gone from pillar to post between various departments and to the point that we have now where we have them as full government business enterprises. One would hope that this will be an opportunity, especially for the Civil Aviation Authority to settle down and to make sure that we are restored as being one of the leaders in terms of the administration of civil aviation. When debating these particular Bills I think it is important that we do regard them-even though it is a cognate debate-as two separate entities because there is a very great .difference in terms the nature and the responsbilities of the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation. The CAA is basically an administrative body; it is a regulatory body. It is its duty, of course, to make sure that we do ,have that proud civil aviation record and that we do have the efficient industry of which we have been so proud in the past. On the other hand there are some very real options for the Federal Airports Corporation in terms of its commercial nature, and it can be quite commercial. The CAA is required under this legislation to try to draw back as much as it possibly can the costs incurred in the administration of civil aviation. That is fine. I welcome the Government move to make sure that all charges that are imposed by the CAA-and to that degree the Federal Airports Corporation too-come under the jurisdiction of the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA). One of the things that has in fact happened in the last few years is that within the industry and in particular in the general aviation industry there has been some very real concern at the nature of some of the charges that are being imposed, some concern at the duplication of the charges that have been imposed by both bodies and a real concern that in fact there will be a decline in the nature of the general aviation industry in Australia if this is allowed to continue. I know that there are reviews going on at the moment in terms of those charges and there is that ongoing concern within general aviation that we could be looking at some increases in charges of up to 800 per cent in coming months as the whole thing is settled down. We believe that the PSA has a very real responsibility indeed to make sure that through the administration by the CAA and the FAC we do not get a situation where many of the operators in general aviation are in fact forced to the wall. A similar situation to this in fact happened in New Zealand, Mr Deputy Speaker. The net result in that country was that there has been a massive decline of in the whole of general aviation. I think it is not without foundation that some of the operators here are concerned that if we get too heavy in terms of the charging and administration of general aviation the same situation may develop in this country. So the PSA has a very real job. There is no doubt that civil aviation administration in Australia has been an area of grave concern in the last couple of years. There has been some hostility between the administrators and the industry; there have been charges arid countercharges of lack of consultation b-tween the CAA, the FAC and the operators; there have been reports done into that and recommendations are in line for implementation now to make sure. that that situation does not go on again .. There have been numerous reportsand in fact court cases-involving the function of some of the civil aviation officers in terms of their policing and administration of the provisions of the CAA Act. We would hope that now that the CAA has the opportunity to bring into operation its own board, its own administration, its own staff, its capacity to hire and fire staff, to bring in horses for courses in some of those very technical areas that aviation brings about, that this will in fact help to settle down the situation and to make sure that it does get back into some semblance of mutual cooperation so that we can see it expand once more. In the introduction of this particular legislation the Opposition looked very closely at those provisions of the Bills that pertain to liens being placed on aircraft. We looked closely at the prospect of moving some amendments in that regard to get rid of that particular section of the Act because we believe that in these days there are other methods in which the Government or the Authority could in fact make up those payments that may not have been submitted by the operators should they have fallen into arrears. We would hope that the CAA in its wisdom may look towards a more business like approach under its new structure in trying to get away from this policeman attitude that seems to have existed whereby some of the officers could go in and place a lien on an aircraft and cause some very great concerns for the operators and, in fact, send them to the wall if they went ahead with some of those provisions. There are a number of these cases. My colleague the honourable member for Mc-herson (Mr Bradford), in his maiden speech yesterday, made reference to the very real difficulty that some of the operators were experiencing at Coolangatta Airport in this regard. Coolangatta Airport, of course, is a - ery busy airport; it has a lot of small entrepreneurial-type operators in the tourist industry. They often express to me as well the concern that they have with some of the attitudes that are taken by the CAA officers. Similar accusations have come to me from airports as far afield as Archerfield in Brisbane and Essendon in Melbourne about some of these attitudes. I hope that one of the very real tasks of the new board of the CAA is to. make sure that it has the right horses for courses in the administration of this very important area. There is concern, that some of the powers of the examiners of airmen may be too wide and maybe an opportunity will arise at a later time in this House to have a closer examination of just what some of those powers might be. I do not think anybody would deny that there must be a very strict control over the whole operation of the civil aviation area, and especially in the general aviation area, and that irresponsible pilots should be brought to task. Public safety must never be compromised. Some of the so-called cowboy operators within the industry are kept under control. But we must make sure that the administration of those provisions is in fact reasonable and does not get out of hand. Some concern was expressed in the other place about the issuing of air operators' certificates. There was a very real plea that the issuing of those licences be streamlined, especially for the general aviation industry. It seems quite remarkable to me that at the height of the pilots dispute it seemed to be almost a rubber stamp operation to be able to get foreign pilots coming into the Australian airways system through the CAA, but in terms of the general aviation industry there was some very real criticism that it is a long and complic'lt-d process to be able to get those licences endorsed. We would hope that the new board looks at that. I turn briefly now to the Federal Airports Corporation !"",;ction of this particular cognate debak; this is also an area of real concern. Within the industry there has also. been criticism in terms of the charges that are impos-d. Many of the smaller operators feel that they are being squeezed with the imposition of these particular charges. Can I say, in defence of the Federal Airports Corporation, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is not going to have a very easy year. It is more commercial in its nature and will have suffered to a much greater extent from the pilots dispute than perhaps even the CAA. In the Estimates committees last night we learned that the CAA in fact had lost something like $60m in charges during that particular dispute and that the Federal Airports Corporation was facing the prospect of some very large losses this year as a result of the pilots dispute. The Federal Airports Corporation is an interesting animal because of the major airports involved with the FAC. Only Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Coolangatta are providing any sort of profit at this stage for that organisation. A number of the other airports are coming close to profitability, and we would hope that that trend would continue. The real difficulty is just how capable the Federal Airports Corporation is going to be of becoming a fully commercialised government body, because this is basically what this legislation is all about. I wonder whether, at this stage, the Federal Airports Corporation is equipped, or has the capacity, under this particular legislation, to really become entrepreneurial and to get the full benefit of its position in terms of being self-funding, being able to provide better infrastructure for Australia and being more efficient so that there can be cost reductions passed on to the longsuffering travelling public in Australia. I make no secret of the fact that one of the reasons why I welcome this particular legislation is that it brings us to a stage now where the FAC can shake itself out and get itself up into a commercial operation. Then, perhaps, at a later time we can look at the very real proposition of moving into some form of privatisation of the Federal Airports Corporation. I do not say that lightly, and I know a great deal of work has to be done. There are a number of propositions that can路 be put up in terms of assisting the Federal AirPOlts Corporation. I know that a lot of the personnel who work for that organisation like the proposition of being fully privatised so that they can get out into the real world and have some sort of impact. Some of the prospects that have been put up include the sale of airports individually. Another proposition is that there should be a combination of the sale of some airports and the privatisation of the F-deral Airports Corporation in other areas. Or there could be a combination of all of those. My personal feeling is that, more realistically, we should look at the privatisation of the F AC as a unit or a number of units. While some people on the other side of the House seem to be totally opposed to privatisation, there are some very real arguments for looking at it, and some very real examples of what privatisation of airports can do overseas. The case I always like to cite is that of Manchester. Manchester was one of the few major airports in the United Kingdom that went out of the control of the British Airports Authority. In some respects it is not unlike the Cairns arrangement in far north Queensland whereby the local authority has some ownership of the airport and there is some private ownership of it. I think the Manchester authorities would be the first to admit that 15 years ago the airport at Manchester was a pretty run-down operation. They decided to go along the commercial road. They had land that could be developed; they had the capacity to go out and get operators to come in; and they did just that. . It is really the most amazing situation now, because my understanding is that Manchester International Airport receives 90 per cent of its revenue away from the airlines, away from the travelling public and away from aviation generally. It has been able to reduce its landing charges and attract a number of international operators as part of the business of being privatised. It can offer lower landing charges, lower handling charges and lower parking charges. A number of airlines, including our own Qantas Airways Ltd, now operate into Manchester. I did a quick check, before coming into the House, of the ABC Airways Guide. Manchester International now attracts 42 overseas airlines into what was a very depressed area of the UK. On that airport site now there have been constructed not only hotels and a few of the shops which one usually imagines to be at an international airport, but whole shopping complexes. There are supermarkets, and every conceivable thing one would want to buy is available at the airport. There are movie theatres. There are seven restaurants, to the point that on the top of the roof of the terminal is what is called the Sky Fry. The idea of the Sky Fry is that kids are taken there on a Sunday afternoon and left there eating their fish and chips or hamburgers while mum and dad go and do the shopping within the airport. It has become very much a centre of the life of Manchester. Mr O'Keefe-A modern day child-care centre.",33
37,Mr JULL,CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Subtitled 'MCDonalds', I suppose, in some areas. This situation has been quite interesting, because it has picked up a depressed area and created a whole new industry. The whole area of aviation industry is well and truly represented there at the moment. It has opened a new area for tourism. It has opened up a new catchment area from the Midlands to operate through Manchester, which has taken a great deal of pressure off some of the larger airports in the United Kingdom. It is highly profitable and attractive, and is going very well indeed. At some of the airports in Australia there is a lot of land available. We have the opportunity of really doing something about developing these airport sites. Tullamarine is not terribly efficient. It seems to me that at Australian international airports now, if one is lucky, one gets a hotel, a newsagent, a duty free shop, a snack bar, and maybe a flower standand that is about it. Airports are tremendous employers of people. I understand that at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport alone something like 18,000 people are directly employed on the airport site. That is a minitown in itself. Where do they go to do their shopping? They could well do it at the airport. Indirectly at Kingsford-Smith there are something like 56,000 people in the area', without those facilities. I see no reason why there could not be development, either on or close to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, that would attract that sort of traffic. The same certainly can be said of Tullamarine in Melbourne. My own case of Brisbane is probably the perfect example of an airport site just waiting to be developed. After Alice Springs it is the biggest airport site in Australia. It is going to become Australia's No.2 airport-I think by the turn of the century rather than by the year 2005. There is an old airport site there but, quite frankly, nobody quite knows what to do with it at the moment. One of the great contributions to this particular debate from the Federal Airports Corporation was to put a road through the middle of the boundary between the new and the old airports, cut a runway in two and really knock off the prospect of being able to do any major development in combining the two sites. I wonder whether that was not a bit short sighted because there was a very real opportunity to develop major aviation industries and high-technical industries that would have been very good for Brisbane and Australia. To add to that argument about Brisbane Airport, it was interesting that in the heyday of the proposed new operators coming into Australia after deregulation, the major players in the game were all looking at basing themselves at Brisbane. One of the great things going in favour of one of those operators was that, if it went there, one of the major aircraft manufacturers would come in and provide the backup facilities. That would have brought a great deal of high-tech industry to. Queensland and, indeed, to Australia, because it could well have become a hub for the South Pacific. I do not know what is going to happen under this legislation and whether the Federal Airports Corporation is going to go ahead and look for the prospect of development. I think there are some very real opportunities for us to look at the full privatishave at ion of the FAC, to allow it to go ahead and develop these airports profitably and create between airports in Australia competition that would allow those airports to provide cheaper services to attract international carriers and domestiC operators into a particular area and, by doing it that way, to force down the cost to the Australian travelling public. The Opposition, when in government, will look very closely indeed at trying to pass on the cost benefits of the development of airport sites to the travelling public, because we have some very real concerns about the way the charges are going at the moment. The Opposition finds absolutely no problem at all with the sections in this Bill dealing with the anti-hijack provisions. We think it is right that the FAC should have a full input into determining the provisions of that particular section. We welcome the provision in the legislation regarding the carriage of dangerous goods. It is quite surprising that in Australia and, indeed, throughout the world there has not been a closer examination of the ramifications of what goes on in the freight holds of aircraft or in some freighter aircraft. We have already had in Australia an example of somebody who accumulated from visits to hotels and motels around Australia safety matches which ignited in the baggage in the cargo hold of an aircraft and caused delays to that aircraft. There is a host of dangerous goods that travel on aircraft all day, every day around Australia. Things like photographic materials are highly inflammable. One would want to make sure, when getting on an aircraft, that the freight loaders have full knowledge of what is going into that cargo hold. Therefore, we certainly welcome those provisions. There are very real challenges ahead for the new boards of the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority. We acknowledge the fact that those boards are going to be expanded by another two people in each case. We hope that when the Government makes those appointments they. will be of people who an intimate knowledge-perhaps even an operational knowledge-of the aviation industry, because another criticism has been that a number of people who have been involved in aviation do not have much of an aviation background. The industry is looking for that. It wants to have people who have a thorough knowledge of the very real difficulties that the industry faces, especially in general aviation. It wants an understanding of the potential of this particular industry and it wants to make sure that we have people who are committed to making sure that we have the safest and best aviation system in the world. We wish the new boards well. We hope that they make the appropriate adjustments in terms of the personnel who will be employed in these new government business enterprises. We hope that the Government will not just stop there, especially in terms of the Federal Airports Corporation, that there will be a further examination of the possibility of loosening up the F AC even more to make it entrepreneurial, to make sure that the Australian travelling public gets the best value for money and to make sure that we have the proper provision of equipment at the airports. I have not raised that aspect just in this speech; I mentioned it also in a debate late last week. There are some very real difficulties in terms of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and Melbourne and Perth airports with the radar equipment and the air navigational aids in Australia. A great deal of upgrading has to be done. It would seem that there is almost a panic on at the moment to make sure that these things are put into place. We want to make sure that the Federal Airports Corporation, which is going to have massive expenditure in terms of terminal building- in the future, has very real opportunities to provide the best possible. We have the situation of the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport in Sydney and the provision of that third runway which is going to be costly and we believe in the whole principle of cost recovery. We want to make sure that the Federal Airports Corporation has the wherewithal, the knowledge and the gumption to go out there and make very real inroads into the commercialisation of that part of aviation so that the burden does come off the taxpayer. It is a most definite part of our micro-economic reform program here on the Opposition benches in terms of aviation and the aviation infrastructure. While I welcome this particular move, I think the Government still has a great deal further to go in bringing the F AC to its true potential and in achieving the obvious benefits that would flow on to the people of Australia from that.",37
38,Mr OKEEFE,CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish you well in your first indent into the chair, as I understand it. It is a pleasure for me to follow the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) in this particular debate to support the introduction of the Federal Airports Corporation Amendment Bill and the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill. It is also very encouraging for me to hear the honourable member for Fadden this morning calling for the Government to look at further privatisation in this field because, if he is calling for it, it obviously going to be profitable; if it is going to be profitable that is seen by the corporate sector as a good target so that engenders more confidence on my part that the aims that have led to the development of this legislation-the freeing up of the industrial relations structure within these government business enterprises, the introduction of the price capping arrangements and the limits on borrowings that are incorporated-are sound measures that will enable these authorities to carry out their task, to drag through the process of reform as efficient and publicly owned monopolies. That is where I would like to see them stay. But if they are becoming a better or more pronounced target for privatisation, obviously it is seen that they are going to be successful. Tullamarine Airport is in my electorate so obviously I have a close personal interest in these changes, particularly as they affect the operation of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). But I might also say that one of the most informative and pleasurable tasks I have had since joining this Parliament was to spend some time with the standing committee that worked on airports and aircraft and their operations in Australia. It was an enlightening experience for me and I have to say that I welcome the bipartisan approach to this legislation here in the House today, because both the Opposition and the Government see clearly that airports are places of tremendous potential for Australia. The aviation industry is providing the gateway to the world. We as a nation have made some very silly decisions over the decades about where we put our airports and how many of them were put in place. In most instances the decisions were governed more by the politics of which State government would like an airport where, rather than a rational approach to the placing of the infrastructure. In time, we will even have the路 absurd proposition of two airports at Sydney which will simply be a product of history. Down the east coast of Australia we will have six airports that can receive international aircraft. It is not sensible beis cause it has resulted in a duplication of infrastructure. It is historic, but now that we have aB these airports we are faced with the difficult task of deciding how best to develop them, which ones to develop, in which ones to put all the facilities and resources that the honourable member for Fadden talked about, and which ones to operate as secondary engagements. They are hard decisions that the FAC is being given the scope to take under this legislation. The Government established the F AC a few years ago and is now freeing up its operations. It is saying, 'Take this out of the hands of the politicians and narrow sectional interests and take a national overview of the most efficient and economic way to structure these resources, but do so knowing that; if the Corporation wants capital to expand and put new facilities in place, it cannot any longer just go and borrow the money'. As a nation we have begun to discipline ourselves on borrowings, and this legislation will put in place the means by which borrowing limits are imposed on government business enterprises as part of the broad objective. It will also put in place the price-capping arrangements which mean that, if the Corporation wants more money, it will not be able to get it simply by increasing its prices. The efficiencies and the generation of extra revenue must be found from within. I found interesting the observations of the honourable member for Fadden about Manchester Airport. I have not,been there myself, but I will take his word that some quite innovative entrepreneurial thoughts have been taking place about the best way to develop an airport and gain the maximum potential from it. I can tell him that those very same thoughts exist within the planning of the FAC. We will see these sorts of things happening with respect to our airports and, because those directions are unfolding, the F AC is becoming a prime target for private sector ownership. Other things about the operation of airports have to be taken into account which are in direct conflict with the interests the private sector. Airports have to be good neighbours; they must take account of the environment around them and the people who relate to them. If they are left simply to the profit motive, the corporate desire to extract the most from the least, in the end scant regard will be had for the people who live around airports. It has been necessary for the Government to impose on the F AC a charter to improve the relationships of airport administration and management with the communities that live around them. That has been done through an enforced relationship with local government authorities around Australia. It is my view that we have seen significant improvement in consultation, access and information about the planning that is taking place. At Tullamarine we are going through an exercise such as this at the moment. The Federal Airports Corporation has on display the Melbourne airport strategy and the development plan for the airport for the year 2050. There has been public comment and as a result of the public comment it is proppsed that there be a major shift in the plan for where one of the new runways will go. The community has been consulted and changes have been made as a result. The development that takes place at Tullamarine will be in accord with the wishes of the community. The community at the same time fully understands that the airport ,is one of Victoria's major commercial assets. It is a job centre for about 10,000 people directly, and many more who work in the industries that flow from it. It is seen as an important resource, so people are prepared to move with the airport, providing it moves with them. All those sorts of entrepreneurial plans-I am not sure whether we will finish up with a MCDonalds on the rooffor the commerCial development of an airport are in train. The other matter on which the honourable member for Fadden touched and on which I too can add something is the issue of compatibility of what takes place around airports. Again I draw the Tullaof marine example. One of the things that we have done very well at Tullamarine is draw the line on the map where the houses finish and the airport boundary starts. The councils, the developers, and everybody else have been told that there will be no more high density housing inside those boundaries. We are not interested in having residential housing creep up to the end of the runways, such as has happened at other airports in Australia, and then getting into the debate of needing to shift airports because they are not compatible with housing. The space is there to do other things, such as build shopping centres. I am not all that big on shopping centres, because one of the reasons for not having concentrated groups of people around airports is that, if something goes wrong, we do not want to have a target centre with thousands of people in it. In considering the compatible use of airport land we have to look to matters such as storage and warehousing, activities in which not many people are involved,but which represent a profitable and good use of the land. That is all part of the planning strategy. It is hard to find the right blend, but it is being sought. 1 want to comment quickly on the clause in the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill ciently, which provides for the removal of the process. Public Service Act coverage of employees working under the Civil Aviation Authority on airports. The establishment of the board and the direct link-so that these people will be direct employees of the airports rather than employed in the broader Public Service structure-is again consistent with the direction that we are taking in respect of what we call microter's economic reform. That is a rather grand term for just simply a more efficient method of industrial relations and pracment tices, but the closer employees get to their employing authority and the more direct the lines of communication between the people who do the work and those who are making the management decisions the more efficient and effective will be operation. I take great comfort from a private discussion that I had with the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins). One of the things that he has observed is the need for a very rapid have improvement in industrial relations, parularly ticularly in the field of air traffic control, and a need for rapid introduction of equipment and technology that keeps operation of the airports in line with twentieth century. The former Department of Civil Aviavery tion has a lot to answer for. It has to islation. answer for the way it conducted its industrial relations and for the appalling ard of equipment which was allowed to degenerate in the air traffic control towers over the 1970s and early 1980s. We had the absurd example at Tullamarine Airport where a brand new computerised air traffic control system was introduced, in my opinion, via an appalling process of human relations and transition. It was purchased with very little consultation with the people who were going to be using it, and as a result the system had to be chucked out and a new one bought, at an expense of about $30m. All those decisions were put in train before we came to office. It has taken five years to sort out the mess and to get an air traffic control system at T ullamarine that enables the airport to operate effiand we are still in that transition There have been dramatic costs and inefficiencies in the operation of \lirports which have stemmed not in a small way from the industrial relations atmosphere that路 existed under the old Public Service way of running airports. I welcome that amendment because it reflects the Minisdesire to see a much' more direct relationship between people who work at airports and those who make the managedecisions that affect their work. I support the legislation. I am glad that there is almost a consensus approach on both sides of the House. Clearly the reforms are badJy needed and they are seen by all parties to the debate as facilitating the the process of efficiency and dragging Australia into the twenty-first century as the gateway to international airways. , Overall, we ought to be pleased that the Bills are being introduced. It is a good sign for the people in the industry. They been through, difficult, times, particwith the airline dispute last year. The Government and the Parliament are the moving quickly to put in place these the changes so that the whole environment the can be positive and those people can see where their future lies and that it is a promising future. I support the leg",39
39,Mr SMITH,CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Firstly, Mr standDeputy Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment and ask that you pass on my congratulations to Mr Speaker on his appointment.",41
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Nehl)Thank you, I will.",42
41,Mr SMITH,CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I also extend my congratulations to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) who is taking through his first Bill; I wish him well also. As the Opposition spokesman on aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), indicated, the Oppositjon supports the legislation. I rise as the Opposition spokesman on the new area of privatisation. When I say it is a new area, I mean that, although it has been a long standing commitment of our parties, for the first time we have established a specific shadow ministry to look at this issue in more detail. The remarks that I want to make about the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) are in that context, because there is a broader underlying point that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), was making about the need to address the economic uncertainties we face and the need for greater efficiencies and one would agree with that. One point that the honourabie member made perhaps went a little astray. The Federal Airports Corporation Amendment Bill is about enhancing the accountability of the board of the F AC and also about allowing greater flexibility from current Government controls as to the commerciality of the activities of the board .. I heard the honourable member say that there would be greater limitations on borrowings. In fact, the Bill will do the opposite, which is one of the reasons we support it. It will inject a greater sense of commerciality and give greater flexibility to the FAC board to respond more positively to market movements in its op will be allowed to purchase shares and establish subsidiaries and partnerships. The Bill will remove the day-today controls exercised by the Government, including controls over the terms and conditions of individual borrowings. We support the Bill because we think that is a positive step. The reason I criticise the Government is that I think the Bill is only a half-way house. In 1986, when I spoke about the Bill when it was first introduced in this chamber, I quoted Mr Henry Bosch, who was the Chairman of the Independent Inquiry into Aviation Cost Recovery. It is a quote I make again because it is a point well worth making, and draws upon the broader point I want to make in these brief remarks. He said: . . . there is a clear danger that trading statutory authorities will not necessarily attempt to minimise costs or refrain from over-provision of facilities and services. While we welcomed and wanted at that stage to refer the legislation to a Senate committee, that was the danger we saw then and that is still the danger. There is no doubt that the F AC has improved and the Government is moving further down the path to recognising that it must have greatercommerciality. But there is still always that danger, and that is where the principles of privatisation come into play. The word 'privatisation' has unfortunate connotations for some people. Privatisation is not an ideology; it is an economic necessity. Over 60 countries in the world have adopted privatisation in one form or another. Primarily, privatisation is about removing activities from Public Service areas and putting them into the marketplace and subjecting them to the disciplines of the market. That is why many countries, such as Kenya, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom, have adopted路 those processes. They have done so because privatisation is all about optimisation of opportunities. That is what the honourable member for Fadden spoke about when he talked about Manchester Airport-optimisation of opportunities. That can be best achieved if the activity, whatever it might be, is subject to competition. We believe that though the FAC has got better it stIll has to go a lot further. That is why the Federal Airports Corporation and the international domestic airports are listed in our policy on privatisation, which was issued before the last election, as areas that in government we would have proceeded more quickly to privatise and offer to the marketplace. All sorts of complicated mechanisms would have to be gone through to do that, and one recognises that, but we are talking about the principles. Where has the Government got to in addressing these issues? We heard some rhetoric, with which many of us would agree; there must be greater efficiency and greater opportunities for the marketplace to operate, but the rhetoric does not necessarily match the action. The changes today go only half-way. Subjecting these government operations to corporate structures is, in a sense, moving down .the corporatisation path, but at the last moment the Government is squibbing it and not going the whole hog. Interestingly, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in March said with respect to privatisation that it was a subject that was on the agenda and that the Government had put it on the agenda. Where is it now? Not a week or two after the election, the Minister路 for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), stood up and said that privatisation was no longer on the agenda. The newspaper headline, 'Dawkins kills off privatisation' explains it. In that article he was reported as saying;路 'Our group is far from being convinced that the sale of government assets is now justifiable.' Senator Walsh has been pointing out the very grave difficulties the country's economy faces under the present Administration. I suggest that in taking the Government away from the path that in March it was to proceed on, the Minister made a precipitate decision. The point I have been making in my press releases is that the Government has closed off options. The economy is under great pressure, yet the Government has closed off an option that has been embraced by governments of varying ideological positions right around the world to address economic necessities. When we look carefully at the annual report of the Federal Airports Corporation-I am sure the Minister has looked at it-we can see from the graph that many airports are operating at great profits; some are not. Some areas .must be investigated more carefully. Quite obviously, there are airports that could be subjected to privatisation; Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are the classics and Coolangatta would not be far behind. We must take the decisions to allow the market to supply the equity and the capital, rather than taxpayers, because the funds that are going into profit-making operations are taxpayers' funds. If those funds can be attracted from the broader market-employees ought to be able to have shares in these organisations and corporations-those funds could be released for other areas, or used, in the event of sale, to retire debt. All of us know of the profound difficulties that the country faces. because of the racing Government debt. Privatisation is a means that has been adopted by other countries-it will be adopted by the Opposition when we have the first opportunity to do so-to retire debt. That would be a far better way to deal with our budgetary problems because, if we are optimising opportunities in privatisation, we must do so in our overall management of the economy. We must optimise taxpayers' funds for the benefit of those taxpayers. If the Federal Airports Corporation can operate at a profit under government control, there is no reason why it cannot operate at a profit under independent control outside government. That is why I think that privatisation is so important in this area. First and foremost I wanted to indicate the broad principle that the Opposition is strongly of the view-and I believe many in the FAC are of the view-that corporatisation is to be welcomed, but it is only a half-way house. We are only half-way there; as an economic necessity we must go further, and to do otherwise is an economic folly. Other countries have shown the way and it is a sadness, when many people in the Government recognise the economic perils we face, that the Government is closing off options. The Prime Minister will not give his views on privatisation. It seems to me that the new Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) is likewise floundering and not indicating clearly what is happening or what should happen, when he knows that economically it is an absolute necessity. The Department of Finance has already made achievements in the assets sales branch-nearly $2 billion of sales-and there is great scope for that to be expanded. We certainly would want to do that. Unless we recognise that Australia's continuing poor economic performance, which is revealed regularly, must be addressed in a multitude of ways, we will not get any major turnaround in our economy. Sometimes in this place one sees an indication of where a government is going. I think that the FAC situation would have been one where the Government could have been bold and could have gone much faster, but it has chosen not to do that. has been slow. This Bill was first mooted in 1988 when some of the changes were ing proposed, but it got to the Parliament only in 1990. If that is to be the speed of micro-economic reform of the Governhave had an election. ment, woe betide Australians. It will be more and higher taxes and more of the same. Standards of living will not imjecting. prove; they will continue to go down. Unless the Government embraces innovative approaches to government finances and management of government activities and gets out of some of the areas in which is currently involved by adopting policies such as privatisation, contracting out, expanding assets sales, each and every of us, regardless of our ideological posiChinese tion, will be the poorer.",42

In the light of these comments, how can he justify very severely limiting debate on 34 detailed and complex Bills, including the wool tax Bills, to only two days? Is it because the Government is in such disarray that it cannot handle Parliament?

47,Mr ELLIOTT,CHINESE STUDENTS,"I direct my question to the Minister for Employment, Education it and Training. I preface the question by reminding the House that there have been and media reports in recent times of demonone strations in Shanghai and Beijing by students who claim they have not received refunds of fees which were due to them as a consequence of their applito study in Australia being unsuccessful under the new, tighter guidelines. ask the Minister: Can he advise the House of the steps which the Government a has taken to ensure that refunds which are payable to unsuccessful student applicants from overseas are being repaid?",44
48,Mr DAWKINS,CHINESE STUDENTS,"I thank the honourable member for his question. He is quite right in saying that there have been some difficulties in relation to the overseas student program, particularly as it relates to students from China. The Government's concern in this matter is at least threefold. Firstly, there is the question of the safety and the welfare of Australian officials and their families who are on duty and resident in China. It is true that in some cases Australian officials have been subjected to some harassment on the part of those students demonstrating around the question of whether or not they will receive their refunds for fees which have been paid to institutions in Australia but i- respect of which they have received no VIsas. Secondly, we want to see the continued growth and development of the export of education services. We have seen a very impressive development in this industry in recent times. The Government is committed to this program and wants to see it flourish in future. But most importantly, we do not want to see this program in any way compromise the integrity of the immigration program, which is a fundamental and different and separate issue. It is true that some of the institutions have, in my opinion, been exploiting this scheme and promoting it improperly. Because of that the Government has introduced tighter guidelines in terms of the selection of students from a number of countries, including China. My colleagues the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I have been meeting on this matter together and with officials from other departments and with the industry. I am pleased to say that we have now been able to secure an agreement with the industry about the way in which these problems and concerns can be dealt with in the future. What is of paramount importance to us is that we ensure that the industry acts quickly to ensure that refunds are paid to those students who are entitled to them. We also insisted that a rather foolish resolution adopted by the ELICOS Association of New South Wales is rescinded so that there is no impediment to members of that Association paying those refunds. The Government, for its part, has agreed to introduce some additional flexibility in relation to the visas. My colleague the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has agreed to the introduction as soon as possible of a new visa category, particularly in relation to students coming from some particular countries which will not have attached to them working rights as other student visas do; As well as that, we have agreed to withdraw the $130 visa processing charge for applicants from countries with very low overstay rates. There are some other matters which have been the subject of a public announcement by me and my colleagues yesterday. I think we are now satisfied on the basis of the agreement we have reached with the industry that we can overcome the concerns of the Government, the concerns of the industry and the concerns of the overseas students. We hope that in this way we can secure a future for this industry. NA",45

Given that it has now been revealed that the basis for the Treasurer's attack .on the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce was wrongthere are no car waiting lists and Cabinet unanimously supported the revisions to the car plan in 1988-why did the Prime Minister admonish the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce rather than the Treasurer?",45
50,Mr HAWKE,HAWKE MINISTRY,"I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he concentrate on his side of the House in terms of the relations between his shadow Ministers in the Liberal Party and in the National Party.

As honourable members would know, this gift follows some six years of negotiations between this Government and the British Government. As you know, Mr Speaker, release to Australia required specific legislation in the British Parliament. The Bill passed all stages of the House of Commons on 3 March this year. I expect that formal transfer of the Act will take place later this year when my good friend the B1,'itish Deputy Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Howe, visits this country. During our recent meeting at Gallipoli I of course took the opportunity t6 thank the British Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, personally for her assistance. I also take this opportunity to express the thanks of the Government and, I believe, of the House for the special efforts by Mr Alf Morris, who is the Chairman of the ANZAC group of parliamentarians in the House of Commons.

62,Mr HAWKE,CONSTITUTION,"Opposition members were expert in drawing up policies, but there was this yawning gap between policies and achievement. I cannot think of any area in the government of this country where they did not have a policy which, on reading it, one might say made some sense, but there is a lot of difference between having policies in the miserable little booklets and having the guts and imagination to stand up in this Parliament and translate policies into achievements. Members opposite have never done it. I am quite prepared to accept that it was the policy of the honourable member for Menzies to get the document back. The honourable member for Menzies and the Liberal-National Party Government had the policy but could not achieve it. The difference is that we had the policy and we achieved it. That is the distinction between us and them on just about every area of achievement that one could talk about in this country. The document has been on loan to this country since the Bicentenary. It is on display here in Parliament House. There is a question about where its final resting place will be. If the Government decides to establish a museum of political history in the old Parliament House, it would probably be appropriate there, although there is a view-and I think it has been recommended by the Presiding Officersthat the document should be kept on display here in Parliament .House. Whatever is the decision, we will ensure that it will be on display so that this signally important document in the history of our country will be available for sighting by members of the Australian public.

66,Mr SPEAKER,BUTTON CAR PLAN,Order! There is too ranted. much noise in the House.,47
67,Mr KEATING,BUTTON CAR PLAN,"What we should be gard seeing now are efficiencies in the motor vehicle industry which, over time, should reduce the price of vehicles. The fact of the matter is that, under the former coalition Government, the effective rate of protection in the passenger motor vehicle industry was 250 per cent. This was the situation when the Government came to office. Those opposite ought to hang their heads in shame at these numbers: 250 per cent, down to 104 per cent this year, heading to 86 percent in 1992-and they will go lower when the Government decides upon the passenger motor vehicle plan for the following period.路 So it has been only the Government that has been to deal with high rates of proteca tion and to get those rates of protection The fact of the matter is, as I said the other day, that the only ferment of disfor change in this country occurs has in the Cabinet of the Government of the Commonwealth and not in the shadow Cabinet of the Opposition. This is still of the. case. And if one wanted any more pathetic demonstration of the fact that there is no structure.in economic thought or discipline on the Opposition side, one merely had to be here for the shadow Treasurer's matter of public importance NA",47
68,Mrs DARLING,NATURAL THERAPIES,"I direct my question to the Minister for Aged, Family and of a Health Services. Has his attention been drawn to the article in today's Brisbane Courier-Mail regarding natural therapies? and If so, can he advise the House whether the Government is concerned about the of natural therapies and their pro",47
69,Mr STAPLES,NATURAL THERAPIES,"I thank the honourable member for Lilley for her question and The the House should note her great concern for the consumers of Queensland, whether it be in her role as the coordinator of price watch or on issues of health such as this. Her concern in this regard is warIt is worth noting that the major consideration of the Government with reto herbal products which have a long history of safe use in the marketplace is their quality rather than simply their safety and efficacy. The Government is very keen to ensure that the raw materials used in their manufacture are good materials and that the goods dispensed to individuals are of a quality that will enable those goods to do the job they are intended to do. The Government makes no distinction between natural therapies as such, as they are practised, and other therapeutic goods when it comes to expecting safety, quality and justification for claims. Certainly the Government does not intend-because it does not have the power-to enter into any form of accreditation for natural therapists, as has been claimed by some. The Government does not regulate that area at all. But some quite incredible claims have been made nonetheless. I could draw attention to one that was made on a radio station in Queensland yesterday,when a caller said that even the local minister who says 'Jesus Christ will heal you' will not be allowed to say that under this Act. That is taking the issue a little bit too The least I could say about that is that we are talking about natural therapies, not supernatural therapies. The point is that obviously a lot of people would have difficulty getting to read a piece of legislation or any regulations that are attached to it, and that then allows for a fair degree of misinterpretation and misunderstanding. We would hope that such misunderstandings and misinterpretation could be cleared up. The problem that the Government faces and that the consumer faces, as has been highlighted by the honourable member for Lilley, is that there are many products which, without regulation, are allowed to be produced for human consumption and usage, particularly therapeutic goods. These do not attract the same sorts of expected and reasonable controls that one would expect if one went out and bought a pie or a hamburger. If one went out and bought a pie or a hamburger, one would expect-because health departments look after these things in the States-that the product was produced in a safe and clean environment, that there was some regulation and control over the quality of the ingredients that were going into it, and that it was then heated or dispensed in a proper manner. There are no real controls for many therapeutic goods available in Australia. The problem is that we do need, for the protection of consumers, to get that level of control over many of the products that are used or for which therapeutic claims are made in Australia. I suppose what the Government is seeking to achieve, therefore, is a system of protection for the consumer. Health is a very precious asset to any individual, and we must ensure that any substance that is taken that makes any particular claim or is for any therapeutic use contains what it says it contains, that it is of reproducible quality, that the ingredients ate safe to use, and that it does what it claims it will do. I have not been asked the question yet and I have not seen it raised anywhere; but probably the only one that has not been raised so far is in relation to far. Kentucky Fried Chicken. I can assure Colonel Sanders that his secret combination of 11 herbs and spices will not come under this Act. ENVIRONMENT: IMMIGRATION",47

72,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,NATURAL THERAPIES,"Can the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories inform the House whether environmental criteria were used by the Government in deciding on the current level of immigration and how they influenced the outcome? Can the Minister also indicate, on environmental grounds, what Australia's target population should be?",48
73,Mrs KELLY,NATURAL THERAPIES,"The issue of sustainable development is a key issue that this Government is going to address. The process we are going through is that there has been a Cabinet subcommittee formed where we are developing this whole concept of ecological sustainable development. It is then going to look at particular sectors and at what is essential to maintain growth in our economy and at the same time to keep the balance with protection of the environment. On the issue of immigration, as the environment Minister I obviously have an important role to ensure that we get the balance right between development and protection of the environment. I have a personal view, and this is not a view that we have actually discussed in the Cabinet room, that the issue in question is not how many people we have in this country but how we manage the resources we currently have. So on this question of sustainable development and the immigration debate, my colleague the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is doing some studies in relation to that. I will be working closely with him on it. The issue this Government is addressing is how to keep the balance right. The Government is very committed to preserving our environment but at the same time we are conscious of the need for development. That is a very important balance and it is one we will continue to be committed to. NA",48
74,Mr GEAR,CONSUMPTION TAX,Is the Treasurer aware of tually proposals to introduce a consumption tax with only partial compensation? What are the Government's intentions in this ter?,49
75,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"I was interested to read children. in this morning's newspapers a proposition attributed to Access Economics and the Institute of Chartered Accountants that a consumption tax should be introercise. duced without maintaining people's real disposable incomes. In other words, it is with it. another variation on the theme presented by路 a few of these organisations in the few days that we do not need to compenposition sate people for the increased cost of ture consumption, that all we need to is to compensate them for present consumption, and that there is no need to protect the real value of current savings. It is an extraordinary statement when the very genesis pf the consumption tax in the minds of these groups is to improve national savings while at the same time they know that the economics and the arithmetic of the switch to a consumption tax cannot produce tax cuts if in fact there are compensations which protect future savings, that is, which compensate now for savings which protect future consumption. So we have this extraordinary statement that whatever one saves is certain to be eroded by higher prices coming from the consumption tax, but路 if one spends more one will get a bigger income tax cut. Of course, if that were the case, people would actually save less. Some groups float the proposition that they should actually get an income tax credit for the consumption tax that they actually paid in the course of the year. If that is the case, what is the point of having a consumption tax? Apparently, this has not occurred to them. When one looks at all of these propositions floated by the various groupssuch as Access Economics and the Institute of Chartered Accountants-they demonstrate that the proponents of the consumption tax have no intention of compensating people adequately to protect their Ii ving standards.路 In fact, the Victorian Employers Federation is acsaying that it wants cuts in what it calls effective spending capacity for single people on average earnings, a sole parent matwith one child-again on average earnings-and a single income family with no It actually wants to cut the effective spending of these nominated groups by the value of a consumption tax. In other words, it is a totally fraudulent exIt wants a consumption tax without the necessary compensations that go Does the House remember that yesterlast day I talked about the Leader of the Opbeginning the wimp-out? It was fuon again last night when he addressed the do National Farmers Federation. He dropped a couple of little pearls in his speech which I draw to everyone's attention: Now that we've got a situation where we are prepared to put that taxthat is, the consumption taxback on the agenda for consideration, there is the danger that some groups are going to rush way ahead of the debate. Dreadful! He continued: If we were to go down the consumption tax routenotice the word 'were'it would be a difficult political exercise have to be sold very well and very carefully if we were to get the j9b done. The Leader of the Opposition continued: Now, in saying that, I would have to express some disappointment at how little recognition there has been on occasions for the strides we have made as an Opposition in the policy area. He believes that the Opposition is not fully appreciated out there. The point. that the Prime Minister made more eloquently earlier, in reply to the honourable member for Menzies, was that the Opposition never wants to implement its policies when it is in office. The Leader of the Opposition now wants brownie points for looking at something hard-something that he actually does not want to do but which he embraced on day one of becoming Leader. We are all supposed to say, 'Here is the big ideas man, he has embraced this new tax. He does not want to implement it but he is embracing it, anyway'. What we get are these sorts of backsliding comments day in, day out. The really hard people in the debate-all of these groups that want to cut down ordinary people and rip away at their incomes-are really about having a consumption tax which is not compensated. John Stone said the other day, 'Why muck around? If that is what you want to do, if you want to belt the poor to help the rich, why go through the ruse of a consumption tax? Just knock off the tax-free threshold'. Mr Chaney-You have got a Labor Treasurer to do it for you.",49
76,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"Is that right, Fred? They are always such scintillating interjections.",50
77,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMPTION TAX,Order! The Treasurer should not respond to the interjections.,50
78,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"As it was his first, I . thought I would give him a bit of a reception, but it was pretty dull, I must say. Basically, the Liberal Party is up to its old game, that is, hurt the low income people and help the wealthy. As Stone said, it can do it by knocking off the tax-free threshold and use the money to cut the high tax rates. As I pointed out yesterday, as if the highest profit share in the country's history is not enough, as if a and would wage share lower than in 1961 is not enough, and as if a 39 per cent corporate rate with full dividend relief is not enough, the Opposition now wants to get at the poor again, to give people on higher incomes a bigger tax cut. That is what it is really on abollt. NA",50
79,Mrs BAILEY,WHOLESALE SALES TAX SYSTEM,I ask the Treasurer why he taxes random breath testing machines at 20 per cent under the wholesale sales tax system while pornographic magazines are exempt. I also ask w.hy orange juice attracts a wholesale sales tax rate of 10 per cent while caviar is exempt.,50
80,Mr KEATING,WHOLESALE SALES TAX SYSTEM,"We happen to have a tax on beverages in this country at a single rate, that is 10 per cent. Any government, if it wished, could have a one rate wholesale sales tax. We could average the 30 per cent, 20 per cent and 10 per cent rates. The 20 per cent rate covers the great bulk of goods and the average rate would be about 18 per cent. Apparently, the Liberal Party is advocating that the tax on fruit juice goes from 10 per cent to 18 per cent. Opposition members are arguing that they do not want differentiation in the tax. The honourable member's first question in the House is advocating an increase in beverage taxation. That is consistent with the Leader of the Opposition, who started his day as the Leader of the Opposition by advocating a new tax base in the tax system, a consumption tax. I know that the Opposition is tax happy. That is why we have had to cut its-that is the rate of the Leader of the Opposition-60 per cent rate to 47 per cent and its 30 per cent rate to 21 per cent. Basically that is the job the Opposition has left us to do. There are differential rates. Mr Tim Fischer-Caviar is exempt.",50
81,Mr KEATING,WHOLESALE SALES TAX SYSTEM,"It is a foodstuff and foodstuffs are not taxed. Beverages are taxed. The point about the literature has no logic whatsoever. Literature is not taxed and therefore, the equation with the breathalyser is an illogical, cheap appeal-a bit of contorted logic-that the honourable member for MCEwen thinks will bring some benefit to her question. I make the point again that the wholesale sales tax system was in place for the 30-odd years that the Opposition was in office. If the Opposition did not like it, why did it not get rid of it? Why did not the honourable member for Bennelong, geed along by his adviser the now Leader of the Opposition, get the ball under the arm and run through the Cabinet Room with the consumption tax in 1978 or 1979? As I have said in this House on plenty of occasions, the reason is that they could not get a piece of tissue paper through the Cabinet, much less a submission. That is why we were stuck with this rickety wholesale sales tax system. I would be very interested to hear the Leader of the Opposition's view about this. As an Opposition member has asked the question-and as not a lot of people were jumping up, the honourable member was slotted into the Question Time list so it has the official imprimatur-this has obviously come past the Leader of the Opposition's office. If it has come past the Leader of the Opposition's office, let him tell us whether he is advocating a flat rate wholesale sales tax. Does he want the 10 per cent rate lifted to 18 per cent? That is an option. If he wants the tax on food and some products such as beverages, biscuits and certain categories of confectionery lifted to 18 per cent, let him say so. If he does not, the best thing to do is to shut up. PARLIAMENT HOUSE: NA",51
82,Mr JOHNS,CITIZENSHIP VISITS PROGRAM,"Could the Minister for Employment, Education and Training advise the House of the number of students who have received or who are likely to receive assistance to visit Parliament House under the citizenship visits program and of the future of the program after 1990?",51
83,Mr DAWKINS,CITIZENSHIP VISITS PROGRAM,"I can report that the citizenship visits program has been ex traordinarily successful, even more successful than we thought when we introduced this pilot program last year. The reason the program was introduced was that for those of us who live outside New South Wales and Victoria, we noticed that there was a very important program of school visits to Parliament House where groups of young people came here to observe and, no doubt, be edified by our activities and to learn something more abo-t the democratic process generally, parttcularly as a result of the education programs which have been put into place in the Parliament House. Those of us from outside of Victoria and New South Wales would have noticed that hardly any school groups came to Parliament House from Western Australia, Queensland, the Northern Territory, South Australia, Tasmania and so on. It seemed to me that it was important to introduce an element of access for children from more outlying, far flung parts of Australia. For that reason we introduced the citizenship visits program which provides a subsidy from $50 to $200 on a graduated. scale for those school groups which have to travel in excess of 1,000 kilometres to visit Parliament House in Canberra. There has been an enormous upsurge in school groups coming from those areas. Already 1,000 secondary school students have visited and there will be another 3,800 visiting Parliament House in the next six months. I contrast that with last year when only 14 school groups came to Parliament House from those areas outside Victoria and New South Wales. For example, we will see in the near future a group from Exmouth in Western Australia, one from Biloela, one from Tully, one from Rockingham-even, Prime Minister, one from Perth Modern School-and the Minister for Transport and Communications might be interested Questions without Notice to know that there will be one from lywood High School, his old school, as well. Indeed, even today there is a group from Hilder Road state school in Queenscompensate land-and this group has benefited from this subsidy program. I want to say that because of the specthrough tacular success of this pilot program has been necessary for me to institute review to see how the program should proceed next year, and in order to underand take that review I will be consulting the Serjeant-at-Arms who has been exlater. tremely helpful in the administration of this program, with you, Mr Speaker, and consumption. the other Presiding Officer, and the chairpersons of the relevant parliamentary committees that have an interest in can say that the rules which have been applying now will continue for the rest of this year so long as those groups notify the Serjeant-at-Arms prior to 31 July of their intention to visit the Parliament during 1990. I think this has been an important program to encourage a greater understand the ing of the workings of the Parliament, workings of our democratic system genEconomics, erally, and I hope that we will be able announce. by about September of this the results of the review and the guideuncompensated lines which will operate in 1991 and yond.

84,Mr REITH,CONSUMPTION TAX,"Mr Speaker, my question without notice is to the Treasurer, refer him to his National Press Club appearance last week when he asserted that if a broad-based consumption tax were introduced there would be a need to comnotice pensate income tax payers, not only for the additional cost of consumption but also for the loss of earning power on their savings. Is it not a fact that the Treasurins er's proposition conceptually involves relation to savings the payment of comfarm pensation in advance of actual consumpstock tion, and has he not thereby deliberately inflated the consumption figures which presented last week?",52

That is what he is on about. What he is saying is, 'We'll you later'. In other words, his proposition is not to allow people compensation for their living standards the consumption tax; not to allow it a tax break on their current savings for a their future consumption. He says to pick it up when they consume in the future then give them a tax cut later. That with is the proposition: give them a tax cut Mr Reith-A tax cut to match their",52

He has a line from Access which basically, on this issue, to is in the right wing camp, and that is to year whack the low income earners with an consumption tax, and all beincome earners who have the discretion to save or to consume. The honourable member wishes to cut back the benefits of their saving and say to them, 'If you actually consume we will give you a tax cut'. and I Why then would you get any savings? NA",52
89,Mr OKEEFE,CHEMICAL DISCHARGE,My question without is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and concerns the discharge of dioxins and furans in Victoria. Is the Minister aware of reports that dioxwere released into the environment in recently near the government sewerage at Werribee in Victoria? Were liveand pastures contaminated as a result of the alleged dioxin release? Is he he aware of steps that have been taken to counter this problem?,52
90,Mr KERIN,CHEMICAL DISCHARGE,"I thank the honourable and I member for his question. The chemical the manufacturer Nufarm Ltd at Laverton North, which makes, among other prodIs ucts, 2,4-D was claimed by Greenpeace be discharging dioxins and polychlorito nated dibenzofurans in the efiluent water from its plant on 1 May. The levels deceived tected by Greenpeace were in terms of parts per quadrillion, that is, one-milhe lionth of a part per billion. The United States standards referred to were for drinking water and not efiluent. This basically a State matter that my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the vironment, Tourism and Territories is terested in as well, of course. It is not Commonwealth matter but it is important for the general public to know what plans governments have in mind for these kinds of events. There is regular testing, and tests last year at this plant showed nothing at all levels of parts per billion. The Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works in Vicnegotiating toria immediately voluntarily suspended sales of stock from the sewerage farm til full testing could be completed, and Ministers. few sales are held at this time of the year in any case. The chemicals involved are unlikely to contain dioxins but may contain some unreacted or partially reacted phenols. The responsible authority is the Victorian vironmental ProtectiOn Authority, which has taken samples of efiluent and has quested that Nufarm commission an incommercial dependent risk assessment on its premises including soil, ground water, waste water, air discharges and materials manufacdistribution; tured. Nufarm has also ceased manufacketing turing the product until the question resolved. The chemicals involved are not agricultural路 chemicals, and do not fall within the jurisdiction of the State Dechising partment of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.

91,Mr MCLACHLAN,INDUSTRY COMMISSION,My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his answer in Question Time yesterday when he listed 18 inquiries from the very bitious program which he gave the IndusHealth. try Commission some nine months ago. it not a fact that to date only seven of to these references have actually been sent the Commission? I ask the Treasurer: Why has the number of references rea year by the Industry Commission from the responsible Minister halved since took control of the Commission?,53
92,Mr KEATING,INDUSTRY COMMISSION,"I do not know how the honourable member reached that concluis sion. This is the most ambitious program of inquiry that any government has ever Enpresided over for economy-wide referinences. In fact, it is the only program of a inquiry for economy-wide references. This is for a set of inquiries to be carried out over a couple of years. It is a two-year work program. It means that the inquiries will be dealt with over the course of that period, that is, seriatim. As we look at at each particular inquiry and, particularly, as it impacts on the States, we have been with some of the State authorities concerned and also looking at terms unof reference between Commonwealth Let me record for the House the current state of play in relation to inquiries.

95,Mr HOWE,AIDS,"It is nice to have your support, Tim. I might just say by way of preface that. we had a first m-eting .in Parliament Just before QuestlOn TIme of the parliamentary liaison group on AIDS. I would like to thank the parties for promptly appointing their representatives and for a quite constructive meeting. With reference to the honourable member's question, there is concern in a number of Pacific and Asian countries about the . spread of AIDS, HIV virus, particularly as a by-product 路of tourism, IV drug use and the lack of secure blood supplies. The World Health Organisation's global program on AIDS, to which Australia is a contributor, has been responsible for financing most AIDS-related initiatives in our immediate region. In addition, the Government is providing direct funding of $1m a year to South East Asian, Western Pacific and Indian Ocean nations for AIDS-related study grants and .assistance programs. The Department also agreed to cosponsor with the World Health Organisation an important international conference on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific. The objective is to bring together leading policy-makers and health workers concerned with controlling and managing the AIDS pandemic from every country covered by WHO South Asian and Western Pacific officers. I am pleased to advise the Parliament that arrangements have now been finalised for this very important conference to be held here in Canberra from 5 to 8 August. My Department anticipates an attendance of some 500 delegates representing government, community and religious agencies. The Director-General of WHO, Dr Nakajima, has indicated that. he will. be attending. Arrangements have also been finalised for many eminent speakers, including key personnel from the global program on AIDS in Geneva. The two regional directors of WHO from Delhi and Manila and Cardinal Sin, the Roman Catholic Archbishop from Manila, are expected to attend the conference. Australia has had an extremely impressive record in dealing with the issue of AIDS. It is one that the Government has given and will continue to give very high priority. We hope that it will continue to this have the bipartisanship in the Parliament that was certainly characteristic of the last Parliament. We have demonstrated our leadership at least in one respect by having so many delegates and countries visiting Australia for this important WHO conference where Australian delegates, no doubt, will playa very significant role.

Would you a-sist the House by approaching the Prime Minister to bring forward that visit to the e.arliest possible opportunity so that a fact-finding delegation of this Parliament can go to those newly emerging democracies?",54
97,Mr SPEAKER,EASTERN EUROPE,The answer to the honourable member's question is that the allocation of outgoing delegations is a matter for the President and me. There is a delegation visiting parts of eastern Europe next year. There is also a delegation visiting parts of eastern Europe this year.

102,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to implement reform of Australia's transport infrastructure, leading to a weaker economy, lost jobs and lower iT1comes. I call upon those members who approve the proposed discussion to rise in their More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",56
103,Mr SHARP,TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE,"During the run up to the last election there were a number of very clearly defined policy differences between the Australian Labor Party and the coalition, none more so than in the areas of industrial relations and micro-economic reform. The coalition had developed policies in industrial relations which were designed to take Australia's industrial relations scene out of the nineteenth century into the twentyfirst century. The coalition parties had developed policies in the area of microeconomic reform which were designed to meet the challenges of the 1990s.路 Of course, the policies that the coalition had during the election campaign in these two vital areas highlighted some serious weakness on behalf of the Government. Aus- As a consequence of that, it has led to a considerable amount of concern on the government benches. Only in the last few days we have seen the Treasurer (Mr Keating) criticise his Cabinet colleagues for the lack and slow pace of reform. We have seen Senator Walsh, the former Minister for Finance, criticise his Government colleagues for the slow pace of reform that has been occurring over the last seven and a bit years of this Labor Government. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has also recognised the difficulties that this Government has been having with microeconomic reform. As a consequence, he gave notice to his new Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) that he wanted to see micro-economic reform elevated to the highest political priorities. We were going to have a plethora of legislation which would bring reform in the areas to the Parliament and indeed deliver significant changes and benefits to the economy. Of course, the Prime Minister has been boasting around the traps that he has put two of his really big guns, two of his 300 pounders-that is Senator Collins and the Minister for Transport and Communications-in charge of handling these vital reforms in the transport sector. Over the last few weeks these fellows have路 been. talking a lot about the need for reform. Indeed, Senator Collins has been very generous to offer his resignation in 12 months time if he cannot implement reform on our waterfront to a significant degree. I take the opportunity to remind the House that the days are ticking by and that my office is keeping a calendar watch on the days. In 12 months time we will take a great deal of delight in reminding Senator Collins that it is time that he offered his resignation. In the last seven years that this Government has been in power we have heard a lot of rhetoric about' micro-economic reform. In August 1987 the Prime Minister made a statement in a speech at Surfers Paradise. He said that one of the major items on the agenda of this term of government is a sweeping reform of the nation's transport infrastructure. Three years later that sweeping reform of our transport infrastructure has delivered very little indeed. We have become quite used to rhetoric-all talk and no action-from this Government. The Opposition raises this matter of public importance today to highlight the fact that the Labor Government has done nothing at all to implement reform on our waterfront, our coastal shipping industries and our land transport systems. It is with that purpose today that I speak particularly on waterfront reform and coastal shipping reform. When one looks at the waterfront one realises how bad that situation is and how great is the need for reform. The waterfront in Australia is so inefficient that it is costing each and every Australian thousands of millions of dollars a year in lost potential income. According to the Inter-State Commission report, which was tabled last April in this place, Australia's waterfront is only 50 per cent as productive as the average European waterfront and only 40 percent as productive as the average Asian waterfront-waterfronts and trading nations that Australia has to trade and compete with in the world marketplace. Yet ours are so inefficient that they cannot reach a halfway level of productivity corp.pared to the European waterfronts. . Reform on our waterfront and amongst our coastal shipping industry is vital. It was highlighted in a paper produced by the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) some little time ago that reform on the waterfront can produce cost savings of about $860m a year. It has also highlighted that reforms on our!路 waterfront and in other transport sectors路 can produce savings to Australia of about $3,240m. These inefficiencies in our transport infrastructure, our waterfront, our shipping industries, and so forth, are costing, according to that EPAC paper, the average Australian household about $720 dollars a year. Thos- cost savings are significant reasons for change on our waterfront. In the past few days we have seen the Government's new Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins)even though he has put his job on the line in 12 months time-already starting to try and wriggle away from the commitment that the Prime Minister was making a month or so ago towards reform in these vital areas. Last Saturday, Senator Collins was interviewed by Alan Ramsey in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald. In that article Senator Collins was . trying to argue exactly why reform on the waterfn;mt would not really solve Australia's economic problems. He used a somewhat lower figure than the EPAC figure for cost savings of $650m. He said: . . . $6S0m savings on our waterfront each year is not going to solve Australia's economic problems. Unfortunately, Senator Collins neglected路 to take into account the downstream economic advantages that will flow to other sectors of our economy as a consequence of making our. waterfront - nd coastal shipping industnes more efficIent. For example, in the EPAC paper one finds that the downstream effects to the rest of the economy total some $6,100of extra potential income that. AustralIa can earn each and every year If we c.an reforms these sectors of our transport Infrastructure. The waterfront accounts for $2 562m of that $6,1 OOm. So, more than $2' 500m in extra income can be earnt by A-stralia if we can reform our waterfront. . Yet last Saturday Senator Collins tried to dov.:ngrade the significance of reform on our waterfront. . It would be. interesting for the average worker to find out that reform on the waterfront would generate extra income for the average worker of about 3 per cent of a wage, in real terms. A 3 per cent wage increase in real terms would be g-n颅 erated if we could reform the AustralIan waterfront. That would represent an extra $842 that the average Australian worker could enjoy having in his pocket at the end of each year. Not only that, but an extra 17,000 jobs would be created, according to this EPAC paper, through reforms on our waterfront and in relation to other sectors of the transport infrastructure. These are all significant benefits that would accrue to the Australian economy if these reforms were to take place on our waterfront. Reform is critical. It can deliver huge benefits, provide huge economic gains to the average worker and to individual industries. What do we see on the part of the Labor Government, a government that claims to represent the average Australian worker? Over the past seven years or so we have. seen the Lab.or Government trying to wnggle out of SIgnificant reform on our waterfront. After 51f2 years of investigation we saw a report produced by the Inter-State Comn:tissio.n last year, which was tabled here In thIS House. It recommended reforms on the waterfront and amongst our coastal shipping industries. The Government made a response to that on 1 June last year in this House and that response dodged the very difficult recommendations that were made by the Inter-State Commission-difficult recommendations not because they could not be achieved by a government with determination but difficult recommendations because ' this Government is linked and associated with, and depends upon, the favouritism of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the union movement across Australia. The reforms that were recommended by the Inter-State Commission attacked the very power base of the nation's trade union movement and one of the most historic elements of that trade union movement, the Waterside Workers Federation. So the Government has been backing away by dodging some of the key recommendations made by the Inter-State Commission for reform on our waterfront. So where are we at this stage? We have had the response from the forme- M.inister for Transport and CommUnICatIOns, the present Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), on 1 June last year. We have seen the Government establish a thing called the Waterfront Industry - e颅 form Authority (WIRA). That AuthorIty was told by the former Minister for Transport and Communications, 'Go out there and implement our reforms on the waterfront and do not worry about what it costs', and the Government has given the WIRA group a $300m budget to help pay off retiring waterside workers. Half of that $300m will be paid by the taxpayer, the other half by the various employers on the waterfront and ultimately, of course, by consumers - of goods here in Australia. For the average waterside worker that means a lot of extra money if he wants to retire now. This retirement package will give a fellow who has been 25 years on the waterfront and who is 55 years of age an extra five years wages on top of his normal retirement benefits. So it is a very generous deal that this Government is offering at the expense of the taxpayers and the r-st of Australia, in order to try to implement the very modest reforms that the Government has given WIRA to implement. Let us compare the sorts of reforms that this Government has asked WIRA to implement with reforms going on on waterfronts in other countries. Senator Collins has stated that the Government's program is designed to increase efficiency on our waterfront by 30 per cent over the next three years-lO per cent per annum on average. The British Government introduced there in April of last year reforms on the waterfront which in the first 12 months delivered a 65 per cent increase in efficiency on the waterfront. Last year the New Zealand Labour Government introduced reforms on its waterfront which in the first 12 months of operation have delivered a 100 per cent increase in efficiency on the waterfront in that country. Yet here in Australia our big, brave, bold Government is talking about efficiency increases of 30 per cent spread over three years, at great cost to the taxpayers. So really the reforms being proposed by this Government are quite puny. Whilst all this slow action is going on in reform on the waterfront, the rorts and the inefficiencies and the bad work practices continue. Honourable members will be interested to know that the Inter-State Commission found that in many cases waterside workers had a work week of only 20 productive hours, but were paid for considerably more than that. There are situations in which the employer has to have two derrick crane drivers operating the machine at the one time. There are only three levers on the crane and there is only one seat. Yet it requires two people to drive it. These examples of inefficiencies and bad work practices on our waterfront still exist today. Currently in the port of Cairns the John Burke stevedoring group has gone broke in recent times. The company has gone out of business. But what happened? The employees are still maintained in the port through the pool levy system and now the extra employees who have no extra work to do find that their average work week is 7.9 hours. They are being paid for a 35hour week and the man-hour costs in the port of Cairns have gone from $38 per hour to $100 per hour. As a consequence of that, one of the major industries that operates out of the port of Cairns, that does $70m worth of trade, is now proposing to move its activities out of Cairns to Singapore. So Australia is going to lose that sort of income, simply because of the inefficiencies of the Waterside Workers Federation in our ports and the lack of courage of this Government. There are many examples that one can give in a debate like this which highlight the deficiencies on our waterfront, which highlight the fact that these inefficiencies are costing each Australian hundreds of dollars a year-billions of dollars a year for the total economy. We need to do a number of things to our waterfront. We need, first, a government that has the commitment to micro-economic reform, and I seriously doubt whether this Government has got it. If the Government has got it, the first thing it has to do is to introduce true enterprise agreements on the waterfront; that is, give the employers of waterfront labour the right to hire and fire the people that they believe are necessary for the job at hand. They must have the ability to have compulsory redundancy provisions and compulsory stand-down provisions. The Government must be prepared to scrap the monopoly of the Waterside Workers Federation that exists on the ports of Australia. It must be prepared to introduce voluntary unionism and to urge privatisation at our ports throughout the country. In the coastal shipping industry, it must be prepared to scrap cabotage. We must scrap this ridiculous situation of the transTasman shipping route which leaves Australian manufacturers shipping goods to New Zealand finding that it is cheaper to ship them via Hong Kong and Japan on international freight lines than on Australian shipping lines. We have to.scrap that arrangement as well. If we are to have these micro-economic reforms introduced into Australia, we need a government of courage and conviction. The coalition parties are the only parties here in this Parliament who have got the industrial relations policy and the microeconomic reform policies to implement those changes to bring the benefits to the average Australian.",56
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE,Mr Ronald Edwards}-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,60
105,Mr ROBERT BROWN,TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE,"This is one great joke. The wording of this matter of public importance states: The Government's failure to implement of Australia's transport infrastructure, leading a weaker economy, lost jobs and lower incomes. Let us look at what the results of this alleged deficiency on the part of the ernment are asserted to be. First of all, weaker economy: a weaker economy. than what? Is it weaker than the one路 we inherby ited in 1983, when for the first time in years we had negative growth in Ausenue tralia? Is the Opposition talking about this economy now, where we have to gear back on the rate and pace and dimensions of growth? Is it a weaker economy than the one we inherited in 1983 and for which the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) and his colleagues were responsi1983 ble? Is that what they are talking about? Are they talking about lost jobs when predecessors. we have had growth of 1.6 million jobs during the period of this Government? Perhaps they are comparing that achieveWe ment with what we inherited in 1983. remind everyone that in 1983, when we came into government, we had in Alls33 tralia 750,000 people officially unemus ployed, that is 10.4 per cent of the labour force. In the last year alone of the Fraser Government we had 250,000 additional people who were thrown on the uneming ployment scrap heap because of the incapacity of that Government to address the serious problems that Australia was facing then and which it had faced for greater part of the time when the coalition government was in office. Opposition members also referred to lower incomes being associated with this alleged reluctance or incapacity on the part of the present Government to underbeen take significant reform in the area transport. Again I remind honourable members that when we came into governcould ment in 1983 the situation was that comes then were low for ordinary Australian households. Why were they low? Let me give two reasons: first of all, the Opposition and its predecessors crushed the growth out of this economy and sent it into a very serious recession. As a result there was less production, less gross domestic product, less income and less purchasing capacity to be spread around those families. The second reason reform why those families had lower incomes to when we came into office in 1983-and honourable members opposite should not ever forget it-was that the then GovernGovment refused absolutely to do anything a about those areas of taxation evasion and taxation avoidance which were estimated academics at that time to be costing 30 the public purse in Federal taxation revabout $7 billion every year. Those opposite were protecting all those rip-off merchants who were responsible then as a result of that beh-viour for imposing an additional tax burden of something like $40 a week. What did the total come to? All of those households in Australia in were worse off by $90 a week as a result of the present Opposition and its The honourable member for Gilmore talked about a lack of reform in transport. have now been in government for a I little over seven years. Those opposite were in government for 30 of the previous years. Watch the reaction-they hate referring to the fact that they were in government for 30 of the 33 years before 1983. And what a hell of a mess we inherited! We have had a responsibility durthe seyen or eight years that we have been in government so far to do something to turn the economy around. We have introduced those reforms to which the the honourable member for Gilmore referred. The best part of his speech was when he complimented us. That was good content. If he had stripped away all of the rhetoric and left the substance, which was when he complimented us, it would have one of his most magnificent contriof butions to debate in this chamber. The worse parts of his speech, the parts that not be substantiated, were when he inattempted to suggest that there had not been reform by this Government. It is most reforming Government in the histwo tory of the Commonwealth. What did we have to reform? I agree with the honourable member for Gilmore that in our first year, in our first term, did not give a great deal of emphasis to the question of transport reform. The honourable member is right in that rethat gard. The reason is that the first thing had to do was to give attention to whole question of macro-economic reovervalued form to get this economy moving again after those opposite had crushed it. We introduced macro-economic, expansionvious ary policies at that time in order to get moving again, to stop people being thrown on the unemployment scrap heap, to get production moving and introduce greater competitiveness, flexibility, adaptability and efficiency into the Australian producin office. tive capacity. That is what we set about doing. That was our first priority. If the honourable member says that our first priority was not transport reform, he dead right. What about all of those kids out thereconfirm one kid in every four or 24 per cent young people-who were unemployed as form a result of the previous Government's policies? We did not give priority at that time to transport. We had decent prioriufacturing, ties in place. We got those kids back into the work force or staying on at school. We got people back into employment. We have created 1.6 million additional jobs over the relatively short period that have been in office. Yet those opposite come in here with this sort of nonsense, suggesting that the Government has failed government. to implement reform. As I say, it is the most reforming Government in the histhose tory of this Commonwealth. Having implemented macro-economic reform, what did we then have to do? had to look at the whole structure of tralian secondary industry to make sure that it was capable of meeting today's demands because those opposite had kept us in the Dark Ages. Black Jack MCEwen established a featherbedded situation that industries showed no initiative were not competitive. During the IS-year period before we came into government, the as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, million extra jobs had been created in Australia. Do honourable members know how many were ill the manufacturing area? Not one. When those opposite we were in office during that period not one job was created in that area. In fact, when employment grew by two million during IS-year period, the level of employwe ment in the manufacturing area actually the fell. The previous Government had an dollar as its only device to try to deal with the question of inflation. As a result of that overvalued dollar, the preGovernment allowed manufactured it goods from the rest of the world to pour into this country and smash our manufacturing capacity. I repeat: The previous Government created not one new job in the manufacturing area in its last 15 years Those opposite are not fair dinkum when they t'l-lk about reform. One of their front bench members knows all about and is understands this matter. His background in economics is such as to require him to my observations. In the first place of we had to deal with macro-economic reand, as a result of that situation that we inherited in manufacturing, we had to set about creating a restructuring of manto make sure that we could compete, to make sure that we could give Australians jobs, to make sure that we could open up the horizons and opportunities f<;lr ordinary Australians, for kids we when they left school so that there was hope for them, unlike the situation that prevailed when those opposite were in We then went into the whole area of sector industry reforms. We looked at steel. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that when we came into government We in 1983 Australia, among all the develAusoped countries in the Western world, was on the verge of losing its primary steel making capacity. The Australian steel industry should have closed. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), the so man who became Prime Minister, gave and an undertaking before that election in 1983. He said, 'If we come into government, within 100 days we will put into place a pla- that will maint,!-in the Au-t.ra颅 lian steel mdustry, make It competItIve and make sure that it is retained'. We did it. We have a steel industry in Australiaa competitive steel industry, a growing steel industry. But it was not as a result of that appalling behaviour, that incapacity-we were talking about it earlier today-to develop policies. Even when the then Government had policies, it did not have the courage the capacity to put them into operation. today. The Opposition now comes in talking about reform. We had reform in the steel industry. We maintained a steel making capacity. We had it in textiles, clothing and footwear. We had it in motor vehihas cles. We had it in heavy engineering. had it in shipbuilding. We had it in the coal industry. We had to restructure mess that the Opposition had been sponsible for and we restructured it. Improvements are still necessary in those industries. But those industries are in place as they were never in place beis fore, as a result of the reform of this Government. There were a whole host of those particular types of problems, people well recognise, that confronted this Government in its attempt to address difficulties that existed in the Australian economy generally. We said it was clear at that time that the economy we inherited was inefficient. It was distorted. It non-competitive. It had to be turned around. If Australia was to regain that position in the world league that we previously held, there was a responsibility on the Government. We'came into office in 1983 because millions of electors had had a gut full what had preceded us. They said then that enough was enough. Indeed, enough was enough. That is why we were elected. The electors gave us a second term. They said, 'That mob is having a go and they have a bit of capacity and they have a bit of initiative and they are prepared to get off their bums and do something about it'. The electors gave us a third go. Then the electors said that was in their interests-as it was. That wise judgment. Mr Sharp- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to the content of the Minister's address and I refer to the point of relevance. I draw your attention to standing order 145. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to take into account what is being said by the Minister. The matter of public importance is about transport. So far we have heard about everything else but transport. I just wonder when the Minister will get around or to the subject that is before the House",60
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE,"There is no point of order. I have been listening to the debate and it been, what I would call, a fairly wide We ranging and robust debate so far.",62
107,Mr ROBERT BROWN,TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE,"You are right, that Mr Deputy Speaker, robust indeed. Let reme get on t6 some of the questions on transport. The matter of public importance refers to a government failure to implement reforms in Australia's transport infrastructure. We might well ask why reform in Australia's transport infrastructure necessary when, as I said before, the Opposition was in office for 30 of the as previous 33 years. The honourable member for Gilmore believes that things are the bad now that we have got to this stage during the term of this Hawke Government, now that we have progressed all of those other areas of reform. But he knows, was because he is aware of those inquiries, that we are now arming ourselves with all the information that we need in the areas had for which I am primarily responsiblethat is, road and rail. When it became necessary for us to start looking towards the sorts of, reforms we could introduce I of said, 'Where is the information available to provide us with a significant databank upon which we can base sensible judgrement?'. There was nil,. zilch. The essential point about this is that the matter of public importance is dealing with the question of reform. It specifically relates to the question of reform in transport. We have been responsible for the most coherent, the most sensible, the most it efficient type of national road funding was program. This is reform! We have accepted full responsibility for the national highway system which stretches for 16,000 kilometres right around Australia. During the period of this Government we have increased the level of. funding over the term of the previous Governernment ment by 20 per cent in real terms. That represents an additional $250 million every year, and that is in addition to what the State and lqcal authorities are putting into the road system. So we have enorsomething mous road network development investinaction. ment projects taking place. The national highway system is the biggest civil engineering project ever undertaken Australia. '",62
108,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE,Order! The Minister's time has expired.,63
109,Mr HAWKER,TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE,"1 supbecause port very enthusiastically what my colThey league the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) has said and twice much having heard the weak, pathetic sponse of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown). I think his response was an insult to this Parliament, and insult to the people who have come today able. to hear a reasonable debate. What they have seen from this Minister would not even be fit for a high school debate. His feigned indignations are about the only thing that he can stand up and show. He spends most of the time just harking back to the past because he cannot think of what he can say about what the Governernment ment is doing or what it has done in its last seven years. He talks about the problems facing families. He did not mention the' high interest rates which are obviously crushhave ing families right throughout Australia they are also crushing small business. are all engineered by this Government. The Minister's excuse for inaction was weakest that I have ever heard. For twelve and a half minutes he talked about thing and everything apart from the ter of public importance. This is an important matter; it is something that the Parliament and Australians are concerried about. Yet this Minister seemed to show total disregard for it and paid lip service to what is a very impornumber tant issue facing Australians. In the last two and a half minutes of his speech he talked about Government reports; that was the only fact he could bring up. The Govalready has reports but they are not enough. He is going to have some more just to reinforce the earlier reports, and he feels that by having reports somehow or other he can be seen to be doing when really it is nothing but As my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore put it so well, all the in Government has done when it comes to reform of Australia's transport infrastrucis utter rhetoric, and that is what we have been getting today. This is a serious issue which should be raised in the Parliament for the interests of all Australians, Australians are very concerned. have very strong reasons to be concerned. As my colleague the honourable as member for Gilmore has already pointed reout, in the area of the waterfront huge reforms needed to be carried out. The Government has run out of excuses, and an to date its performance has been lamentIn fact, when we look at the land transport area for which I am responsible for the Opposition, there is a gigantic ,opportunity for reform, and yet all we are seeing is a gigantic chasm between the rhetoric of reform that is coming out of the Govand what is actually being delivered. We want results; we are sick of the rhetoric. The Minister's colleague Senator Walsh and, to a lesser extent, Senator Button, shown their disgust and their dissatand isfaction at the pace of change of this They Government. The Minister's own colleagues have pointed out the importance the of a bit of action or, as Senator Walsh has put it so bluntly, it is 'time to put a anybit of spine into the Government'. We matwant to see some performance to match this rhetoric. Clearly the rumblings of dissatisfaction on the performance in micro-economic reform have emanated from not only Senator Walsh and Senator Button but also a of different bodies which are all widely regarded and which are all independent and eminent institutions in the Australian community. I refer, of course, to reports from the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC), the Inter-State Commission, the Business Council of Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry, various State employer organisations, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Professor Garnaut - nd, of course, the Macquarie Bank. All of these. reports make it very clear that micro-economic reform, particularly in the land transport area, is long overdue. What is more, they outline in detail the way that some of these reforms could be made. Yet the Government continues, as it has done today in this debate, to come in here and give nothing but rhetoric as an excuse for inaction. Despite this pressure for change, the Government to date has done so little that it is very hard to find any reasonable measure of what it has done in any of these critical areas. I felt before the debate started that the response of the Minister would be completely predictable. What happened is exactly what I predicted as I prepared my notes: he would go on and on about the past as' an excuse for doing nothing about the present and working towards doing something constructive with the future. The Minister has got to realise that the past is a long time ago. This Government has been in power now for seven years, and what has it done? We have been waiting for seven years and the Minister came out with excuse after excuse. After seven years I think the Australian public is running out of patience. What greater admission of failure could there be than when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), after seven years of being in government, felt it was necessary to announce a 10-point plan for micro-economic reforrri? After seven years he felt he had to do that. What more obvious example of an excuse for inaction is there than that? We have seen virtually no initiative in the arp.a of land transport. All we have seen, as the Minister loves to keep saying, are reports. While we are talking about micro-economic reform, rather than using the general overall picture and figures, we might try to quantify some of these figures into what they mean to ordinary Australians and their families. We came across some very large figures when looking at a joint report put out by the lAC and the Busihess Council recently on the scope for increasing efficiency. The report mentioned that in the area of rail transport increased efficiency would lead to an output increase of at least $2.41 billion-and I am glad to see that the Minister is nodding because he agrees with that figure. In the road transport area it mentioned $1.7 billion and in the bulk commodity handling area another $2 billion. That is well in excess of $6 billion. Those are big sums. If we work that back to what that means on a per capita basis for the average family, we find that the average household would increase its income by over $1,100. . If that is added to the figures that the honourable member for Gilmore put forward for reform on the waterfront-he suggested that Economic Planning Advisory Council figures have shown that there would be another $720 available for every Australian family if there was reform there-the figure is nearly $2,000. That is a lot of money. We talk about living standards and we talk about what could be done to help Australian families. I suggest to this Goven1ment that this is a very important area where micro-economic reform can help Australian families. Nearly $2,000 today would mean a lot to many families. If those are the sorts of savings that are available, the question must surely be: Why has it taken seven years for the Government to produce just another report? The sorts of things that could be done have been mentioned in all these reports. We found that there is gross overmanning. I am not going into examples today because of the limited time and, as my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore showed in his area, they are too numerous to mention. The same is true of land transport, of the state of our railways and of the work practices in so many of these related areas. Then we look at tpe regulatory controls, which the Minister is well aware of, and the road funding system. The Minister tried to make much of the fact that he has changed the legislation. The fact is that anyone who drives around on Australian roads today knows that, once one gets away from the highways, the roads are vastly inferior to what they were when this Government came into power. Everyone knows it. If honourable members drive aroupd anywhere in the coup try they will see roads disintegrating before their eyes. So much for the Government's record in that area .. I turn to the announcement which the Minister made the other day when he put the Inter-State Commission report before the House. He tried, in a five-page speech, to talk about the reforms that the Government has actually made and he brought it down to three things. He talked about an examination of the road industry. There has been an examination. Seven years is a long time. The Government can do a pretty good examination in that time, but what has it produced from it? He talked about road funding, yet we still see our roads deteriorating. He talked about changes to Australian National railways. As I pointed out then, the only change was to reintroduce legislation which the Fraser Government had already introduced into Parliament but which, unfortunately, had lapsed. That is the sum total of the reform over seven years. It is indeed a very sad state of affairs. It is something that Australian families are paying for very dearly-as I have said, nearly $2,000 a year. The longer the Government goes on delaying, the longer families have got to pay unnecessarily for all these inefficiencies that are hurting pepple so much. The time has come to stop the rhetoric and start some action. Mr KERR. (Denison) (3.31)-A very cruel member from this side of the House, speaking of Menzies, said that his brilliant military career was tragically cut short by the onset of war. Listening to the Opposition speakers in this debate, one would have to think that the spectacular policy pats on the back that they give each other are matched only by their incapacity to reveal any instance in which they were able to demonstrate activity in the area of reform at a time when they had the reins of government. As the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, has said, when we came to office our number one priority was to get the macro-economic ciimate for investment and the restructuring of our economy on the right track. We permitted the existing shoddy transport arrangements to remain largely undisturbed. Those arrangements are now the subject of what has been, the most critical examination ever made of transport communications and infrastructure in this country and the most ambitious program of reform that has ever come before the Australian Parliament. The programs that we are now engaged upon-the Minister at the table is part of a team looking at these areas-are programs which we are called upon to look at riot simply because' of what I suppose we might say emotionally has been the neglect of the last 30 years but almost further than that because we have institutionalised the problems of discordant systems between different States. Rail, for example, is the most obvious area. There are different gauges between different States. There has not been a coordination because we were not truly a nation until recently. We have not had the coordination between road, rail, shipping and the like. Even the transport of goods between different States is governed by different road regulations. We have different licensing systems, different speed limits. We still govern this large country as if it were a collection of tiny fiefdoms where economic efficiency is not the priority but rather preserving the dominance of domains which were those previously appropriate to State government. Those are hard questions for us to pick up and deal with but it is hardly fair in terms of any critical approach to the history of this issue to say that it is due to sev-n years of Labor neglect. On the contrary, this Government is for the first time grappling with issues which were entrenched and institutionalised and which have been problems in terms of efficiency for the last 60 or 100 years in this country.For those on the other side to come before us and say that this Government has been slow in terms of a response is simply a kneejerk and rhetorically based response. It is most unfortunate that the priorities indicated by the Opposition in this debate are really so ideologically driven. We have had a motion before us seeking to censure the Government for its failure to act in the area of transport. But what have we heard? Almost all the debate has been about waterfront reform. Waterfront reform is important, but the Industries Assistance Commission says as to where efficiencies can be gained that a substantially greater impact in efficiencies can be obtained by reform in the area of road transport than can ever be the case through reform of waterfront arrangements. The ideological thrust of this debate seems to be because in the area of the waterfront the Liberal Party and the National Party come up against their bete noir-the trade union movement. They seem to believe that reform is meaningless unless it is associated with the sounds of the cracking of heads, preferably union heads. This Government, on the other hand, has been committed for the entire period of its office to processes of reform, bringing together the parties that are actually engaged on the ground in terms of the issues that matter. That means bringing together employers and employees through their unions in a process of consultation and negotiation so that reform is possible, not in an atmosphere of confrontation, which is likely to backfire in terms of efficiency gains, but rather in terms of a process which draws all parties towards an agreed set of outcomes. We can see the success of that through the accord process. The Treasurer (Mr Keating), in response to questions today, indicated that because of the agreement of the trade union movement in areas such as award restructuring and a restraint on the overall level of wage rises in this country we have been able to generate massive increases of employment1.6 million new jobs. That kind of reform has been delivered. It is not reform that is being talked about. Award restructuring is going through the hard, agonising and grinding process of implementation day by day. This is a government that has got on with those jobs to the advantage of the Australian people. Let us consider the areas where this Government has taken action, such as the waterfront. We have an agreement for the reform of the stevedoring and international container depot employment arrangements, ratified in October 1989. That process will lead to the establishment of enterprise-based employment, the rationalisation of stevedoring industry awards, rejuvenation of the work force and substantial labour force reductions. What do we hear on the other side of the House? We hear that there are not enough screams of pain from employees. We have heard in the debate criticism of retirement and retrenchment packages and interjections claiming that this was a rip-off. It is not a rip-off to ensure that those retrenched from an industry are given an appropriate package of retirement measures for retrenchment so that the industry can be restructured. It is necessary. If, people believe that one can proceed indifferent to the interests of the employees and of industry, if one thinks that is the way to go, then that industry is likely to suffer morale loss and industrial dislocation of a scale which would deprive the exercise of any efficiency gains at all. If we are serious about efficiency gains, we will gain them through constructive, cooperative arrangements and by drawing together the entire community of interests affected as far as possible. There will obviously be cases where aspects of that process will not be capable of consensus. The Government may have to make decisions unilaterally, but to the extent that it is possible to draw together the parties we should do so. It is a tragedy that this debate is so dominated on the Opposition side by what seems to be a clear ideological preference for the politics of confrontation of the trade union movement. On the area of transport more generally, however, we have heard not a word on aviation policy. We have heard nothing of the changes that have occurred in international aviation policy, which has dramatically changed the framework of operations. We have heard nothing of international air freight charter policy, which has lifted the restrictions on the types of cargo which can be carried and the gateways which can be served. We have heard nothing about the abolition by this Government 路of the two-airlines agreement. We have heard nothing about the aerodrome local ownership plan. We have heard nothing about maritime transport. We have heard nothing about the reductions in crewing sizes that are being negotiated with maritime transport. We have heard a diatribe, obviously based on a narrow framework of ideological constructs, which seems to be designed to create some impression in those who might be listening that there are still some adverse practices in the waterfront industry. It is a search for the trees rather than the forests. We have an Opposition that cannot see the wood for the trees. Those opposite are stuck there staring around saying, 'Look, we have a few problems on the waterfront'-problems which are in fact being addressed-'but are not looking at the massive reform program that this Government has already put in place in relation to a whole series of areas designed to make sure that our transport infrastructure is developed in a way which leads to the massive productivity gains that everybody who is influential and who understands this issue accepts and agrees are available if the exercise can be constructed successfully'. We are about successful, cooperative, determined action in this area.",63

111,Mr TAYLOR,QUEENSLAND,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the first report of the Committee for' 1990 relating to the redevelopment of the Army Aviation Centre at Oakey, Queensland. Ordered that the report be printed.",67
112,Mr TAYLOR,QUEENSLAND,"by leave-I thank the Committee Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), for this opportunity to present the report not only as Committee Vice-Chairman but also as the local member of the area under report. On 22 November last year this House referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report the proposal for the next stage of redevelopment of the Army Aviation Centre at Oakey in Queensland. Oakey Army Airfield is located adjacent to the township of Oakey on the Darling Downs, 33 kilometres west of Toowoomba. The airfield is owned by the Commonwealth and, except for the civil terminal and its access road, is controlled by the Army. It occupies an area of approximately 220 hectares. There has been incremental enhancement of the airfield's facilities since it was first occupied by the Army in 1969. Aircraft movements have doubled in the last 12 years. By 1995 the working population on the base will increase to nearly 900. By 1992 Oakey based aircraft numbers are planned to be 22 Kiowa helicopters, 24 Nomad fixed wing aircraft and six Black Hawk helicopters. The Black Hawks are relocating from Townsville later this year when training facilities are completed. Development to accommodate units has tended to be on an ad hoc basis and some are currently occupying temporary accommodation and facilities constructed between 1969 and the early 1970s, a number straddling a taxiway and, as a result, inhibiting aircraft movements. Furthermore, serious occupational health and safety deficiencies exist. In the main, this is due to working areas being located too close to the areas used by aircraft and their high noise levels. In 1971 it was decided that 1 Aviation Regiment's temporary facilities would be retain-d until the early 1980s and that a major development plan would then be required. Permanent facilities were completed in 1972 for the School of Army Aviation, 5 Base Workshop Battalion, headquarters for the Army Aviation Centre and the base support unit. Additional temporary facilities were constructed in 1972 to alleviate the shortage of working accommodation. Accommodation for 1 Aviation Regiment Workshop and 173 General Support Squadron Workshop was constructed in 1980. There has been no other significant construction of facilities for 1 Aviation Regiment and 173 General Support Squadron at Oakey since the erection of these temporary buildings, which are still occupied. The scope of this latest work comprises the construction of permanent facilities for 1 Aviation regiment and 173 General Support Squadron; the extension of the existing hangar and technical facilities used by 1 Aviation Regiment Workshop; the extension and refurbishment of 5 Base Workshop Battalion aircraft maintenance facilities; and the relocation of the police guard dog section. At present, Jondaryan Shire Council provides the water supply for Oakey township while the Army provides its own water. A recent application to this Government for a local government路 grant to carry out a feasibility study into the augmentation of the town and base water supplies was refused. Council has stressed the importance of above ground storage for water harvesting and its belief that mutual cooperation with the Army and the surrounding community would result in water harvesting schemes and water treatment works to the benefit of the Army and the local community. The Committee agrees that a need exists to overcome serious occupational health and safety deficiencies at the Army Aviation Centre at Oakey. It also recognises the need to replace the 1972 temporary buildings with facilities meeting current scales and standards of accommodation. The Committee believes that a local government grant should be made available to the Jondaryan Shire Council to enable it to carry out a feasibility study into the augmentation of the town and base water supplies. The Committee is satisfied that the proposal will overcome the more serious occupational health and safety problems at the Army Aviation Base. Finally, the Committee recommends the redevelopment of the Army Aviation Centre at an estimated cost of $14.6m at September 1989 prices. With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to conclude by reiterating the sentiments expressed by the Committee Chairman, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) in this place yesterday. Those who set out to bypass the specific legislative responsibilities of this Committee do so at their parliamentary peril. As a consequence, we will be monitoring very carefully progress on the Expo 92 pavilion in Seville, Spain, which was debated in this place yesterday. The longest serving investigative committee of the Parliament, which our Committee is, was never a rubber stamp and will not be in this Thirty-sixth Parliament. NA NA Reports . Mr HOLLIS (Throsby)-On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the second, third, fourth and fifth reports of the Committee for 1990 relating to housing developments by the Defence Housing Authority at Laverton and Macleod, Victoria, and Bullsbrook, Western Australia; Puckapunyal redevelopment stage 1, Victoria; multiuser Army Reserve Depot at Oakleigh, Victoria; and construction of Commonwealth Law Courts, Brisbane. Ordered that the reports be printed.",67
113,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS,"by leave-The reports I have just tabled and the report relating to the redevelopment of the Army Aviation Centre at Oakey, Queensland, tabled by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who is the Vice-Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, relate to projects originally referred to the twenty-ninth Committee at the end of the previous Parliament. As the Committee was unable to complete its investigations before the House of Representatives was dissolved on 19 February 1990, the current Committee has now completed the inquiries. The Committee is pleased to see continuing progress being made in the upgrading of defence facilities. This relates particularly to the Oakey and Puckapunyal projects. The Committee also notes with satisfaction the continuing progress being made by the Defence Housing Authority to improve the stock of housing available to service personnel. In relation to the Brisbane Law Courts proposal, the Committee has recommended that the Attorney-General's Department should undertake a thorough review of space allocation within the proposed Commonwealth Law Courts building with the objective of providing permanently for the needs of the Commonwealth Reporting Service. While the Committee has concluded that the site chosen for the proposed Commonwealth Law Courts in Brisbane is suitable, it has recommended that the Attorney-General's Department should review the need for courts to be established in legal precincts with particular emphasis on the costs involved and also the convenience of the public, staff, the judiciary and the legal profession. Finally, the Committee has recommended that, during the detailed design stage, comprehensive consultation be undertaken by the Attorney-General's Department with the judiciary, staff and associations, the legal profession and interested Commonwealth, State and local government bodies. I thank both the Government and Opposition Whips-the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), who are both former members of the Public Works Committee. Perhaps there is a line of promotion from the Public Works Committee to Whip. We have not managed to get a Minister up yet, but we have got the two Whips up. I thank both those gentlemen for their assistance in ensuring that the Committee could be formed in sufficient time to enable it to report to Parliament on these projects. I also thank the members of the Committee in the previous Parliament for their dedication to the work of the Committee during an extremely busy period. I refer particularly to former Vice-Chairman, Mr Clarrie Millar, whose dedication to the work of the Committee has become somewhat legendary. NA THURSDAY, 17 MAY 1990",68

115,Mr FIFE,ROUTINE OF BUSINESS FOR,"As I indicated to the House yesterday, what the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) proposes in his motion has been negotiated between him and me. The Opposition agrees with what is proposed. I take the opportunity, however, to point out that what is proposed is an orderly arrangement for what is commonly referred to as private members' day, and we are appreciative of that. Our complaint is that there is insufficient time for private members to take part in debate in this House and to ask questions. I place on record again our protest that the sittings of this House are being truncated to a point where, in 1990, the Australian Parliament, and certainly the House of Representatives, will sit for fewer days than any other Parliament has done for the past 50 years. That is deplorable. The Opposition certainly supports what the Minister has put before the House today.

116,Mr FIFE,BUDGET SPEECH AND REPLY,The Opposition warmly supports the motion moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). At this point I would ask the Leader of the House whether the Government-as distinct from the House Committee-is giving consideration to televising at least some of the proceedings of Parliament on a regular basis.,70

NA (TERMINATION) BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Beazley, and read a first time. Second Reading",71
118,Mr BEAZLEY,AIRLINES AGREEMENT,"Swan-Minister for Transport and Communications) (3.59)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. There is no need to remind honourable members that since taking office the Hawke Government has embarked on an unprecedented program of reform and development in the aviation sector. Both the aviation industry and the community at large stand to benefit greatly from the changes involved. The decisions taken to date have been substantial and have been an integral part of the Government's agenda of micro-economic reform both in the private and public sectors. Faced with an industry hamstrung by 38 years of detailed economic regulation of interstate aviation, the Government's first reform priority was to put in place new arrangements designed to promote increased competition and pricing flexibility which would lead to greater economic efficiency in the industry and benefits to the consumer. Consequently, the Government decided in October 1987 to give the required three years notice of termination of the twoairlines agreement and move in 1990 to a deregulated domestic aviation system. The Bill currently before the House gives effect路 to this decision. The Bill brings to an end the two airlines policy, and opens Australia's interstate air services to free competition. On enactment of the Bill, the following legislation will be repealed: the Airlines Agreement Act 1981; the Airlines Equipment Act 1958; and the Independent Air Fares Committee Act 1981. In addition, action has been taken to repeal Customs (prohibited imports) Regulation 4N, which currently controls the the import of aircraft into Australia. The net effect of these actions will be that the Commonwealth will withdraw from the detailed economic regulation of the domestic airline industry. First, the current controls over the importation of aircraft will be removed. These controls have provided the threshold underpinning of the legislative and contractual arrangements which currently regulate the industry. Secondly, the de- tailed determination of passenger capacity that may be provided by each trunk airline will cease. Thirdly, the existing constraints on the entry of new domestic operators to trunk routes will be removed. Finally, the Independent Air Fares Committee (IAFC) will be abolished and the Commonwealth will withdraw from the determination of air fares. The Government is, however, determined to ensure that Australia's high safety record is maintained. It will also路 continue to maintain the highest level of aviation security and ensure that the aviation system is similarly geared to national environmental priorities. What the Government expects is a general improvement, over time, in the competitive environment, with the airlines free to develop their own commercial initiatives which should flow through to the advantage of consumers. The benefits which can reasonably be expected to result from the increased opportunities for competition in a deregulated environment include: greater incentives for路 existing and new participants to develop the industry in ways which are more efficient and responsive to consumer needs; a wider range of fares, in particular, arid increased availability discount fares; growth, particularly in the price sensitive leisure market; . and a greater variety in the types, standards and frequency of services provided, and use of more appropriate aircraft on some routes. Following deregulation, the domestic aviation market will be required to operate within the constraints of established competition policy controls applicable to industry generally. Interstate be made subject to surveillance by the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA). The discipline that competition will apply to the industry should ensure that the PSA's influence will, in practice, be limited to cases-likely to be isolated-involving abuse of market power. The Australian aviation industry will also be fully exposed to the Trade Practices Act and its anti-competitive and consumer protection provisions. A central issue concerning competition will be the ability of new entrants to gain access to appropriate terminal facilities at airports. A decision be made within the next few days on the priorities to be assigned to individual operators for access to facilities located in Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines existing terminals. The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has acknowledged that it has a major role to facilitate operations by its customer airlines, existing or new. It welcomes additional business and will do its utmost to accommodate it in a responsible, commercial manner. There will be a need to ensure that adequate information is available in a deregulated environment. In order to encourage a more competitive environment governments, airlines, tourism bodies and consumers will need timely and relevant information on the aviation industry. My Department is currently reviewing the information needs of a range of users in the deregulated environment to determine the most appropriate form, timing and distribution of information, along with appropriate cost recovery measures. The Government acknowledges that access to foreign capital could make an import ant contribution to the Government's of aim to open up the industry to competition. From October 1990, foreign investment will be welcomed, subject to the normal Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines, including investment by foreign carriers which do not operate to Australia. The only exclusion in current policy is unlimited investment in domestic airlines by foreign international carriers operating services to Australia. In such cases, the investment limit is 15 per cent in any air fares will one domestic airline. The second major challenge facing the Government was to replace the outdated administrative arrangements so that the aviation facilities and infrastructure essential for a deregulated environment would be provided efficiently. Accordingly, the Government took the significant decision to reform these areas by separating them from the bureaucracy. This was achieved through the establishment of the Federal Airports Corporation, with responsibility for major airports, and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), responwill sible for safety standards and day to day regulatory control of air service operations. These new organisations, free from the constraints of the Government's annual budget cycles, provide the basis for a more efficient delivery of facilities and services.  Its primary function is to plan, develop and operate Australia's major airports. This has meant that, for the first time, Australia's airports have been placed on a truly commercial footing, with proper emphasis on their operating and commercial performance. Adequate forward planning of airport facilities has been conspicuously absent in the past, and accounts in large measure for the problems of congestion and overcrowding at some of our major airports. Nowhere is this reflected more acutely than in the capacity constraints of Sydney's Kingsford-Smith Airport. Previous governments had put the question of a second Sydney airport in the 'too hard' basket. However, this Government has met this critical issue head on and has taken decisive action to resolve the Sydney airport issue and to position Sydney to meet aviation needs into the next century. Whilst micro-economic reforms in provision of airports and terminals have already achieved visible improvements in the provision of modern and efficient air traffic services are of importance. For this reason, and in recognition of the need for effective safety regulation and enforcement in the deregulated environment, the Government established on 1 July 1988 the Civil Aviation Authority. The Authority is responsible for both safety standard setting as well as day to day regulatory control, and. also has operational responsibility for the provision of aviation services to the industry. The Government was especially concerned when determining the functions of the CAA to ensure that the high levels of safety achieved to date were maintained and enhanced. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) is also maintaining its role to investigate and report on all aircraft accidents and incidents. In addition, the Bureau prepares recommendations for increasing safety in aircraft operations and operates as an independ.ent body responsible directly to the Minister. Through a cooperative effort the Government, the CAA, BASI and industry are committed to maintaining Australia's excellent safety record. Another issue that needed to be addressed by the Government was the implementation . of measures to ensure the competitiveness of Australian Airlines. Following incorporation of the airline in 1988 the new processes, announced as part of the reform package for the Transport and Communications government business enterprises in May 1988, will ensure that the board and management have greater responsibility for the performance of .the airline and are more clearly accountable for results. Day to day controls over the airline's operations have been removed, including the requirements for ministerial approval of contracts and expenditures, terms and conditions of bor. rowing and leasing arrangements, investment of surplus funds and the establishment of subsidiaries. These reforms clearly placed the airline on a more commercial footing and will enable it to compete more effectively in a deregulated environment. However, the Government results, recognises that Australian Airlines requires additional capital and is currently equal addressing a range of funding options which could meet the airline's future capital needs without compromi-ing public ownership and control. A number of recent reports have identified areas of possible policy change, including Qantas Airways Limited carrying domestic passengers, a single aviation market under closer economic relations, pricing of landing slots at Kingsford-Smith Airport and major airports, and the level of foreign investment in domestic airlines. In considering options, however, it is important to emphasise that any change to one facet of policy could have effects on other elements of the industry. There are many linkages and significant implications for existing and prospective players in the domestic and international aviation spheres. The Government will need to examine carefully the potential gains and losses. The financial implications of the proposed deregulation legislation for the Commonwealth are minimal. As mentioned above, the Independent Air Fares Committee will be abolished. In the 198889 financial year the IAFC incurred $611,369 in running costs. The Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority will have an increased oversight role within the aviation industry. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Jull) adjourned.

119,Mr ROBERT BROWN,AUSTRALIAN MARITIME SAFETY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill is to give effect the Government's decision, announced on 28 November 1989, to establish a marimarine time safety authority as a further element in the total restructuring of Australia's shipping and waterfront industries underall taken by the Hawke Labor Government. Australia's future prosperity depends our ability to compete effectively in seas markets, overseas markets which are themselves becoming increasingly coman petitive. Australia's almost total reliance on shipping for trade means that mariwill time regulation and government services to shipping must be efficient, sensible relevant. Broadly speaking, the new Authority will take over the functions currently perthrough formed by the Maritime Operations Ditors. vision of the Department of Transport and Communications. These functions inneeds. clude: the coordination of maritime search and rescue services, in cooperation State and Northern Territory search and rescue authorities, through the Federal Safety Centre; in cooperation with the States and Northern Territory authorities, the administration of the national plan combat pollution from ships; the impleto mentation, application and policing of maritime safety and pollution prevention prosperity. conventions on Australian and visiting foreign ships; the provision of a comprehensive network of navigational aids around Australia's coastline; the provithe sion of safety radio services to shipping through the Overseas Telecommunications tions Commission; the setting of standtions, ards for the education, training and certification of seafarers; the operation the seamen's engagement system, under contract to the Australian shipping indusstances. try; the operation of the Australian Regthe ister of Ships; the promotion of sea safety for small craft through a public education and awareness campaign; and Australian representation at the International Marithe Bill. time Organisation. The Maritime Operations Division function of investigating casualties to will not be transferred to the Authority but is to remain with the Department of Transport and Communications. Like its aviation counterpart, the Bureau of Air to Safety Investigation, it is more appropriate that the conduct of investigations into casualties should be路 separated from the regulatory body. The functions being transferred to the Authority have been effectively performed by the Department, and Australia has an excelon lent record in maritime safety and the overprotection of the marine environment from ship-sourced pollution. Nonetheless, authority which has direct accountability to the maritime. industry it serves be far better placed to provide efficient, cost effective services and to keep and pace with changes in an industry undergoing rapid technological change. Specifically, these benefits will derive from the accountability of the Authority's direction management by a board of direcThis will facilitate the development of corporate goals responsive to industry It will also help ensure the rationalisation of administrative arrangements with associated with safety regulation to achieve greater flexibility, efficiency and Sea control in the use of financial and human resources. For its part, the Government will benefit from the increased efficiency to in the delivery of maritime services both the community at large ami to a sector of transport crucial to Australia's future The legislation now before the House will provide the new Authority with all necessary powers to fulfil its safety, regulatory and community service obligaand to perform commercial funcwhilst ensuring accountability is maintained with appropriate checks and of balances, including powers for the Minister to make directions in certain circumI do not propose to go through Bill clause by clause, as the explanatory memorandum has been distributed to honourable members. I would like, however, to highlight the key features of Clause 6 specifies the functions of the Authority, which I have already outlined. ships In carrying out these functions the Authority can provide, on request, services to the maritime industry on a commercial basis and relevant consultancy and management services. It is the Government's intention that such commercial services should be consistent with the normal functions of the Authority and the expertise of its officers. Clause 8 provides the Minister with powers to give directions to the Authority regarding the performance of its functions. I must emphasise that this power is intended as a reserve power to be used only where the Minister believes it necessary in the public interest. Any such exercise of the Minister's power of direction is required to be included in the annual report, and any financial detriment suffered by the Authority in complying with the Minister's direction is reimbursable by the Commonwealth. A vital part of the Authority's operations, if it is to be fully effective in sponding to the needs of the maritime industry and community at large, will be the consultative process. This is reflected in clause 12, which requires the Authority to consult with government and non-government bodies and organisations where appropriate. As specified in clause 13, the Authority will comprise seven members, including the Chairperson and the Chief Executive Officer. This compositionis consistent with other statutory authorities of a similar size. Selection of persons for the board will reflect government policy to ensure the Authority is directed by persons having the necessary professional expertise and experience across the broad spectrum of government, community, business and industrial issues. One member of the board will be an officer of the Department of Transport and Communications to ensure the Authority is kept in touch with Government objectives and policies. I turn now to the operation of the Authority and associated financial matters. As with other government business enterprises, the Authority will be required to prepare and maintain a corporate plan and associated financial plan covering the three-year forward period. The corporate plan will include a statement of objectives and must outline the intended strategies and policies to achieve those objectives. These provisions, which are contained in clauses 25 to 28 of the Bill, are intended to ensure the Authority operates in a proper business like manner in performing its functions. Under clause 29 the Minister is given powers to direct the Authority tp vary the financial plan in respect of its financial targets and performance indicators. As with the Minister's aforementioned powers to give directions in regard to the performance of the Authority's functions, this ministerial power is not intended to permit interference in the proper commercial operations of the Authority but would be used only in exceptional circumstances where, for instance, the Authority'S financial planning fell short of, or was inconsistent with, the requirements specified in the Bill. Clauses 30 to 45 detail the financial rearrangements necessary to establish the Authority and to ensure it has the financial capability of achieving its objectives. Provisions include the transfer of Commonwealth assets to the Authority, t.\le payment of dividends, borrowing powers and tax provisions. The Authority will be a public authority to which division 2 of part XI of the Audit Act 1901 applies. The powers of the Authority to make determinations in respect of fees and charges is covered by clause 47. I would draw the attention of honourable members to subclause 47 (12) where a provision has been included, as in recent similar Bills, to require the amount of a charge to reasonably relate to the expenses incurred in providing the service and not be such as to amount to taxation. I must underline, however, that it is the Government's intention that expenses incurred should include overheads and a reasonable return on capital. As I indicated earlier, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill will enable the new Authority to pursue its goals of service to the industry and the community free of unnecessary strictures, whilst ensuring full accountability and reporting to Government. An effective, efficient Authority will provide value for money in the community services it provides under contract to the Government. Furthermore, it will, without detriment to its safety and environmental protection functions, introduce a degree of flexibility into its operations and the setting of its priorities to be better in tune with the needs of the industry it serves. The establishment of the Authority is expected to cost $10.9m, which will not be recovered from the industry. The Bill does not have any significant implications for the ongoing cost to the public sector but, to the extent that greater efficiency is achieved, cost can be expected to fall in real terms over time - allow public licensees to broadcast This Bill is an important contribution to the Hawke Labor Government's strategy for structural reform.

120,Mr BEAZLEY,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT,"Swan-Minister for Transport and Communications) (4.17)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill represents the first stage of islation to reform the operation of broadclosely casting regulation. It replaces a similar Bill which was introduced into the House on 1 November but which lapsed when Parliament was dissolved. This Bill and package of efficiency reforms that I pose to introduce later in the current tings represent useful interim measures address some immediate deficiencies in the Broadcasting Act 1942. However, the Government remains fully committed to the wider reform of this Act, and work proceeding well on the main reform packstream age. I expect to announce the results of this later this year. The Bill gives the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal access to more appropriate cable. remedies in cases where a commercial radio or television licensee does not meet the basjc suitability requirements that currently applicable to a licence. It includes amendments to: - confirm that the Minister can initiate, and the Tribunal can hold, joint inquiries into the grant of a licence for a supplementary or an independent commercial FM radio service in a regional area; - allow aspirant public broadcasters to transmit sponsorship announcements when conducting test transmissions; and community promotional material. Before turning to the detailed provisions of the Bill, I will briefly remind honourable members路 of the framework for reform of the Broadcasting Act laid down late last year. We are addressing seven key areas and the scope of the review remains as outlined by my predecessor on 1 November last year. First, future broadcasting legislation must serve the explicit policy aim that no more regulation of industry than is necessary to support stated objectives. The current legislation casts a very wide and complex regulatory net. In seeking to address all aspects of broadcasting it can also extend regulation to nonbroadcasting communications services, and indeed to other commercial activities. legFuture legislation will need to be more targeted. Secondly, we are examining the regulatory needs and implications of new electronic comrimnications services and service delivery methods. a Where new services are different from probroadcasting, they should not be subsitjected to regulation aimed at broadcastto ing. We need a regime that encourages initiative and service development and facilitates the innovative use and development of technology. But, of course, where is any particular service amounts to mainbroadcasting, then we must ensure that it is regulated as such, regardless of whether it is ultimately delivered from radio transmitters, from satellites or by Thirdly, we are examining the need for reform in the broadcasting planning procare esses. We intend to provide a more transalso parent process that also provides for proper commercial and public accountability. We need a framework within which technology, and especially the radiofrequency spectrum, is allocated and used efficiently and equitably. We need to avoid unnecessary second-guessing of commercial decisions or commercial outcomes. Fourthly, we are continuing to examine options for further reform in the area of ownership and control regulation. Fifthly, we are examining reform to the processes of licence allocation, review and renewal in order to enhance efficiency and to streamline processing. We will, of course, retain arrangements for public account ability on the part of broadcasting licensees within this framework. Sixthly, we are examining possible changes to the process for setting the program standards which broadcasters are required to observe. Whatever new arrangements are adopted, the Government will maintain support for Australian content, quality children's programming and observance of community standards. The final area involves the future of Australian Broadcasting Tribunal as the regulatory authority in this area. Its function, powers and structure may require amendment to reflect changes decided on in the overall regulatory regime. It is not, however, intended to abolish the Tribunal. It is important that that body has the appropriate powers, resources and status to do its job efficiently and effectively. In developing options against this agenda the Government's position remains that broadcasting is more than just another industry. Its cultural role means that it has special characteristics which will continue to require government intervention to ensure that undue concentrations of ownership or control do not arise in commercial broadcasting; to ensure that commercial and programming control remains firmly in Australian hands; and to ensure community responsibility on the part of broadcasters through appropriate program standards. The Government's concern does not relate only to ensuring the efficient, equitable and responsible of the radiofrequency spectrum. Increasingly our efforts are directed to the uct or service being delivered to homes or businesses, whatever the method of transmission and delivery-be it terrestrial radiocommunication, satellite or cabk These concerns present special challenges to Government in our efforts to develop a more appropriate, contemporary regulatory regime. The first challenge is to ensure that public interest safeguards are provided with rigour, but in a manner which recognises that, while it has these special requirements, commercial broadcasting is also a business where its participants compete at some considerable risk for commercial returns. It is therefore important that only the minimum regulation needed to meet those objectives is imposed, so as not to unnecessarily inhibit normal commercial development. The second challenge is to ensure that essential regulation of mainstream broadcasting is not unnecessarily applied to new and emerging electronic services. Differthe ences in the nature of services provided by broadcasting, telecommunications and role, publishing have narrowed significantly through their use of common technology and through the development of new and complementary services. Inappropriate regulatory restriction on some electronic entertainment and information services, on educational services and potentially on pay TV, would be likely to significantly constrain their development. This in turn could deny Australian homes and businesses timely access to the technologies and to the entertainment and information services that they have the potential to provide. However, when these services converge to the point where they become de facto mainstream broadcasting, broadcasting regulatory provisions should of course apply. The third challenge is to recognise that, in addition to its special regulatory regime, the broadcasting industry is subject to a wide range of general business regulation. It is therefore important that interuse action between the two regimes avoids conflict and provides, as far as possible, a prod- stable and consistent environment in which the industry can operate efficiently. This Bill and the efficiency package to be introduced later are consistent with the objectives of the wider review. I will deal now with the provisions of the Bill; concentrating first on the ownership and control changes. At present, the Tribunal would be faced with extremely limited options if, after conducting an inquiry that it was required to hold, it were to find that a commercial licensee was no longer fit and proper, or no longer had the cial, technical or management capacity to provide an adequate and comprehensive service. It presently may only impose licence conditions or suspend, revoke or not renew the licence. If the licensee's unsuitability was due to the conduct or character of a person in a position to control the licensee company or its operations licence conditions may not be an effectivremedy. This is because the conditions may not be capable of affecting the influence of the relevant person on the licensee company. The only other remedies available-suspension, revocation or refusal to renew the licence-would put the service off the air. Cessation of a service would penalise not only the licensee company, but also the viewing or listening public and other innocent shareholders and creditors. There is a need to give the Tribunal more flexible and less draconian remedies. This Bill achieves that objective. The Bill allows the Tribunal, where it finds that a commercial licensee is no longer suitable to hold the licence, to issue specific directions to relevant parties and/or to impose appropriate licence conditions. These provisions do not create new substantive powers for the Tribunal. In the case of licence conditions, the Bill confirms that the existing power of the Tribunal under section 85 of the Act can be used as an alternative to licence cancellation. Similarly, in the case of directions, the Bill extends the current directions power under section 92M of the Act to enable it to be used in the event of a failure by a licensee to meet basic suitability requirements. In some circumstances, licence conditions or directions may still be insufficient to deal with the situation. In these cases, the amendments allow the Tribunal to order divestment of relevant interests. If a relevant interest is directed to be divested, a six-month deadline will apply. By then it would have been fully established by the Tribunal, if necessary thro'ugh court and Administrative Appeals Tribunal avenues, that the licensee had failed to meet the suitability requirements and that divestment was the approfinan- priate remedy. At this stage, the Government proposes no change to arrangements for any divestment that may be required in other circumstances, such as following a breach of ownership limits. The Bill also provides powers for the Tribunal to impose licence conditions and to issue directions to apply pending divestment. These powers will mirror the existing provisions that are available to the Tribunal pending its consideration of a share transaction. The purpose of this power is to enable the Tribunal to prevent actions that might adversely affect the service. The range of licensing remedies provided in this Bill enables the sanctions of licence suspension or revocation to be put in a clearer perspective. These remedies are best used as an ultimate deterrent against repeated or serious breaches of the Act. This Bill will remove concern that such draconian actions could be taken by the Tribunal because it had no other real alternative. At this point, I would like to refer more generally to the powers that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has long held under section 85 to impose licence conditions at any time, and, under section 92M, to issue directions pending an inquiry into an ownership transaction. In recent months, some doubt had been cast on the possible validity of the section 92M power and a possible procedural requirement may have inhibited its use in practice. These doubts had led to calls for additional powers to be provided to the Tribunal. In the light of advice from the Attorney-General's Department, the Government now considers that路 the current section 92M powers are valid. There are no undue obstacles to the use of these powers, or to the imposition of licence conditions, in cases where those steps would be warranted. Accordingly, the Government is not proposing any amen'dments in this respect at this stage. This Bill also proposes some minor adjustments and clarifications that reinforce existing policy and do not pre-empt the Government's ongoing review of broadcasting regulation. The Bill places beyond doubt the power of the Tribunal to inquire concurrently into applications for grant both commercial radio licences and supplementary licences in the same market. These amendments answer arguments that the Act may require those applications to be considered sequentially, an iriterpretaand tion that could substantially delay the troduction of new, competitive radio services in non-metropolitan markets. The Bill also will permit public broadcasters to transmit community promotional material. Pr-sently, public broadcasters may transmit community information, which under recent interpretations, may not be promotional in nature. The Government considers that this is too restrictive and that public broadcasters should be able to promote actively genuine community events of interest to their listeners. While the promotion of commercial sponsors will continue to be prohibited as a form of advertising, the Government is considering the implications of recent Tribunal findings and a Federal Court decision on these aspects, and may propose further clarifying amendments if that seems necessary. The amendment has been cast in broad terms on the basis that the Tribunal has power to make program standards in this area if it considers that to be appropriate. The Bill will also allow public broadcasters undertaking test transmissions to broadcast sponsorship announcements as if they were licensed services. This will assist aspirant public groups to pay for the tests, and enable them to gauge the level of support likely to be available within the community. Any breaches of the sponsorship requirements during the test would be an offence, and may also be taken into account by the Tribunal when it comes to determining who should be licensed. The continued growth of public broadcasting as an integral element of the Australian broadcasting system is fully appreciat-d by the Government and these amendments will continue to assist that growth. I mentioned earlier that this Bill is substantially similar to one introduced last year, but not passed before Parliament was dissolved. The present Bill incorporates a number of changes arising from of representations on the previous Bill. Those changes are as follows. The Tribunal will now have the power to .extend the period of six months allowed for divestment of interests required on suitability grounds; provision has been made for appeals into the Administrative Appeals Tribunal over directions by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal under proposed paragraph 92M (1 A) (b) or subsection 92M (1B). The first change recognises that an absolute limit in which interests must be disposed of may not be appropriate in every case. However, the Government is not prepared to allow people who do not meet the suitability requirement to hold interests indefinitely; The maximum extension, therefore, is six months and the Tribunal is required to consider whether all reasonable steps have been taken to dispose of the interest before an extension can be granted. The second change does not allow appeals against protective directions by the Tribunal. These are interim measures designed to. protect the licensee company and it is consistent with the current scheme of the Act that these protective directions are not subject to appeal. These changes respond to industry concerns while maintaining the role of the Tribunal to protect broadcasting services to the Australian public. Financial Impact The Bill is expected to have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.  adjourned. NA BILL (No.2) 1990 Bill presented by Mr Beazley, and read a first time. Second Reading",76
121,Mr BEAZLEY,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT,"Swan-Minister for Transport and Communications) (4.43)I move: That the BiII be now read a second time. This Bill represents a further step in the process of reform of broadcasting regulation in Australia. The efficiency measures proposed in the Bill were announced on 20 February 1990. However, I stress that they are interim measures pending the outcome of the review of broadcasting regulation currently under way. The framework for that review and its underlying philosophy were outlined in my second reading speech on the Broadcasting Amendment Bill 1990. This Bill proposes a number of improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of key areas of the Broadcasting Act 1942, particularly in respect of ownership and control of commercial broadcasting licences. The amendments are designed to: (a) change the share transaction approvals process to require Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) inquiry into, and approval of, only those transactions which result in the acquisition of a prescribed interest; in changes in actual control; or in possible breaches of the eign ownership licence condition; (b) change the 'prescribed interest' defacquisition inition for television licences clude loan interests and to increase the threshold for shareholding terests from 5 Per cent to 15 per cent, except in the case of the newspaper-television cross ownvides ership limit which remains at 5 cent; (c) require licensees to notify the ABT on a quarterly basis of arrangeinvestor ments, other than shareholdings, which give rise to actual control the licensee; (d) clarify the definition of actual control of a company; (e) extend the maximum licence renewal period from three to five years and allow concurrent renewal inquiries of licences where the licensees agree; and (f) ensure that legitimate networking arrangements do not breach relevant ownership and control limits. While a necessary interim step in the process of reform, these measures in no way compromise the Government's commitment to wider reform of the Broadcasting Act. Rather, they ensure that the Act continues to be workable while the complex task of crystallising policy options to minimise special and costly regulation and deliver a system of straightforward and generally applicable rules is completed. Consistent with that objective, this package addresses a number of deficiencies in the Act which give rise to unnecessary regulation. It will bring about some immediate reductions in paperwork, time and effort, and substantially reduce the ABT's current backlog of work to enable it to concentrate on issues of real public importance. The package has been developed in close consultation with all interested parties and has general support. I will now discuss the measures to be covered in this Bill. Revised Share Transaction Approval Process The present ownership and control reforgime of the Act required ABT approval for every share transaction involving the of, or increase in, a prescribed to exinterest in a commercial licence. This scheme allows the ABT to check the suitinability of new owners and to ensure that any associated change in control will not adversely affect the licensee. It also proa means of enforcing the foreign per shareholding licence condition and general ownership and control limits. The process has been a major source of and industry complaint. Because the Act attempts to identify all persons of who might conceivably exercise control, the approval process catches many persons who are in no position to exercise actual control. Furthermore, approval is required for all acquisitions of, or increases, in, prescribed interest holdings, irrespective of the size of the transaction, or of its impact on control of the licensee. The process itself has a range of automatic notice and application requirements. This process is widely acknowledged to be inappropriate and the Bill proposes a range of measures to streamline it. The changes are expected to reduce substantially the workload on all parties to a transaction and the ABT in three main ways: by reducing the number of transactions requiring inquiry approval and focusing ABT resources on those transactions requiring closer attention; by reducing delays and increasing certainty in the current process by establishing time limits; and by reducing reporting requirements, consistent with the ABT maintaining sufficient information to carry out its regulatory functions. The amendments will mean that ABT approval will only be required in three cases. First, where a person acquires a 15 per cent prescribed interest in a licensee for the first time. Second, where the ABT considers that an increased prescribed interest results in a change in actual control of a licensee. Third, where the ABT considers that there may be a breach of the foreign ownership licence condition. As a result, it is expected that up to 90 per cent of transactions currently requiring approval would no longer have that requirement. Time Limits The Government is, for the first time, introducing time limits for various stages of the process to reduce delays and increase certainty for the ABT and affected parties. In cases where the ABT has commenced an inquiry into a share transaction it will be required to complete that inquiry within six months of its commencement, unless the Tribunal formally extends the inquiry period. The same time limits will apply also to applications for transfer of a commercial licence. Where the Tribunal extends the period, which it could do repeatedly if necessary, the extension will need to be for a fixed period and the ABT will have to give reasons in writing for the extension. If the ABT chooses not to continue an inquiry by extending the period, the transactions subject to the inquiry will be deemed to have been approved. Reporting Requirements This Bill also represents a substantial streamlining in the reporting and general paperwork associated with a transaction. This includes: the complete removal路 of the requirement for pre-notification of share transactions; a streamlined posttransaction notice to replace applications in most cases; and removal of procedural requirements such as statutory declarations. Generally, notice and application requirements have been reduced to a minimum compatible with the ABT being able to carry out its relevant statutory functions. The aim is to reduce routine, detailed reporting under the Act and to rely instead on the ABT's information gathering powers to supplement its information base as required. For the revised process to work optimally, co-operation from licensees will be necessary, and the Government will be monitoring the outcome of the revised procedures closely. It will also be a condition of a commercial licence that the licensee report to the Tribunal each quarter if, during that quarterly period, a person gains control of the licensee corppany. This procedure will enable the ABT to identify arid inquire into situations of changes of actual control without having to rely on the detailed share transaction reporting arrangements under the current Act. These revised reporting and transaction procedures have been the subject of detailed consultation with licensees and the ABT and have received strong support as worthwhile improvements to the administration of the ownership and control provisions. During' these discussions, it was suggested, however, that the broader requirements for reporting of information to the ABT should be reviewed in the light of practical experience over recent years. The Department of Transport and Communications will hold further discussions with the broadcasting industry, public interest groups and the ABT to consider areas for further reform of the reporting and information provisions. This review will link with the current inquiry by the Administrative Review Council into ABT procedures. Definition of Television Prescribed Interest The ownership and control limits in the Act apply to a person who has a 'prescribed interest' in a licence or newspaper. For commercial radio licensees and newspaper companies, this occurs when a person acquires a 15 per cent equity or voting interest in a licensee through shareholdings. For television, however, the prescribed interest level for shareholdings is 5 per cent and loan interests are regulated under a 5 per cent 'financial' - aggregate shareholding and loan-interests test The television prescribed interest rules were introduced in 1965 to address concern about the potential for control or influence to be exercised through loans or small shareholdings. However, the current prescribed interest level has been ineffective in achieving the intended purpose, and often imposes an excessive regulatory burden on licensees, investors in licensee companies and the ABT. Few, if any, share and loan transactions involving prescribed interests between 5 per cent and 15 per cent confer actual control. More importantly, there are consequences for legitimate business investment. For example, it is common for investors to acquire-indirectly and unintentionally-a 5 per cent interest in a television licensee through the tracing and aggregation of unrelated shareholding interests. The ownership and control limits then apply, restricting their further investplaint ment in companies that may hold similar deemed interests in other television licences. The potential for acquiring a prescribed interest through loans has similar consequences. The Bill, therefore, proposes to raise the prescribed interest threshold for a television licence from 5 per cent to 15 per cent except in respect of the televisionnewspaper cross media limit. This recognises legitimate concerns that increasing the 5 per cent threshold could weaken the effectiveness of this cross media limit by allowing strategic newspaper investments in television licensees of up to 15 per cent. The television-radio limit is already set at 15 per cent. In 1987 this Government introduced strict limits on cross media holdings by radio and television licensee companies. Those provisions ensure diversification in the ownership in anyone area of radio or television services and local newspapers. The Government does not wish to change the application of these rules through alterations in the level of interests allowable in individual licensee companies. Consistent with other cross media limits, .a person already having a prescribed interest in a newspaper will continue to be required to notify the Tribunal when acquiring a 5 per cent or greater interest in a television licensee. That person would then have a six-month period of grace from the date of the transaction in which to divest excess interests. I mentioned earlier the matter of television loan interests which are subject to regulation under the current provisions of the Act. The Bill proposes deletion of the current 5 per cent financial interest component of the television prescribed interest test and of the registered lender provisions. Experience has shown that it is unnecessary to regulate all direct and indirect loan interests. In the vast majority of cases, loan interests do not confer real control of licensees. These provisions have been a particular source of justified comfrom broadcasting licensees and financial institutions. Where substantial loan interests do confer a real capacity for control, those interests can be investigated by the ABT case by case. The special quarterly reporting arrangements to which I referred earlier will bring to the notice of the ABT any situation of actual control arising through loan arrangements. Definition of Control The primary concern of the ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting Act is to identify situations where there is an actual capacity to exercise con- control. trol of a commercial licence, either through control of the licensee company or through control over programming or other broadcasting operations. It is a matter for the Tribunal in administering the Act to determine whether actual control can be exercised in the particular circumstances of each case. Related provisions in this Bill require the licensees to report actual changes in corporate control and the ABT to determine whether particular share transactions have resulted in an actual change in control of the licensee company. It is therefore considered desirable for the Act to give clear guidance to the ABT and to licensees on the meaning of the term 'control of a company'. The definition of 'control of a company' to be inserted in the Act is based on, and consistent with, the Federal Court ruling in Re News Corporation Ltd on which the ABT has relied in its recent decisions. The definition covers situations where a person is in a position to exercise direct or indirect 'control', whether through the power of direction or restraint, over any substantial issues affecting the management or affairs of a company. The Bill will also make it clear that, the purposes of the administration of the Act, two or more persons will each be taken to be in a position to exercise control of a licensee or newspaper if an agreement, arrangement or understanding puts them in a position 'to jointly exercise trol of a licence. This 'associate' provision is intended to further assist the ABT and all parties to arrangements in setting out clearly situations in which actual control will arise. Control would not exist, for example, merely because two persons at a shareholders' meeting agreed to vote together on a single issue affecting the management or affairs of a company-such as a decision whether the company should take over another company. If, however, two persons agreed to act regularly together for the purpose of securing control, the new associate provision would apply to deem each to be in a position to exercise In introducing amendments in relation to actual control of a licensee company, I should also emphasise the importance of related provisions already in the Broadcasting Act. which attribute control of a licence to any person in a position to control the selection of provision of programs to be broadcast by a licensee. The existing provisions in the Act, in particular, prohibit any foreign person or company from entering into transactions or other arrangements which confer control over the programs to be broadcast by a commercial licensee. While it is a matter for the Tribunal to determine whether particular arrangements confer control, potential foreign investors in licensee companies need to have regard not only to the individual and aggregate limits on foreign shareholding interests, but also the prohibition on foreign programming control. Periods of Grace The current Act allows a period of grace in which purchasers or third parties to a transaction may dispose of interests which contravene the ownership and control limits. There has been criticism that, in for conjunction with the system for approval of share transactions, the operation of these period of grace provisions has allowed companies to hold excess interests for indefinite periods. A practical effect of the streamlined transaction approval syscon- tem which I have outlined will be to reduce the length of time during which contraventions of the limits can be allowed under a period of grace. The Bill also makes consistent the requirement that applications for extension of time must be made within the initial six-month period. This remedies a previous anomaly in relation to cross-media limits which allowed repeated applications for extensions of the period of grace. The Bill also makes it clear that all reasonable efforts must be made to dispose of excess interests as quickly as possible before any extension of the six-months period can be considered by the Tribunal. Licensing and Renewal Inquiry Procedures There are currently 273 broadcasting licences on issue which, after the initial period of grant, are subject. to renewal every three years. This process is so demanding that the ABT has not been able to cope with the current workload. It has deferred renewals for periods of between 18 months and two years for up to 40 per cent of the licences due for renewal in the 1989-90 period. In practice, the' experience of the ABT has shown that it is unnecessary to review the performance of licensees every three years and that an extension to five years would be sensible in terms of practical evaluation and use of resources. Such an extension would continue to allow public interest groups and concerned citizens adequate opportunity to participate in the evaluation process. These provisions do not prevent the ABT from examining any issue of importance which may be raised with it during the term of a licence. Similarly, the ABT is still able to renew a licence for a shorter period if it believes this desirable. The Bill will allow the ABT to shorten licence periods, with the agreement of the licensees concerned, to synchronise renewal inquiries for licences .. This mechanism will enable the ABT to consider issues common to all related licences as part of a single inquiry. Normally, this will apply to commonly owned licences or licences that have substantial programming or operations in common. Issues specific to a particular licensee would still be considered individually but in the context of a common inquiry process. The procedure will save licensees time, effort and expense, and will enable the ABT to streamline its licence renewals by avoiding repeated inquiries into issues common to a number of other licences. Consent of affected licensees will be required before a joint renewal inquiry can be held for licences that have common ownership or programming operations. Exemptions for Networking Arrangements Recent legal advice indicates that arrangements between licensees who are affiliated to networks for the purposes of distribution of programming could breach the 60 per cent population reach television limit or associated cross-media limits. Clearly, such arrangements between licensees are to be encouraged to make possible economies of scale in the production of programs and to support the Government's policy for equalisation of television services in regional areas of eastern Australia. Accordingly, to ensure that these legitimate affiliation agreements proceed, the Bill provides that parties to a written networking agreement, lodged with the ABT for this purpose, will be exempted from operation of relevant ownership and control limits to the extent that direct or indirect control would arise from the terms of the agreement. In considering the means of resolving this issue, it has also been necessary to look at the effect of networking arrangements on the provisions of the Act relating to participation in the benefits of a licence to which programs are supplied. The amendments proposed in the bill ensure that these provisions are similarly not compromised. A minor amendment to the provisions on participation in the benefit- of a licence is included to exempt agreements under which a percentage of a licensee's revenue is payable to another party under programming rights agreements for performing artists or other copyright purposes. During consideration of these amendments, it was suggested that, in the context of revised provisions dealing with control of a licence, provisions in the Act relating to participation in the benefits of a licence may no longer be required. This issue will be considered further in the more fundamental review of the Broadcasting Act. This package of measures has been the subject of detailed consultation with representatives of licensees, public interest groups and the ABT. I express my appreciation for the constructive assistance provided by all these parties. Should any interested persons or industry representatives wish to have further discussion on the effect of the detailed provisions of the Bill, I will be pleased to facilitate those di-cussions. I indicated at the outset that the package of measures is an interim step in the overall process of comprehensive reform of broadcasting legislation by this Government. Further proposals will be brought forward when the results of the broader review have been exposed and decisions taken by the Government later this year. Financial Impact The Bill is expected to have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I commend the Bill to the House and table the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  journed.

122,Mr DUFFY,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Family Law Amendment Bill 1990 will introduce a small number of significant amendments to the Family Law Act, particularly in relation to child custody, guardianship and access proceedings. In line with the past bipartisan political approach in family law matters, the Bill is being introduced to lie on the table until the Budget sittings of Parliament. This will allow time for public comment on the Bill before it is debated. The most important of the amendments to be made by the Bill are aimed at improving the handling of custody and access disputes in which allegations of child abuse are made by one party against another. In preparing these amendments the Government has been guided by the findings and recommendations made by the Family Law Council in its 1988 report on child sexual abuse. Honourable members will be aware of increases in recent years in reported instances of child abuse. Child sexual abuse in particular has become a significant is-. sue for the Family Court of Australia in a number of cases. A number of the uncertainties raised by early Family Court decisions on child abuse were resolved by decisions of the High Court in 1988. However, other difficulties with the handling of child abuse allegations in Family Court proceedings remain. The Family Court has responded to the problems in this area by establishing appropriate procedures within the Court's administration to process cases involving child abuse allegations. Procedures have also been introduced for better coordination with State and Territory child welfare authorities. The amendments to be made by this 1990 Bill are designed to complement the administrative steps already taken by the Family Court in the area of child abuse. The amendments will provide for mandatory reporting of child abuse by Family Court staff to State and Territory child welfare authorities; provide legal protection for Family Court staff who report child abuse to child welfare authorities; provide for State and Territory child welfare authorities and other interested persons to intervene in cases involving alleged child abuse; limit the number of unnecessary medical and psychological examinations of children obtained by parents involved in custody and access disputes; insert an express statement in the Family Law Act requiring the Family Court to have regard to the need to protect children from abuse; and provide protection for medical and other witnesses in child abuse cases from abusive or hectoring questioning. One amendment to be made by the Bill will give statutory force to the Family Court's established practice of admitting hearsay evidence of statements made by children to adults about abuse they have suffered. The Family Court already admits evidence of this kind because of its long established policy that children should not be drawn into Family Court proceedings by being called as witnesses for either side in a custody or access dispute. The weight to be given to any hearsay evidence will, of course, remain a matter for the Court to determine in each particular case. Another area of family law in which the Bill will make changes is step-parent adoptions. For many years the formation of step-families usually resulted from the death of a parent. Today, however, many step-families are formed following the breakdown of pr(!vious marriages. In these cases both natural parents are still alive and usually maintain continuing relationships with their children. It has long been an accepted principle in family law that continuing contact with both natural parents is usually desirable in the interests of the long-term development of a child. If parents disagree about custody or access to a child following the breakdown of their marriage, the Family Court provides appropriate counselling and if necessary applies the relevant legal principles under the Family Law Act to resolve the dispute. However in recent years a small number of parents have tried to use adoption to establish a new family unit consisting of the children, one natural parent and a new spouse-the step-parent. One reason a parent may have for seeking to adopt in these cases is that adoption may put an end to any rights the other natural parent may have to custody, guardianship or access to the child. It also puts an end to the oth-r natural parent's liability to pay child support for the child. In its 1986 report on step-families the family Law Council commented on the inappropriateness of adoption as a method of establishing the legal status of a stepchild in a step-family. The Council preferred the alternative of a determination by the Family Court of the parties'custody, guardianship and access rights under the Family Law Act. The Bill will amend the Family Law Act to make it clear that a step-parent adoption does not put an end to existing custody, guardianship or access rights under the Act unless the Family Court decides that the step-parent adoption is in the best interests of the child. The amendments will not affect adoptions other than step-parent adoptions. The Bill includes other amendments recommended by the Family Law Council to protect the welfare of children. The Bill includes provisions which will stop parents transferring custody or guardianship of children to non-parents by means of Family Court consent orders or by registering child agreements with the Court. These provisions are aimed at ensuring that in future any arrangement that comes before the Family Court that involves conferral of custody or guardianship on non-parents will be scrutinised by the Court to determine whether those nonparents are suitable persons to have custody or guardianship of the child. The Bill makes a number of other technical amendments to the Family Law Act. I need mention only two of these amendments. In 1989 the Family Law Act was amended to allow the parents of an exnuptial child to register an agreement with the Family Court which determines their rights and duties in relation to the custody, guardianship, access and maintenance of the child. The Bill will amend the Family Law Act to provide that these child agreements are exempt from stamp duties. This will ensure child agreements relating to ex-nuptial children enjoy the same exemption as maintenance agreements for children of a marriage. The other technical amendment I mention is an amendment to clarify the powers of police who are responsible for the enforcement of Family Court orders. The Bill will empower police, who are authorised under the Family Law Act to arrest a person, to enter and search premises for the wanted person. This amendment is necessary to ensure that the police are able to apprehend people who breach domestic violence and other orders issued by the Family Court. The Government. welcomes comments by interested persons on the amendments proposed in the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  journed. NA LABORATORIES (CONVERSION INTO PUBLIC COMPANY) BILL 1990 ucts. Bill presented by Mr Howe, and read a first time. ' Second Reading",85
123,Mr HOWE,COMMONWEALTH SERUM,"Batman-Minister for Community Services and Health) (5.02)I move:路 That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Act 1961 to convert the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) to a public company, called the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd. It will also remove a variety of statutory controls which inhibit CSL's commercial operations. The Minister responsible for CSL will retain strategic oversight of the new pany in line with the guidelines for reform of government business enterchanges prises. The Bill is a major step in implementand partnerships. ing the reform package for CSL announced on 16 August 1989 and is part of the Government's comprehensive proerinary gram to improve the performance of ernment business enterprises. CSL has a long history of achievements in serving the Australian community. CSL was established in 1916, following World sents War I, as an arm of the quarantine ice, so that Australia could be self-sufficient in vaccines and sera in times of and peace. In 1923 CSL was one of the four laboratories world-wide to produce insulin in 1944 CSL enabled Australia to be the first country to supply penicillin to civilian population. In 1952 CSL comto menced the fractionation of serum, prothe vided by voluntary blood donors and collected by the Red Cross, into life-savAustralian market. ing blood products, a function it continues to perform today. CSL has developed anti-sera and antivenoms against specific Australian pests and diseases, the most recent being the funnel-web spider anti-venom in 1988. CSL is the only manufacturer of human vaccines in Australia and one of only two producers of biological veterinary prodWhen CSL became a statutory authority in 1961 its charter focused on the performance of national interest functions, in particular the manufacture of prescribed biological pharmaceutical products and serum fractionation. Provision was also made at that time, however, for limited commercial operations using any excess manufacturing capability. With support from successive Ministers CSL has since evolved into a primarily commercial organisation. Significant changes to the CSL Act between 1980 and 1985 removed the restriction limiting CSL to manufacturing solely biological products and placed CSL's operation on a commercial profit-making basis, whilst continuing to perform some national incomterest activities for the Commonwealth the under re-imbursed arrangement. These to the Act also allowed the establishment of subsidiaries, joint ventures CSL now markets a wide range of prescribed human pharmaceuticals and vetproducts both in Australia and govoverseas. CSL currently employs over 1,200 staff and has over 2,000 product lines. As such CSL is the largest pharmaceutical company in Australia, and reprea unique pharmaceutical servmanufacturing capability. . Indeed, since 1980-81 CSL's sales revwar enue has increased from $33m to $127m in 1988-89, and pre-tax profits have increased from $1. 5m to $11. 5m over the and same period. Not only does CSL pay a 40 per cent dividend on its post tax profit to its the Commonwealth but also it is subject State payroll and land taxes as well as corporate tax. CSL's achievements are significant, given the small size of the In its recent endeavours to increase sales CSL has been a winner of several export awards. Indeed, with the globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry CSL's future must lie with the development of new products and new markets, not just within Australia but overseas. This will be achieved not only through CSL's own research activities. but also through the convide tinued development of licensing arrangements and joint ventures to access new technology. CSL can succeed in these areas only if it is allowed to operate as a truly commercial enterprise that can respond quickly in the market-place free from day-today government regulatory controls. The reform package is, therefore, a ther significant step in the continued de'"" velopment of CSL. The objective is to establish it as an efficient and commercially focused organisation able to compete profitably and effectively with the private sector in the domestic and international market place. The reform package will thus achieve the Government's aims of firstly, fostering a more commercial focus for CSL and secondly, retaining a key manufacturing capability in Australia without the need for any subsidies from the Commonwealth. This Bill is a major step in implementing this reform. There are a number of important elements of the CSL reform package. Firstly, there will be new planning and accountability mechanisms for CSL. These will include the provision by CSL of a three-year corporate plan路 which will define the company's goals, financial targets and strategies to achieve those goals. Financial targets will be set and CSL will report annually giving an account of its performance against goals. CSL's memorandum and articles of association will be registered, as with any public company, with the National Companies and Securities Commission. The Minister responsible for CSL will exercise control, on behalf of the Commonwealth as the shareholder, in a similar manner to shareholders in any other company. The proposed memorandum and articles of association will provide for the Minister sponsible to have the power to appoint and dismiss the CSL board of directors. Also the Minister responsible for CSL will be able to issue guidelines to the board. In addition, as a public company, CSL will be required to operate in accordance with the companies code. This will profor the protection of the interests of the Commonwealth through its rights as a shareholder of the company. Under the companies code the company directors have specific responsibilities to shareholders as well as other defined obligations. There will also be revised remuneration arrangements for the managing director. CSL's important community service fur- function of serum fractionation will be made more efficient and accountable through use of a formal contractual arrangement with the Commonwealth. The provision for rights to be attached to shares included in a class of shares will also protect the Commonwealth's interests in relation to the land on which CSL is 'located. CSL will be expected to continue to comply with Government wages and industrial relations policies, in particular with those guidelines developed specifically for government business enterprises (GBEs) in March 1989. It is intended that CSL operate as a public company limited by shares and incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory. The arrangements proposed for CSL are essentially the same as those already applying to other GBEs such as Australian Airlines Ltd, Australian National Line and most recently the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. I will now summarise the key elements of the Bill. The Bill provides for the conversion of CSL from its current statutory authority status, to a public company under the Companies Act. The Bill comes into effect in several stages, on Royal Assent and through two proclamations. This is to facilitate the consolidation of the asset base, creation of capital structure and repeal of sections of the CSL Act 1961 which are no longer required. This also allows for the develre,- opment of an appropriate balance sheet, financial performance indicators and strategic plan to enable the Minister responsible for CSL to undertake strategic oversight of the company. As the legislation will come路 into effect in several stages the Bill ensures the continuity of CSL as a legal entity during transition in order to preserve all contracts, agreements and the relationship of CSL with its subsidiary companies. ' The Bill ensures continuity of employment and staff conditions during the transition. Each staff member of CSL will become an employee of the company on the same terms and conditions as applied to his or her employment by the statutory authority. This includes the preservation of accumulated entitlements such as long service, recreation and sick leave. The isting provisions covering superannuation will be maintained for staff who are members of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. Those staff who have mobility rights under part IV of the Public Service Act 1922 will retain those rights. The Bill also ensures路 that CSL's taxation position and other assets and liabilities are unchanged upon conversion in recognition of the fact that there has been no change in the beneficial ownership by the Commonwealth. On the matter of assets the aill provides for CSL's asset base to be consolidated before the assets are converted into share capital and fully paid up shares are issued to the Commonwealth. The consolidation of assets entails the transfer to CSL of the remaining land and buildings which had remained vested in the Commonwealth. These 'transferring assets' have been employed by CSL since its establishment in 1916 but were not transferred to CSL at the time it became a statutory authority in 1961. In relation to the 'transferring assets' the Bill contains specific provisions which ensure that, for taxation purposes, CSL is treated as if it had acquired these assets at the time they were acquired by the Commonwealth. Provision has been made in the Bill for the issued shares to be divided into classes to which rights can be attached. This allows for the Commonwealth to have rights in relation to the existing serum fractionation operation, which is an important community service operation and will not be路come part of CSL's fully commercial operations. This provision also allows for this the Commonwealth to have rights in relation to the sale of the land at CSL. The Bill then provides for the establishment of CSL as a company through the registration of the memorandum and articles of association for CSL with the N-ti-mal Companies and Securities CommISSIOn. The Bill removes controls such as the requiremf;nt for the Treasurer's approval for individual borrowing arrangements, and investment and banking arrangeex- ments. However, CSL will remain subject to the Loan Council global borrowing limits and will be liahle for the Commonwealth borrowing levy on any borrowings. It will, however, forgo all forms of government guarantee and will not be able to claim protection from the shield of the Crown. T,he Bill also contains consequential amendments to other Acts to ensure that the new company remains subject to the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987, and exempt from the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The schedule to the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) 1930, which identifies those Commonwealth bodies which are not exempt from sales tax, will be amended to delete reference to CSL. Nonetheless, as a company, CSL will continue to pay sales tax. The Bill does not involve additional expenditure by the Commonwealth or additional revenue to the Commonwealth. Nor does it involve any State and Territory taxes on the transfer of assets in recognition of the fact that there has been no change in the Commonwealth's beneficial ownership. The Bill implements a further stage of the Government's program of micro-economic reform by removing another government business enterprise from the restrictions of day to day regulatory control, whilst ensuring that strategic oversight of performance and efficiency is maintained. It is also a further step in the Government's effort to encourage value added manufacture within Australia without the requirement for underpinning by the Commonwealth. At the same time, it recognises CSL's significant contribution to the Australian community in the past and present. I commend the Bill to the House. I now present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MACKellar) adjourned. PETROLEUM EXCISE (PRICES) AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Griffiths, and read a first time. Second Reading",87
124,Mr GRIFFITHS,COMMONWEALTH SERUM,"I move.: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990 is to amend the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 to enable the calculation of a volume weighted average of realised prices of sales of crude oil, referred to as the Volware price. This calculation is required for the purpose of determining excise liability for excisable oil produced outside the Bass Strait producing area, including the Jackson oilfield located in south-west Queensland. The powers of this Bill are integral to the collection of crude oil excise under the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and Excise Act 1901. As from 1 January 1988, when the decision to deregulate the oil market and to terminate the import parity pricing basis for levying excise was implemented, crude oil prices for the purposes of calculating excise liability have been determined by the Minister for Resources, or his delegate, under the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 on the basis of the volume weighted average of realised-Volwareprices of sales of crude oil in a calendar month. As the principal Act applies to offshore areas producing excisable petroleum, its application has effectively been confined to the Bass Strait producing region. The second reading speech to the principal Act noted that production from areas onshore would become excisable in the event that production exceeded the 30 million barrel excise free limit, and that the price basis for excising such onshore oil production would be considered at the appropriate time. Indications are that cumulative production from the Jackson oilfield will exceed 30 million barrels early in 1990-91 and hence production above this limit will become excisable. The calculation of separate Volware prices for different producing regions is necessary to prevent inequities in excise liability. These inequities arise from the fact that the realised prices of crude oil from different sources have been observed to differ and hence there are direct implications for the excise payable. In effect, those producers with lower realised prices would pay relatively more of the excise liability than those with higher realised prices if a combined Vol ware price were used as the basis for excise liability. This is the case for Jackson and Bass Strait production. In order to facilitate the calculation of a Volware price to determine excise liability for the Jackson oilfield, it is necessary to widen the definition of producer in the principal Act to include onshore producers. Amendments are also required to enable the calculation of a separate Volware price for the Bass Strait and Jackson producing regions and for the description of each producing region to be prescribed in the regulations to the Act. The amendments have been framed in a way that will enable regions additional to Jackson and Bass Strait to be listed separately in the regulations in the event that production from within other regions becomes liable for excise. The Bill therefore provides for an effective and equitable system of collecting excise on crude oil production at Jackson. The amount of excise that will be generated from the Jackson oilfield will be dependent on the level of production. If production were to be maintained at current levels, excise of about $0.35m might be expected in a full year. Consequential changes of a minor nature are required to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. These are incorporated in the proposed amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. 1 commend the Bill to the House, and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Carlton) adjourned. CUSTOMS (DETENTION AND SEARCH) BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Baldwin for Mr Beddall, and read a first time. Second Reading",90
125,Mr BALDWIN,COMMONWEALTH SERUM,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to repeal the current power to detain and search persons suspected of unlawfully carrying prohibited goods, and insert in its place a new division containing a more comprehensive range of customs detention and search :Jowers. The Bill gives effect to several major !lements of the Government's anti-drug ;trategy. Foremost amongst these is: the ]overnment's decision to implement the egislative framework for the detention .nd, if necessary, search of persons reaonably suspected of importing narcotics 'y internal concealment, which has been ettled in consultation with the Commonlealth/States Ministerial Council on Drug trategy, as one of the outcomes of the 985 Drug Summit; and the Governlent's decision announced on 18 July 989 to allow authorised Customs officers ) stop and frisk search persons for proibited goods within Customs controlled 路eas at internat-onal air and sea ports. The Bill is substantially the same as the le which was introduced last session into e Parliament, with the exception of three inor amendments which have arisen as result of briefings on that Bill with the lW Council of Australia and the then )position spokesperson on customs. The lendments in particular provide an ex-ss right to an interpreter for detainees t able to communicate with reasonable ency in English, to allay concerns that a detainee might not appreciate the consequences which flow from a failure to cooperate with a frisk search, for example, by reason only of the detainee's inadequate knowledge of the English language. This new right appears in proposed new section 219zD, on page 16 of the attached Bill. The other two minor amendments are to proposed subsections 219R (10) and 219v (11), and are explained in detail in the relevant notes on clauses in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies this Bill, on pages 20 and 26 respectively. It is indeed an unfortunate fact of our modern-day life that there are persons who wish to corrupt our society by importing illicit drugs, and some of those persons will even go to the extent of concealing the drugs inside their bodies or force a courier to do the same, in order to escape detection. Tragically some of those persons or couriers pay for this very dangerous and路 difficult attempt to avoid detection with their lives. The present Customs Act power to detain and search persons reasonably suspected of carrying prohibited goods has remained largely unchanged since Federation, and is currently contained in section 196 of the Act. The section however does not deal adequately with the problem of internal concealment in that it does not expressly provide adequate protections and rights either for the officers or suspects concerned, or the medical practitioners who may be asked to conduct an internal search. At the other end of the spectrum, the present detention and search regime is unnecessarily complicated for the simple frisk of a person at the customs barrier. With evidence to hand of a growing trend towards the importation of drugs using concealment on the body, and the community's expectation and legitimate demand when travelling for a speedy clearance through the customs barrier, a corresponding mechanism for the quick and efficient checking of persons reasonably suspected of carrying prohibited goods is necessary. The proposed new Division IB inserted by clause 8 of the Bill, proposes 23 new sections for part xii of the Customs Act 1901, bringing together the full range of proposed Customs body search powers, from the least intrusive frisk, through external search, to the more intrusive internal search. By splitting the three types of searches into distinct subdivisions, the new division highlights not only the progressive strengthening of the statutory protections and rights afforded persons to be searched as the level of intrusiveness increases but also the more rigorous legal requirements on officers of Customs. and police as the searches become more mvasive. The first level of search, the frisk is set out in proposed new subdivision A of the Bill, new sections 219L to P. It is limited to Customs controlled areas at international air and sea ports, and will be available to enable the detention of persons by Customs where a Customs supervisory officer suspects on reasonable ground that a person is unlawfully carrying any prohibited goods. The search itself, which is a common and widespread barrier feature of most customs administrations around the globe, involves the quick pat-down of a person's outer garments and must be carried ou-, as soon as practicable after the person IS detained, by an officer of Custo?1s of the same sex as the detainee, and m pnvate if so requested. The proposed regiJ?e includes the right of Customs to reqUIre the production of any thing reve-led by the frisk search, in order to determme whether the thing is, or contains, prohibited goods. Failure to submit to a lawful frisk search, or to produce upon request at-ing revealed by the search, shall constItute sufficient grounds for the next level of search an external search, under proposed' new subdivision B. This second level of search, the external search, in proposed subdivision B, new sections 219Q and R, effectively continues t-e current detention and search power m section 196 of the Customs Act, with minor drafting amendments to make. it consi.stent with the proposed new fnsk and mternal search regimes and express provisions to highlight a person's rights if detained for such a search. The initial decision to detain a person under this regime is one which must be taken by an authorised customs officer, an experienced officer of supervisory rank, or an officer of police, who must decide whether there is sufficient cause to suspect that a person is unlawfully carryin- any prohibited goods. Where a person IS detained the detainee must be taken as soon as practicable to either a special detention place or a place that offers the detainee adequate personal privacy. The Customs or police then must apply, as soon as practicable, for an order for an external search from a justice of the peace, the search, Comptroller-General of C-stoms or an authorised officer of supervIsory rank, unless the detainee consents to be searched. Sp.ecial pro-ection is provide? for th--e detainees WhICh the BIll descnbes as m need of protection'; effectively, those persons who because of their age, under 17, or mental or physical incapacity, are eiltitled to special rights. Consistent with t-e spirit of Australia's international commItments under human rights and privacy conventions, especially with regard to children such persons may be searched only by 'order, and any search order is to be carried out in the presence of the detainee's legal guardian or another person capable of representing the detainee's i,nterests, with that person, so far as,PractIcable, being acceptable to the detamee. Finally, similar to th- frisk regi-e, where an external search IS to be carned out on a detainee, the search must be carried out by a person who is of the same sex as the detainee. Further, an express right to an interl?ret-r has .been provided when commUnICatIOn WIth or by the detainee is to take place, for those detainees not able to communicate orally with reasonable fluency in the English language. The final level of search proposed by the Bill is the internal search, proposed by subdivisions C and E, new sections 219s to 219z, and 219ZF to 219ZJ. The term 'internal search' has been defined as an examination by a medical practitioner of the body of a person, including an internal examination of the person's body, to determine whether the person is internally concealing a narcotic substance, and includes the recovery of any substance suspected on reasonable grounds to be so concealed. The overriding policy of this proposed regime is that, if a search is not consented to, it will be ordered only as a last resort. To give effect to that policy, the Bill provides for two periods of 48-hour detention, which may be ordered only by a magistrate or judge, to maximise the chances of any drugs being eliminated naturally. The Government appreciates that the detention of a person on suspicion only is a serious and very sensitive matter and, were it not for the fact that the control of the路 importation of drugs requires strong powers, the civil liberties implications of detention represented by this regime would not have been countenanced. Therefore, the Bill provides detention will occur only when that action is authorised by an appropriately senior judicial officer-that is, a judge or magistrate. In that respect, this part of the Bill is similar to the Customs Amendment Act of 1979, which proposed an internal bodysearch regime, but which was never proclaimed. The protections afforded suspected persons under the terms of that amendment Act were not considered adequate and, partly as a consequence, all the States and the Northern Territory were not able to agree to provide access to the necessary judicial officers before the Act could be proclaimed. As far as the detention and internal search provisions of this Bill are concerned, the Government has included specific provisions to protect the rights of persons detained, while retaining the practical and necessary flexibility for Customs officers and police officers charged by the community with the responsibility of controlling the importation of narcotics. All States and the Northern Territory have been consulted on the terms of the Bill and are expected to agree, this time, to allow access to judges and magistrates to consider applications for orders to detain or search under the terms of the internal search regime. This exercise has been a protracted one and various amendments and suggestions made in the course of those discussions have been incorporated in the Bill. In addition, consultations on the obvious privacy and human rights implications of this regime have occurred over the period during which this Bill has been settled, to ensure as far as practicable that the rights of the individual are not submerged by the community's interest to control the influx of drugs into this country. The rights in particular of a detainee at any time during detention under the internal search regime to consult a lawyer of his or her choice, to have adequate opportunity to obtain legal advice and legal representation in relation to detention and search order applications, and to have the services of an interpreter where the detainee is unable to communicate with reasonable fluency in the English language are ample evidence of the civil rights emphasis proposed by the Bill. Finally, I think it is important to put into context the frequency of current detention and search activity at the Customs barrier, to allay any fears that the proposed powers in this Bill might in fact alter markedly the current practice of passenger processing. The power of search of persons under the Customs Act presently is exercised mainly by Customs officers and mainly at Australia's international airports. In 1988-89 the total number of persons searched was 2,505, which represents 0.06 per cent of the total arriving passengers population of 4.2 million. Of this number of searches, 102 persons were detained for internal search and, in most cases, those persons consented to X-ray by a medical practitioner. The figures clearly show that the present power is exercised in a judicious and controlled way, and it is not expected, as a result of this Bill, that the number of persons searched should show any marked increase. Financial Impact Statement The costs associated with this Bill relate to the provision of medical and judicial personnel for the internal search regimenew subdivisions c and E of proposed new division lB. It is estimated that the costs for medical personnel and facilities to carry out those internal searches which are ordered, and the costs of the States and territories judicial officers detention and search order applications, will total $150,000 per annum.

126,Mr BALDWIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill contains amendments to a number of Acts administered by the Administrative Services portfolio. The amendments are of a kind which, in recent years, it has been the practice to include in an omnibus Bill. Amendments of the Archives Act 1983 The Government has decided that the Australian Archives should charge for certain discretionary services to Commonwealth agencies where such charges would promote efficiency and effectiveness. Currently, the levying of charges by Archives for any of its services must be prescribed by regulation in accordance with section 71 of the Archives Act. It is proposed that the Archives Act be amended so that the Director-General may levy charges on Commonwealth agencies without recourse to regulations. The proposed amendment is designed to provide the Archives with the same degree of flexibility in its charging policy as will be available to any private sector competitors who are able to determine charges in accordance with market conditions. This amendment is necessary to enable the archives to implement fully the Government's policy of using interdepartmental charging to impose economic discipline on both the suppliers and the users of common services with the Australian to service Government Administration. Repeal of the Naval Properties Act 1925 This Act provides for ratifying agreements between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Government for the transfer of Cockatoo and Schnapper Islands from the New South Wales Government and part of Goat Island from the Commonwealth. In 1985 the New South Wales Govern1990 ment granted an easement in gross which protects the Commonwealth's maritime rights. Thus, this Act is no longer necessary and the Bill proposes that it be repealed. Repeal of the Procurement of Goods, Works and Services Act 1981 The Procurement of Goods, Works and Services Act has two essential features. It provides a legislative basis for a preference scheme in support of the purchase of Australian goods by government authorities and a framework for centralised purchasing. The legislation has been contentious since its enactment. It has since been overtaken by a series of purchasing reforms and new preference arrangements, developed following consultation with Australian industry, being phased in from 1 November 1989. Amendments of Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952 This Bill also seeks to amend the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952. The Act provides for the continuation of salary payments to members of the Parliament from the路 date of dissolution of either House or of the Parliament until polling day, where members are to be candidates for election. The Act also sets the circumstances under which additional salary and allowances determined by the Remuneration Tribunal are paid to certain office holders of the Parliament. Currently the Act provides that additional salary and allowances are not payable to office holders with the exception of the President of the Senate, Speaker of the House and the chairmen of both Houses, between the dissolution of either House and polling day. it is the considered view that all officeholders continue to exercise their responsibilities over the period in question and consequently that the Act should be amended to reflect this. It is proposed that salaries and allowances payable to office-holders who are candidates for election continue to be paid between dissolution of either House and polling day. Amendment of the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No.1) 1930 and Social Security Act These Acts are amended to remove reference to the Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services, which was sold and is now no longer a Commonwealth. instrumentality.

This Bill is substantially the same as the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 which was introduced in November last year but lapsed with the dissolution of Parliament. The Bill proposes a variety of amendments to Acts dealing with defence matters. The more important amendments are: A. amend Defence Force retirement and death benefits legislation to increase the orphans' benefit from $702 to $5000; B. remove restrictions on the Chief of the Defence Force's power to make single service command appointments and organisational arrangements. C. modify provisions relating to the enlistment of soldiers and sailors to enable the open-ended enlistment scheme to operate more effectively. D. amend Commonwealth Acts to replace references to the Joint Intelligence Organisation with references to the Defence Intelligence Organisation. Other amendments include: A. remove redundant provisions dealing with seniority; B. amend the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 to replace obsolete refer1947 ences to the offence of rape with references to the current Australian Capital Territory provisions that have replaced that former offence. C. amend the Statute law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (No.1) 1985 to remove an unnecessary provision dealing with allotments. I will now deal with the more important amendments. The other changes are explained in the explanatory memorandum. Orphans' Benefits The increases in the orphans' benefits proposed by the amendments in schedule 2 are those that my predecessor announced in a statement on 11 May 1989 in responding to the report on personnel wastage in the Defence Force by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-the Cross Committee. As was then indicated, the level of orphans' benefits under the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme and the defence forces retirement benefits scheme were considerably less than those under the Commonwealth superannuation schemes. The increase of some $4,300 for each orphan will correct the situation. The total benefits payable in respect of the orphans of a deceased member or pensioner will be capped at the maximum路 rate of pension that would have been payable to the member or pensioner. About 140 orphans will benefit immediately from the increases. Command Power of the Chief of the Defence Force Current command arrangements allow the Chief of the Defence Force to command all operations conducted by the Australian Defence Force (ADF). These arrangements have been put into place as a result of the ongoing process of refining the command of the Australian Defence Force. They are the result of implementing the recommendations of a study into ADF command arrangements conducted in 1987. The existing legislation obliges the Chief of the Defence Force to implement single service appointme'nts and organisational arrangements through the service chiefs of staff. To provide the appropriate legal basis for the current arrangements, these restrictions upon the Chief of the Defence Force's command power need to be removed. The amendments make the necessary changes to the Defence Act and the Naval Defence Act. The amendments in no way detract from the provision for command appointments and organisational arrangements under the Acts, as remaining provisions will contain adequate authority for these matters. There will therefore be no need to replace the provisions that have been omitted or repealed. The new operational command arrangements have been implemented with the support of the service chiefs of staff. While they ,no longer conduct operations, they continue to train and administer their respective arms of the Defence Force, and provide advice as the professional heads of their respective services. Open Ended Enlistment In 1987 the Defence Act and the Naval Defence Act were amended to allow servGroup ice administrators to offer enlistment retiring age as well as enlistment for fixed period. A soldier or sailor enlisted until retiring age may claim his or her discharge on giving an appropriate period of notice, which in relation to members of the permanent forces is 12 months or such lesser period determined by a chief of staff. It was the intention of service administrators at that time to offer, initially, enlistment for a fixed period lowed by the option of extension until retiring age. Service administrators now consider that it is more efficient to enlist a soldier or sailor initially until retiring age but require that a minimum period of service be required before a discharge may be claimed. The amendments proposed to the Defence Act and the Naval Defence Act include a provision so that a soldier or sailor of the permanent forces who has enlisted until retiring age does not have a right to claim a discharge during the first six years of service, or such lesser period as a chief of staff determines. Historically, six years is the minimum initial period of service required to be served. To enable effective implementation of the openended enlistment scheme, the amendments proposed required that the approval of a chief of staff be required for any variation or withdrawal of a claim for discharge. This amendment is required to avoid manipulation of the procedure of claiming a discharge. F-ctors required to be taken into account by a chief of staff in determining a lesser period of service before which a discharge may be claimed and in considering approval of a variation or withdrawal of a claim for discharge are included in the proposed amendments. It will still be open to a soldier or sailor to request a discharge at any time. Joint Intelligence Organisation On 1 March 1989 the then Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, announced some changes to defence intelligence arrangements, and in particular the combining of the functions of the Joint Intelligence Organisation with those of the Intelligence in the Australian Defence Force to headquarters. The then Minister also ana nounced that this restructured body will be known as the Defence Intelligence Organisation. The new name better reflects the body's central role in the preparation of defence intelligence assessments and the provision of operational intelligence for the Australian Defence Force. The amendments make consequential name changes to the various Commonwealth folActs containing references to the Joint Intelligence Organisation. These changes will enable the formal renaming of the body. Financial Impact Statement It is estimated that the increase in the orphans' benefits will cost approximately $600,000 a year. The other provisions of the Bill have no financial impact. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Carlton) adjou-ned.

128,Mr BALDWIN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The provisions of this Bill were included in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.3) of 1989. That Bill lapsed, however, due to the dissolution of the Parliament. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act to protect the rights and responsibilities of higher education institutions to make their own decisions, independent of Government interference, on the provision of services and amenities for their students and the imposition and collection of fees for that purpose. The Bill should therefore be seen against the background of the Government's efforts to strengthen and, where necessary, protect the legitimate autonomy of higher education instijourned. tutions. Student organisations provide range of services to their members, from counselling, sporting, health' and careers services to the necessary social outlets for first time. young people in higher education. These services and amenities must be maintained at a viable level, - nd that requires money. The principal source of that money is services and amenities fees collected from students themselves by the governing bodies of the institutions on behalf of organisations representing the interests of students generally. At present these fees are paid in accordance with provisions made by the governing bodies of the institutions. It was路 made clear when this measure was originally introduced into the House that the Government considers it unfortunate that there needs to be a Bill of this kind at all. However, States have in the past interfered with these arrangements and there have been threats, notably from the New South Wales Government, that this might occur again. We are not prepared to see this happen. This Bill provides that, as a condition of grant under the Act, a State must not interfere with the rights of the governing bodies of institutions to make decisions as to the imposition or collection of fees for organisations representing the interests of students generally. If a State breaches this condition it will be required to make up any consequential shortfall in revenue to those institutions. If necessary this will be achieved by a requirement that the State pay the Commonwealth an amount to make up the shortfall or, alternatively, the Commonwealth could reduce the State's general revenue assistance. The Commonwealth will than make payments direct to the affected institutions. The Government again encourages any State contemplating such interference in the autonomy of higher education institutions to think again and hopes that the provisions of this Bill will never need to be invoked. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the House.

129,Mr KERIN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Dried Fruits Levy Act 1971 to increase the maximum rate of levy for dried vine fruit. The funds raised are destined for dried vine fruits research and development and to finance the operation of the Dried Fruits Research Council. Currently, the Dried Fruits Levy Act 1971 sets a maximum rate of levy for dried vine fruits at $S per tonne. The dried fruits industry, together with the Dried Fruits Research Council, has requested that the maximum rate of levy for dried vine fruit be increased from $S to $10 per tonne. This increase has been sought in order to accommodate continuation of a rolling program of increases to the operative levy rate for dried vine fruit. Operative levy rates will continue to be set by regulation under the Dried Fruits Levy Act 1971. This Government has given a commitment to match additional funds raised for research and development through increased levy receipts, on a dollar for dollar basis up to O.S per cent of the average annual gross value of production of an industry, in this case, the dried fruits industry.

130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Nehl)Before the debate on this Bill is resumed I remind the House that is has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering this Bill and the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1990.,98
131,Mr SNOWDON,CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (S.S2)- Mr Deputy Speaker, let me congratulate you on your magnificent appointment. I am sure that you will bring to this position the discipline that you have brought to your activities as a backbencher. I am conscious of the time constraints, and am aware that my National Party colleague from the Opposition benches wishes to make a contribution, so I will confine my brief remarks to the contributions made by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith). The contribution by the honourable member for Bass illustrated the tremendous contradictions which have been evidenced in Opposition policy in this place both prior to the election and subsequently. In one part of his speech the honourable member for Fadden indicated that he welcomed the Prices Surveillance Authority's role in the monitoring of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) charges. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in the second reading speech it was stated that a change provided for in the legislation is the scr-tiny of proposed statutory charges levied by the CAA under the Act by the Prices Surveillance Authority and that the Government believes there is a need for visible checks and balances to be put in place to ensure there is no perceived misuse of the CAA's monopoly position. As a result, the Minister will retain the formal power to disallow charges and be given the power to set replacement charges. While I commend the honourable member for Fadden for his current position with regard to the Prices Surveillance Authority, it is perhaps illustrative of the contradictions within the economic policy of the Opposition that prior to the election it was advocating the abolition of the Prices Surveillance Authority. Now it is saying that it has a very important role to play in monitoring charges of government business enterprises such as the CAA. The honourable member for Fadden bemoaned the losses to the Federal Airports Corporation (F AC) and the CAA that resulted from the pilots dispute. That leaves me somewhat amazed, as he was, among other people, probably the person in this House who was most responsible for the prolonging of that dispute. For him to now say that he is concerned about the losses incurred by the Civil Aviation Authority and the FAC is somewhat amusing, to say the least. In addition, both he and the honourable member for Bass strongly advocated the privatisation of the FAC. The honourable member for Fadden said that he saw a variety of options, ranging from full to partial privatisation of parts of that organisation. The honourable member for Bass provided almost total support for the concept of privatisation, as one would expect, having regard to his current position as shadow Minister. But the honourable member for Bass indicated that he recognised that the Government's decisions in relation to the FAC in this instance and also the CAA enhanced accountability, allowed greater flexibility and provided an increased capacity for borrowings, and he welcomed the movement towards corporatisation. The difficulty, however, is that both honourable member for Fadden and the honourable member for Bass have advocated quite strongly that the FAC should be privatised. What they did not say, although it was implicit in what they said, was that they wanted to privatise the profitable components of the FAC. That is something that I do not think we can countenance. If one looks at the structure of the FAC one will see that a large number of the airports for which it is responsible are at present loss making enterprises. I refer particularly to Darwin Airport on which the FAC is currently spending about $45m. What would happen to airports such as Darwin if the F AC were to sell, as was advocated by the honourable member for Bass, the profitable airports such as those路 in Sydney, Cairns and Melbourne? One can only wonder. What I think would happen and what has been alleged will happen would be an increase in charges to the users of Darwin Airport and it is likely that the sort of developments which are taking place in Darwin and other airports of that type would not proceed. That is a matter of concern because inherent in the argument being put by the Opposition about privatisation is that the only way to get micro-economic reform in this country is to privatise. I do not believe that argument is sustainable. It is certainly true that in some areas there is a need for dramatic reform in the structure of these organisations. That is what the Government has done in the case of both theFAC and the Civil Aviation Authority. It is not necessary to privatise to deal with micro-economic reform and to improve enterprise efficiency. I will conclude on that point and allow my colleague to make some remarks.",98
132,Mr COWAN,CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL,"1 thank the honourable member for the Northern Territory(Mr Snowdon) for allowing me the time to speak on a few aspects of the Bills before the House-the Federal Airports Corporation Amendment Bill 1990 and the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1990. I would like to have referred to a broad range of aspects, but time will not permit me to do so. Naturally, we in the Oppothe sition welcome the legislation. Of course, we point out the problems, but it means that the corporations will become business enterprises which, in turn, must breed efficiency, as will the removal of some of the controls that are presently in operation, although aviation safety aspects must be kept in mind all the time. As the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) said, the main question is this: .Can the Federal Airports Corporation eventually be a profitable organisation? That is the challenge facing it. There is a big job ahead of it. I was impressed by the remarks that the honourable member made concerning Manchester Airport. I think there is an opportunity, with the flexibility that will be available to the Corporation, for it to draw on a certain amount of imagination and business expertise. Whilst it has been said during the debate that the Board of the Corporation should comprise people with airline knowledge, at the same time those people must have business knowledge so that the Corporation can expand. A couple of points worry me. One is the fact that the Airports Corporation, after deregulation-or even prior to deregulation-will provide for competition from the smaller airlines throughout Australia, particularly the intrastate ones. lines such as Australian Airlines and Eastern Australia Airlines are united and therefore the facilities for them are already in place. The same can be said about Ansett Airlines of Australia and East-West Airlines. They are already set up to deal with the demands and expansion of the services. I hope that the areas will be available to any other competitor who wishes to come in on those airline routes. As I have done on numerous occasions over the years, 1 again call upon the Government to do something about Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) airport. The situation there amazes me. I travel on Eastern Airlines consistently and on Australian Airlines Ltd flights and I am delayed repeatedly. This is a cost to the traveller. For goodness sake, we ask the Government whether it can do something about getting its environmental study completed. I understand that it was to have been completed some time ago. I thought that it might have been held over because of the 24 March election. The fact of the matter is that it is time that we had that environmental study and the Government carried out its assurance that it will proceed with a third runway at Sydney airport. It is essential that that occur because Sydney is being by-passed. Not only am I concerned about the runway but I am also concerned about the air traffic controllers. We have had the air strike and we have seen the situationwhilst I have not seen the figures-where landings and take-offs were fewer at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) airport during that period. Continually during the strike, flights were delayed and cancelled to the inconvenience of the traveller, particularly those who were travelling intrastate. I could stand here for quite some time and give reasons why the Government has to proceed with this project at that airport including for the sake of Australia and of the tourist industry as the honourable member for Fadden has talked so much about in this chamber over months gone by. We need Sydney airport brought up to date. I understand that the runway will not be started soon. It will be some Airyears, we are told, before it will be completed. Let us look at what the hold-ups will cost the nation during that time. I call upon the Government-I suppose it would be the Civil Aviation Authority-to closely examine the situation concerning the air traffic controllers to see that they have enough equipment to enable them to work efficiently to overcome some of those delays and problems at the airport. I am pleased to have had the opportunity of saying a few words to support the legislation and to impress upon those listening the fact that the third runway must be commenced as soon as possible.

133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Mr Nehl)I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1990 concurrently with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1990, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1990. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",101
134,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, I begin by congratulating you on your election to the office of Depextensively uty Chairman of Committees and, therefore, Deputy Speaker in this context. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1990 is a Bill incorporating measures which were left over from one introduced and debated in the Thirty-fifth Parliament. The Bill brings forward the remittance of certain group tax deductions among other things. Legislated adjustments to procedure involving the quarterly payment of provisional tax in the 1989 version of this Bill have been abandoned for the tax year 1989-90. These arrangements were an announced Budget measure. In practice the failure of the Government to have its 1989 Bill passed and in place has led to avoidable costs and inconvenience to taxpayers and their agents. The same failure has placed the Commissioner of Taxation in the awkward position of being forced to amend provisional tax assessments in many cases because he wrongly assumed that the legislation would be passed by the Parliament as a matter of course within a period which in the event proved路 unattainable. The Commissioner was caught short by wrongly assuming that this Parliament would always rubber stamp legislation put forward by the Executive. There should be a chastening lesson both the Commissioner and the Government flowing from that experience. Surprisingly, or perhaps not so surprisingly, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean), made no reference to these matters during his second reading speech. law. Ironically, provisional taxpayers received an unexpected break because the uplift factor and the Medicare element had to be taken out of the earlier assessments the Commissioner had wrongly issued before having legislative authority. The comparable measures are now included in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1990. If time is available I might refer to that briefly when I talk about that particular Bill. The Senate sought to amend the 1989 predecessor of this Bill to exempt public benevolent institutions from the early remittance provisions for reasons which are set out in both the Senate and House of Representatives Hansard records of that debate. The relevant amendment was three times adopted by the Senate and twice rejected by the House. Given that the Government has remained intransigent and benevolent institutions have had time to get their financial arrangements in order, we propose to leave that matter there. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990 proposes an omnibus series of amendments covering many of the proposals announced in the 1989-90 Budget. Generally, the proposals take highly technical legislative form. The amendments are also cumbersome and in some areas contrary to concessional practice and in others do not go far enough. A couple of amendments we intend to propose to the capital gains tax component of this Bill have attracted the coalition's special attention. In clause 23 it is intended to overcome a present weakness in section 160zp which enables a group of companies to transfer a IdSS from one of its members to what is known as a capital gain company in the group and sell the capital loss company to reap a double tax benefit. By placing a time limit of more than three years on for the tax effective disposal of such loss companies, such schemes should be defeated. At the same time legitimate transfers will be facilitated without the impractical consequences which would have ensued if last year's Bill had become Clause 31 sets out to amend section 160zzo in a way which leaves it unsympathetic to the often stated, but largely yet to be observed by this Gov,ernment, need for restructuring within industry. On the one hand restructuring is advocated as desirable and on the other obstacles are too often put in the way of that desirable process at the company level. Companies struggling to reorganise or to restructure will be largely disincentived from doing so by proposed section 160zzo. These amendments are cumbersome and conflict with accepted and acceptable commercial practice. If left as proposed interlocking investments between group companies, which are costly, inconvenient or unwarranted, will be required. To help the Government out once again and to avoid even more unintended consequences of its capital gains tax legislation, the coalition is suggesting a form of words which will obviate the need to render impracticable in many cases the inter-group transfers of assets attracting roll-over lief. Our amendments will give greater flexibility to restructure and still eliminate the offsetting loopholes. Our wording is offered in the spirit set out by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and as a practical and constructive way of not obstructing inter-group net assets transfers but eliminating the avoidance possibilities. There are at least a dozen other amendments in this Bill of a comparatively minor type dealing with capital gains taxes that will have to be examined, I am afraid, during the Committee stage in the Senate. The fact that it cannot be done in this chamber is both a matter of regret and sad testimony to the Government's attitude towards the House. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill also proposes to relax a number of tests dealing with exemption from capital gains tax involving principal places of residence. Of the eleven new exemptions the one which reduces the acceptance period of ownership from one year to three months is the most notable and I think the most acceptable. They are, however, all welcome albeit further examples of the need to redress more of those infamous unintended consequences. Once again, however, the opportunity has been lost to confer exemption from capital gains tax on the gains from the sale of a principal place of residence when a transfer in employment prevents the owner from occupying his or her dwelling for the mandatory three month period. Apart from the seeming injustice the amendment has the undesirable, but not after all these years the unintended, consequence of militating against a truly mobile work force. One could be forgi ven for thinking that a mobile work force is also an essential element in the stated objective to restructure industry. Clause 14 in the Bill sets out to fundamentally change the definition in the principal Act which describes what constitutes a disposal or acquisition by amending section 160M (7). Now 160M (7) along with 160M (6) has been described by a Queens Counsel as re- the terrible twins in that they create an artificial concept of disposal. The measure in the Bill acknowledges that section 160M (7) applies to the assets which have been acquired before September 1985. The House should be aware that section 160- (7) is expressed to be subject to the other provisions of that part. In particular the capital gains provisions were never meant to apply to assets acquired before 20 September 1985, and if confirmation of that is required I refer interested parties to section 160L. The explanatory memorandum which accompanied the introduction of 160M (7) contained no suggestion that the section would apply to assets acquired before 20 September 1985. It seems the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is now trying to do by stealth what he did not have the gumption to do publicly some years ago. Proposed section 160ZD (2A) will create a problem with put and call options. Frequently, such options are separate contracts. Where a call option is exercised against a person, the put option would lapse. A capital gain arises then in the ordinary way when a physical asset is transferred pursuant to a call being exercised. Proposed section 160ZD will cause a quite separate gain to arise on the lapsing of a put option. It is not necessarily the case that the put option will have a nil market value. Unfortunately, lack of available time prevents me from giving a specific example to illustrate my concern. It must suffice to observe that lapses of farm-ins options and possibly the proceeds of claims under insurance policies for destroyed assets can lead to tax being levied on what can be described only as hypothetical gains. It is surely time to get to basics and stop taxing fictitious profits and income. I refer now to section 160zzo (1) (ac) which restricts roll-overs to assets where their market value is not less than the reduced cost base. This clearly works against companies that own wasting assets such as miners and high technology companies. There is no basis for the discrimination. Section 160zZ0A is supposed to cover the situation of the distribution of assets in specie. It has the same difficulty of requiring the market value of the asset to be not less than the reduced cost base as highlighted in section 160zzo. Beyond that, and our amendment, to which I have already referred, section 160zZ0A is at least a concession which we should be grateful for. In part, it overcomes the problems of double taxation of the quite separate disposals that have taken place when an asset is otherwise distributed in specie on liquidation, being the disposal of the asset by the company and the disposal of the shares by the shareholder. That particular difficulty is not covered by section 160zZA (4) although there are people, including some at the Taxation Office, who at times believe the problem is covered. What we do need is a mirror section of 160zZ0A dealing with trusts and the distribution of assets in specie to beneficiaries, but that has not yet been forthcoming. Again, one wonders at the commerciality of these provisions. The State taxation offices, which, believe it or not, are far more aggressive than the Australian Taxation Office, will permit distributions of assets in specie from trusts without stamp duty where appropriate facts are present. The Australian Taxation Office does not follow this approach, even though it is quite content to 'look through the structures' for sections like 160zzs. The House will understand the difficulties in explaining to foreign investors the different tax regimes and the lack of coherence in objectives. It is possible for the Federal counterparts to talk to State .taxation offices and ensure that relief is consistent under all relevant statutes, but that back degree of cooperation seems extremely unlikely. The Bill also sets out to tackle doubledipping arrangements by dual rysident investment companies. In the event, we have another example of a press release by the Treasurer, issued as long ago as 1986, announcing a measure which is at odds with the wording of the amendments now proposed. For example, the actual business test will not match that indicated in the press release. The substantive purpose test suffers from the same defect and on the surface, at least, also seems restrictive. Still talking about the same Bill, we come to the proposal to insert section 73B (27 A) and deductions allowed for eligible research and development activities. It is now intended that any income received as a result of these activities is to become assessable income. The rate of deduction of expenditure on core technology is limited. All assessable income from all receipts from granting access to, or the right to use, the results of a research and development project, where expenditure on the project has been allowed as a deduction, is included. In plain language, research cannot be sold for more than the grant given without any excess being taxed in future. The treatment of research and development technology is not consistent with current practices, which generally treat intellectual property as a capital asset and, as such, are subject to part IlIA of the Act-that is, the capital gains provision. The effect of the amendments, when included in the Act, will be to deny the vendor of research results any of the benefits of the indexed cost base provisions provided by part IlIA of the Act, following the sale of eligible assets. I turn now to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2). This also is an omnibus Bill, an exposure draft of which was released early this year, and it is also intended to implement a number of Budget measures. The wide range of measures include, but are not limited to, improving access to tax rebates for social security beneficiaries; removing anomalies in relation to the Medicare levy; removing the tax exemption currently enjoyed by the Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd; extending existing concessional tax treatment to the voluntary disposal of livestock because of chemical contamination; exempting from sales tax imported uncut precious and semi-precious gemstones and imported coins which are legal tender in another country; and removing a technical requirement for investment funds to be deposited in the Australian Film Industry Trust Fund in order to attract tax concessions for capital investment in that industry. Matters of more immediate interest include the rather ponderous and cumbersome provisions aimed exclusively at the quarrying industry. Again, the time allowed for this debate precludes the possibility of going into great detail. The question which logically arises is: why cannot the quarrying provisions in the principal Act become part of the mainstream mining provisions, as will be the case with gold mining? In considering that part of the Bill which deals with the practice of scrip lending, we are faced with the ludicrous situation created by the Treasurer that, as he has indicated, further but as yet unknown changes are already in the pipeline. We are dealing with a measure which is going to be amended in the very near future and I recommend to all concerned that it is amended in the near future. The practice of scrip lending had existed on Australian and overseas stock exchanges. for many years, and is important in the functioning of them. The proposed legislation seeks to overcome perceived problems relating to the capital gains tax; However, the measures proposed-such as prescribing disqualifying events such as dividends or rights issues occurring during a borrowing period, or lending scrip for more than three months-make scrip lending impractical. Moreover, a capital gains tax arises when the loan is returned after the books close for dividends, rights and entitlements, despite the amendment. Thus, it appears that the Government's intention to facilitate the practice of scrip lending is prevented by the two previously mentioned anti-avoidance areas. In other words, we believe the Government is not going to achieve what it sets out to do for the reasons I have given. There is also an anomaly in that scrip lending from offshore can still occur. There is also provision in the Bill for measures designed to discourage the practice of companies giving shareholders a choice of accepting streamed .or selected dividends. An anti-avoidance mechanism involves the establishment of franking debits. A franking deficit at the end of a franking year will require a company to pay a franking deficit tax. There is a new one, Mr Deputy Speaker, It is not certain that these proposals will completely eliminate the perceived problem. For example, there remains a limited possibility for some companies in some circumstances continuing a dividend streaming operation through the issue of special shares where the recipient has no power to vary a special right attaching to those shares. Elsewhere in the Bill the period over which losses can be carried forward is modified. Generally, business losses can be carried forward now for seven years. If they have not been recouped by the end of seven years, they lapse. The Bill proposes allowing unlimited carry forward of such losses incurred in 1989-90 and subsequent years. While this proposal is welcome, it would be better, it seems to us, if it was to extend also to losses incurred prior to 1989-90 to bring it into line with primary production losses and capital losses, for which unlimited carry forward is currently allowed. Another welcome change in the Bill that which will exempt clubs which facilister itate participation in any sport or game from income tax. Apart from the intrinsic fairness of the measure, it will relieve honourable members of the need to make constant representations to. the Treasurer calling for exemption. The Minister for ence. Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is at the table, has not had that pleasure but I can assure him, if he had been here, he would have had it. I venture to suggest that no member has been exempted from making such representations in the recent past. Currently, non-profit' clubs engage in athletic sports or games in which human beings are the sole participants are exempt from income tax. The Bill proformance poses to extend this exemption to any impedes sport or game. In addition, non-profit community sults service organisations such as Lions, tary and ,the Country Women's AssociaAs tion are to be granted exemption. This measure recognises the important service that these organisations provide community at large, but I am glad to say that political or lobbying bodies do not constitute qualify. This Bill is a welcome, if belated, development. Included in the Taxation Laws Amendby ment Bill (No.3) are numerous miscellafunctions, neous measures which are, for the most part, technical in nature. In part, I back to where I started in that the of calculating a taxpayer's provisional liability, which appeared in last lapsed Bill, is spelt out, but this tithe for the year 1990-91. Lifting the threshold $8,000 before quarterly provisional tax instalments must be made is again proilege posed. Our views remain much the same as when the 1989 version of this Bill was defeated. After the dinner break I intend to circulate an amendment. It might suit the convenience of the Chair to suspend the sitting for dinner at this stage. Debate interrupted. NA",101

The well known statement in May's Parliamentary Pracwhich tice on contempt in general is: . . . any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament in the perof its functions, or which obstructs or any member or officer of such House in the discharge of his duty, or which has a tend'ency, directly or indirectly, to produce such remay, be treated as a contempt even though Rothere is no precedent of the offence. against this, regard must now be had to the requirements of section 4 of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Privileges to the Act 1987, which provides: Conduct (including the use of words) does not an offence against a House unless it amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise a House or committee of its authority or or with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member. come There are relevant precedents, as the method honourable member mentioned this tax morning, although in each case preceyear's dence was not given to a motion. My consideration of the information to before me has led me to the conclusion that a prima facie case of breach of privor contempt, such as would cause me to accord precedence to a motion in respect of the matter, has not been made out. I believe this view is consistent with the positions taken previously and the belief that the Parliament's penal jurisdiction should be exercised sparingly. I would add that, aside from the question of privilege, this incident, as the honourable member for Menzies stated, is that should be of concern to all members. The unauthorised disclosure of correspondence between members and about entitlements or other matters is to be deprecated in principle, quite apart from the particular circumstances of any case. If members are to have confidence in the system for the provision of support services they must be able to feel that the confidentiality formation about individual members, and their staff, will be respected. I hope that these remarks will be noted in all departments and offices concerned with these matters.",105
136,Unknown,PRIVILEGE,Sitting suspended from 6.32 to 8 p.m. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 [COGNATE BILLS: NA BILL 1990 NA BILL (NO.2) 1990 NA BILL (NO.3) 1990] Second Reading Debate resumed.,106
137,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Before the suSl1ension of the sitting for dinner I indicated that we hoped to be in a position to move some amendments. Because they are copious, to say the least, and because the guillotine is on-we have already registered our protestations about this numerous times today-the paperwork involved has not been possible. But I want to explain, particularly for the venience of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is at the table, what motivates us to move amendments which will be articulated and spelt out in the usual way in the Senate. So this might take the form of some sort of advance notice. The amendments we propose to move relate to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1990. The coalition is of the view that measures are required to close off avenues for avoidance in areas where assets could be sold outside the group free of capital gains taxes and where doubtful deductions for losses could also be obtained. However, the Government's remedies proposed in clauses 23 and 31 are so cumbersome as to seriously frustrate legitimate transactions, that is, the requirement of the issuing of new shares between group companies as consideration for the transfer of assets within a group. The concern we have is that the conseof inquences are uncommercial and produce consequences that are well beyond the mere remedying of existing defects. They go much too far. They will operate to deny, or at best make it extremely difficult, for group companies to obtain protection from the capital gains tax in circumstances where it is generally agreed that capital gains tax ought not to apply. Accordingly, the coalition will propose in the Senate two amendments in substitution for clauses 23 and 31. The coalition's amendments in the Senate will prevent avoidance opportunities while protecting, we sincerely believe, legitimate transactions. Furthermore, this Bill proposes to relax a number路 of tests to be applied to the principal residence exemption. A total of 11 exemptions are given, with the principal issue being the reduction of the period of residence from one year to three months. I touched on this earlier; nevertheless, there would remain under the proposals before the House situations where taxpayers are denied the principal residence exemption. To highlight this inadequacy, the coalition proposes in the Senate an additional amendment to grant exemption where a taxpayer has to shift conemployment before the residence can be occupied for the three months mandatory period. This amendment will remove a disincentive to a mobile work force where, in the circumstances mentioned, persons are penalised for making their talents available when or where the need arises. I, along with other members on this side of the House, deplore the situation where we have to debate and discussgiven the goodwill we would expect to be able to discuss it intelligently-four tax Bills of supreme complexity. I know the Minister at the table would understand what I mean. They are supremely complex. Yet here we are in this House discussing under the guillotine four measures with copious measures in each and with no ability to explain our total reasons, to go into examples or to provide the proposed alternatives to the Government's proposals in each case. It is a preposterous situation where taxation can be legislated for in this way. Only those in the profession will understand the extent of this denigration of the processes of the House of Representatives as a legislative chamber. They will, but unfortunately the public at large will not and that is to be regretted. I think, and I might not have this quite right, that there are under discussion in this chamber for about one and a half hours about 500 pages, compnsmg amendments and new legislation, explanatory memoranda and second reading speeches. We certainly deserve the verdict of the people when they vote as they did at the last election in a way which indicates a plague on both Houses. Let me say to the Minister and to the House that the amendments we intend to propose are intended to make the legislation better. They are intended to preserve the intention of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and to make it work.",106
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,107
139,Dr CHARLESWORTH,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Perth) (8.05)I must say that I share some of the concern of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) who would appreciate having more time to discuss this legislation. Four Bills-the Income Tax Assessment . Amendment Bill 1990, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1990, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1990-are being discussed cognately and a large number of issues are canvassed within those Bills. It is very unfortunate that, because of the election campaign and the events over the last few months, some of this legislation, which had previously been discussed in this place, lapsed. That is the reason that some of these Bills had to be re-presented. The interesting thing about the contribution of honourable member for Curtin was that he spent a large amount of his time talking about the capital gains tax. Only a couple of months ago in the Federal election campaign this was a seminal issue. One has to look back only five or six years ago in the history of this country to understand that we did not have a capital gains tax until then. Members of the public and members of this House need to understand very clearly what that meant. Workers on yearly incomes路 of $25,000 in any number of different occupations, paid weekly, fortnightly or monthly, had a certain amount of tax taken out of their income. That tax was paid to the Commonwealth. These taxes are used to build schools, to build roads, to provide a health care system, social security benefits, unemployment benefits and all of the many things that make up our civilised society. The wage earner on $25,000 a year had to pay tax on that $25,000 that he earned in anyone year. The significant difference between our philosophy and the philosophy of the coalition is that under coalition governments somebody who in the same period of time; in the same financial year, chose to sell a package of shares or a property which that person had an interest in could earn $25,000 with no tax liability whatsoever. Such a person may have been earning income from another profession or whatever but by merely selling the package of shares that person could make a capital gain of $25,000 that year with no tax liability. But the wage and salary earner has to pay his fair share of tax every week. That is the fundamental difference and, as I said, it was a seminal issue in the election campaign. The honourable member for Curtin has foreshadowed amendments which he suggests will improve the capital gains tax legislation. It is interesting to note how far the Opposition has moved on this issue in such a short time. Indeed, the Opposition's concern about the principal residence exemption is one that many have people may share. I would think that if one were looking at making hard decisions in taxation-I am not advocating this, but it needs to be considered-maybe one would be looking at a capital gains tax on the principal residence. That would be the sort of hard decision that someone may contemplate to improve the fairness of our taxation system. Perhaps there would be honourable members on this side of the House who would support that. But the suggestion that we should provide some sort of an opportunity for people to wriggle out of it, or the suggestion of the speculative gains tax that we saw the Opposition go to the election campaign with, is something that is a complete anathema to us. In talking about taxation policy, it is also interesting to note the backflip that the Opposition did on the consumption tax. It went through the election campaign only a matter of months ago vehemently opposing such a proposal, while now it is something that is being put forward. Mr Rocher-I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Given what has been said so far, both by the Minister in his second reading speech and me in addressing, strictly, the legislation, I fail to see relevance remarks on the consumption tax have to this debate. I would ask you to direct the honourable member for Perth accordingly.",107
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I understand the honourable member for Perth to be referring to the consumption tax in the context of tax options and, of course, section 26AAA and subsequent sections are mentioned in this legislation. I understand his remarks to be in that context, but I know that the honourable member for Perth will be directing his comments to the main legislation. Mr Rocher-Could I speak to that, Mr Deputy Speaker?",108
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,There is no need to debate the matter. Mr Rocher-I will not debate it. I simply remind you that section 26AAA has not been mentioned in either speech.,108
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am talking not about the speeches but about the legislation, I should remind the honourable member. Mr Rocher-I respectfully remind you, that it is not mentioned in the legislation, either.",108
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Well, that is for the Chair to decide; the Chair has just been reading the legislation. I call the honourable member for Perth.",108
144,Dr CHARLESWORTH,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I understand the concerns of the honourable member opposite, because the capital gains tax is a very sensitive issue for the Opposition and, indeed, the consumption tax is also a very sensitive issue. The only reason I mentioned it is because I am suggesting that the consumption tax is part of the program of broadening the base. Our capital gains tax proposals were part of a base broadening philosophy which we developed and, indeed, it is part of that proposal. There are, of course, a number of other pieces of legislation, and indeed the honourable member's concentration on the capital gains tax relates to only part of it. what Within the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) there is provision for pensioner and beneficiary rebates. Indeed, the increase in those rebates, which is part of this legislation, is something that is very important to retired people and to the people in our society who are beneficiaries. Indeed, the combined non-pension income of $70 will now have no tax liability attached to it. It is part of the Government's proposal that by 1995 no beneficiary of a pension will have any tax liability. It is a proposal that we have set down. We have to achieve it incrementally. It cannot be achieved immediately. It must be achieved incrementally, but we have set down the framework. Pensioners in my electorate and in this country understand that. They also understand that the pension now represents, according to comparative studies, a higher amount of income than it ever has for the past 40 years. That is a significant achievement of this Government. The pension as a percentage of average weekly earnings now represents for pensioners a higher amount that it has for 40 years ih this country. On top of that, the increased rebate and the increased ability for them to not have a tax liability is something that pensioners see as important. That is an important aspect of the legislation. There are also tax exemptions for nonprofit promoting organisations which are involved in community services and sport. This is something that was heavily lobbied. When it was announced in the Budget last year it was very well received in the community. In the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) we find new measures relating to the tax file number. Indeed, when one considers the tax file number and the way in which it was introduced and the debate that went on before that, we see the tax file number as being something that tightens fairness and equity in the taxation system. It is a measure that we introduced because we believed that the system was in need of that. We also find changes to the provisional tax quarterly payments provisions and, indeed, the threshold for exemptions for people who have to pay provisional tax is now $8,000. That means that, for those people who previously had a provisional tax liability and who had to pay on a quarterly basis, they will no longer have to pay on a quarterly basis and this involves 134,000 Australians. I have no doubt that those people in my electorate who have previously lobbied me about this issue will be pleased that the exemption has in fact been increased. Some 45,000 of those 130,000 people who no longer have to pay on a quarterly basis are retired persons, elderly persons over 60 years of age. Indeed, the requirement to pay on a quarterly basis was something that they found most disturbing. I am sure that they will be particularly pleased with the changes in that part of the Bill. I do not wish to take up any more time of the House, because I understand that there are other honourable members who wish to speak in the limited time that we have available, but I will say that it would be lovely if we could come into this place and talk about sensible taxation measures that have made the system fairer and more equitable, with some degree of bipartisanship. I believe that on most of these issues we are in accord, but there is a certain amount of nitpicking going on in relation to the aspects of a capital gains tax. I understand the Opposition's sensitivity to that, but it is that nitpicking that causes us some grief and, indeed, it continues the belief in the minds of the public that the Opposition is good at spoiling but very bad at producing positive results.",108
145,Mr TAYLOR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"At the outset can I say that I unreservedly support everything that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) said in relation to the scandalous behaviour of the Government in the guillotine process. There is no other word for it. It is scandalous, and I accept nothing of what the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) said in refuting our views on that point. I want to refer to one or two points that the honourable member for Curtin made earlier in this place. I remind the House that the first thing he referred to was the very large legislative and administrative delays caused by the Hawke Government, particularly when it comes to taxation and superannuation matters. That in itself poses very substantial problems of uncertainty, not only for individuals and companies but also for the tax professionals. I think that is a very important point that was made well by the honourable member. Secondly, the honourable member for Curtin strongly put the view that there is a proliferation of legislation being put forward by press release. Clearly, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is one of the worse offenders when it comes to that sort of an approach to matters in this House. For example, what happened in the superannuation area? It took over a year for the legislation to come into this place, and what do we have? We saw earlier in this place the minefield that clearly remains. This is a point that was brought out very strongly by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). Thirdly, I refer to the comment of the honourable member for Curtin in this debate about the importance of tax exemption for nonprofit community service bodies. We should all welcome that, and I congratulate the Government on taking that sort of approach to those particular bodies. I now refer to a specific reference in the second reading speech made by the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean) on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2). I refer to the Hansard of 9 May, page 187. Under the heading 'Qifts', in part he said: Gifts made after 9 November 1989 to nonprofit companies that conduct life education programs in association with the Life Education Centre will also qualify for deduction. He went on to say: There will be no revenue consequences of this as the company is currently treated as a public benevolent institution under the gift provisions. One may say that that is very unexcep"" tional and that indeed, it is welcomed .. I would like to draw the attention of the House to alittle of the background to that attitude of the Treasurer and his Minister assisting. I go back almost two years-18 months ago-to some activity going on behind the scenes' involving me as the member for Groom,' the previous honourable member for Fairfax and the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). For the information of the Minister for Science and Technology, who is at .the table, in July of that .year I received a letter from a constituent which said, in part: We have just learnt that the Commissioner of Taxation has ruled that donations to support the activities of Mobile Life Education Centres throughout Australia no 1011ger qualify for income tax deductions under subparagraph 78 (1) (a) (ii) qf the Income Tax Assessment Act. These centres exist due to public demand for specialised educational programs to prepare our children to resist drug abuse and so build a happier and healthier Australia. The whole purpose of the centres is to prevent drug abuse rather than to spend scarce resources on the very lengthy and costly process of rehabilitation. Ironically, funds spent after a drug problem has been created are still tax deductible. The ruling of the Tax Commissioner goes against the well accepted fact that 'prevention is better than cure'. It goes on to say that: the rest of the funds necessary to educate and help our children to resist drug abuse comes from the people of Queensland, who, until this ruling, had some taxation relief for their urgently needed donations. As a result of that letter, I wrote to the Treasurer in August i 988. On 19 September I received a reply from Mr Morris, the predecessor of the' Minister sitting at the table as the Minister Assisting the Treasurer. In that letter he stated, in part: The Commissioner of Taxation confirmed that for donations to mobile life education centres to be deductible, it is necessary that the latter meet the description of a public benevolent institution. Although the phrase public benevolent institution does not have a statutory definition, it is generally understood to be an institution for the relief of poverty, sickness, suffering, distress, destitution, misfortune and helplessness. Public benevolent institutions have, as a common feature, the giving of relief freely to those who are in need of it and . are unable to care for themselves . . . Consequently, the Commissioner concluded by saying that gifts to such centres do not qualify for deduction under the existing provisions of the Act. Asa result of that, I wrote back to Minister Morris in October 1988 expressing my disappointment and concern at the seemingly overly legalistic approach. In fact, it was raised in this place at Question Time later in October 1988. Both the Treasurer and the Minister Assisting the Treasurer gave some assurances that the matter would be reconsidered. We then had deathly silence for over a year until 6 December, until the Treasurer put out a press release headed 'Deductability of Gifts to the Life Education Centre'. He said: The Government has decided to amend the income tax law to allow deductions for gifts to the value of $2 or more made on or after 10 November 1989 to the Life Education Centre. The Life Education Centre plays an extremely important role in educating young Australians about the dangers of drug abuse. The Government is proud to be associated with the objectives of the Centre. Legislation to give effect to the Government's decision will be introduced as soon as practicable. This re-emphasises, once again, legislation by press release-an approach that the honourable member for Curtin referred to earlier. I notice that the date on that press release is 6 December 1989. I know that an election was looming at that stage. I have to conclude, as I am sure many others would, that it was political opportunism, not genuine concern by the Treasurer for the real needs of those life education centres, which motivated him. I draw the attention of the House to the background to that ruling by him. I think there is more to it than meets the eye. I now move on to the matter of Australian Taxation Office reforms and the need for a simpler tax law. With the indulgence of the House, I will quote from an article by Michael Bannon in the Canberra Times about a month ago. He said: Over the past 10 years, the income tax law has become extremely 'complex. As a result it is not unusual to be given different answers as well experienced, qualified, tax practitioners and even the Australian Taxation Office give an interpretation of the law to a particular transaction or event. This situation is not ideal and creates more than a little anxiety for practitioners and taxpayers. The law must become simpler to ensure that it does not become a disincentive for investment and the growth of our economy. This fact has been recognised in a report by MCKinsey and Company published last week and made publicly available by the Commissioner of Taxation, Trevor Boucher. On 4 April, Tim Dodd, in the Australian Financial Review, said: The report . . . identifies major problems in the unnecessary complication of tax law, the tax office's delivery of service and its relations with large companies and tax agents. He suggests that the Treasurer sees it as a blueprint for overhauling the operations of the Tax Office, and that the Treasurer believes that the Taxation Office will complete the tax reform process he began in 1985. Further on he said: Mr Keating regards the report as the basis for the final stage of his sweeping tax reforms which began in 1985. The reforms, up until now, have concentrated on the structure of taxation, and he regards those as complete. But Mr Keating believes that the finishing touch to the process will be to improve the efficiency of tax administration and compliance. The report calls for a more rapid transition to complete self-assessment of all tax returns, including personal returns, to relieve the tax of much of the repetitive processing workload and free more resources for assisting taxpayers with queries and conducting selective audits. ' A few weeks later Tim Dodd again suggested that the objectives of this new round of tax reform are markedly different from those of the past five years. He said: In the theory of taxation three aims-equity neutrality and simplicity-are spelt out as desirable characteristics of the taxation system. The first round of tax reforms were aimed at achieving the first twoin other words, equity and neutralityIt increased equity by plugging many avenues of tax avoidance and reduced the taxation bias between different types of investment to move closer to neutrality. But in its haste to achieve these aims the Government glossed over simplicity, adding yet more layers of complexity to the already very complex Income Tax Assessment Act. That is the very point that the honourable member for Curtin made just a little while ago in this House. Tim Dodd went on to suggest: Now if the pendulum swings back to simplicity, it may require compromises which reduce equity and neutrality. There is no doubt that we need simplification of the tax system, a fact that of course was, recognised by the Treasurer earlier this year in his press release on that very subject. I refer the House, in part, to what he said in February of this year: A modernised and simplified tax system is part of the Government's on-going commitment to reforms which increase our national competitiveness and efficiency . . . Against this background, the Government has decided to build on its achievements of the 1980's by undertaking a major new study of options to reduce uncertainty and complexity within the income tax system and thereby make it simpler for taxpayers and the tax administration. Streamlining processes for individual taxpayers will be a major objective of the review. He added. a very strong qualifier in the context of his press release when he said: I would stress that the review will not be a forum for policy change. Its strict intent is to reduce uncertainty and complexity in existing law and administrative settirigs within the current policy framework. office I would suggest to the house that, in the light of the Treasurer's general attitude, that is a very important point. That sort of attitude, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would suggest, you could compare with the attitude of one or two other commentators on the tax scene, not the least of whom is Professor Brian Arnold of the Canadian National Tax Centre, who, I understand, was involved in advising the Government earlier this year on a number of tax matters. I refer the House to a comment that was reported in the Canberra Times early last month which said that Professor Arnold suggested: Policy formulation should be an integrated process, but in Australia is split up in a way that produces disadvantages and no benefits. The report continued: . . . formulating tax policy involves policy development, technical analysis and statutory drafting, but these three functions are so closely related 'the entire process suffers if they cated to different parts of the government bureaucracy'. Professor Arnold paints a picture where the Treasury's 30 professionals (mostly economists) have little interaction with the 60 members of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) (most with accounting or legal training), who in turn rarely meet with the three Office of Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) drafters who work full-time on tax legislation. He said this lack of integration has serious disadvantages and no countervailing benefits, with the main disadvantages being: Tax policy cannot be developed properly by Treasury without an intimate working knowledge of technical aspects of the existing tax system, but the necessary expertise is in the ATO's Policy and Legislation group and Treasury has no satisfactory w-y of using it. To minimise the inefficiency of liaison between the three groups, Treasury often drafts policy in an excessively detailed way, its officials do not have the expertise to deal with technical aspects' of proposed changes, and spelling out technical details in a policy paper can eliminate better ways of achieving a desired result and obscure the more important issues. Tax legislation can be absurdly complicated, partly because of the Independence of the opc. He finished by saying: Since OPC have no experience with either tax policy or tax administration, they should work closely with and under the supervision of the technical tax policy analysts. I would hope that the Treasurer and the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is at the table and who does not seem to be taking much notice of this debate, would take those points on board in the overall review which, as I understand it, is to be led by the Treasurer's Parliamentary Secretary, Senator McMullan. I wish Senator MCMullan the best of luck in this very important review. In the final couple of minutes available to me this evening I would like to comment about the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Boucher, and the continuing criticisms of the use of his discretionary powers. This has been brought out in the last week or so, again in an article by Tim Dodd in the Australian Financial Review. I can assure the House that Tim Dodd is not paying the member for Groom to make these points, but some of them are are allovery relevant to the debate this evening. He reported in an article on 7 May that Ray Conwell, the partner-in-charge of a tax firm in Victoria and a former colleague of Mr Boucher, commented that Mr Boucher was increasingly using nonstatutory discretionary powers. He said that the growing freedom of action exercised by Mr Boucher made the level of taxation, in his view, one of the least certain matters facing the citizens of this country. He went on to say: About the only thing certain in taxation in Australia today is that just about everyone will have trouble determining how much tax he or she ought to pay. Later in the article Tim Dodd said: Mr Conwell's criticisms are highly significant as until last year he was a senior tax officer in Melbourne. Later he said: Mr Conwell was also concerned at the growth of other discretionary powers specifically awarded to the Tax Commissioner in the tax law: He said the 1915 version of the Income Tax Assessment Act contained only 37 discretionary powers. By 1969 there were over 300, by 1974 nearly 500. Since then this figure had probably doubled, if not trebled. I think that is endemic in the overall complicated nature of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The article concluded: Hiding behind the cloak of discretion can often be an easy way out for a draftsman-",109
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. I might note for  Bergin has joined us in the Serjeant-atArms chair.,112
147,Mr MARTIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"1 was also going路 to say one or two things about Mr Bergin. Nice suit, Phil. Perhaps my tie would go a bit better with it, but never mind. In the very short time. I have left in debate, as it is to conclude at a quarter to nine, I intend to leave some time for my very dear friend on the other side the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards), to make a contribution as well. But very quickly I want to say one or two things. First, what we are doing by introducing this legislation--':and I point out that one of the Bills is being reintroduced, and I will come to that point in a moment-is not resiling for one minute from the fact that the Government, if it identifies that some changes to its legislation, of a technical nature, have become necessary, is prepared to make the changes. The second thing is that we are prepared to consult in the broad community. The honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) made some comments-as is the wont of those on the other side-criticising the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for making legislation by press release. What we endeavour to do is to inform people of the Government's statutory program and its obligations and, in terms of taxation relief that is coming their way, clearly this is something which the Government believes is very important to them and will continue to do so. When the legislation is subsequently introduced there is opportunity for people to participate in the debate and to make some comments on it. I am talking not just about the people who are affected by the legislation, but also about the practitioners, the tax professionals whom the honourable member talked about and who are complaining about all the changes. I point out that they are making a fair dollar out of all the changes that are coming in by keeping abreast of everything that is taking place. The second thing I would say in regard to the contribution of the honourable member for Groom has to do with his comments about the Life Education Centre, bemoaning the fact that it took the Government so long to get around to introducing legislation to provide for donations to that very worthwhile organisation to be tax deductable. It will not have escaped the honourable member's notice that during the course of last year a conthis. siderable number of representations were made to the Treasurer, not only from the Opposition side but also from this side of the House on this very issue, but a little something called the election happened to get in the way for several months and now the legislation is before the House. There are many parts of this legislation that are important and we are debating a number of Bills. The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) in his contribution a little earlier referred to some of those, including the pay as you earn tax changes that have been introduced, the changes affecting pensioners and so on. All of them are here and all of them were announced by this caring Government last year. I would say something to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in respect of the amendments he is proposing to move to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1990. It should not have escaped his attention that this Bill was introduced last year in the previous Parliament and was passed without amendment. What we are seeing now is reams and reams of amendments that have come forward from the honourable member for Curtin-certainly under his name-when in the previous Parliament the Opposition of the day felt it necessary to give it the all clear. The Bills do in fact add fairness and equity and continue the reform of the Australian tax system which has been so necessary and which has been tackled fearlessly by this Government and by this Treasurer in particular.. I commend all of these Bills to the House and I am quite happy to have the honourable member for Berowra make his very important contribution at this stage.",113
148,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"1 thank my friend the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) for these few moments. I shall still use a little time to protest against the time allocated to debate these four Bills of about pages of extreme complexity. It is a PreCrean) posterous situation that in this House, House of Representatives, we get an hour and 20 minutes to debate these Bills. In the few moments available I will refer to only two matters. In the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, one of the variety of issues dealt with is the 150 per cent tax incentive for research and developDevelopment ment. This was a measure that was a key initiative of the Liberal and National ties in the run up to the 1984 election. the then shadow Minister for science technology, I had taken the initiative that regard. It has subsequently been plemented and I believe it is successful. While mentioning that, though, that it is extremely important that the overall economic climate be right, otherEdwards)-Order! wise the thing will in no way work. In Bill before the House there are very plex provisions, the effect of which is to second time. deny the vendor of research results any of the benefits of the indexed cost-based provisions provided by part IlIA of the Act in respect of the sale of eligible assets. I trust that something can be done about that in the Senate by way of or change. The other matter I refer to is in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3), which is a Bill dealing with a whole variety of miscellaneous provisions. I refer to part 4, chapter 11, of the Bill where as an addition to section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act there are nominated three additional bodies as eligible contributions in excess of $2, these contributions路 being tax deductable for the donors. The particular body I refer to there is the Foundation for Development Cooperation Ltd, about which I have some personal knowledge. This is an organisation with a governing body of the highest credentials and with the objective of understanding, promoting and supporting leave-I move: activities to improve the quality and increase the quantity of Australian aid and cooperation with developing coun160zp tries, especially through non-governmental bodies. Private sector aid in quality and quantity is what this is all about. In the second reading speech of the 500 Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr the cost to the revenue of making the contributions to this body tax deductable is noted. I want to take the opportunity to stress that that cost will be well worthwhile. It needs to be appreciated that close to $IOOm is spent annually by Australianbased non-government organisations, quite apart from the Australian International Assistance Bureau's main program of foreign aid expenditure. If this parbody succeeds in bringing about even a 5 As per cent productivity and quality imand provement, there would be a $5m impact in towards improved value or reduced wasimtage, compared with the $500,000 cost to revenue mentioned. I think that is a very I stress important consideration.",113

Because I did not anticipate that this opportunity would arise, I did give my reasons at the conclusion of my speech on in land; the second reading for the amendments I have moved. I do not think there is anything I need to add. I point out that in reference to my foreshadowing of amendments, the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) drew conclusions which seemed strange but seemed to indicate a desire to get away from the clauses of the Bill and make some political points. I simply repeat that, whilst we do not claim perfection in everything we do, and bearing in mind the lack of resources which are available to an Opposition, the amendments we have moved are intended to make the legislation work, plained in both the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum. If they fail on those grounds, that is fine. There are some things we seek to do which take matters beyond the second reading speech, but the amendments are also intended to make the legislation better. I made the point in my speech during the second reading debate that what we proposed was in the spirit of the announcement by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) that we want to make this chamber work better and we want to make the Parliament relevant again. Whilst I am not thin-skinned about the reaction of people such as the honourable member for Perth, I think it is disappointing that this spirit of cooperation, where it is possible, has not permeated through to the back bench. Indeed, in some ways in Question Time it has not even got to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I commit the amendments to the opinion of the committee.",114

In the contribution by the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) he gave some indication that in his view consideration should be given to not exempting the principal place of residence from capital gains tax. I would like to place on record the concern that would exist in a number of quarters on this side of the House, with due respect to my colleague the honourable member for Perth, that that may ever happen. 1 know that it is not the intention of the honourable member for Curtin in his amendments to see that that is the case. Nevertheless, 1 do think it is worth saying in this debate. Amendments negatived.",116

155,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"1 would like to round off the remarks I was making earlier regarding the part of the legislation which amends section 78 ,of the Income Tax Assessment Act by way of nominating certain additional bodies which may receive gifts and contributions which are tax deductable in the hands of the donor. 1 referred in that connection to the Foundation for Development Cooperation Ltd, about which I have some personal knowledge. As I stressed, the governing body of the organisation has the highest credentials. I mentioned its objectives of undertaking, promoting and supporting activities to improve the quality and increase the quantity of Australian aid to and cooper"" ation with developing countries, especially tbrough non-governmental channels-as I said, private sector aid. I mentioned that the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean) said in his second reading speech that the cost to revenue of this body could be of the order of $500,000 annually when the body is up and running and perhaps attracting contributions of the order of $1 m per year. I wanted to stress that that cost to enue would be very well worthwhile. Close to $100m is spent by Australian based non-government organisations annually, quite apart from the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau's main program of foreign aid expenditure. The emphasis of this Foundation's efforts lies in achieving higher standards of accountability, financial viability and economic sustain ability of development projects-not just in providing handouts which are frittered away, but in implementing activities of a permanent character, with high standards of accountability and sustainability, and sponsored by non-government organisations. If the efforts of the Foundation resulted in a 5 per cent productivity or quality improvement, there would be a $5m impact towards impr-)Ved value or reduced wastage in such development assistance. That would be quite apart from efforts to gain interest and support from the private sector in Australia and to broaden the contribution of non-government aid, thus helping to reduce the present excessive reliance on official aid which is directly and wholly financed by the taxpayer.

157,Mr HOWARD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"The measure now before the House relates to the imposition by the Hawke Government of a special tax on a limited number of Australian companies in order to finance and to force a level of training. I start by saying to the House that the aims and objectives of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990, which are to enhance the level of training in Australia, are aims and objectives that the Opposition compl-tely shares in common with the Government. But we have a fundamental problem with the notion that a limited section of the community should be taxed in order to pay for the provision of something which is regarded as a general community benefit. In other words, if the Government thinks it ought to be provided, it ought to have the guts to tax everybody to provide it and not to pick on a section of the community in order to tax for it. Dr Charlesworth-User pays.",117
158,Mr HOWARD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I am very interested that somebody interjected. Is it the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free), the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) or the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) or Jack's son? I. have forgotten what seat the honourable member represents, but I know Jack well. Well may Government members say the user pays. In all sincerity I say to those opposite that the users on this occasion are the entire Australian community. Do not let anybody imagine that the only people who get the benefit of training are the trained and the people who employ the trained people. Everybody benefits from training. If people go into a restaurant and do not get the soup spilt on them, they benefit. If those are consumers whci do not get soup spilt on them, they do not pay anything路 towards the cost of training that waiter. That is my very point. Dr Charlesworth-You are proposing a new tax.",117
159,Mr HOWARD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"No, I am proposing that if the Government really wants to put more money into training, it ought to have the guts to tax everybody. Do not pick on a few thousand isolated companies and ladle them with all the responsibility for paying for it. The honourable member for Perth, or any other honourable member, can shake his head as much as he likes, but I can promise him that this is exactly what this Bill does. We therefore have a fundamental philosophical objection to the notion that if the Government wants something of community benefit it singles out one small section of the community and says, 'You will pay for this even though all of us get the benefit of it. You alone will pay for this'. If Government members carry the analogy through to many other sections of the Australian community, they will have exactly the same problem. At the outset of this debate I want to say that we in the Opposition oppose this measure in principle. We will vote against it. In the other place we will seek to have it referred to a committee. If we are unsuccessful in our opposition at the second reading stage we will move a number of amendments to improve the operation of the Bill and generally to reduce some of the undesirable features of it. I repeat at the outset that there is something fundamentally wrong with a notion that says that if we want to do something for the community as a whole, we single out a small section of the community and say, 'You and you alone will pay for it'. Nobody can deny the value of training and nobody can deny that everybody benefits from well trained people. It is not only the employer, not only the person who has been trained but all of us because we consume their services. Therefore, the Government should tax everybody for it or tax nobody for it. But do not under people any circumstances single out-Dr Charlesworth-You are a big taxer.",118
160,Mr HOWARD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"The honourable member for Perth in his irrepressible style interrupts yet again and says that I am a big taxer. I am simply saying that if the Government wants a big new tax, be fair and be honest and spread it across everybody. Do not single out a few companies and say, 'You are going to pay for it'. This is what this measure does. This measure says that the Government wants some extra money so it will single out a few companies. It will bang them over the head and say, 'You are going to pay for it. You do not have many votes. You are part of the capitalist structure anyway and we are going to dump it all on you'. That is exactly what the honourable member for Perth's mate has done in relation to this and it is exactly what the Government is doing in relation to this. The flaws in this Bill run beyond the in principle objection that we have. We have a great deal of difficulty with a number of the specific provisions in the Bill. To start with, in our view the definition of eligible training is too limited. If one reads the definition of eligible training, one is left with the impression that it may not be wide enough to embrace many areas of commerce. In fact, it may be too heavily orientated to industry. Some on the other side may think that that is a fairly pedantic distinction to draw but it is not, because there is a great deal of one-on-one training and a great deal of training in commerce which is not covered by this Bill. I invite those opposite to ask themselves, for example, whether it is fair and reasonable to impose this burden upon an organisation such as Drake Personnel Ltd-a very well-known company around Australia which operates a service in providing emergency temporary staff. By its very nature, its definition and its very existence it is not an organisation that recruits and employs untrained people. It holds itself out as being ready to fill路the gap. Yet, under this legislation if its over is more than $200,000 a year, it will be路 caught. Does anybody opposite really think that is fair? Honourable members-Yes.",118
161,Mr HOWARD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"Of course, but on what notion? Dr Charlesworth-A little while ago you wanted to widen it.",119
162,Mr HOWARD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"The honourable member interjects that a little while ago I wanted to widen it. Brother, the Government either widens it fully or it does not have it at alL We do not have this arbitrary situation that the Government has chosen. That is what the Government has done. The situation is totally arbitrary. There is no logic at all in saying, 'We are going to tax every company which has a payroll of more than $200,000 irrespective of what it does, irrespective of whether it provides any one-on-one training, irrespective of whether the nature of its business requires it to recruit and to employ untrained people and then to train them'. I used the example of Drake Personnel to illustrate that many companies, by their definition and their very existence, do not recruit untrained people. Government members say that that is perfectly all right. The criterion of the imposition of the burden as far as the Australian Labor Party is concerned is very simply the size of a company's payroll. It does not matter what the company does, what the nature of its staff is, whether the company has to train them, how the company recruits them, what their qualifications are. As far as the Labor Party is concerned if the payroll is $200,000 a year, it belts them over the head and imposes this levy on them. Government members can turn their heads, shake them and do everything they like but it does not alter the simple, unassailable fact that that is the criterion of the imposition of the burden. As I understand it, according to the principles of the Australian Labor Party equity and social justice are very much about the criterion that is imposed and applied to the imposition of a burden. If Government members were saying to turnme, 'Look, we want more money put into training so we are going to ask the whole community to share the burden' that would have far more logic than this Bill. But on this occasion the Government has singled out people in a totally arbitrary fashion and said, 'You're to cop the payment of this Bill'. On fundamental principles of equity and social justice which I have always understood to be very dear to the heart of the Australian Labor Party-whether it is the left wing, the centre left wing or the right wing-they are motions that have been completely and utterly discarded so far .as this particular measure is concerned. It is best illustrated by the example I have given. I invite my friend the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean), who is sitting at the table to explain in his reply-this is on the assumption that the payroll of a company such as Drake Personnel is more than $200,000 a year-how he will justify the imposition of a burden on that company despite the fact that by definition all of the employees of that company must be trained when they get there. Otherwise that organisation has absolutely no reason for existence. I invite those opposite to apply their minds to that as the first of the Opposition's objections. I would also like the Minister, when he replies in this debate, to justify the use of the figure of $200,000 as the cut-off point. Why has $200,000 been chosen? Is $200,000 the figure below which you think you will have excluded sufficient small businesses to relieve the Government of any political heat that might accrue as a result of the imposition of this particular measure? And I can tell by the smiles of those opposite that I think I have hit it in one. I can tell-they are a total giveaway, particularly these new members. They are an absolute giveaway. They are a little unsullied as yet by the practices and the cynicisms of this place. What has happened is that the Government has thought to itself; 'We cannot ask everybody to pay for training because that would be very unpopular. If we ask every business to pay for training that would be incredibly unpopular because it would get us off side with small business so what we will do is choose a fairly generous cut-off point and we will exclude all the genuine ma and pa places and all the genuine one man, one person operations and we will be completely in the clear'. That is basically what the Government-and the honourable member for Perth nods his head-on this particular occasion has done, and it is a very cynical exercise. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), who is the Opposition spokesman on small business, will say on behalf of the small business community of Australia that they are not terribly impressed with this little exercise in cynicism. Dr Charlesworth-Y ou want to lower it?",119
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING GUARANTEE,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member for Perth will restrain his enthusiasm t6 assist. The honourable member for Bennelong and the other members on my right will not be led astray by the honourable member for Perth.,120
164,Mr HOWARD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I think he is doing very well. He is nodding in assent but I appreciate the protection the Chair has provided to me from the marauding interjections of the honourable member for Perth and many of his colleagues. It is a serious point that this Government has quite cynically chosen a $200,000 cut-off point. The fact is that there are many firms below $200,000 that in any fair assessment ought to be required to provide a contribution to training and there are many firms above it that will be providing one-on-one on-thejob training that will not be eligible. That, of course, leads me to one of the major criticisms that we have of the structure of this legislation, and that of course is the definition of eligible training. is a great stress in proposed section 27 of this Bill on the need for formally qualified people, for a formal structure of training and all of the other things that constitute formal training and formal requirements for training. The great problem with that is that it totally ignores the fact that, as all of us in the House know or ought to know from our own work experience, the greatest training that people receive in any form of employment is one-on-one unstructured experience on the job. Absolutely no allowance is made in this Bill for that. I go back to the time when I was an articled clerk working for a firm of solicitors in Sydney in the days when articled clerks existed as a category of people. Do honourable members know what destroyed the articled clerk system? It was the introduction of an award. It was because some zealous minimum wage people came running along and said, 'This is disgraceful. You are employing these people at $10 a week', and that was an overpayment for most of us when we first started to work as articled clerks. I can tell you it was an overpayment for a lot of my Labor Party mates who were articled at the same time. It might well surprise the Minister at the table if I named some of them who were employed under the same system. What of course destroyed that system was the introduction of an award. The point I simply make, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that I learnt far more about the law and the practice of the law through one-on-one instruction while I was being articled to my master solicitor in the early 1960s than I learnt of the practice of the law at the Sydney University Law School. That is not meant in denigration of one of the greatest law schools in this country. It is simply meant as a statement of fact. But I am sad to say that under this Bill the sort of instruction I received on a oneon-one basis and a face-to-face basis from my master solicitor in the 1960s would not qualify as training under this legislation. That is to me a total condemnation of this measure. It is not a condemnation There of the aspiration of the Government to have more training. I am totally in agreement with that. If the Government had and come to us and said, 'Can we work out system of increasing training?' then I we would have been a great deal more sympathetic. I am not unsympathetic to the GovernVery ment's aspiration because I would accept the criticism that there are some firms this country that do not make an adeand quate contribution to training. I accept that and I accept the goals and the objecment tives of the Australian Council of Trade next year. Unions (ACTU) in wanting to have more training. I say to the Minister at the table, who brings to this debate a speciality dint of his background and his previous experience, that I think he has chosen peculiarly arbitrary way of going about that objective. I was asked today by a journalist in, this building as to how I thought we might increase the contribution towards training in the Australian community other than through the devices of this Bill. One way I said we might do it is to break down some of the barriers of mistrust that exist between our tertiary institutions and the whole of commerce and industry in Austhe tralia. Let me say at the outset that I acknowledge that the Government has made a number of steps in this direction. I am not totally condemning everything that Government has done on this particular score, but I believe that the universities and the colleges of this country have long way to go in breaking down some of that mistrust. If there were a greater ingness to allow, if you like, sections commerce and industry to adopt tertiary institutions, to patronise to a greater gree, to sponsor, to support and to entaken'. mesh their activities with the universities and colleges around Australia, I think there would be a greater treno towards voluntary training and voluntary support of training which might render many the things that are proposed in this Bill unnecessary. We are concerned-leaving aside the in-principle objections that the Opposition brings to this Bill-that inadequate lead time has been allowed for employers training institutions to assess training a requirements resulting from the award rethink structuring process which is now under way. We see the 1 July starting date as being in the middle of an academic year. few enrolments are accepted in the middle of an academic year. We believe in that will create a number of difficulties I would ask the Minister very seriously to consider delaying the commencedate of this measure until 1 January I accept that it is government policy to bring the measure in and I gather from by discussions that I have had with the Australian Democrats in another place that a the Government will have their support and that this measure will' become law. We are unhappy about that but we accept the reality of it. Those opposite have the numbers and we have not, and they will put it through. But I ask them to consider delaying its operation until 1 January , 1991. If they are into the business of saying to the employers that are going to be caught by this, that they are trying to increase, in an atmosphere of good will, effort for training then I ask the Government to consider delaying the scheme's application. I repeat the concern that I have that the Bill does not adequately cover many the activities of Australian commerce. We would like to see the legislation broadened to accommodate the different traina ing and educatiol1 needs and prOcesses of the service sector. We would like to rewilldefine 'structured training' to include: of 'training programs normally associated with the competent acquisition of the skill defor which the training is being underI would also like to ask the Government to consider adding the word 'relevant' to the term 'employment related skills' in section 27 (1) to reflect relevance of to the current employer who is funding the training andlor levy-'relevant' to mean related to the business of the employer who is funding the levy or traini'ng. I go back to my example of Drake Personnel. I believe very strongly that it is quite unreasonable for companies of that kind to be caught at all, irrespective of whether their turnover is $200,000 or $200m. I believe that provision should be made in the legislation to exempt employers where their circumstances justify this. Let us examine for a moment why the Government might not agree to this. The only circumstances in which the Government would not agree to this would be because it believes that employers as a class-that is, employers with a payroll of over $200,000-should exclusively be made responsible for the payment of this levy. There can be no other justification for the Government rejecting such an amendment. If, in fact, that is the reason for the Government rejecting that amendment, then the onus is on the Government to justify why it is that employers with a payroll of more than $200,000 should exclusively and alone, as a class, be responsible for this levy. I would be very interested to hear the justification that is advanced by the Minister for Science and Technology, who is at the table. I can understand him saying that employers generally should be responsible for it. I would not agree with it, but I would understand why he might say that. But how he can say it should be employers with a payroll of more than $200,000 is a very interesting exercise in logic chopping. At the end of this debate I would specifically like to hear from the Minister as to why it is that, alone of taxpayers in Australia, employers with a payroll of more than $200,000 should be responsible for this levy even though many of them are in businesses where, by no stretch of the imagination, can it be asserted that their nexus with training is greater than my nexus, the Minister's nexus or the Deputy Speaker's nexus with training. This gets back to my central point. Okay, we are going to tax somebody for training. Why do we not tax everybody and not a limited number of people? If the Government is really fair and into social justice and equity, why does it not tax everybody? I would be very interested to hear the answer that is advanced by the Minister. During the course of the committee stage the Opposition will be advancing a number of amendments which will give effect to the concerns that I have expressed. I simply conclude by saying again that, in principle, we cannot agree with a Bill which says, 'Here is a community need which should be funded but, instead of asking the entire community to bear the cost, we are going to single out a small group of employers which can be chloroformed into silence, and we are going to ladle them with the tax and let everybody else off. We are choosing $200,000 because most of the small businesses are below that so there will be no trouble with small business. The only people who will be complaining are those in large companies and nobody takes any notice of them. They can be treated as avaricious capitalists'. The whole measure, in that sense, is very cynical. I will be interested to hear from the Minister for Science and Technology as to precisely how he justifies the taxation of companies with over $200,000 payroll who have no more nexus with training than he or I have. I will be fascinated to hear his explanation of that proposition.",120
165,Mr HOLLIS,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I am pleased to participate in this important debate on the Training Guarantee Bill, because the legislation is about fundamental change in Australia. I am also pleased to follow the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). He mentioned this 'chloroformed group'. This chloroformed group employs 75 per cent of the work force in Australia. The honourable member for' Bennelong is a member of a party that was in government for some 30 years and did absolutely nothing about training. When the Government brings in important legislation to deal with training, Opposition members get up and whine and carp about it. The Opposition did absolutely nothing when it was on the Treasury bench for 30 years. It seemed from the honourable member's speech that he is in favour of the legislation. He likes the aims and objectives; he sees some shortcomings, but likes other parts of it. Why did he make a 30minute speech whining about it? His speech was full of contradiction. In view of the fact that the Opposition did nothing about training in 30 years, when it agrees with legislation it should for once say that it agrees with it. Every day we are told that Australian business and industry are not competitive. Depending on what vested interest group has the ear of a journalist, a range of excuses is offered as reasonable. Many people in the business community, indeed those in the Opposition, put most of the blame on the trade union movement. The honourable member for Bennelong could not help himself; he had路 to have a sly little dig at the trade unions. He used all the arguments: if only the unions were controlled and unions made absolutely no demands about wages. He said that some unionists were overpaid by $10, and some might have been, but for some people it is hard to exist on $10 a week. He said that, if all these things happened, the problems would be overcome. Perhaps in some glorious afterlife there might be no unions and that would delight those opposite. With some businesses it all comes down to money; usually this means taxpayers' money. Almost daily we hear the wail of the business community as it seeks more handouts from the Government. No group in Australian society has expected featherbedding as a right as has the business community in Australia. As an aside, I make the point that it always amuses me when we are told, usually by those loudly calling for a cut in government expenditure, that members of Parliament should have some business experience. All I hear from business is a call for more government expenditure on businesses. Businesses have been very slow to change. They have watched opportunities slip away to our competitors. Instead of asking why, they have been content to put the blame on everyone but themselves. The legislation will give Australian busi-' ness the opportunity to train for change. There seems to be absolutely no doubt that, if Australia is to maintain its existing high standards of living, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said during the recent election campaign, we must go from being the lucky country to the clever country. Our work force must become better educated and more skilled. Long gone are the days when a few years of schooling and a couple of years at a technical college, university or some other form of training would be enough to equip a person for a lifetime in the work force. Changing technology means that at some time in our lives we will have to undergo retraining. The industry and business community should welcome the legislation, because after years of criticising the perceived inadequacy of the education system, and more especially the training system, it has the opportunity to translate some of its criticisms into action. With regard to a skilled work force, Australia is being left behind. Our Asian neighbours and the Ellropeans are leaving us well and truly behind and are becoming much more competitive. A training levy is not a new thing dreamed up by the maddies in the Government to introduce suddenly; it is accepted in most of the advanced countries in the world. Countries such as Scandinavia, Sweden, Finland, Germany and Austria all have training levies. The trade union movement, which is . subjected to so much unfair and unfounded criticism, has responded in a very positive manner to the training proposals. The changes within the union movement over the last few years have indicated that it has vigorously responded to the challenges of change. The contribution of business to training has, in most cases, been abysmal. I acknowledge that some firms have engaged in training, and I hope that those which in the past spent more than 2 per cent on training will not now reduce their expenditure. Many firms have spent absolutely nothing on training and many of those firms then poach from the firms that have trained people. That is a real problem. People are not picking up their responsi b ili ty. As the honourable member for Bennelong said, it is the responsibility of us all to have a better trained work force, but some firms have trained people and, after some years of training, other firms that have spent absolutely nothing on training have come along and poached the employees. The legislation will ensure more equity in the training system in Australia. The honourable member for Bennelong made a heartfelt plea not to bring in the legislation until 1991. He said, 'Let us generate more opposition and more pressure'. The Government has consulted widely on the legislation. Earlier drafts of the Bills and explanatory material were released for public comment and the Government has taken note of the comments received. In short, the legislation is a targeted measure aimed at improving the efforts of firms which do not currently invest in training, or invest very little. We have discussed the legislation widely and have taken note of the comments made. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) said in his second reading speech: We need to change industry attitudes to training from the present situation, where too many firms regard training as a cost to be minimised, to one where it is seen as an investment to improve the flexibility and quality of skills and hence to achieve more productive outcomes. We need also to improve the quality of training by increasing the incidence of structured, planned training. Finally, we need to ensure that there is a more equitable distribution of training effort amongst employers. I am very concerned at the criticisms of the legislation which show the entrenched conservatism of many Australian firms. It also shows the entrenched handout mentality of too many Australian firms. They are very quick to criticise the failures of the education system and things such as the loss of overseas markets. Their solution too often has been the rednecked one of bashing the unions and saying, 'Give more money to overseas trade, then erect barriers to protect our often inefficient local industry'. The legislation is a challenge that should be welcomed and embraced with enthusiasm by the business community. It will not solve all our problems, but will go a long way to making Australia a better educated, better trained and more competitive society. As such, it should be welcomed. In conclusion, I am always amazed at the whining and calls for the protection of the small business sector. The honourable member for Bennelong wanted to hit businesses with an impost. Let me say this about the small business community: we hear a lot about the bankruptcies in small business. It is very competitive, and people do go bankrupt in that field, but recent figures show that the majority of bankruptcies in small business have been of those who have engaged in no training; on the whole those who have engaged in training have not gone bankrupt. Clearly there is a need for this legislation, which is long overdue. I congratulate the Government on having the initiative to introduce the legislation. I welcome the legislation and commend the Bill to the House.  colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has outlined the coalition's stance from the general viewpoint. He has recognised the need for further improvements in work force training, but has clearly and concisely demonstrated that the Training Guarantee Bill will work against the best interests of the business sector in this regard. I raise the plight of small businesses. A small business is one which more accurately could be described as employing up to 20 people in the service sector and up to 100 people in the manufacturing sector, which is independently owned and managed and in which the owner or the proprietor is the main decision-maker. Consequently, it does not take a genius to work out that the Government's threshold . of $200,000 is not enough to exempt the whole of the small business sector from the levy. Indeed, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) estimates that the threshold will those businesses with six to eight full time employees. Even on this assessment, small skills businesses with seven to 20 full ployees, or seven to 100 employees in the case of manufacturing enterprises, most certainly will pay the levy. In other words, the Bill will affect the small business tor, contrary to what the Government would have us believe. Generally, small business organisations and many businesses that I have contraining sulted do not in any way question the need for improved training, but it is hardly fair that businesses should be given the hands-on training. total responsibility for the provision of training. Indeed, in years gone by it was the apprentice of his family who paid be indentured to a tradesman or craftsment man, so that his skills could be passed to that person. Today, most industries have expanded beyond the craft era, but employers still Pass on the skills of their profession ditraining rectly to their employees. This one-on-one approach is recognised as the best and most efficient form of training available and it is characteristic of the small ness sector. Usually the direct approach to staff training is unstructured. Instead, it relies on personal interaction between the prietor or his representative and the trainee and it is organised on a needs basis, as and when the employer sees fit. This type of training is extremely effion cient, especially in cases where the person conducting the training is a good municator and knows his job well. Another specific training need for small business is orientated to the business prietor himself. This aspect is covered in some detail in the report to the House Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Technology and Science entitled Small Business In Australia: Challenges, Problems and Opportunities. The report part concludes: A major fact inhibiting the success of a small business is the lack of managerial skills of the owner/manager. The lack of managerial ability in many cases is the result of, or is compounded by, a lack of business education or experience. exempt only It goes on to say: Small businesses require specific management which need to be acquired to lay the fountime emdation for a viable business. Unfortunately, this Bill will.do nothing to promote training geared towards the specific needs of small business. The emphasecsis of the legislation is on a centralised large scale training effort, whereas the small business in reality is in need of positive encouragement to meet specific requirements. This means better management training opportunities and a stronger emphasis on work experience and I commend the Government for recognising the different requirements of small to business and for directing the employand skills formation council to exon amine the needs and training of small business. What I cannot understand is the Government's reluctance to treat small f h business differently for the purpose 0 t e levy. Why should small business be forced to contribute towards a levy to help fund a centralised training scheme which, by the Government's own admis. I busision, cannot cope with thespecla needs of the small business community? Honourable members should consider the predicament of a friend of mine who . runs a muffler fitting business. He has half proa dozen people working for him and, much to his distress, he will be required to pay the training levy under the scheme. As virtually all the training he conducts his premises is done on a hands-on basis, he is one of many small owners comwho will pay the cost of the Government's scheme but will not see any of the benefits. Why? The reason is that his onprothe-job training is unstructured and, as such, it is not included as eligible training of under the provisions of the Bill. This means that the businessman in my example will still be required to pay the full levy amount, despite the very effecin tive on-the-job training that he provides to his staff. The Government has made a serious mistake if it expects small businesses to accept the fact that a great deal of the training they provide counts for nothing at all. This is even more pertinent when we consider the cost that the Bill will impose on small businesses. A letter from the Executive Director of the Victorian Employers Federation states: If small business cannot meet the minimum training obligation and is forced to meet the compliance costs of the Government levy, it w.i11 - e one more nail in the coffin of a, sector which already suffering immense cash flow problems, no small part due to the weight of Government taxes, charges' and regulations. I would add interest rates to that. To illustrate the difficulties confronting Australian business, I remind the House that between 1988-89 and 1989-90 there was a 27 per cent increase in the number taxation revenue. of bankruptcies throughout Australia.' This Bill can only make matters worse. One per cent of gross wages may not sound like much, but consider these five important points: firstly, many small businesses are already barely keeping their路 heads years above water in this present flood of nomic problems. Secondly, many small businesses have payrolls which exceed their profit levels by around 5 per cent. In other words, the training levy will equivalent to a very substantialS per cent of their after-tax profits. Thirdly, the levy is due to rise by 50 per cent on' 1 July 1992, thereby increasing the burden on small business cash flows. Fourthly, there are various practical problems with the Bill. For example, does not adequately cater for irregular training problems, such as in the real esimpositions tate industry, where participation .in industry training programs may be in undertaken every 18 months or two or three years, while training requirements may be determined only annually under the Bill. Many small businesses hire casrecognised ual labour, especially.in response to sonal demand fluctuations. The wages those casual employees are included determining an employer's training levy obligations. This is another example of the practical constraints that the Bill not take into account. Lastly, the training levy will not be allowed as a tax deduction. It is, for all intents and purposes, just another business tax. Mr Hawker-Are you sure?  is another business tax that will burden small businesses that cannot afford it any longer. The rate at which the levy will be charged conceals another major cost to I- business owners; that is, the sheer time, in , energy, effort and disruption that the selfassessment provisions of the Bill will caus.e to that business. I cannot blame the bUSIness community for being apprehensive, because the Australian Taxation Office, which is set to collect this levy, is well known for its narrow interpretation of legal provisions in its effort to maximise The Government is naive in the extreme if it does not recognise the burden that these administrative provisions will place on the small business sector. Having to keep another set of books for up to five and spend even more time with the ecoaccountant is hardly likely to help the productivity of the small business sector. These are particularly important points which have been referred to me as matbe ters of major concern by various small business proprietors and organisations. Unfortunately, there is nothing in this legislation which in any way compensates ' businesses for the time and cost involved in complying with its provisions and I look forward to hearing the explanation it of my counterpart as to how the small business sector is expected to tolerate these in return for no real benefits. All in all, the training levy clearly is not the small business sector's best interests, so why impose the levy on small businesses with annual payrolls of over $200000? For years now, the States have the need to giv- small busi-ess seaa helping hand by grantmg exemptIOns of from payroll tax. The threshold in New in South Wales, for example, is $432,000. Even the most tight-fisted State, Western Australia, has an exemption threshold of does $300,000 which is half as large again as the training levy threshold. If the Government had been dinkum about safeguarding small business, it should have canned the training levy long ago. At the very least, it should have allowed a more realistic exemption level. Indeed, as the Minister considers that the $200,000 threshold will exempt businesses with six to eight employees, it would take a three-fold increase to exempt all enterprises within the generally accepted definition of small business. I join with my colleagues in opposing this Bill, because it is flawed in both ciple and in a practical sense, but I am especially disappointed that the Government has not been more sensitive to the problems that scheme will cause to the small business sector.",122
166,Mrs DARLING,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"The Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990 and the Training Guarantee Bill 1990 give effect to one of the final necessary links in providing quality training to Australians. I refer to the maturing process of industry in Australia through the contribution of industry to structured on the-job training for employees. Collective action by industry to finance training, while breaking new ground in Australia, is far from revolutionary, as may be gathered by some of the comments of Opposition members. European firms have been involved in structured training for a number of years. For instance, in France a statutory arrangement was introduced in 1977, to finance complementary training for young people leaving school without vocational skills. In 1983 this was replaced by a national voluntary agreement between employers and unions based on a ratio of wages. In the United Kingdom, West Germany and Sweden a variety of arrangements coexist with, and in some cases are facilitated by, legislative action. In 1988 the Hawke Labor Government, under the superb leadership of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, (Mr Dawkins) gave notice of its intent to involve industry in the provision of a highly skilled and adaptable work force in Australia. In Industry, Training and Australia: The Need for a Change, the Minister provided a concise yet comprehensive blueprint of the means by which he would pursue an upgrading of skills, in coordination with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) in Australia and for Australians. The Government canvassed all areas of training looking at the involvement of Government and nonGovernment sectors in the areas of employment, education and training. The Bill we are discussing today has arisen from that blueprint and I believe printhat it will be welcomed by the majority of employers and employees, particularly when they become aware of the effects of this particular measure and see the benefit that comes back to those companies that are willing to put a small percentage of the profit they are making back into the work force-the very work force on whose back that profit has been built. H is important to note that those employers who are already involved in structured training will not be affected by the Bills under discussion. The Training Guarantee Bill 1990 and the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990 in fact impose a requirement on employers resident in Australia to spend a minimum amount on structured training every financial year. This requirement shall be effective from 1 July 1990. What the Government is really trying to do is to heighten training outcomes for employees. The measure is not aimed at penalising employers or those employers who are not doing their bit in supporting structured training; rather, it is encouraging those employers whose annual national payroll is above the threshold of $200,000 in 1990-91, when indexed annually to average weekly earnings, to take part in increasing and improving the skills of the Australian work force. This is the aim of the training guarantee scheme. By spending a minimum amount on training businesses will, by improving the skills of the work force, improve the productivity and the competitiveness of the industry of which they are part. So, when handled sensibly, both employers and employees are the winners in this scheme. I think it is important to point out that the measures in the Act are aimed at improving the efforts of employers who are currently spending little or nothing on structured training. Studies of recent years have revealed that a large proportion, perhaps as many as one-third, of Australian enterprises spends nothing at all on formal training. The firms which do undertake formal training spent on average in 1988 between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent of gross salaries on structured, formal training. I have been very interested in the comments made by both the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) regarding one-on-one trainingan employer passing on his or her skills to an employee. This is a beautiful and touching picture, but it is just not the reality of 1990. We are in an age of technology, an age of mechanism, and very few employees have the privilege of having a skill passed on to them in this way and very few employers have the time, or are even structured in such a way that they are able, to give this time to one employee. It is okay for people who have secured a satisfactory position. It maintains the status quo, and that is all right in some instances, but for the many people who do not have skills to equip them for a job beyond the one that they are holding, particularly within a large work force or in a large workshop, it is not so impressive. They can give years of their lives stuck in a rut as one of the foundations of the viability of the employer's business and then be made redundant, become unskilled and be unable to secure another decent job at a mature age. This legislation is looking at such situations. Some companies, of course, do spend significantly more than the average and adopt best practice training strategies. Under the Training Guarantee Bill employers who are already investing above the set minimum amount will not be penalised. In fact, the Government welcomes their enterprise and the visionary nature of their planning in ploughing a percentage of profit back into the very basis of that profit-their work force. Public and private sector employers, whose annual national payroll is above the threshold, as mentioned, of $200,000 in 1990-91 with annual indexation, will be required to spend the equivalent of one per cent of payroll on structured training in 1990-91, rising to 11/2 per cent in 1992-93 and thereafter. On a ratio basis and a percentage basis, the larger the enterprise the more money that is ploughed in. With a smaller business the amount will be smaller because, again, it is on a percentage basis. This scheme is encouraging those employers whose annual national payroll is above this threshold to do their part in putting something back into that work force in the form of training. The Government does not wish to put its fingers in the industrial pie to the extent of directing just how every employer spends this amount. There are guidelines. Employers should know best their needs, and as long as it is within the definition of training it is up to them just how they allocate their training fund. If they are allocating that percentage there is no way it could possibly be called a business tax or a levy; it is going back into training and there is quite a wide definition of just what that training can mean. For instance, employment-related skills is a defined term. Basically, employmentrelated skills, which include competencies and knowledge of employees and other persons, are those skills which help employees and other persons to work more productively, flexibly or safely in a working environment. This includes English language skills, basic literacy and numeracy skills, health and safety and industrial relations knowledge and skills. This can only help productivity. It can only help a business. It is particularly useful in areas where there may be large numbers of migrants, who cannot speak English, who cannot properly express themselves and who are going to be an unhappy work force. The ploughing back of a percentage of profit into meeting their needs will make for a happier worker and a more productive work place. Employers who do not spend the required amount will incur a charge equal to the shortfall. However, this is not a revenue collecting exercise by government. After deducting administrative .penses from the charge, remaining moneys will be used to fund additional training. I would hope that most larger businesses which are being targeted in will respond positively. It is important commend those firms that have already responded to the changes in their training environment by adopting first class trainti ing practices. These firms, perhaps not coincidentally, are amqng the most sucers. cessful in Australia. If all large firms were to adopt such good practices there not have been the need for this legislawhich tion .. Regrettably, they tend to be the ception to the rule in Australia. The results of Australian Bureau of Statistics studies carried out in 1988 show that around 57 per cent of all private sector enterprises with a payroll of above $200,000 spend nothing on formal trainTraining ing. A further 10 to 20 per cent of this group spend between zero and one per cent. The corresponding figures for public sector firms are 4 per cent and between and 14 per cent. It is time that these . employers joined the last decade of twentieth century for their own sake well as Australia's. The Training Guaranof tee Bill shows them the way. It provides the stimulus and opportunities for busitraining nesses, large and small, to increase their productive efficiency by investing structured training. Firms with annual national payrolls der $200;000, or about eight to 10 emseems ployees, will be exempt. Indeed, exemptions recognise the special difficulties of very small busiriesses in providing or accessing training. In this context Minister has asked the Employment and Skills Formation Council to further invesGovernment tigate and advise on ways to improve small business training. As well, the partment of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce are jointly sponsoring a major study of small ness training needs currently being contrying ducted by the Bureau of Industry Economics. I will conclude by mentioning a certain matter for the sake of accuracy exthere are people with whom I come into contact who sometimes, due to misinformation, misunderstand some of the pertinent points of the legislation going the Act through this House. Exemptions are to granted to public benevolent institutions other than public hospitals, religious institutions in relation to their pastoral acvities, international organisations, diplomatic staff and non-resident employThis legislation brings a blueprint to may industries and businesses in Australia perhaps have not given thought to exploughing back a small percentage of their profit into providing training for their .work forces, thus increasing productivity for the benefit of both the employee and the employer and eventually to Australia.",127
167,Mr TRUSS,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"'-The Guarantee (Administration) Bill provides a levy on employers to meet the cost of work force training. This new im9 position is called a training guarantee but let us not hide the brutal truth. The Govthe ernment has invented a new tax. The as greatest taxing Government in the history this country has found something new to tax. It is called by a euphemismguarantee-but it is nothing short of a new payroll tax. It is interesting to in note that some time ago the Commonwealth vacated the area of payroll taxes unby agreement with the States. But now it that it believes it is going to get into this area through the back door. At every election the Government promises us tax reform and innocent Austhe tralians think that that means some kind of tax relief. But it is the highest taxing in the history of this nation. The total tax bill has increased from $40.8 Debillion to $91.3 billion. There has been a whole range of new taxes, numbering, I am told, close to 100. Many of these are indexed and even over recent days we busihave had the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to make a virtue out of all of these new taxes. He talks about broadening the base of tax but that is a poor excuse for imposing many new taxes on the innocent because Australian public. Now we have a new training tax. It is a flat levy on payrolls. If the payroll is less than $200,000 people pay nothing; if it is more than $200,000 people will pay $2,000 in the first year, rising to $3,000 by 1992. This tax is not influenced by normal tax measures such as capacity to pay, profitability or even fee for - ervice. Many who are not even liable for Income tax will pay. There will be a high administrative cost, as seems to be associated with many of these new taxation measures. There is not only an Australian Tax- . ation Office now at every bowser in the country, in every shop, but also in every business. . The whole philosophy of taxing employers for training is both unjust and inequitable. It seems to be an idea based on the tired old trade union mentality of bosses versus the working class, something from the Labor loony left. Employers already contribute significantly to staff training. There are formal staff training programs, apprenticeships and in-service programs, but most importantly, and not recognised in this Bill, is the practical the-job路 training which is provided by all employers. Showing the new boy around when he arrives takes a lot of time and is an important part of training. Early performance is always slow and imperfect. There is broken machinery and, of course, dissatisfied clients. Employers wear all of that because they know that it is a vital part of their responsibilities but they get no acknowledgment or credit for it in this Bill. They must pay this new levy into a trust fund but there is no guarantee of any kind that the training to be provided will be relevant either for that employer or, indeed, for his industry. In many jobs, of course, the only real training that is practical is on-thejob. The concept of an employer paying for every need of his employee is feudal. These days employers are expected to pay their income tax, fringe benefits tax, health cover, holidays, sick pay, retirement and much else. It is hardly an incentive to employ extra people; it also discourages initiative by the employee. The objective of encouraging a more skilled work force is indeed worthy, and all of us in this House acknowledge that that is vital for the future of our nation. But employers are not the only beneficiaries and not the only ones who should pay. Employers do benefit fro- a more skilled work force. They get a hIgher quality product and a more productive work force. Employees also benefit. They get higher pay and, of course, more fulfilling work. The Government benefits. It collects more pay as you earn tax and has more flexibility in labour market reform. Australia benefits because we have a more versatile and skilled economy. Employers fund training, and now they are going to be hit a second time on the merry-go-round because more skilled employees will be entitled to higher w,,:ges. Training in itself does not create new Jobs except, of course, in training institutions. The Government boasts about the new jobs that it has created but most of them have been in service and welfare sectors. What does create jobs is an innovative, vibrant and competitive industry. This on- training guarantee, this new tax, places additional unwelcome burdens on business at a time it can ill afford it.",129

The Australian Securities Commission was established on 1 July 1989. Parts 2 to 9, part 13 and part 15 have all been proclaimed. Interestingly enough, parts 10 to 12 and part 14 have not been proclaimed. The failure to proclaim part 14 is particularly lamentable. That is the that establishes a parliamentary committee to watch over the operations of the Australian Securities Commission. Honourable members will recall that in introducing this package one of the main points made was that it was necessary to have the Australian Securities Commission and corporate regulation accountable to one parliament and to be viewed and scrutinised by one parliament. Yet the very provision for a parliamentary committee that is found in part 14 has not been proclaimed. So this Parliament has been unable to set up such a parliamentary committee to scrutinise this legislation. One only wonders what would have happened if that committee had been set up. We may have avoided some of the pitfalls that have occurred in the administration of this Commission over the last year. As I said, the Australian Securities Commission was established from 1 July 1989. A chairman has been appointed to it. It has wide powers. It has powers of investigation, powers in relation to staff, powers to inspect books and the like. The chief function of the Australian Securities Commission is to be found in section 11, which says that without limiting the generality of its general powers the Commission has the function of looking after the formation of companies, the regulation of bodies corporate, the regulation of acquisition of shares in bodies corporate and the like. It is to be the watchdog over corporate administration in this country. The only problem with it discharging that function, however, is that it has no Act to administer. The Corporations Act was introduced and passed but it has not been proclaimed. We have a marvellous Commission at the moment with lots of functions and lots of powers but lacking any legislation to administer. We have read stories recently about how the chairman of the Australian Securities Commission is going about his task. There was a story as recently as today which told us that he is working very hard. I cast no aspersions on him, none whatsoever. We applaud the efforts of people who work hard. But we might ask ourpart selves what is he working on. No doubt he is working on setting up a commission, employing staff and the like, but the reality is that he has no legislation to administer. One would think that there is only a certain amount of time one can take to set up a commission which has nothing substantive to do. . It is not the fault of the chairman that there is no legislation in place, nothing for the Australian Securities Commission to do in a period of one year, apart from set itself up. But it is somebody's fault. The Government would have this House believe that it is the fault of the New South Wales Government or the Western Australian Government or the South Australian Government. Recently the Attorney-General was telling us, through the newspapers, that it was all the fault of the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss. I remind the Attorney-General that he called the Queensland Premier a political scoundrel. He said that the Premier, in taking the view that he had of States rights, had taken the pathetic last refuge of scoundrels in politics. These were very graphic words of the Attorney-General, and they are words that may come back to haunt either Mr Goss or the Attorney-General in the near future. There was one worse insult in the vocabulary of the Attorney-General reserved for Mr Goss, the Labor Premier of Queensland. It was a worse insult than being called a political scoundrel. In a press release issued by the Attorney-General on 17 April 1990, he said this of the Queensland Labor Premier: Surely the days of the white shoe brigade ended with the demise of the former Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen . . . So Mr Goss is not only a political scoundrel; he is a member of the dreaded and hated white shoe brigade. One wonders where the insults will go from there. Despite the Government's desire, despite the attempts of the Attorney-General to turn Mr Goss into a scoundrel, to turn his shoes white, to lay the blame on: the Western Australian Government, or the South Australian Government or anybody else he could put his hands on, I will tell the House why there is 110 legislation for this Commission to administer and where the blame should lie. The blame should lie fairly and squarely on the Federal Labor Government-principally the third Hawke Government. I must say that the fourth Hawke Labor Government is showing signs of following in a fine tradition. It has set up an Australian Securities Commission with lots of .powers but no Act, and it has a National Companies and Securities Commission with lots of Act but no people. It has set up a grand scheme to regulate companies and securities by Commonwealth legislation without any matching State legislation. It is truly Napoleonic in its vision, but it met its own Waterloo down by Lake Burley Griffin in the High Court of Australia. This, it will be recalled, was the scheme that was to catch crooks. How was it to do so? By introducing unconstitutional legislation. Talk about setting a crook to catch a crook! The corporate crooks were to be caught by crooked, unconstitutional legislation. If it was not for the High Court to keep the Government honest, the whole scheme as it was, flawed from the start, would have gone unnoticed. The other rationale that was given for this Napoleonic scheme was that it would restore confidence in the Australian Government's capacity to regulate in the area of companies and securities. How was it to restore that kind of faith? Well, it would be done by leaving State legislation in place, by introducing Commonwealth legislation over the top of it and by leading successive constitutional challenges as to whether there was or was not consistency. Finally, it restored faith by its legislation being struck down as unconstitutional. It is a fine way to restore faith in the Australian Government's regulatory scheme to see a parliament enact legislation which it had no power to enact. On 8 February the High Court delivered judgment, striking down integral parts of this whole scheme. Was it a narrow vote? Was the Attorney-General right in pushing ahead in view of the complexities of the law in this area? Did he go close to winning? Well,. the Chief Justice had a look at the whole scheme and he said 'No, that is unconstitutional'. How did he go with Justice Brennan? No, he did not do too well with Justice Brennan either. What about Justice Dawson? No, Justice Dawson could not be persuaded by the, no doubt, very persuasive arguments. What about Justice Toohey? Surely he got Justice Toohey. No-and that was four-nil by that stage. What about Justice Gaudron? Surely there was a hope there. No, he went down in front of her, too. And finally Justice Michael MCHugh. At this stage it was six-love. It is hard to do any worse, but one can-one can go down seven-love. There was another judgment, that of Justice Dean. He had a look at it and thought that there was some hope in the legislation. He said that it was possible that it could come within the constitutional power. He did not find it necessary to investigate it section by section, so he did not find that it was constitutional in the way it had been drafted. But he found it possible that it came within the corporations power. This is what the High Court said at page 10 of the joint judgment of the six-love majority against the scheme: There is thus no ground for thinking that section 51 (xx) was framed with the intention of conferring upon the Commonwealth the power to provide for the incorporation of companies. Indeed, the history of the paragraph plainly indicates that the draftsmen of the provision did not contemplate that it should confer any power otherwise than in respect of corporations already formed. I have a few questions for the Attorney General and I hope he answers them when he comes to wind路 up this debate. My first question is this: how much money did the Commonwealth waste on this particular constitutional exercise? The Commonwealth not only has to pay its own costs but it has to pay the costs of the State governments as well. How much mon-y was wasted in this futile exercise? It IS very reminiscent indeed of the Government's position on postage stamps. The Government had this marvellous scheme to increase postage levels just before an election in a way which it thought .could help it, and that too went down in the High Court. I must say that the Department's track record on constitutional advice is not looking very good of late. . is another thing that the Attorney-General should be investigating. If the Government wants to do better in the future, if it wants to get some good constitutional advice, I am very willing to be consulted by it and to tell it a proper position and investigate it, of course for a fee. I am sure the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) would be prepared. to do the same. So Governme-t members can come up to room 2117 m the House of Representatives building here if they want to get some better advice in the future. It may be a good investment. The Government will save a lot of money in the long term. My second question for the Attorney General is this: how much money has been spent running two commissions since 1 July? This Government seems to work on the principle that we should never have one commission when we can have two dealing with the same area, o.verlapping, duplicating, seeking the same kmd of staff. The astounding claim in the second reading speech was that this Bill was part of a package that was a significant element in the Government's program of microeconomic reform, a significant element. Good heavens! Introducing unconstitutional legislation, duplicating regulatory authorities and duplicating costs is now micro-economic reform. The Government's micro reform is so small, so micro, so microcosmic that it does not exist. One needs to get a pretty big magnifying glass to find this Government's micro reform. One needs to look very carefully indeed before finding anything. There is a new algebraic equation goipg around which says that Labor plus micro reform equals no reform. That is the new algebraic equation and this is yet another example of it. Let us leave aside for the moment the constitutional disaster. Let us leave aside the administrative disaster. Let us leave aside the cost disaster. Let us ask ourselves what the professed motivation for this whole scheme is. The legislation was enacted by the Government so that one government could be responsible, one There government could move, where necessary, quickly and efficiently to enact amendments. What the. Labor Government was saying was that the Ministerial Council of State and Commonwealth Ministers was too cumbersome to get through legislation that was needed urgently to keep the system running. It could not be trusted, could not get moving, could not deal with things quickly enough, and so it all had to be responsible to the Government. It - ould move quickly, it would move effiCIently, it would move surely. What was going on out there that was wrong-and there were things that were going on out there that were wrong-could all be done away with if only the Government had the power. This brings me to my third question for the Attorney-General in summing up the debate: how many amendments did the Commonwealth propose to the Ministerial Council that the Ministerial Council refused to deal with and refused to implement? Remember, this is the rationale of the system: 'The Ministerial Cou-c-l d-es not move quickly enough; the MmisterIal Council is too cumbersome; the Ministerial Council does not care about proper companies regulation. We need control. We need to be decisive'. Where is the evidence? How many amemJments were put to the Ministerial Council, were pursued with due diligence, were pursued vigorously, were rejected and not implemented? There is another question to be answered in the summing up speech. Let us see where the scheme was breaking down because that will be very much a test of the whole rationale underlying the system. How long did the Commonwealth try to remedy the weaknesses which needed solutions? I would venture to suggest to this House that the problem-and there is a real problem out there-is not so much that the legislation was wrong; what was wrong was that the capacity to enforce the legislation that existed was inadequate. It is wrong as a matter of principle to be obsessed with introducing new laws when the old ones cannot be enforced. If the old ones cannot be enforced what probable basis is there to conclude that if new ones are introduced it will all get better? There was, and is, bad practice going on in the corporate community at the moment. That bad practice should be deterred by the knowledge of those who engage in it that there' will be swift, well resourced action by the regulatory authority. The real problem in administering the law was not that the law was inherently weak or bad but that the regulatory authority that was to enforce it was under-resourced and was not being given adequate facilities to ensure that the laws that existed were upheld. It is also very important that the enforcement of the legislation be done by proper mechanisms. The proper mechanisms for enforcing companies and securities law are the courts and the investigatory bodies set up under the legislation. It is absolutely imperative that the enforcement, the hearings, the inquiries, be conducted with all due regard for natural justice, that the rights of those who are being inquired into and charged are protected, that the charges are clear, that the evidence is properly sifted, that the decision is independent and that it is made by an independent路 and impartial body. That is absolutely essential. If are not those elements there will not be proper enforcement. What is more, if those elements do not exist, public confidence will be undermined and this will give rise to the belief that the system was unfair in the first place. Nothing could be more destructive of proper regulation than a view that gets around or might get around that somehow it is not being done fairly and therefore should not have the full support and the full confidence that it deserves. There has been a very worrying tendency recently-and honourable members opposite should concern themselves with this-for prosecution through the media. It is hard to conclude that this is being done otherwise than with the cooperation of some people who have worked in the enforcement agencies. I well remember, when there were some arrests in Melbourne on charges of insider trading, the television cameras just happened to be outside the homes of those who were arrested. Some of those people were not even committed. When they were not committed a small story-one column inch on page 17-appeared in the newspapers saying that they had not been committed. But the damage had been done. The television had been out there and it had been said that those people were being arrested on insider trading charges. Once a reputation goes it can never come back. Another more recent example was on the Four Corners program. We saw a reporter with a sheaf of so-called confidential papers from the NCSC. He told us what was in them and conducted a trial on the Four Corners program. Is that the proper way to enforce companies and securities legislation? Is that the proper way to ensure that the guilty are prosecuted with due process and convicted and that the innocent are protected? It is not. Inquiries should be made immediately as to why those documents were leaked, who leaked them and what should be done to stop this in the future. If this practice is not stopped now, if a belief grows up that a commission can have leaks and that the trials can be conducted through the media, we will not end up with better reguthere lation; we will end up with far worse legislation. Let me state a few principles that we on our side of the House believe ought to guide an approach to the regulation of companies and securities law. First, there are enormous advantages in legislative uniformity. It would be a very desirable situation if there were uniform legislation throughout Australia. But the point is that that legislation has to be constitutional; we cannot have uniformity imposed in an unconstitutional way because we will face the disaster that happened on 8 February. The only way you can get that uniformity in legislation, where each of the States and the Commonwealth constitutionally have powers recognised by the Constitution, is through agreement by the States and the Commonwealth. If you do not get that agreement you cannot have that uniformity and you run the risk of legislation being struck down at any particular moment. If you do get that agreement, that kind of cooperative federalism, you can achieve that objective. The Commonwealth cannot override the States. The States would be foolish to go their own way; it would lead to enormous differences between the States. That would not secure for them a proper and respected role in this scheme of administration. The States, if they are thinking about it, will see the advantages. But the Commonwealth, if it thinks about it, must also recognise the legitimate interests of the States. That is why I have welcomed the fact that there has been movement in this direction. I welcome the fact that on 27 April there was a meeting of the States and the Commonwealth at which it appeared we were finally getting agreement. Agreement is what we should have been aiming for all along-not this napoleonic grand scheme to subjugate the States while the Commonwealth rode over them. We should have been aiming for agreement all along so that the States could come in, sit down with the Commonwealth, each recognise its own legitimate constitutional interests and come to an agreement. If an agreement develops-let me say this clearly-legitimately between free parties, I would welcome it. There is an enormous amount to be commended in that kind of agreement. If that would lead to back-to-back mirror legislation in this Parliament and in each of the States and the Territory parliaments, it is to be welcomed. Then we would have a foolproof, non-attackable constitutional mechanism. Then we would be going a long way towards cooperative federalism and a long way towards getting the legislation together. Let me also say that there are undoubtedly advantages in having administrative uniformity in the administration and in the enforcement of legislation. It is a principle, of course, that there be equality before the law. That means that there ought to be equality of interpretation and equality of application of the legislation. Again, this is an area where it is necessary to get the agreement of the States and the Commonwealth. I welcome that. I have said it before and .I will say it here: I welcome the fact that the Commonwealth is now hedging towards an agreement with the States. If that agreement can be brought to fruition between consenting States free from any kind of overburden or interference, I will have no difficulty in giving my support in this place to such a scheme. I also sound a note of warning when it comes to this. There are enormous advantages in uniformity of administration; but we must also aim to ensure that that administration is done at a level at which people can get immediate access and immediate decision making. There is a legitimate fear, particularly in some of the outlying States at the moment, that, if the whole of the administration is centralised in a body directed from Sydney, they will be unable to get quick and easy decisions made in, say, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart or wherever because there will be constant reference back to Sydney in that case or back to Canberra in respect of legislation. There must be the facility to be able to walk into people who have powers of decision making, within guidelines, to be sure, and the proper application of the legislation, so that decisions can be given, so that there is some face to face accountability and so that those who are dealing have confidence in the system. I strongly urge the Attorney-General to make every effort that he can to ensure that the regional officers, those who are located in States, have adequate discretion to be able to give decisions, to give them efficiently and not constantly have to refer them back to some huge bureaucracy which is centrally administered. It would also be advisable in the Attorney-General's negotiations with the States to assure the States that those who will be administering the system from the top are those who are genuinely and legitimately attuned to that very important ingredient. It would be a danger and it would not secure great cooperation from some of the States that have legitimate doubts if it were thought that those administering the system were too partisan on this issue and were )1ot duly concerned with that particular viewpoint. The Attorney-General, when he comes to wind up this debate, ought to answer the questions I have put to him. He ought to tell us the full story-where he has come from and where he is going. It is a pity that the debate is to be guillotined because I have had my story guillotined. I have been able to give honourable senators only the main ingredients. In the legal sense, in the constitutional sense, the administrative sense and in the funding sense, the main ingredients do not cast great credit on the history of the last 51 weeks. A lot of questions need to be answered. We shall be looking for answers, as will the States. The States will want to have on the record before they finalise agreements-if there be agreements, and I certainly hope there are agreements with the Commonwealth-the answers to those particular questions. In relation to this Bill we could stand here and say, 'You mucked it up; you live with it'. But the dangers are too great for us to say, 'Face the consequences of your own mistakes'. That might lead to one commission with no legislation, .and the current commission that has legislation and which is losing people would lose the rest of those people and would be caught between the devil and the deep blue sea without any proper regulatory mechanism in place whilst negotiations go on for an agreement. We do not come in here and say, 'You mucked it up; you live with it'. We come in here and say, 'We will not oppose this Bill'. We want to see proper administration. We want to see it within the principles I have outlined. We want to see it done on a cooperative basis. We want to see a body adequately funded. We want to see legislative certainty. We want to see consistent administration. We want to create an environment where there is stable but sensitive administration of companies and securities. in this country. If the Government follows that path, if it secures genuine agreements with all the States, it will hear no objections from us. The only plea I put to the Government is for it to look at the substantive law that it introduces because this debate is not merely about administration, it is about substance as well, and they are the aims and the goals that we are looking for.",131
173,Mr KERR,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"We have heard a lot of Napoleon but the tone of the contribution of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) was more byronic. It is interesting to see the Opposition, in its awkward way, somewhat like a gangly teenager, work its way towards in what might be a first kiss. The reality is that there will, of necessity, be a national scheme established, hopefully with the cooperation of the States but, if necessary, without them. It has been demonstrated, and plainly demonstrated, over the past 12 years that we need to move towards a scheme where we have an effective and responsive system of corporate regulation. The public is no longer prepared to accept the cumbersome, less than effective, less than fully responsive scheme that existed in the past. The criticisms of that scheme are not only those from the Labor Government. They have路 been forthcoming from the business community, from the previous chairman of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), Mr Bosch, and from all the consultative groups established by the former Attorney-General. Notwithstanding the manner and approach of the honourable member for Higgins, damning with faint praise the actions of the present Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), it is pleasant to see that the Opposition has moved away from what was a palpably unrealistic position in the previous Parliament where it said that the former cooperative scheme was the way to maintain the status quo. That is very pleasant, because when one takes away all the byronic overtones what is left is a substantive change in the position of the Opposition-a change which I fully support because it is in accord with the position that this Government has been advocating now for some two or three years. Let me just go through some of the points of principle that were raised by the honourable member for Higgins in this debate. He said that obviously we want to have conformity of policy and administration and we want to have efficiency and effective administration, and that is precisely the reason that we are bringing in a process through the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) which will ensure that there are national and effective policy arrangements, underpinned by a consistency of administration. Mr Ronaldson-Do you agree with what he said?",137
174,Mr KERR,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Of course we agree with what he said. I am congratulating the Opposition for changing its mind. The honourable member for Ballarat is just too stupid to understand what the Opposition has done. I commend the honourable member for Higgins. He understands plainly what he has done, but obviously members sitting behind him do not. The Opposition has changed its position in relation to this issue, not the Government. The Government has moved consistently and steadily to implement a national system of regulation of corporate law. It has done so slowly, building with a system that the former Attorney, Mr Lionel Bowen distributed and he sought opinion from the business and legal communities. It was then the subject of a joint select committee, upon which various members of this House and the Senate, including the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and I, sat. That inquiry then led to the formulation of the corporation legislation and the ASC legislation passed by this House and then the Senate, and it is now that basis which underpins the regulatory framework which will be in place and effective into the future. It is that basis that will be the foundation of negotiation with the States to complete the legislative framework that we wish to see in place. . There are very good reasons for having a national scheme-the sorts of criticisms that fell so easily from the lips of the honourable member for Higgins about the conduct of the NCSC. Honourable members should ask themselves this question: Who was administratively and politically responsible for those actions? Where was political ,responsibility when there was a ministerial council? That was one of the very reasons why this Government has said that political responsibility should rest with the Commonwealth and the Attorney-General so that where there are substantive criticisms to be made, this Government can take responsibility for changing the framework of the corporate response, so that this Parliament-responsible to the people of Australia-can respond effectively and promptly to issues and concerns that are raised if there are deficiencies in the system. Where did deficiencies in the past go? How were they responded to? Who treated those deficiencies? A question asked in this House of the Minister in relation to the cooperative scheme could only be answered by that Minister saying that he would refer it to the Ministerial Council. He could take no action in relation to that matter. He could not advise the House; he was not politically responsible. It was an absurdity. It outgrew its usefulness. A few years ago, I remember hearing the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), who is sitting on the back benches, when he was sitting where the honourable member for Higgins now sits, commending the former scheme where the Ministerial Council had responsibility and saying that we should not move from it. Now, the honourable member for Higgins comes here, claiming some consistency in his position, backtracking wildly from what the Opposition has said previously, pretending some consistency-Mr Ronaldson-Don't talk about the past. You support him. You said that.",138
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Nehl)Order!,138
176,Mr KERR,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,The honourable member for Moore sits glumly in the background-Mr Ronaldson-Don't backtrack.,138
177,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable member on my left will not interject. He will certainly not interject from a seat which is not his own.,139
178,Mr KERR,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"What we have seen in this debate-and the rest is sideshow and shadow boxing-is that the Opposition is now content to rest with the substantive achievement of the former Attorney-General and the present Attorney-General in having the business community and the legal community accept the necessity for nationwide regulation under the responsibility of this Parliament. That is the position which all the States, the Commonwealth and the Territories now appear set to resolve. The rest is windowdressing. We heard this bewildering statementand I find this most interesting from a person who holds himself out to be a constitutional expert-that this Parliament is tainted with illegality, or words to that effect, by the manner in which it approached this legislation. It was suggested there. was some contempt in the process that Parliament used in passing this legislation. The honourable member for Higgins really needs to have some better understanding of the constitutional processes of this nation. He needs to have some reflection of what it is that this Parliament is charged with as a maker of laws. What occurred in the passage of this legislation was that the Government acted on the advice of the Solicitor-General of the. day, Sir Maurice Byers, QC-an eminen.t Queens Counsel responsible, I might say, in the High Court of Australia for winning some of the most important victories this Government has won in constitutional law reform such as the dams case, the Koowarta decisions and the like which have expanded Commonwealth authority over a range of matters which were thought not previously to be within the ambit of this Parliament's authority. ing on that device, this legislation was passed. The High Court found that this Parliament lacked the legislative power to deal with pre-incorporation matters. It does not lack the power to regulate companies. This Parliament is quite free to act unilaterally and decisively to implement this scheme without further reference to the States. But it would prefer not to do that because the process of incorporation would remain for the States. The bare bones of that incorporation process would have to remain with the States .. Stripped to its essentials this Commonwealth Parliament could simply leave it to the States to permit the incorporation of companies, and then take over the rest. That would leave the States with the barest of responsibilities. . The States themselves have recognised the limits of their capacity to bargain in . this situation. They recognise now that this Commonwealth Government, if pressed, will proceed in that way. It will act to do what is necessary in the interests of the Australian nation and company law reform. But obviously it is much better to pr9ceed on a basis which brings all the States and Territories with us. If that could have been possible 18 months ago--:-if, when the member for Moore was speaking on behalf of the Opposition, he had said we need to move in a cooperative way with the States--:",139
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable member will refer to the honourable member for Ryan by his correct title.,139
180,Mr KERR,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, my apologies; I should have referred to the honourable member for Ryan. I have mistaken the name for the electorate. Instead of looking backwards to. the cooperative scheme and insisting on its merits, if the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) had looked forward to the future and seen the advantages for Australia's corporate scene, if there was a national legislative program, and advocated that to the conservative and to the Labor States, then we might have been Actsome many months ahead of schedule now. We might have been in a situation where we could have proceeded on a cooperative basis in this Parliament rather than going through those quite ridiculous struggles in relation to the framing of the legislation and' wasting time when trying to preserve what is really an antiquated, ramshackle scheme that the Opposition now concedes should have been torn down and replaced with a national legislative program. From hearing what the honourable member for Higgins says, I am very pleased to note that there has been this very substantial change in the position of the Opposition. As awkward and tentative as it may be, it will be of moment to those who observe the realities that underlie the rhetorical position. The basic point we all need to note in this debate is that the people of Australia know that there are massive deficiencies in the way corporate law is presently administered. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, chaired by my colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), currently has before it a reference to look at the deficiencies in the law in relation to abuses that occur in corporate transactions outside the areas of insider trading but including the various practiCes like ramping and various other practices described to the Committee by the former Chairman of the National Companies and Securities Commission, Mr Bosch. He pointed out that Australia is one of the most poorly regulated nations in terms of corporate regulation, that investors are reluctant to invest in this country because there is a perception that the regulations can be abused by directors who cannot be fully brought into line for abuses of shareholders' trust, and that this country is seen by many commentators outside this nation as a land of cowboys and a place where fairly wild corporate abuse is possible. Given that that view i""s not just an academic view but one that is firmly entrenched in the Australian. community, which believes that it has seen many instances of actions that might be thought to have been directed by self-interest of directors and the like rather than the long term interest of shareholders, it is plain that the community will not accept a system of corporate regulation that is nonresponsive to those issues. So, we no longer are in an age or time with the mechanisms of the past, slow and nonresponsive as they were, and conceded to be slow and non-responsive. The point I make is that the report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, upon which colleagues from both sides of this House served, stated that the issues of corporate regulation, takeovers, management of corporations' activities, the prosecution functions, the c.ontrol of the issue of securities and the like should be solely governed by the Commonwealth. That is not a view 'that was simply put by this side in the debate; rather, it was a view accepted on both sides in ,that Joint Committee. So, we really have now moved to a position where it is accepted universally that the body of Commonwealth law that is responsible for corporate regulation should be in the hands of this Parliament and that we should have an Attorney-General who is responsible to this Parliament for the operation of the system. We have moved ,Very far in just the last 12 months. In that period we have seen the passage of legislation, which has passed this House and the Senate, and we have seen the Attorney-General, in a process of negotiation with the States, reach a position where I understand there is broad agreement that the Commonwealth should have all these powers and that it is simply a matter of administrative adjustments around the edges so that that can be put in place. There may be some discussion about funding arrangements and the like, but the principle has been resolved. We have now come to see the very thing that members of the Opposition warned us would be so destructive come to pass, and supported by them now. That is quite proper because it is an idea whose time has very truly come. The present Bills before us permit the effective ongoing operation of the corporate watchdog over a period when the NCSC and the ASC will be overlapping. They will permit one chairman to accept responsibility for both operations; it is a blending of the two schemes .. Ultimately the NCSC scheme will be eroded, let fall away, as it ceases to have further relevance. But what the legislation does is to permit a smooth transfer in that course. It allows that smooth transfer to occur in a context where the States can be fully engaged and come to a process of agreement. But if the States at the end of the day do act in a parochial and self-interested way and without regard to the national interest, then I am quite certain that the Attorney-General is made of stern enough stuff to make sure that we will proceed, unilaterally if necessary, to enforce a nationwide scheme of corporate regulation for the benefit of shareholders and consumers in the Australia public. That is a responsibility of this Parliament, and will be accepted as such. l now fully anticipate that it will not be necessary to proceed against the views of the States. I believe they now see that it is imperative that they fall into line in relation to this very important. issueI thank the House for the opportunity of contributing in this debate.

It was the split scheme in which certain powers were ceded to the Federal power and certain smaller areas, especially incorporation, were left for the States. That was deemed by all the interested parties to be ineffective and the operative option. Therefore, the third option was the enhanced cooperative scheme. That was the position that the Opposition took and supported, and it is precisely the position we have today.

184,Mr CREAN,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1990 amends the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 to preserve its continuity from 1 July 1990. The Act is otherwise scheduled to terminate on 30 June 1990. As a result of a non-Government amendment to the Bill in the Senate, the Bill further amends the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 to preclude grants being paid in respect of export expenditure that relates to X-rated videos and films and videos and films that have been refused classification by the Film Censorship Board. In light of the 30 June 1990 expiry date for the export market development grants scheme, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), as honourable members will recall, appointed a Committee for the Review of least Export Market Development Assistance in December 1988. This Committee, chaired by Professor Helen Hughes of the Australian National University, was charged with examining Government measures providing financial assistance for exporters under the Export Market Development Grants路 Act and schemes established under the Australian Trade Commission Act. The Hughes Committee presented its report to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce in July 1989. Honourable members will also recall that on 28 February this year the Prime Minister(Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce jointly released the Goy-ernment's decision on the Hughes Committee report. The Government accepted the majority of the Committee's recommendations. In that announcement, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce foreshadowed that amendments to the Export Market Development Grants Act arising out of the Government's adoption of the Hughes Committee's recommendations would operate from 1 July 1990. Whilst this is still to be the case, the recent election and the need to consult widely with interested bodies and persons about the precise nature of the new provisions required in a revised Export Market Development Grants Act to give effect to the Government's decision, and the regulations which will underpin many of the extended services which will now become eligible under the export market development grants scheme, precluded the required路 substantive amendments to the Export Market Development Grants Act being brought forward in this parliamentary sitting. The Government wants to ensure that all possible views are taken into account so that the best possible framework, within the limits of the Government's decision, is implemented in respect of the revised export market development grants scheme. Accordingly, this Bill has been brought forward at this time to preserve the continuity of the Export Market Development Grants Act so that no exporters will be disadvantaged by the Act lapsing through the effiuxion of time. It is intended to bring an Export Market Development Grants Amendment Act implementing the Government's announced changes to the export market development grants scheme forward in this year's Budget sittings, to be effective from 1 July 1990. No financial impact is expected to arise from the amendments extending the term of the Export Market Development Grants Act by six months. Any saving reSUlting from the Senate amendment to the Government's Bill is not readily quantifiable as, to date, only one relatively small payment has been made to an exporter in respect of such films and videos. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and I commend the Bill to the House.",141
185,Mr MCLACHLAN,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"Barker) (11.15)The Export Market Development Grants Development Bill 1990 has two elements. First, a six-month extension of the existing scheme and, secondly, provisions to prevent the payment of export market development grants (EMDG) in respect of expenditure incurred by a person exporting a film that has been or would be classified as an X-rated film, or refused classification. The provision to extend the existing arrangements is the sum total of the Government's changes to the EMDG scheme. To some extent, I suppose, this illustrates the Government's continuing failure to carry out its promises. As the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) has said, on 28 February Senator Button announced, at a joint press conference with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), a new assistance package for exporters. I suppose one could call it the Government election export policy. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) announced assistance packages which, in total, provided for cuts of $200m over five years. A press report on the following day said that the Minister had then changed his position four times and, finally, as to ultimate costs and benefits, he came out with a final conclusion that the proposed scheme would add over $13m over three years for exporters. The Prime Minister, and understandably so, was by this time left speechless-which is hard to believe. However, the final concliJsion in relation to a benefit to exporters would have been, in the context of an election, a very necessary conclusion. I think the last word on this escapade was uttered by Senator Button himself, who was overheard, when an aide proposed ways to limit the damage of the disastrous press conference, to say that it was irretrievable-and so it was. At the beginning of this session, the Government circulated the Export Market Development Grants Development Bill 1990 in draft form, proposing a five-year extension of the export market development grants scheme. It finally woke up that to extend the existing scheme for five years was an odd approach-a view that the Opposition had held since we first saw a copy of the draft Bill. The Government subsequently changed its mind and it has introduced the present Bill, allowing for only a six-month extension, no doubt to give itself some time to add to its own confusion. However, the whole issue of export incentives ,requires greater consideration by the ParlIament than tonight's guillotine debate allows. The issues are touched on in the report from the Hughes Committee for the Review of Export Market Development Assistance, which states, for example: Macro-economic policies are by far the most important determinants of exports. The rate of exchange dominates the profitability of exports - ut, except in the short run, the rate of exchange I- largely .t-e outcome of all of a country's cipal polIcies-fiscal, monetary, trade and income-and how they mesh together. It also says: Further micro-economic reforms are needed to bring down costs. By 'micro-economic reform', what the Hughes Committee and others who use the jargon mean is, enabling things to be d,?n- b-tter within Australia through elImmatmg waste and making use of our resources, both human and cattle. The Hughes report goes on to address areas where this process is essential, and it says: . . . protection still hinders exporters by raising the price of domestically produced goods above world prices. Further reduction of protection will make substantial contributions to competitiveness of Australian exporters and thus to the shift to exports. The reform of service tries . is equally important High costs in coastal shipping, on wharves, in railways, power and other utilities n,eed to be reduced to make Australia competitive. The report also notes that it is widely recognised that export subsidies destroy the international trading environment and are particularly harmful to small countries. It notes that the Industries Assistance Commission review of 1982 recommended an extension of the EMDG scheme for five years as an interim measure whilst the Australian economic environment was hostile to exporting. The Hughes Committee's recommendation that the scheme should be extended for a further five years has a similar basis. In other words, the Hughes Committee considered that because the factors which determine export competitiveness for Australian firms are so poor, most firms still need to be drip-fed subsidies to keep them alive and exporting. So it said that cutting out assistance to exporters would give the wrong signal. This conclusion is an indictment of the wasted opportunities and inaction of this Government. The coalition does not oppose the Bill. However, there is one matter that I would like the Minister for Science and Technology to clarify in his response to the second reading debate. The second reading speech and the explanatory memoranprindum say that the six-month extension of the scheme has no financial impact. My information is that to extend the scheme for six months would cost the Commonwealth between $80m and $100m. I seek the Minister's advice on this matter.",142
186,Mr ONEIL,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"ln speaking briefly to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill I must say that I was particularly interested in the amendment moved by Senator Harradine in the other place. I concur completely with the honourable senator on his amendment. I congratulate the backbenchers on this side of the Parliament who saw fit to support Senator Harradine's important amendment, because I think it is quite outrageous that somebody indus- who produced hard-core porn could apply for a subsidy from the Government and be supported. I believe there is nothing more outrageous than people who produce this filth, this garbage, to exploit Australian women in this case, selling it for profit to young people, people who are deviant and people who are perhaps not 100 per cent who are aroused by this material. All sorts of things run from this. Senator Harradine needs to be applauded, as do those on this side of the House who were quite concerned and worried about what was taking place. This very controversial and emotive issue involves questions about morality, public safety, censorship, denigration of women and other matters. I am pleased that on this side of the House we now have unanimous support to outlaw this terrible stuff. I think we are going a long way along the track of taking a more mature, responsible outlook on these sorts of things. I hope that this rubbish can be completely outlawed. During the election campaign I gave a commitment that I would do everything possible to stamp out this sort of material. This is the first step and it seems to me that I have great support across both sides of the House on this important issue. I congratulate Senator Harradine and I support members of this Parliament for taking this responsible step of supporting the amendment.",143
187,Mr CREAN,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"in reply-As both speakers have indicated, there are two aspects to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill: firstly, there is the extension of the current legislation by six months and, secondly, there is the encompassing in the Bill of what has been referred to as the Harradine amendment. I do not really want to speak just now to the latter point, which was referred to by the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), who is a member from this side of the House. But I do want to go to the question of the necessity for the extension set out in the Bill and the question that the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) has asked me. The extension was necessary because there simply has not been enough time for the formulation of legislation based upon full consideration of all of the recommendations from the Hughes Committee for the Review of Export Market Development Assistance. The Government has indicated its intention to adopt the recommendations. But in doing that, it needs to frame legislation having regard to the interest groups in the community that may have some concern with it. It is in that context that I think the honourable member' for Barker's concern about the guillotine being used in this debate is misplaced. After all, all we are doing tonight is extending that which currently exists. The substantive debate about the impact of the Hughes report and the implications of it being turned into legislation will come before the House in another Bill. That is where the opportunity will present itself to question, comment on or debate the aspects of government legislation. The new Bill, as foreshadowed in .the second reading speech which I have just made, will operate from 1 July this year. That is the reason why there is no financial cost impact. The Government has already factored into the cost of the new scheme an understanding as to what that scheme will cost operating from 1 July this year. Therefore, any extension of the current scheme cannot add to the cost. All we are doing is continuing the current scheme and putting on notice that the new scheme, which has been factored in, will operate from 1 July. So there is no net cost impact. All this legislation is going to do is cover the hiatus that could otherwise exist by it being argued that the current legislation no longer applies and there will be no opportunity for the new legislation to come before this House until the next session of Parliament. The purpose of this Bill is to do no more than ensure that that potential for hiatus does not exist. There is one路 final pont that I will allude to, given that the honourable member for Barker questioned the reduction in the amount-I think he mentioned a figure of $200m-that this Government will make over 5 years. I am advised-and I make this point at the outset-that funds for exporters, as a result of the new measures, will not be路 cut. Whatever people might want to say about the confusion surrounding the press conference in February, the clear, unequivocal commitment that the Government made and still holds to is that the funds will not be cut. Let me just try to address the question of the $200m shortfall that the honourable member for Barker alluded to. On the information available to me, the best estimate of likely payments in 1990-91. under the existing export market development grants rules-the honourable member for Barker should listen to this because he asked about it-if the current scheme were to continue to apply, was $162m. Because there are uncertainties in the value of the Australian dollar and the open nature of access to this scheme, it is impossible to predict with any certainty what the payments will be in 1991-92 and 1992-93 if we were not to adjust it. But, assuming that there are similar levels of payments to those which are proposed in 1990-91, it is estimated that the total the three years to 1992-93-if we did not change the scheme-would be $486m. Under the revised scheme announced by the Government, payments in support of exporters are projected to be $177m in 1990-91, $155m in 1991-92 and $167m in 1992-93, a total of $499m. The honourable member for Barker alluded to a $13m addition. I simply make the point that the proposal that we intend bringing forward by way of a more substantive Bill in the next session, which will improve access and the impact and direction of export marketing opportunities through direct government assistance, will be of enormous benefit to industry. I commend the Bill in its current form, which merely seeks to extend the term of the of the current legislation by six months so that we do not find ourselves potentially in a hiatus. I commend the Bill to the House.",144
188,Mr DOWNER,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"1 seek leave to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill, owning to the fact that some of the speeches were a little shorter than anticipated. Lea ve granted.",145
189,Mr DOWNER,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"I am sure that I will not be outrageously controversial and require the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) once more to repeat or refute some of the things I have to say. This Bill, as has been pointed out by others who have spoken before me, and by the Minister as well, is not in a sense the Bill that we on this side of the, House were expecting the Government to come forward with-a Bill which would have given expression to the. various statements made by Government Ministers, in particular Senator Button at the end of February, during' the election campaign, on this issue of export market development grants. It is interesting to reflect on the statements that Senator Button made at the end of February and the press coverage that was given to those statements, particularly in light of the present controversy regarding Senator Button's subsequent statements which he has made over the last few days. He announced that the over Government was going to proceed with a number of initiatives in reforming the export market development grants scheme. There was some disagreement and controversy over the co stings that Senator Button produced. I would have to say, without wishing to be disrespectful of the House and make too many party political points, that the newspaper headlines at that time make amusing reading in the current context. On 1 March 1990 the Canberra Times had a headline 'Button bungles again'; in the Age, 'Embarrassment for PM over slip by Button'; in the Sydney Morning Herald, 'Button's export plan blues anger PM'; in the Australian Financial Review, 'Button comes undone on new. funding policy'; and so on. There was some confusion on the part of the Australian Labor Party at that time as to what it was going to do with the export market development grants scheme. In a sense that confusion still remains because this particular legislation does not include the proposals that the Government was considering putting forward. But the Government did promise at that time, regardless of that, to act on the recommendations of the Hughes Committee For the Review of Export Market Development Assistance. I remind the House that the Hughes report does make quite excellent reading in terms of both this grant and the relevance of this grant to promoting Australian exports. As the s-a90w Minister for trade and trade negotIatIOns I would have to say that when I. browsed through the Hughes Committee路 report I found its discussion not only of the relevance and importance of the export market development grants scheme but also of the whole issue of why Australian exports have been as unsuccessful as t?ey have been over the recent years very Important reading. I commend the Hughes report to all members of the House. Of course, the Minister would have read the Hughes report but I would certainly commend it to other members of the House who may not have had the time that I have set aside in order to read that particular report. Let me take a little time in the context of this Bill to remind the House of some of the points made in the Hughes report and to encourage members in the context of this Bill to consider very seriously those points. They are most important points, perhaps not just for this House but for all Australians to consider. First of all, the Hughes Committee made the point that Australia was the only comparable country in recent years not to increase its ratio of exports to gross domestic product (GDP)-that is, taking a period of the last 30 years. But in the case of Australia, that ratio has remained stagnant at 15 per cent compared to between 20 and 65 per cent for other comparable countries. According to the Hughes report a country of our size should have had an export ratio to GDP of around 19 per cent. This is not a party political point. Because we are all involved in the process of trying to strengthen our export performance, it is a matter for all Australians to consider. Why it is-and the Hughes Committee made this point-that European countries such as Finland and Sweden, and I think that in a previous incarnation the Minister for Science and Technology may have visited Sweden on one occasion, with similar populations and less resources are able to export to countries not just in the European Community but to countries of Asia so successfully despite their distance from Europe, while we have made very little impression in recent years in what one could describe as our own backyard? That is a very major worry for Australia. The question we have to ask ourselves in the context of this legislation is whether the export markets development grants scheme, regardless of its strengths and weaknesses which were carefully identified by the Hughes committee,路 is in itself going to be able to turn around that performance and give us a performance even as good as the performance of some of the smaller European countries, such as Finland or Sweden. Let me remind the House that the Hughes Committee in reviewing export markets development grants made five or six important and significant points. One of those points was that over many years Australia has established what could broadly be described as a protectionist tradition. For a number of reasons, Australia .has had very high levels of protection which have closeted Australia from international competition. That has meant that at a country we have not been conducive to an aggressive export culture, which is the sort of culture we need to have as an island which will depend for its survival on a successful performance in the trading world. It is interesting to look just today at the statement made by the National Farmers Federation on lower tariffs on manufactured goods. The National Farmers Federation pointed out that it has been disappointed by the Federal Government's performance and reminded us that we have to continue the process of reducing levels of protection in order to develop an aggressive export culture in this country, open up our markets to international competition, and make us think more, particularly within our businesses and the trade union movement, about competing on an international scale rather than at the national level. The export markets development grant in itself will not make any difference. The fact is that we as a nation have to work very hard to develop that .expor.tculture. The second point made by the Hughes Committee-and it is not a point made by the Liberal Party or anybody elsewas that not enough work has been done in Australia to ensure that our macroeconomic policies put us in a position to ensure that we become sufficiently competitive. The author pointed out in her report that our inflation rate was stuck somewhere in the vicinity of 8 per cent, that we suffered from higher interest rates than a range of other comparable countries, and that as a路 result of our higher interest rates we had an artificially high exchange rate, which again made it all the more difficult for Australian exporters to get into appropriate markets. Interestingly enough, the Hughes r<eport also turned to the issue of taxation. That report made a very interesting point which the Government will need to think about carefully. It made the point that Australia suffered from a relative disadvantage-for example, in relation to European countries-because of the operation of our wholesale sales tax in this country and effect of the operation, of that tax on ports. The Hughes report made the very interesting point that if one compared the effect 'on exports of indirect taxes in the United Kingdom with the effect on exports of indirect taxes in Australia, one found that British exports had sufferedI think that. is the appropriate expression-about 50 per cent of the effect of indirect taxes as an influence on costs as compared to Australian exports. In other words, because of our existing wholesale sales tax system in this country, we put ourselves at a very substantial disadvantage as compared to countries in the European Community, New路 Zealand, importantly, and other parts of the world. Our wholesale sales tax regime imposes a tax on exports in a way that is comparable, if one could say that, to the direct tax regimes in those countries that in fact do not tax exports. We have put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage because of the operation of our taxation regime. A few dollars here and a few dollars there from an export market development grant are not going to make as much difference as a complete overhaul of our indireCt tax regime would make, and indeed has made in countries that have been prepared to produce those sorts of changes. The Hughes report also made the very important and oft spoken comment that we need to make significant changes to the micro-economic structure of our at country. The Hughes report referred to the disadvantages to Australian exporters which ensued from our coastal shipping system. She pointed out in her report that it was cheaper to ship cars to New Zealand via Tokyo than it was to ship those cars from Australia to New Zealand direct; that it was cheaper to freight from Hobart to Tokyo than from Hobart to Adelaide, which really is an appalling indictment of our coastal shipping in this country. She also referred to the problems we have with our rail system in Australia and the effect' this had on the capacity of Australian industries to export successfully. In addition, she made a reference to our communications sy-tem. The fact the is that, as the Hughes Committee pointed路 exout, the whole issue of micro""economic reform is again going to be so much more important than the Government providing a feV{ dollars here and. a few dollars there in order to help exporters. The Hughes Committee significantly went on to refer to the issue of productivity, again ali issue which is very much debated in the Australian community but I think it is worthy of repetition here in this debate. The Hughes Committee pointed out that Australians work the shortest day, the shortest week and the shortest year amongst comparable industrial countries. As a country which' has to export successfully to survive economically, that is a very worrying factor. It has certainly held us back above all in our manufacturing industries. While manufacturing industries have seen the fastest growth in trade throughout the world since the 1950s, Australia in effect has continued to ride on the sheep's back. That is a comment often made, but it is important to note that in the area of manufacturing, because of our industrial relations system and because of the failure to improve productivity as a country, we simply not succeeded in getting successfully into export markets. The fourth point the Hughes Commitwish tee made was a question of standards. When it comes to exporting we apply standards for Australia-for Australian industry, for Australian consumers, Australian community in general-which are not necessarily relevant to the counBill tries overseas to whom we wish to export. Again, because of what is in effect governthese ment regulation, we are inhibiting ourmember selves in terms of getting into export markets. In conclusion, I think it is important for everyb<;ldy in the House to understand that when we are debating a Bill such as this, a Bill about extending the life of the export market development grants scheme, we have to consider the significance. of the quiver. that in terms of its overall objective. The overall objective is do something to courage Australian exports, but we will not succeed in developing Australian ports if we simply rely on measures such as this. The Hughes Committee emphainstructive sised this so strongly. We have to break down the protectionproblem ist tradition and build up an export culraised ture. We have to change significantly macro-economic policies and reconsider our taxation policies to see how we can change those again in order to encourage exports. We must carry out that much World War. debated process of micro-economic reform and improve our levels of producable tivity. If we do not do those sorts of things, measures such as the extension the export markets development grant will be little more than a waste of money. The Australian community must underbase stand that this Bill is nothing more than a waste of money unless we really tackle the issues at their heart. This is a bandaid measure-it is not a panacea in any way at all for our fundamental problems in trying to turn around our balance of payhaving ments. The business community should not think that it is; the general commuthis nity should not think that it is. That is not a reason for us to reject or disapprove of the Bill, but it is important that we our understand the true issues, rather than have being deflected by cosmetic measures.",145
190,Mr CREAN,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"by leave-I to make a few very brief comments in response. I will not take too much of the time of the Hous-, but I was interested in the comments made by the for the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). I am sure that when the new comes before the House we will all have the opportunity to debate some of issues more fully. The honourable rightly points out, and I agree with him, that the export market development grants scheme is not the only initiative that one can rely on in terms of fostering our exports. No-one on this side of the House is pretending that this legislation, or the legislation that we will bring forward next session, is the only arrow in The honourable member alluded to a ennumber of questions that were raised in the report of the Hughes Committee for exthe Review of Export Market Development Assistance and I think it would be for me to try to address a couple of those points at this stage .. The in terms of many of the issues in the Hughes report as to why we our have not an effective export culture is essentially caused by the policies pursued in this country by the governments of the day for almost 30 years after the Second I make this point because the honourmember raised the point about the essential nature of competitiveness. It is of not just a simple question of becoming a competitive nation. I accept the fact that competitiveness is essential if our export is to grow, but the honourable member should look at the position in which Australia found itself when this Government came to office in 1983. Within the space of two years, having floated the dollar, having halved the inflation rate and witnessed the largest drops in unit labour costs that this country had seen, Government made Australia more competitive than it had been for three decades. Yet we did not see the investment response going into exports. Why? Because investment in this country had been encouraged to go off shore and produce for a domestic market behind a high wall of tariffs that the previous coalition governments had built up in this country. It did not see the need to develop export growth in a global market context. It was the Opposition's fault that that happened. The coalition was responsible. The parties that the Opposition represents in this chamber left us with that legacy after the war. They failed us and we have been trying to claw that investment back over the past seven years. I might say that we have been clawing that back quite significantly. The Whitlam Government between 1972 and 1975 and this Government are the only ones to have reduced tariffs. There was a 25 per cent cut under the路 Whitlam Government and there has been 35 per cent under this Government. Where was the cut from the Opposition side? Not one cut in tariff at any stage. The Opposition built the wall and it did not dismantle it. That is what we have to say about the high level of protection. The Opposition was responsible for it; we have been doing our best to try to get Australia competitive again through the broad macro policies on competitiveness by addressing the protection levels. In the Governor General's speech we are committed to further addressing that question for the future. This export market development grant approach is part of a number of measures that this Government is .taking to boost our export growth. It is why we have another three years to implement it. At the end of that three years we will have made significantly more progress and certainly far more progress than was ever made by those on the other side of the House.
