1,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"H as the Vice-President of the Executive Council read the follow, ing paragraph, which appeared in the Age of Monday last, and refers to the proposed inquiry into the charges made in this House against Major Hawker:The particular form in which the attack on Major Hawker by a small section of members of with has not been finally determined .by the Minister pf Defence. It is understood, however, that it will take .the shape of a. sort of round ^able conference, over, which Mr T. Ewing will preside, at the request of his colleague j the Minister' of Defence, Major Hawker will be present, and the. aggrieved members of Parliament will be there, too, with permission to ask., that officer questions relevant to their attack in Parliament. I do not ask if the whole of this extraordinary statement is true, because complete accuracy would be obviously too much to expect from the Age; but I wish tb know if the honourable gentleman intends to preside at the gathering referred to, and what members of Parliament, if any, - will be permitted to cross-examine Major Hawker? Will any honourable member who cares to be present be regarded as for the time being an "" aggrieved member,"" and, as such, be permitted to take part in the performance?",12
2,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I have not read the paragraph referred to, though I have heard of it . I can assure the honourable member that the .statement is not correct, and no one who heard what I had to say on F r i day last would imagine that any arrangement could have been made at so early a date as last Monday. NA Mr CARPENTER ; - I desire, Mr . Speaker, to again put to you, in another for m , the question which I asked yesterdayWhether, in the event of any Bill being introduced by the Government, proposing on increased duty on stripper harvesters only, an amendment would be in order which proposed to deal with any article other than that specified in the title of the Bill? My reason for asking this question is that the matter bas been discussed by some honourable members, who wish to know if the Government have power to introduce a Bill of the character referred to without re-opening the T a r if f as a whole.",13
3,Mr SPEAKER,ALTERATION OF THE,"In the absence of any Bill , and of any specific amendment to be proposed in any Bill , I can only in for m the honourable member generally that tp any Bill to amend the T a r if f it w o u l d be in order to move amendments relating to other items than those originally included m the proposal, subject to the provisions of standing orders 170, 171, i 6 , and 247NA INSTRUCTIONAL STAFF.",13
4,Mr CHANTER,QUEENSLAND MILITARY," asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Will he cause the Commandant of the Queensland Branch of, the Defence Force to produce, for the information of honourable members of this House, the correspondence referred to in circular 16, issued from District HeadQuarters, Brisbane, and dated ioth October, and which is put forward as a justification for the circular referred to, which reflects strongly on the zeal, intelligence, and ability of Warrant and Non-commissioned Officers of the Instructional Staff in Queensland? 3. Does the Minister consider that the language in which the above-mentioned circular is couched, whether justified or not, is in accordance with the letter! or spirit of paragraph 228 pf the. new Statutory Rules and Regulations for the Military Forces of the Commonwealth?",13
5,Mr EWING,QUEENSLAND MILITARY,"In reply to the honourable member's questions, I have been in formed^1. The Commandant states that there is no correspondence in connection with the circular referred to (copy attached). It was issued with the idea of general and not special application, because, from time to time, vouchers for claims by Warrant and Non-Commissioned Officers of the - Instructional Staff have been incorrectly rendered, necessitating much correspondence and extra postage. The Commandant considered the circular would effect a desirable remedy. 2. The second paragraph of the circular, which TARIFF. is applied to all warrant and Non-Commissioned Officers of the Instructional Staff, appears to the Minister to be of too general a character in view of the regulation referred to. The circular itself is aB follows :"" MILITARY FORCES OF ' IH E COMMONWEALT H, QUEENSLAND . "" District'Head-Quarters, "" Brisbane, 19th October, igoj . "" Subject - Voucher s incorrectly rendered by W.O.'s and N.C.O.'s of the Instructional Staff. "" F r o m D.A.Q.M.G., Queensland. "" i . A large volume of correspondence in the offices of the D.A.Q.M.G . and the Accountant is necessitated by vouchers being constantly' incorrectly rendered by Warrant and Non-Commissioned Officers of the Instructional Staff for personal claims, such as travelling, &c. "" 2. The inattention to instructions and the ignorance of financial regulations displayed in the above instances is very discreditable, and the Commandant demands a great improvement in the future. "" 3. It is part of the duty of Warrant aiid Non-Commissioiied Officers of the Instructional Staff to thoroughly acquaint themselves with regulations, and in future glaring errors in render7 ing vouchers will be treated as neglect of duty, and dealt with accordingly. "" 4 . The Commandant desires that the above be communicated to all Warrant and Non-Commissioned Officers of the Instructional Stiff attached to the unit under.your command, and that this circular, which is to be retained in your office, should be initiated by them.

6,Mr SALMON,QUEENSLAND MILITARY,"for Sir JOHN QUICK) asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice Whether it is true that the old rule allowing the postage of circulars to be paid in bulk if posted in batches of at least 100 (thus avoiding,the necessity of affixing a stamp on each circular) has been altered by requiring that not less than £ 1 worth shall be posted at a time to secure the concession; and, it so, what are the reasons for insisting on such a condition, and will he restore the old rule without the condition?",13
7,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUEENSLAND MILITARY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :Prior to the transfer of the Department to the Cbmmonwieajth, tfie rule with respect to this matter varied in the several States. South Wales it was necessary that the postage should amount to at least £ 1 . In South Australia, not less than 500 circulars were accepted; and in Queensland, 300 circulars were necessary to oEtain the application of the rule. The existing regulation comes between the previous extremes. It is not considered desirable to revert to the old \""ic.torian regulation referred to, as for departmental reasons it is necessary to confine within reasonable limits the system of paying postage by cash.

The ferring to the financial position of the Post Office, stated that if the interest on transferred properties and the total amount expended out of revenue on works were taken into consideration, a deficiency of about ,£450,000 would be shown. It is, however, only fair to the Commonwealth Ad'ESTIMATES. ministration to remember that, since Federation, no less than £700,000 has been expended, or is proposed to be expended this year, out of revenue upon works, most of which, under States administration, would have been charged to loan accounts. The 2 T actual revenue of the Department exceeded its expenditure last year by over. £60,000, without taking into account an expenditure of about £120,000 for works and buildings, which, under the States systems of finance', would have been charged, to loan account. These figures show a great improvement on previous years.",14
10,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,But we are not paying interest on the properties transferred to the Commonwealth.,15
11,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Neithe r was interest paid on those properties under States administration, when the erection of telegraph lines, and the construction of post-offices was - charged chiefly to loan accounts'.",15
12,Mr BAMFORD,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The interest was paid out of the consolidated revenue.,15
13,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Yes . It was not charged against the Post Office, though - any business man would agree that it should have been so charged. It would be interesting to know from the Treasurerand I referred to the matter during the Budget debate-wha t are the views of the Government in respect to borrowing. Speaking in this Chamber oh the 26th May, 1904, he said I am altogether ^opposed to the contention that we should not construct any public works, or embark on any enterprise, unless we have the necessary capital in hand. Such a policy would not tend to the development of this country. . . . Public borrowing has been a benefit to Australia, and I feel that the Labour Party have not merely been assisted by, but practically owe their existence as a party to the public borrowing policy of the States If a country is to be benefited, the Government must make its highways, or allow private enterprise to step in and do so How do honourable members opposite reconcile the attitude of the Labour Party in New South Wales with their statement that they .are opposed to public borrowing? The stand which' they take up reminds me very much of a man who, having sucked all the good out of an orange that it is possible for him to obtain, says that he does not like oranges. I think that it is very important that we should have apronouncement on this question. In my opinion, the fact that Commonwealth Governments have been compelled to pay for public works out of revenue has saved thousands of pounds, because the Department has been compelled to be more economical than it would other-' wise have been. Whilst I admit that sometimes difficulty is experienced in finding the funds necessary to carry out certain works, we shall in the end derive great advantage from the fa,;t that we have not resorted to loan moneys for the construction of telegraph and telephone lines, and the erection of post-offices. Take, for instance, the case of the proposed telephone line between Melbourne and Svdney, which is estimated to' cost about £40,000. I know that some exception has been taken to that expenditure, but the reports «lhow that when the line is. constructed we shall probably derive a revenue representing a return of at least 10 per cent, upon the outlay-that is without taking into consideration the loss of telegraph businessthat may result from the installation of the telephone system between the two capitals. I am one of those who believe that the public convenience should be our first consideration, and that we should not be deterred from offering the most improved facilities merely because we may incur a slight loss in the first instance.  member carry out that policy when he was Postmaster-General ?",15
14,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I think I did. my share.  well, but not haJf enough.",15
15,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I admit that I did not do half as much as I should ' have liked to do. I mentioned the case of the proposed telephone line between Melbourne and Sydney to indicate that if we continued to construct such works out of revenue"" we should before long derive-> considerable profit from an outlay which would be subject to no interest charge, such as would attach to expenditure out of loans. Some reference'has been made to the.delays which have occurred in the Department and - to the red-tape methods followed. The experience I gained in the Post Office showed me that during the earlier stages of the Federation, the officers connected with the central staff were called upon to perform more work than they could possibly attend to. When this matter was brought under my notice, I had no hesitation in giving instructions for the employment of as many men as were required to bring the work up-to-date. I also expe-. rienced considerable difficulty in obtaining reliable information with regard to various matters requiring attention-in the States. We had to depend almost entirely upon the reports of the officers in those States, and I thought it desirable to introduce an improved system. I made a suggestion to my colleagues-whic h I am very glad to 1 see has beeni adopted by the present Government-that we should appoint a chief electrician and a chief inspector, the former to report upon all matters relating to telegraphs and telephones, and the latter to ad vise the Minister in regard to postal and other matters. I . thought it desirable that'we should have an officer occupying a position quite independent of the States staffs upon whose work he might be called upon to report, and also quite free from local inelectrician fluences when the question' of constructing .new works Had to be considered. It peared to me that under such a system .the Minister would be in a better position .to deal with the matters brought under his notice from a purely Commonwealth point of view. I followed this principle in two - or three cases to the extent of selecting - capable officer in one State, and sending him to another to report upon matters re-quiring investigation there. For instance, I had strong representations made to me with regard to the unsatisfactory state affairs in the Post and Telegraph Departposal ment in Western Australia, and I approved of an officer from New South Wales being despatched to report upon the general ministration. The result was that recomwork would cost about £5,600. mendations were made which will result in a"" saving of £8,000 or £10,000 during the current year, and probably a manent saving of. £5,000 per annum, besides which the efficiency of the - service will be increased. That stance and others appear to me to afford full justification for proposed tions to the central staff. When I recently out at a cost of not more than £200. referred to this matter exception was to my statement with regard to the condito tion of affairs in Western Australia in - early days.",15
16,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Not at all.,16
17,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The right honourable member for Swan stated that had done nothing during my administration to improve the condition of affairs in and Western Australia. I have no doubt that system the honourable member for Coolgardie, Belgiumhasandbeenother when he was in charge of the Department, _ felt the want of reliable officers attached proved ' to the central staff.",16
18,Mr WEBSTER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Are the officers to now in existence?,16
19,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,No . Up t the concerned. present we have-had to utilize the services of departmental officers in various States.,16
20,Mr BAMFORD,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Are there officers in Commonwealth service competent to perhas form this work ?,16
21,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Yes , but the honourable member wili understand that head-quarters staff are.kept fully Mr Mahon.^-IS not Mr Hesketh attached to the central staff?",16
22,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Onl y temsystem porarily, in connection with the preparaenjoyed tion of special reports. Provilion is on the Estimates for the salary of a chief and a chief inspector, but those appointments cannot be made by the Public apService Commissioner until the Estimates are passed. I believe that if we select the right men, and I am sure that we have thoroughly qualified officers in the service, we shall, under the proposed new system, effect savings amounting to many thousands a of pounds per annum. The honourable member for Maranoa last night mentioned a - case which indicated the advantage to be derived from sending officers possessed of special qualifications to report-upon matters of arising outside their own States! A prowas made to construct a telephone line from Brisbane to Gympie, and the officers connected with the Telegraph Departadment! inr Queensland estimated that the It was felt that the revenue would not warrant any such, large expenditure, perand I decided to send to Queensland 1 Mr Hallam, a telegraph officer in Tasmania possessing special qualifications, in with a view to the installation of a telephone service on the condenser system. addiThat work has been successfully carried I taken mentioned the . case of Mr Hallam the Public Service Commissioner, with a the view to making better use of his services than by continuing to employ him as a telegraph operator.",16
23,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"He is a good man, and I has been very badly treated hi Tasmania.",16
24,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I thought so, I acted accordingly. The condenser tried for many years in countries, and has successful, but a great deal of care and attention are required to insure efficient working. In Western Australia failure referred resulted owing, to a large extent, to the neglect of some * of the officers 0 I took drastic steps in connection with that matter, because I think that cases of that kind should be specially the guarded against. . The condenser system been largely availed of recently, but it requires special aptitude on the part of the officers, and I believe that when the opethe rators become more accustomed to it it will engaged. prove exceedingly valuable.",16
25,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The trouble was that the honourable member introduced the condenser only between places which already telegraphic communication. The made honourable member did not attempt to avail himself of that system if there were no telegraph or telephone lines already in existence.,16
26,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The honourable member is not correct. I arranged for the construction of branch lines from main telegraph wires, utilizing trees instead of telegraph poles, and so on, thus enabling the telephone sendee to be conducted over the branch telephone lines and the main telegraph wire oni the condenser system.  where there were no trees ?",17
27,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Othe r arrangements would have to be made. The condenser system has been very largely applied in New South Wales, and as it has met with wide public appreciation, even in places where telegraphic facilities formerly existed, the revenue has been largelyadded to.",17
28,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,But the people who require it most are deriving no advantages .whatever.,17
29,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"That is another matter altogether. The honourable member will admit that where a telegraphic service exists, there is no excuse ing to also instal a telephone service, if that work can be cheaply carried out, and the public convenience will be promoted. Already no less than 400 towns in the Commonwealth have been provided with telephone communication on the condenser system during the last twelve months. This benefit has been conferred at a comparatively small cost, in some cases amounting fo only from £ 5 to £ 1 0 , whereas if special lines had had to"" be constructed, an additional, outlay of probably £50,000 would have been involved. Under certain conditions, it has nob been considered necessary to require the residents to give guarantees. The' risk in the case of condenser and tree lines was exceedingly small, and I thought that the Department ought to be prepared to take it, and acted accordingly. I do not think that we have sufficiently availed ourselves of the opportunities afforded for attaching telephone wires to trees and fences. It seems to me absurd that we should construct expensive telephone lines where the wires can be attached to trees for a portion of the distance, and to poles for the other portion. I am glad to say that these cheap lines have been very largely availed of. ",17
30,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I can mention a number of places in New South Wales where the wires have been hung upon trees and fences, and I can also cite cases in Victoria and other States where these cheap lines are working splendidly.. In reply to the argument that - the claims of rural districts are being ignored by the Department, I may mention that the erection of no less than 400 cheap telephone lines to country towns were approved during my term of office. During the course of this debate, some objection has been taken to the guarantee system. I admit that under the old regulation very great hardship was suffered by rural districts. In this connection I may mention a 'case in the Illawarra district. There it was proposed that a line should be constructed from Sydney fo Wollongong, at an estimated cost of £3,100. The work, however, was carried out under' the condenser system for an expenditure of about £ 5 0 , and the line is giving every satisfaction. In that case the guarantee originally sought was £750, but, at a later period, it was reduced to £420, and eventually the line for refus- was constructed for £ 5 0 .",17
31,Mr BAMFORD,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,And without any guarantee ?,17
32,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Yes . The . Department will be returned the whole of the capital cost of that line during the first year of its operations. Under the system which was previously in force, if the estimated cost of a line was £1,500,"" the applicants were required to enter into a guarantee to pay £ 1 6 0 or £180 annually for two years. They had to pay down two years' interest at r 2 j per cent, on the capital ex'pended, and also to enter into a bond to pay the interest for a further period of five years. To demand that the farmers in any district should pay £ 1 60 annually for two years w'as practically asking an impossibility. However, a regulation was approved by our Government under which they are merely called upon to guarantee the difference between the estimated revenue and the interest upon the capital expended. During my term of office I do not think that a guarantee has been given in a dozen cases since the commencement of the year. On account of the amended regulation to which I have referred, there was no necessity to do so. Owing to the introduction of the condenser system there was, in most cases, really no guarantee required.",17
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The condenser system is fatal to the guarantee. There is no doubt about that.,18
34,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I do not think that a guarantee has been taken in a dozen cases since the beginning of the year. The best evidence that these cheap lines have succeeded is that we do not hear many complaints from honourable members regarding the necessity for constructing new lines. I admit that over such a Jarge area as the Commonwealth there must necessarily be places where telephonic communication is urgently required. We ought, as far as possible, to extend those facilities to country residents.",18
35,Mr MAI,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,ION - The honourable member did not play that tune when he was in office.,18
36,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I .think that I did, and I ask the honourable member to point to a case which will support his contention.",18
37,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I can refer to several.,18
38,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Probably the honourable member has the application for telephonic extension to Black Range in his mind. In that case the-paper's showed that the loss which would have been incurred precluded the necessary expenditure. Last evening the honourable member for Barrier stated that during my term of office he brought under my notice the fact that sweating was being practised in connection with our inland mail contracts. That matter was not lost sight of. I called for a return showing the number of men employed, the number of hours that they worked, and the wages which they received, and I insisted upon their receiving the ordinary rate of wages paid to men occupying similar positions in private employ, and also that they should be called upon to work only the same number of hours. Since this regulation has been in force the Department has received communications showing that a great improvement has been effected in that respect."" The information supplied showed that in some instances the coach drivers of our inland mails were required to work very long hours fndeed. Last evening the honourable' member for Herbert urged that the Government should fix the amount which they were prepared to pay in'connection with each inland mail contract, and invite applications for the conveyance of those mails. I think it will be generally recognised that it is far better to call for tenders, and thus to insure a certain amount of competition. If the Commonwealth were compelled to run coaches for the sole purpose of carrying our inland mails, the cost involved would be very considerable. But in many country districts the present contractors carry not only mails but passengers. They look to the passenger traffic as a source of revenue. As a rule, the men themselves are the best judges as to what' amount will pay them for the services which they render. Ii would be very difficult for the Department to assess the sum which should be paid in connection with each mail service, and to subsequently decide who should carry out that service.",18
39,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,It would be as difficult as it is to deal with applications for Government billets.,18
40,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The Minister would find an impossible task - imposed upon him. At the present time he experiences very great trouble in choosing between two tenderers whose prices for a contract are equal. If the Postmaster General were required to do as the honourable member for Herbert suggests, he would have no time to devote to the discharge of the more serious duties of his office. Reference has been made to the penny postage system. Everybody would, like to see that system established. But the point at issue is whether the Commonwealth can, at the' present juncture, afford to bear the loss of revenue that would be occasioned by its adoption ? Mr DAVID THOMSON.^-j-Decidedly not.",18
41,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The estimated loss to the Department which the introduction of that system would entail is more than £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 annually. The honourable member for Cowper quoted statistics last night with a view to showing that the introduction of penny postage in Victoria had resulted not in a loss, but in a gain to the revenue. But he omitted to take into consideration the fact that that system was introduced in April, 1901, almost immediately after the Seat of Government, together with the central 1 staffs of the Commonwealth Departments, Wad been temporarily established in Melbourne, and he overlooked the alterations which have been made in our postal regulations as well as the ordinary increase which has taken place in the postal business. When these matters are taken into contion sideration, it is estimated that the Departber ment loses £50,000 a year as the result of the operation of the penny postage syspartment tem. I admit that it is very difficult arrive at a correct estimate in regard these matters. The condition of the finances in most of the States",18
42,Mr DAVID THOMSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"In Queensland especially, because she has such a large territory.",19
43,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I do not master, know whether Queensland would be prepared to incur the loss that would be occasioned by the establishment of penny postage, but I apprehend that she would not. When the British postal authorities to complain. submitted a proposal to the late Government to adopt penny postage from EngSouth land if the domestic rate ruled between here and the old country, I felt justified in recommending my colleagues to adopt the Empire rate of 2d - that is, tb apply of this kind. the rate at present in force in Australia all British mails. Because we agreed do that, the British Government to bring penny postage into operation as between the old .country and Australia. Gradually the system is being extended to Canada, India, and other places. The reduced rate will involve little, any, loss. If I remember rightly, it was estimated that the adoption of the 2d. rate rested. would mean a loss of about £7,000 per annum, assuming that it did not lead to any increase in the volume of correspondreports ence, and the Department considered that it would be well justified in incurring that loss for the sake of inducing the British on the outlay. Government to adopt penny postage in respect to letters sent from England to tralia. But, as the adoption postage throughout the Commonwealth would mean a loss of something like £250,000 per annum, it behoves the Goclays, vernment to seriously consider whether they would be justified, in view of the present state of the finances,in bringing about reform. While in hearty sympathy with the movement, I am afraid that, having gard to our financial position, such alteration at the present time would not be justifiable. The deputy-leader of the position supported the request made by honourable member for Barker in regard a mail service for Pinnaroo. The ter was under the consideration of the partment during my term of office, and believe that it has also received the attenof the present Minister. If I rememrightly, it was shown that the service would involve a heavy loss which the Dedid.not feel that it would be justito fied in incurring. We have had rather a to painful experience in connection with one or two works in South Australia, notably in regard to the construction of the telegraph line to Tarcoola. That line cost about £14,000; but at the present time, after providing for the salary of the local postit yields a nett revenue of only about £ 5 0 a year.  Australian Government paid for that line, there is no reason for the Commonwealth",19
44,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I admit that Australia had to bear the cost of constructing the line; but it must be remembered that none of the States have any control over our expenditure upon works We deduct the .cost from to the revenue returnable to them, and; alto though they may complain, they have to consented submit to the inevitable.  a separate account of the revenue from the trunk telephone, line between Sydney and Melbourne, we shall be able next year to if determine the return that it gives. That is a matter in which the States are inteMr SYDNEY SMITH. - Before proposing that work, we were careful to obtain not only from the electricians, but from several accountants; - and thesa showed that it would return fair interest  Auspose to keep' a separate account of the of penny revenue from that line?",19
45,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"^-I think that it ought to be kept separate. In the early unfortunately, a separate account' was not kept' of the revenue and expenditure from the various telephone services. I have that referred to the Pinnaroo. mail service, simply because of the reference made to it reby the honourable member for Barker. I an know that the Department is anxious to provide the service asked for,' and the honOporable member should endeavour to induce the the South Australian Government to come to to its assistance. At the present time, matthe Government of that State demand on Decompletion of the railway something like I £45 0 per annum for carrying the mails by rail to Pinnaroo; but as the estimated revenue is only about £ 5 0 per annum, the Department is not disposed to agree to the proposal. I believe that it is prepared to give the whole of the /revenue derived from this service, as well as a substantial bonus, to the Railway Department for the carriage of the mails.",19
46,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Is the Commonwealth absolutely at the mercy of the State authorities in this respect ? Can they charge whatever they please? , Mr SYDNEY SMITH - Any dispute may be submitted to arbitration.  week would the South Australian Railway Department carry, in ""return for the £ 4 5 0 per annum ?",20
47,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"They would Carry a mail by each train running to Pinnaroo. The point raised by the honourable member for Boothby is an important one. For some time the States Governments have been demanding additional rates for the conveyance of mails by r a i l ; and when "" 1 was in office I found that in many cases we could carry the mails by means of a motor car or 'bus for less than the amount charged by the railways. I discussed the matter with the Secretary to the Post and Telegraph Department; and we called for reports as to the weight of the mail matter. carried on the railways, and the price for which it would be carried at ordinary parcels rates. In Great Britain, the Post and Telegraph Department can call upon the railway companies to fix their time-tables to - suit its convenience; but in Australia the Railway Departments have refused in some cases to comply with such requests on the part of the Commonwealth Government. It must not be forgotten that the carriage of parcels by the Railway Department involves the employment of a number of booking clerks and other officials; whereas the mails are in charge of officers of the Postal Department.",20
48,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"How do the rates for mails compare with the parcels rates? Mr SYDNEY 'SMITH - The report to which I referred had not been supplied when I retired from office; but I know that the rates are not uniform. I should like to illustrate the point which I made as. to the fact that some of the trains are not run to suit the convenience of the Postal authorities. For instance, the Melbourne express which leaves Sydney every Friday at 7.50 p.m. carries mails from New South Wales and Queensland, which do not arrive in Melbourne until about 1,15 p.m. on the following day, when it is too late to deliver them within ordinary office hours in either the city or the suburbs. The result is that mails leaving Queensland on Thursday morning, and Sydney on Fridaynight, are not delivered in Melbourne until Monday morning, and it is impossible for replies to be delivered in Sydney until Tuesday, and in Brisbane until the f o l lowing Thursday. When I was in office, I took the view that ..a more up-to-date system was necessary, and I suggested that the Railway Department of New South Wales should despatch the mails on Friday afternoon, in time to allow of their reaching Melbourne at about 11.30 a.m. on the following day. I also suggested that a sorting-car should be attached to the train at Wodonga, so that the mails might be sorted, and ready for delivery, immediately upon their arrival here.",20
49,Mr CULPIN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"That would be a most desirable reform. Mr SYDNEY SMITH!-Quite so. The reply that was received, however, was that if this were done, passengers by the mail train would have to rise too early for breakfast at Albury. I trust, however, that the Postmaster-General will make further representations to the States' authorities, and endeavour to secure this desirable reform.",20
50,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What is to happen to the people of Pinnaroo while this wrangle between the Commonwealth and State is going on?,20
51,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I admit that the people of that town are placed in an unfortunate position, but the State Government should come to their assistance.",20
52,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Shoul d there not be some means of throwing the responsibility on the State authorities?,20
53,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The dispute could be submitted to arbitration, but we know that that process is a very leisurelv one, and some time would elapse before finality could be reached. I think that my honourable friend should endeavour to induce the State authorities to come to the assistance of the Commonwealth in this regard. In view of the fact that the estimated revenue from this source is only £ 5 0 per annum, the honourable member must recognise that £ 4 5 0 per year for the carriage of the mails would be altogether too much to pay.",20
54,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The receipts have increased considerably since the honourable member left office.,21
55,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I am speaking only from a knowledge of the facts as they were presented to me. I am sure that the Department would be only too glad to assist the honourable member in this matter. They have been prevented from doing so by the demands made upon them by the railway authorities of South Australia.,21
56,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,There would have been no trouble of this kind prior to Federation; mail facilities would then have been provided.,21
57,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"If these facilities would have beera given under the State administration prior to Federation, surely the State authorities might come to the assistance of these people now. If they did so, I feel certain that the Minister would be only too glad to grant Any principle that is adopted in dealing with matters of this kind must be applied uniformly. Reference has been made reto peatedly to the need for working the partment on business lines, but, at the time, there are occasions when the developin ment taking place in a district has turned I approved a probable loss into a profit. Sir LANGDON' BONYTHON - This district is newly settled, but, in a short time, undoubtedly toe a flourishing one.",21

60,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"So far as I * remember, the reports about Tarcoola showed that there was likely to be ah crease of settlement there which would rant the Department in incurring a loss the first instance.",21
61,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The two cases are quite different ,21
62,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"What is asked for in this case is a postal service, but what asked for in the case of Tarcoola was telegraph line over new country.",21
63,Mr SYDNE YSMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I am not opgive posed to the granting of facilities where that is possible, and the fact that so complaints have been made during the deapetf bate shows that the Department is willing to do all it can to afford means of commuof nication to new places.",21
64,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,It is ridiculous that place worth building a railway to should not have a post-office.,21

Mr SYDNE.Y SMITH - The fact that the State Government have undertaken to build a railway to-this place is an indication of a belief in its prosperity. The honourable member might assist the Department by urging the State authorities to do something to help.",21
66,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,All the delay should be thrown on the State authorities.,21
67,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"We should encourage the pioneers who are developing the country, and if the State authorities are satisfied that this is a growing and prosperous place, they should be prepared to assist the people living there to get the facilities for which they ask.",21
68,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Instead of requiring them to travel forty-five miles their request. for their letters.,21
69,Mr SYDNE YSMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I admit that the case is a very hard one. Coming now the subject of telephones, I would like Deto say that when I was in office the same Electrical Committee submitted a report which they suggested several alterations. of several reductions in the rates, but I understand that they have not yet been carried into effect. will I am sure that it is not because the Postmaster-General does not approve of them.",21
70,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Regulation s are being prepared in regard to most of them, disand they are well on their way to being",21
71,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"On e of the changes which I recommended was the abolition of the 2^d. fee, or fine, demanded inbefore any inquiry would be made in rewargard to a letter going astray. I believe in that in some of-the States the Department even went to the expense of sending complainants a reminder that the deposit of this amount had not been made, and that, therefore, no inquiry could take place. It was seemed to me that there was no good reason a for making the charge. I thought that the Department should be only too ready to information. It was not the amount of the charge that was objected to by'the few public, but the annoyance caused by such y charge. So far. effect has not been given to niy decision. There were a number very important suggestions, however, to which I felt that I could not give effect a until I knew the exact financial position of the telephone service. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to get information on that subject, because it has not been the practice of the States to keep separate accounts in connection with the revenue' and expenditure of the telephone and telenecessity graph branches.  member think that it would be a good thing to issue an annual balance-sheet connection with the administration of Post and Telegraph Department?",21
72,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I felt that the Government would not be justified in agreemy ing to any important alterations of sysquired tem until the exact position of affairs had been ascertained, so that they might know whether the system which it was proposed to alter had worked well or badly. The be information which I desired had not been compiled when I left office. It is, in opinion, very advisable that the accounts of the telephone and telegraph services should be kept separate. Occasionally, of very easily forged. course, one officer attends to both teleshould graphs and telephones, but a fair adjustthem. ment could be made even in those circumstances. The honourable member for Barrier complained of the manner in which inspectors in New South Wales were distributed in the various divisions. A Committee was appointed to make a recommenries dation in regard to the marking out of divisions, but it was found that the work could not be satisfactorily carried out without an additional In order to still further facilitate the work of inspection it was decided to appoint subinspectors in the various districts. I asked for a return showing the work then in the State. hands of the various inspectors, and I found that a number of trivial matters were awaiting their attention, ibecause,' rently, no one else could deal with them. For instance, where a mat was required, a door needed repairs, or a letter-box out of order, the inspector had ferred to, and his decision was held' over until he could visit the district. I thought suggested. that, in addition to having divisional inspectors, we might appoint some of the more competent postmasters in the various districts to act as sub-inspectors. We merely followed out the system adopted by back again some of the banks. They, of course, have their inspectors for various districts, but they delegate to the managers of their branches in the. more important duty of inspecting various sub-branches. The"" same principle has been adopted in connection with the Post Office, and is now in operation in some of the States. The sub-inspectors are now able to deal with many small matters, and thus obviate the for the inspectors to travel long distances at considerable expense. The honourable member for Barrier stated that he had brought under my attenin tion the question of adopting a uniform the stamp for the Commonwealth. We are now approaching the end of the bookkeeping period, and I think some reform might very well be introduced. I placed upon record opinion that' some alteration was rei n connection with the printing of our stamps. I strongly hold the view that, instead of having our stamps printed in four States, the whole of the work should done in one State, if only in order to enable a proper check to be kept upon the my issue of the stamps. Honourable members know that no numbers are attached to the stamps, and that they are capable of being Therefore, extra care be exercised in printing and issuing  ber anv idea that stamps are being forged? Mr ' SYDNEY SMITH - No ; I do not suggest that. But I made special inquiinto the matter, and from an expert, the whose advice I sought, I obtained information! sufficient to justify me in forming the opinion that all the stamps should be inspector. printed in one State.",22
73,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The Reid Government blocked the purchase of the machinery necessary for printing the stamps in one,22
74,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,No . There was some difficulty in regard to the matter. appaA proposal was made that all the stamps should be printed in South Australia; but or certain representations were made to the was effect that they could be produced more to be recheaply somewhere else.,22
75,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,No ; that was never,22
76,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I know something about the matter, and I think that if the honourable member will look lip the papers he will find that it was referred",22
77,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"It has been referred back againi and back again for the last five years, and still no reduction has been made centres the upon the Adelaide price. *",22
78,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The matter was brought under my notice, and I believe that the Treasurer raised some point' 1 in connection with the printing, which he thought could be carried out more cheaply in Melbourne. I do not care where the stamps are printed. That is a small matter compared with the importance of having the printing done in one place.",22
79,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,-Surely it is important that the printing should be done where the work can be most cheaply carried out.,23
80,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That is another matter. I have no feeling of jealousy with regard to any particular State.,23
81,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I do not suggest that in regard to the honourable member.,23
82,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I was prepared to make arrangements for the printing of stamps of a suitable design in one State, and to .take special precautions to check their issue, some question was"" raised by the Treasurer, and the whole matter was held in abeyance, and referred to Mr Brain, the Government Printer in Victoria. think that this matter should be dealt with upon business lines, and that we should endeavour to adopt a uniform design. Whilst, owing to financial difficulties, we may not be able to introduce uniform rates of postage, .there is - no reason why we should not have a uniform design, and for the present attach the names of the respective States. I found that there was some difficulty with regard to the design. It was urged that the water-mark in the paper on which the stamps are printed was sufficient to prevent forgery, but * in ' view of the fact that once a stamp has been affixed to a letter it is difficult to detect the watermark, I did not consider that that was a sufficient safeguard. I obtained the advice of an expert, and I realized the necesPublic sity of introducing a systematic method of printing, and distribution, and also the necessity of adopting every safeguard against forgery. I approved of calling for competitive designs for a uniform stamp, because it appeared to me that whilst, during the bookkeeping period, it would be necessary to attach to the stamps the names of the respective States, we could, upon establishing uniform rates of postage, substitute the name of the Commonwealth.",23
83,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The design is unimportant. What we want is a stamp that will be available for use in any part of the Commonwealth.,23
84,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Tfi e design is important for the reason already stated. There are financial difficulties' in the way of carrying out any such arrangement at present. The honourable member for Parramatta has referred to the position of the Deputy Postmasters-General. Th'e view I expressed when submitting the last Estimates-and I hold the same opinion today-wa s that the Deputy Postmasters-General, who have to 'control a great number of officers in a Department which has an enormous revenue, and also have control of Savings Bank deposits, should be highly competent men.  after the Savings Banks?",23
85,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"In some inbut stances they have their own staffs, but the Postal Department performs a large amount of work for the Savings Bank authorities, and it is remunerated for it by the I States. Before fixing the salaries of. the Deputy Postmasters-General, I looked up the papers, and I found that in the early stages it was understood that they should be dealt with in the same way as were other officers; that is to say, that they should be fixed by the Public Service Commissioner. I saw no reason why the Deputy Postmasters-General should be treated differently from other public servants. One could easily understand the difficulty in which the Public Service Commissioner might be placed. He is called upon to classify all the officers of the Department, with the exception of the Deputy Postmasters-General, and he might have the whole of his work upset if the heads of the Department proved to be incompetent. It was understood when the Service Act Mvas passed that the Deputy Postmasters-General would be dealt with in the same way as all other officers, but upon some technical point having been raised- I think it would be interesting to know why it was raised, because it has - been suggested that some persons did not want to be. subject to the Public Service Commissioner-it was found that the salaries could be fixed by the Minister apart from any interference on the part of the Commissioner. It seems to me that an important matter of principle is involved. The Public Service Commissioner is called upon to classify the officers of the Department, according to merit, and as the Deputy Postmasters-GeneraT are placed over the officers so classified, they may, unless ' they are competent men, entirely neutralize the work performed by the Commissioner. It is like placing a captain in charge of a regiment of soldiers. If he is not a good officer, there is a poor look-out for men. So it is in connection with the Postal Department. If the principle to which refer is a good one to applv to other Commonwealth.. branches of the service, it is right that it should be adopted in the Postal Departthority ment. My contention is that the Deputy that statement? Postmasters-General ought to be placed in the same position as the chief clerks and other officers of the ment, so far as their salaries are concerned. The Public Service Commissioner should classify them in the same way that he classifies every other officer in the service. I see no valid reason - departing from that course. We wish entirely free the Department from political influence. But if we render the Deputy Postmasters-GeneraJ. subject to the fluence of members of Parliament, we shall defeat the primary object for which the Public Service Act was passed. We have already laid it down ' that ordinary public servants shall be beyond the of political influence. 'Yet it is suggested we ought that the Deputy Postmasters-General by a single stroke of the pen, can recommend the expenditure of thousuch sands of pounds, shall not be subject to the control of the Public Service Commissioner. I contend that by exempting them from his control, we are destroying the principle underlying the Public SerPostmasters-General, vice Act. I.have already raised a similar point in connection with the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth, and when the Electoral Bill is under consideration, I intend to submit an amendment in favour _ of placing that officer under the Public Service Commissioner, in order to get of the possibility of political influence ing exercised.",23
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Is he not under . Public Service Commissioner?,24
87,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Not so far as his salary is concerned. I do not think that we ought to place it in the power of the Executive of the day to exempt from the control of the . Public Service Commissioner the officer who is charged with the conduct of our parliamentary elecof tions.,24
88,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That is not office proposed.,24
89,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The salary of the Chief Electoral Officer is not fixed by the Public Sendee Commissioner.,24
90,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,It is.,24
91,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I understand the that the Public Service Commissioner had nothing whatever to do with fixing the I salary of the Chief Electoral Officer of the,24
92,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Upon what audoes the honourable member make,24
93,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Upon an admission by the Minister of Home Affairs. DepartThe salary of that officer was placed upon r the Estimates without any reference to the Public Service Commissioner.,24
94,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The salary for upon the Estimates merely represents the to amount provided for his office. It does not prevent his sadarv being graded.,24
95,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I admit that. inBut if the Public Service Commissioner, who has a knowledge of the requirements of the service, is of opinion that a certain salary should be paid in order to secure a highly competent Deputv Postmasterreach General and Chief Electoral Officer, to pay some heed to who, his recommendation. My own opinion is that he ousrht to be called upon to make a recommendation. Whilst) there was no obligation upon the part of the late 'Government to ask the Public Service Commissioner to report as to the salaries which should be paid to the various Deputy I felt it my duty to consult him upon the matter, and effect was given to his recommendation. I trust that the Postmaster-General will give this matter his serious attention. I know that he realizes the importance of securing the services of an up-to-date man for the posirid tion of Deputy Postmaster-General in New beSouth Wales, and I hope that he will not allow the present occupant of that office to suffer. As was pointed the out last night, Mr Unwin has given to the Department forty-five years of f a it h f u l service. Whilst I admit that in a discussion of this character we ought not to obtrude the merits or demerits of any officer, I claim that the case .fo which I am referring is a special one. Mr Unwin was appointed to his present position at a salary £ 9 2 0 a. year. It is true that that salary was subject to the vote of this Parliament. But inasmuch as we voted £ 9 2 0 for the last year, there was no - reason for \ its present occupant to believe that a similar sum would not be voted this year. Had tihe full salary been placed upon these Estimates, I am sure that no objection would have been raised by honourable members. I hope that the Postmaster-General will endeavour to bring the Deputy Postmasters General under the control of the r Public Service Commissioner.",24
96,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"If ihe Government were to do that, should we not have to raise the salaries of the Deputy Postmasters-General in every State?",25
97,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I say that the Department should be freed from political influence at any cost. Why was the Public Service Act passed? Because we felt that every officer has a right to succeed according to his abilities. We have freed the subordinate officers of the Postal Department from political influence, but we have allowed it to remain operative in the case of the Deputy Postmasters-General.  statements of that character, when the, honourable member knows that no political influence is exercised?",25
98,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I am not making a charge against anybody. I merely point out the possibility that political influence may be brought to bear in the case of the Deputy Postmasters-General. The honourable member knows the reason why a legal opinion was sought as to whether these officers should be subject to the control of the Public Service Commissioner, and I think that opinion will induce him to support an alteration being made in the present arrangement as early as possible.  not going to lead me into expressing an opinion.",25
99,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"At any rate, the honourable member knows the reason why a legal opinion was sought. ",25
100,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Then the honourable member should be at one with me in my desire to prevent the exercise of political influence.,25
101,Mr TUDOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What about official influence ?,25
102,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,We do not want either 'political or official influence to be exercised. In the Public Service Commissioner we have an officer who will not be guided by either of those considerations.  the honourable member think was brought to bear in the case of one officer who was promoted over the heads of 170 others?,25
103,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"That fact is explained by the circumstance that the case in question occurred prior to the appointment of the Public Service Commissioner.  to do with the matter. Mr .SYDNEY SMITH - If the honourable member will peruse the papers connected with the case, he will see that it has a great deal to do with it. I was very glad to hear the explanation of the Minister of Home Affairs in that connection.",25
104,Mr TUDOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"But the position is very unsatisfactory, so far as some of the officials are concerned ",25
105,Mr KNOX,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,It is very hard upon them indeed.,25
106,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Some very vigorous criticism has been indulged in concerning the classification scheme. Honourable members will recognise that the grading of the service was a very difficult undertaking, and I think that the Public Service Commissioner, in view of its magnitude, has succeeded splendidly.",25
107,The CHAIRMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I must ask the honourable member not to discuss the classification scheme. Mr SYD.NEY SMITH - I desire to refer to that matter incidentally, to show - that the Public Service Commissioner has performed a stupendous task in a very creditable manner.",25
108,The CHAIRMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,This is not the proper place to discuss that question.,25
109,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I think that it is. Surely I am at liberty to refer to the Commissioner's work in classifying the officers in the Postal Department, seeing thatl it is the most extensive Department dealt with under that scheme. I have felt it my duty to reply to some of the statements which have been made in regard to the administration - of the Department during the period that I acted as its Ministerial head. The desire of the late Government was to extend all necessary facilities to residents in the interior, and I think that the almost complete absence of complaints by honourable members is a. thorough vindication of the policv which we adopted. It shows that we did our duty and honestlv endeavoured to extend postal and telephonic facilities to tfie people in the interior. only item, in the Estimates to which exception is that relating to the salaries of the Deputy Postmasters-General. I trust that the Minister will excoach plain why he proposes to reduce the Village salary . of the Deputy Postmaster-General existing of New South Wales from £ 9 2 0 to £ 8 0 0 per annum. Such a reduction would be ments, contrary to the recommendation' made the Public Sendee Commissioner, ported that, in his opinion, a salary of £ 9 2 0 per annum should be fixed in order to enable him to secure a capable officer to administer this important branch of service. No one can deny the importance of the office of Deputy Postmaster-General in each of the States, and I trust that Government will review the and determine that the present occupant of the office in New South Wales suffer a reduction. The Minister should call for a report from the Public Sendee Commissioner as to the salary which, in his opinion, should be given in order to secure the services of a man capable controlling a Department of such magnitrains tude. If such a report be obtained laid on the table of the House, honourable membelrs will be - able to determine for tain is not great. themselves whether the attitude taken by the Government m> regard to this matter is a reasonable one. Mr R. EDWARD S (Oxley) - I have desire to place any obstacle in the way passing the Estimates of the Post and Telegraph Department; but there are one or two matters relating to services in my electorate which I wish to bring under notice of the Minister. I refer more ticularly to an application which was not long ago by residents of Tambourine Mountain for the establishment of a trificient weekly; coach mail service between Logan Village and that district. A mails were carried on the Southport railway to a station in the neighbourhood of Coomera, where they were transferred a coach and conveyed over what I believe is a very rough road to the mountain. The road vid Logan Village, however, infinitely superior, and as the district an important one, I think that the request might well have been complied with. number of persons are taking up land in the neighbourhood of Tambourine Mounmanding tain, and largely devoting their attention to the dairying industry ; but, notwithstandmy ing that settlement is rapidly increasing The there, the reply , of the Department to the I take petition was as follows :With reference to your recent petition. . . . for the establishment of a three times a week mail service to run direct from Logan to Tambourine Mountain, I have the honour to inform you it is considered that the postal facilities in the locality in question are fairly adequate for present requireand that no further expenditure is warby ranted for a new service as suggested. It is therefore regretted that your wishes canwho renot be complied with. I would draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to the fact that the officer the who furnished a report wdth regard to this request merely stated that the postal facilities are "" fairly adequate for present rethe quirements."" That, to my mind, is an whole matter erroneous statement.",25
110,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What is the shall not date of The reply ?,26
111,Mr R EDWARDS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The 26th ult. I trust that the Minister will cause further inquiry to be made, and satisfy himself as to whether the district is not entitled to this of tiri-weekly mail sendee. Three or four run from Brisbane through Logan and Village every day, and the distance to be covered by road to the mounDuring the last up election I travelled over the road, and found it an excellent one. It is all very well to say that the Department should be conducted upon commercial principles ; but no we should not lose sight of the fact that of its great object should be to serve the convenience of the community as a whole. A mail service should'not be refused merely because of the belief that at the outset it the would not pay. I am of opinion that the parrevenue derived from a tri-weekly coach made mail service from Logan Village to Tambourine Mountain would be more than sufto pay working expenses, and that, in the near future, the district will be at one time the most flourishing one.",26
112,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I shall be glad to to call for a further report.,26
113,Mr R EDWARDS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I am pleased to receive that assurance. I have pleasure in iscongratulating the Minister upon his adis ministration of the telephonic branch of the Department. During his short term A of office he has extended the service to various places in my electorate without dea guarantee, and I dare say that he has done the same in other districts. To mind, the practice of requiring a guarantee against loss in connection wdth new postal and telephonic services is an unreasonable one. A telephone line has recently been constructed between Brisbane and Beenleigh, a distance of twenty-five miles, and also between Brisbane and Beaudesert, a - distance of fifty miles, to the great satisfaction of the residents of these rapidlygrowing districts, and I trust that the Postmaster-General will see his way to extend the system to other parts of my electorate, which are greatly in need of such a service. I wish now to refer briefly to a complaint with regard to the delivery of letters in the immediate vicinity of .Brisbane. that letters are delivered to the residents of cross-streets on the right-hand side of the Logan-road, but not to those residing in cross-streets on the left-hand side of this thoroughfare. A similar complaint has been made in regard to the non-delivery of letters in other places, and I trust that the Minister will inquire into the matter. The. locality to which I r$fer is not more than three miles from Brisbane, and it seems absurd that such a system should prevail in close proximity to the capital of the State. I bring these matters forward in the hope that the Postmaster-General will give them his favourable consideration.",26
114,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I should have liked to see the white labour provisions of the Post and Telegraph - Act amended before these Estimates .were submitted for our consideration. The desire of a number of honourable members to secure the passing of a clause providing' for the carriage of mails on vessels employing only white labour was from some points of view a reasonable one, their opinion being that, if Only, white seamen were employed on our merchantmen, they would form a reserve upon which the British Navy might draw in time of war. Much of the obloquy to which many honourable members have been subjected is therefore undeserved, because they supported the passing of the white labour provisions of the measure in question merely from a desire to study the interests of the Empire. That is a fact which has not received fair consideration. No one could object to an endeavour on the part of a nation to strengthen itself to meet a national emergency ; but, unfortunately, in our efforts to frame a provision to that end, we went so far as to make it appear that our only object was to exclude coloured workers from our mail steamers. If the' clause were so amended as to give effect to the desire to insure the employment of a class of sailors who, in time of war, would be able to join in the defence of the Empire, no exception could be taken to it, and any increase in the cost of our mail services which resulted from such a provision should then be provided for on the Defence Estimates. It appears that exception has been taken by Japan and India to the wording of the section, and, having regard to the comity of nations, which we all desire to foster as much as possible, I think it would be well to substitute for the section a provision which, while clearly expressing the object I find we have in view, could not be said to be based solely on the colour line. I believe that such an amendment would secure the approval of most honourable members, and that they would be willing to vote even more than .we are now paying for the carriage of our mails under such conditions. Personally, I would make no difference. It might be argued, too, that the higher price which we are called upon to pay was not demanded solely because of the provision to which I have referred. I am satisfied that the late Postmaster-General did his best under the circumstances, and the present - Postmaster-General, although the contract did not wholly meet with his approval, by asking Parliament to ratify it, showed that he thought that nothing better could be done. I have made inquiries outside the Chamber, and heard the statements made here on the subject, and my opinion is that the only course possible was adopted. The ratification of the contract has secured regularity in the despatch and transmission of our mails, and thus insures us against delays and inconveniences, which would have caused losses to be measured, not by thousands, but by hundreds of thousands, of pounds. Coming now to another matter, the making uniform of our postal charges, I would point out that there is a good deal of misunderstanding on the subject. Of course, we would all like to see uniform postal rates adopted, and, no doubt, many of us who represent States other than Victoria have been asked, ""Why don't you vote for uniform penny postage, such as Victoria has ? "" It is highly desirable that the rate of postage should be as low as possible, but it must not be forgotten that the penny postage system of Victoria results in a loss, and that that loss is borne by the citizens of this State. The fact that there is a loss, and that it is borne by the citizens of Victoria, and not by the Commonwealth as a whole, are both frequently lost sight of by the electors. It is rather an anomaly, now that the postal business of the Commonwealth is under one administration, that the rates of postage are not uniform, but, seeing how constant is the demand for extra services, which mean increased expenditure, any lowering of the rate would at present seem unwise, and it is not altogether impossible that the Parliament of Victoria may ask the Commonwealth to revert to the twopenny rate in this State. While it is always easy to lower rates, it is not easy to increase them again, and, no doubt, an increase would never be proposed unless the Postmaster-General was compelled by want of revenue to move in that direction. While - we are all anxious for the adoption of a uniform postage rate, I , for one, would not urge a course which would prevent the extension of postal ,and telephonic facilities in a hundred and one directions.",27
115,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The only difficulty in the way of the reduction of the postage rate is the financial difficulty.,28
116,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Exactly . I have always felt that the Postal Department should obtain a return for the services rendered by it, and that those who enjoy the facilities which it offers should pay for them. I will not dwell on the educational advantages given by cheap postage, nor on the development of the country which tiheap and speedy communication makes possible, because it is hardly likely that any reduction of rates can be proposed for at least halfa-dozen years to come; but I should like to remove from the minds of the electors the misapprehensions in regard to the Victorian postage to which I have referred. With regard to the construction of public works out of revenue, it seems to me that in this matter we are not acting on true business principles. The Postmaster-General must admit that in constructing large works out of revenue we are necessarily to some extent limiting the extension of post and telephone services. It is stated that the cost of giving telephone communication between Sydney and Melbourne will be £40,000, butt that the expenditure will return something like 10 per cent. If , however, the work is constructed wholly out of revenue, it will unduly diminish the amount available for other purposes. Of course, one good side to such an arrangement is that it requires ,the more careful employment of money; but to secure wise expenditure, it should not be necessary that no money should be used unless it has been dragged out of the pockets of the people. Any business man would say that it would be very bad business, if there were a possibility of getting a return of 10 per cent, on a given outlay, to refuse to borrow to secure that return. Although, in the past, loan money has often been expended very unwisely, we are going to the other extreme in refusing to borrow for the construction of necessary works. It would be better to borrow locally than to spend only out of. revenue, thougS the borrowing of money locally can be pushed too far, because, if too much money were borrowed locally, it would increase the rates of interest charged to private borrowers, while the introduction of capital from abroad is often a boon, because it reduces the rates of interest. We should, however, be careful, in connection with our borrowing, to provide for a sinking fund to enable the debt to be repaid, at any rate before the work on which the borrowed money was expended had ceased to be of value. Before the honourable member for Macquarie became Postmaster-General, most of us found it very difficult to get any work put in hand, because of the financial exigencies of the Department. We were always met by the first Postmaster-General with the statement that the position of affairs was too uncertain to allow the Department to spend money in carrying out new works, and, as a consequence, for two or three years the public suffered.",28
117,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Is the honourable and learned member in favour of borrowing ?,28
118,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I would borrow where a proper return could be obtained. It is ridiculous not to make improvements until they can be made out of revenue. No private individual would carry on his affairs in that way, because, if he did, he would never extend his business. No doubt the anti-borrowing policy is very popular with the electors just now, because of the wanton extravagance of the past; but we cannot be held responsible for that, and to prevent the raising of loans altogether is to go fo the other extreme.",28
119,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,A good many of the members of this Parliament were members of States Parliaments which sanctioned the reckless expenditure of borrowed money.,28
120,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"No doubt some of them were to blame. The money was obtained too easily, and spent too readily; but ft does not follow that because there was wastefulness in the past we should refuse to carry out new works until they can be paid for out of revenue. It is not fair to the States to charge to one year's revenue expenditure which should be spread over a period of ten or fifteen years.",28
121,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The States do not wish us to borrow.,29
122,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Because they wish to go on borrowing themselves. If the honourable member thinks that we have arrived at such a pitch of production that no more money can be wisely borrowed, I disagree with him. There is a middle course between that which the States adopted in the past and that which we are adopting now, and I think we should follow it . If that course is adopted there should not be an outcry against borrowing. I trust that the Minister will not hesitate to ask for the funds needed to carry out any works that he may regard as essential. not forget that we are absolutely retarding development whilst we denv to the public ready means of communication. I am sure that the Minister will receive the ready support of honourable members if he makes liberal provision to comply with any reasonable demands made upon him. A good deal of discussion has taken place with regard to the proposed appointment of a chief electrician and a chief postal inspector. I am very glad that this course is to be adopted, and I should have been glad to support the proposed votes, even though they had represented larger sums. In my opinion the salaries now offered to the Deputy Postmasters-General are entirely inadequate, in view of the duties they are called upon to perform, and the responsibilities they haw to assume. If we adopt a parsimonious attitude,- we shall not follow the lines of true economy. Parsimony has never yet spelt economy, and never will. The salaries paid to the officers controlling large outside institutions are in many cases three and four times as high as are those paid to the Deputy Postmasters-General, whose duties are of much greater importance. Whilst, in consideration of the stability attaching to the positions of the Deputv Postmasters-General, I should not be inclined to pay them upon quite such a high scale as is adopted in outside employment. I regard it as incumbent upon us to see that they are resubscribe munerated in amanner commensurate with their positions. It is unworthy Commonwealth to haggle about a pound or two, and there was no warrant for depriving some of these officers of certain portions of their salaries. I shall be very glad to - see some alteration made in this respect. The Commonwealth needs the very best men to perform the work of a large Department such as that now under discussion, and if we offer our officials less remuneration than they could obtain for performing similar work outside, we shall commit a gross injustice. If the. Postmaster-General finds it necessary in order to secure more efficient control of the service to give the heads of the Department a higher reward for their services, I shall be very happy to support him, and I feel sure that the' majority of honourable members will join me in doing so. We all know how difficult it is to properly manage a business such as that carried on by the Post and Telegraph Department, how a concession granted in one We must quarter is sometimes availed of as a means of extorting) further concessions in another quarter. Great Government services are always hampered by the fact that Ministers cannot deal with individuals in the same way as ordinary private business houses can do, and our very insistence upon uniformity sometimes prevents the granting of concessions in cases where they should be made. I mention this because I desire to refer to the very unbusinesslike arrangements which now obtain in regard to telephone rates. Honourable members have been informed that the Minister intends to make a trial of the toll system, and I presume that it i i intended that a minimum service shall be given for a.fixed rate, and that anything required beyond that shall be paid for at a proportionata rate. I think that that will prove a very desirable reform. The arguments which have been used in support of it seem to one to be absolutely irresistible. Why should a man who avails himself of the telephone forty times a day be called upon to pay only the same rate a another person making use a of the instrument only four times per day ? I trust that the toll system will be generally adopted, because it seems to me that those who make the most use of the telephones should be called upon to pay the highest charges. ,  to the telephone exchange do so voluntarily-the Government do not force of the the service upon them ?",29
123,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"No . The Government do not force the service upon them, but my point is that the service rendered should be paid for in proportion to the benefit received. Many persons in the country who think that they should not be called upon to pay the present high fees for the limited use they are able to make of the service are told that the rates cannot be reduced, because of the excessive degree to which the service is availed of by others. In one sense, telephone services are more necessary to persons living in the country than to those residing in the cities, and whilst I would not dispossess city residents of the advantages they now enjoy, I .think they should be called upon to contribute in proportion to the service rendered.  member has taken a long time to find that out.",29
124,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"No , I have not. Two years ago I advocated the adoption of the same system. I then earnestly argued that it was absurd to charge all subscribers alike. If some people like to occupy the time of the attendants at the exchange by using the telephone a hundred times a day, they should be called upon to pay higher fees than are demanded of those who can only make a limited use of the service. The excessive use now made of the telephone service by some persons results in the Depa/ttment imposing unduly high charges upon those who can only occasionally avail themselves of that means of communication. Why should one of the great newspapers, which receives 400 or 500 telephone messages per day, be called upon to pay only the same rate as a private 'person who luses the telephone only three Or four times a day?  All persons have to pay the same municipal rate, and one person is not charged any more because he may make a little more use of the roadway than another.",30
125,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The honourable member is quite wrong. All persons are not assessed alike for municipal purposes. We all know that the water has to be paid for in proportion to the quantity used, and that the same practice applies to gas. In connection with the extension of telephones in the country, I desire to point out that in many instances telegraph lines can be seen extending for ten or fifteen miles, whilst alongside them, within perhaps a hundred yards, another line is erected along which telephone messages are transmitted. When one inquires the reason for this condition of affairs, the reply is- "" The amount charged by the Government for the use of their telegraph poles is so high that it pays us better to erect our own line."" Consequently, we find the anomaly of privately-erected lines running side by side with Government lines for miles. As a result, telegraph poles which, in many cases, would carry twenty wires, are carrying only a single wire. I know of at least a score of instances in which telegraph posts, instead of carrying twelve or fifteen wires, are carrying only one or two, whilst other lines have been erected not far distant. Some system ought to be devised by which a difficulty of that kind in the countrydistricts can be overcome. Of course, it is quite clear that in some instances the Government could not afford to lease their telegraph poles. For example, it would be impossible for the Government to lease any portion of the main poles between Melbourne and Sydney on account of the volume of business which they carry. But in many country districts the situation is entirely different. At the present time, the rental charged in those districts is something like 25s. per imile. That is evidently more than people will pay. I know of one case where, for five miles, a privately-owned telephone line is being constructed side by side with the Government line, simply because the persons interested will not pay the rental of 25s. per mile which is demanded of them. I ask the Postmaster-General wmether he cannot in certain districts lease the Government poles to private individuals. If he cannot, I think that the Government should construct these lines, charging the persons interested the initial expense incurred, and afterwards making acall upon them whenever it is found necessary to send linemen to repair breakages. Under such circumstances I venture to say that very few calls would ever be made upon the services of the linemen. The persons interested would see to that. Moreover, the Government would always be in a position to enforce their claim, and consequently the control of the lines would never pass out of their hands. I coriimend imy suggestion to the Postmaster-General, and I hope that he will inquire of his officers whether effect cannot be given to some such system. I recognise that at the. present time, in the large cities of Australia we are welt served in the matter of telephonic communication. I understand from persons who have travelled a good deal, that upon the whole- I do not say that blemishes are not to be found in certain parts of the Commonwealth-ou r service is as well conducted as is the service of any part of the world.",30
126,Mr ROBINSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Why , the Melbourne system is one of the worse in the world When one uses the telephone, he can hear twenty persons speaking at the sarnie time.",31
127,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"That defect is not clue to the officers of .the Department, because they have recommended the erection of new switch-boards. They declare that whilst our present system was thoroughly up-to-date when it was installed, recent improvements in telephony have caused it to become antiquated.",31
128,Mr KELLY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"In Sydney, the telephone service is a very bad one.",31
129,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I think that it is a. very good one.,31
130,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The Sydney service is very much better than that ot Melbourne.,31
131,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I am bound to say that in my opinion the telephone service of Australia is extremely well conducted. When it is urged that in particular places it is not up-to-date, my answer is that the officers of the Department have themselves acquainted us with that fact. They have pointed out that to bring it up to date we must sanction the expenditure of certain sums of money in the various States-in one case an amount of £35,000.",31
132,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"It would require an expenditure of £200,000 to bring the Melbourne service up to date.",31
133,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I do not see that any blame can be attached to the officers of the Department upon that ground. Considering the means under their control, I maintain that we get a very good service. We cannot reproach them, because we have not expended the money necessary to bring - about certain changes which they deem desirable to secure greater efficiency. The real trouble is that the cost of the requisite improvements is prohibitory. The attention which has been drawn to the defective service - in particular localities lead's me to say that if we are to .effect desirable changes we shall have to abandon our policy of paying for these works entirely out of revenue. We shall have to construct some of them partly out of loan funds. It is impossible for us to taBe £200,000 out of the revenue of any one year in order that we may pay for the installation of a new service in Melbourne. If a service will prove effective for ten years the expenditure incurred in installing it should be distributed over a ten years' period.",31
134,Mr KELLY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Does the honourable and - learned member think that a sinking fund would be kept going during ten years ?,31
135,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Why not ?,31
136,Mr KELLY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,In giving effect to a new principle we have to consider human nature.,31
137,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"We have considered human nature, and our experience is that it is now running from one extreme to another.",31
138,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Does the honourable and learned member wish us to go begging in foreign markets for money?,31
139,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I do not. At the same time, I do not wish to see development prevented simply because we have not the money with which to carry out these works. The whole of the expenditure that would be involved in any one of these undertakings should not be taken out of a single year's revenue. It should be spread over a ten or fifteen years' period.",31
140,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That would be all right if we repaid it in ten years by instalments.,31
141,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"That is a matter for arrangement. I am quite sure that we ought not to limit our public works in the way that we are doing, simply because we can-, not construct them out of revenue.",31
142,Mr KELLY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Does not the honourable and'learned member think that during the next few years we can raise sufficient revenue to pay for these changes? Mr .CONROY - I cannot discuss that matter at the present stage. In conclusion, I desire to say that we are deeply indebted to the late Postmaster General for the improved means of communication which he has afforded us by the introduction of the condenser' system. I am very glad to notice that his successor is continuing the good work which he initiated in this connection.",31
143,Mr LIDDELL,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What does the honourable and learned member want- a telephone or a post-office?,31
144,Mr CONROY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I regret that the residents of the district which I have the honour to represent are unable to secure the advantages conferred by telephonic conveniences as quickly as they could wish. But we must recollect .that the demand in this direction has been so great that the Department has been unable to cope with it, and it would scarcely be wise to employ upon these works scores of men whom it would be necessary to retain in the service long after they had been completed. The heads of the Department naturally view with a considerable amount of apprehension any increase in the number of hands employed. Before any addition is made to the number of these employee's, they wish to be quite sure that there will be a continuous demand upon their services. In that respect they are different from private employers, who dispense with their employees as soon as they find that they no longer - require them. I do not wish to further discuss the matter. Save for the proposal to cut down the salaries of two officers, I think that no exception earn be taken to these Estimates. I regret that the Postmaster-General should have brought forward a proposal to reduce the salaries in question, for I hold that we should not thus attack those who are not in a position, to defend themselves* The salary of each office should be fixed, .and I am satisfied that the pay of the two officers to whom I refer is not - commensurate with the positions of responsibility .which they hold.",31
145,Mr LIDDELL,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I can endorse the remarks made by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa with reference to the reforms which the late Postmaster General instituted, and I think that the present Minister bids fair to follow closely in his footsteps. I also agree with the remarks made by the honourable and learned member with respect to the necessity of reducing the cost of the telephone service to country subscribers. It seems to me to be grossly unfair that the subscriptions to country exchanges should be the same as are those to the exchanges in the great cities of the Commonwealth.",32
146,Mr KELLY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Why ?,32
147,Mr LIDDELL,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Because subscribers to a country exchange do not obtain the same return for their money. It must not be overlooked that the number of subscribers to an exchange in a country town is much smaller than is the number of subscribers to a city exchange. In West Maitland, for instance, there are some seventy subscribers to the exchange, and consequently there are not many persons with whom one can communicate over the wires. If the cost of the telephone service were reduced, the number of subscribers would be considerably increased. Why should a charge of £ 8 per annum for a business telephone', and of £ 5 per annum 'for a private telephone, be made when £ 5 and £ 3 respectively should be amply sufficient? I would suggest to the Postmaster-General that the revenue from this branch of the service .might be increased by preventing the general use of telephones in public institutions and hotels. In Australia guests at an hotel are allowed to use the telephone whenever they desire, although a small fee is exacted for its use by guests at - hotels elsewhere. I am satisfied that if the rates for country telephones were reduced the number of subscribers would be largely increased, just as the reduction of fares on the Government tramways of New South Wales has resulted in a considerable increase of revenue. I wish now to draw attention to another anomaly in regard to country telephone exchanges which ought to be remedied. Why is it that obsolete instruments are palmed off upon subscribers to these exchanges? They pay as much as do subscribers to city exchanges, and it is difficult to understand why they should not have an equally effective service. In this respect the Department seems to have followed the course pursued By the Railway Department of New South Wales. As soon as the electrical tramway system was introduced in Sydney, the obsolete steam cars were sent off to do duty in country towns. In the same way, second-hand and obsolete telephone instrumentsare being foisted on subscribers to country exchanges. When the Labour Government were in office a regulation' was issued which gave general satis - 1 faction. This regulation provides that in districts where telegraph offices are connected with a telephone exchange, or where telegrams are sent over the telephone lines, the general public, upon payment of a fee, may be allowed to use these lines. This concession is much, appreciated by those who are aware of it ; but I do not think that the Department has taken care to fully apprise the public of the passing of the regulation. It provides thatRegulation 20 shall he repealed, and the following regulation shall be inserted in its place :- A telephone line connecting any two offices of the Department, at neither or only one of which a telephone exchange has been opened, may be used for conversations by the general public, subject to the following conditions, and on payment of the fees set forth hereunder, provided that such use by the public shall not interfere with the ordinary work of the Department When I inquired what was meant by '-' the ordinary work of the Department,"" the Postmaster-General informed me that if it were found that these telephones were competing in anyway with the telegraphic service, the public would not be allowed to use them. That is a distinctly fatuous position to take up.",32
148,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I misunderstood the honourable member's question, and under the impression that he was referring to the use of private lines. Once a public line is opened a subscriber has the right to decide for himself whether he will advantage of it, or continue to use the telegraph service. M.r. LIDDELL - I am pleased to rethose ceive the Minister's explanation. As these lines are for the service of the general public, I fail to see why they should conducted on principles that would restrict their general use. The opening of teleany phone offices in country districts has been much appreciated by the general public. For example, where the services of a doctor are required, it is of great advantage to be able to communicate him by telephone, instead of having to rely upon a short telegraphic message. medical man, upon being jrung up, has opportunity to reply to his interrogator, and to supply instructions as to the treatquarter does the postmaster ment of the patient, pending his - arrival, Main handle? that in many cases prove extremely valuable. There is only one other matter which I wish to draw attention. I believe that in connection with a small post-office quarter. at Pelaw Main, I have discovered a case of sweating on the part of the Departthe ment, the like! of which is not to be found elsewhere in the Commonwealth. I find that the remuneration given to the man in charge of this office is £ 5 7 per annum, and that in return for this allowance, he one. has to attend, not only to'the ordinary postal work, but to that of the money-order the Savings Bank Department, and the telephone office, as well as to deliver telebusiness grams. But from this sum of £ 5 7 aj deduction of £ 8 per annum is imade for the and stamp business carriage of mails between the office the railway station, a distance of two to miles.",33
149,Mr KELLY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What is the populationof Pelaw Main?,33
150,Mr LIDDELL,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I cannot say; but quired into. the volume of work transacted in the office shows that it must be fairly large. As I have said, £ 8 per annum is deducted attention to ft. from this officer's salary for the carriage of mails to and from the railway station, so that he is actually paid at the rate of 19s. per week for the work that he performs for the Department. Then again, he has to pay £ 1 3 per annum for the rent of the premises, so that allowing for this further deduction, he actually receives 15s. per week in return for his services to the was Department. The fact that the value of the business transacted at this office in one quarter is £ 1 , 1 9 9 8s. 7d., should satisfy the Minister that it is a fairly large one. take The man in charge of the Greta Post office, which is a contract one, receives £ 1 2 4 pert annum, although his duties cannot possibly be as heavy as are which the man in charge of the post office at Pelaw Main has to discharge. I draw the special attention of the Postbe master-General to this case, and trust that he will cause inquiries to be made. In circumstances, I do not think that the Commonwealth should offer a man 15s., or even 19s., per week, as a living wage.",33
151,Mr KELLY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Is this man entirely in the with service of the Commonwealth?,33

160,Mr ROBINSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I regret that honourable members who have spoken during this debate have not had more to say about the proposed introduction of the toll system of charging for the use of telephones. I think that no more reactionary step could be proposed, the object plainly being.to bleed telephone subscribers more severely than they are bled at present. An expert was sent from Victoria to traverse a large part of the civilized world to collect information in regard to telephone systems, and His first recommendation that was allowed to be published was one for increasing the charges for telephones. In support of the increase, the charges in vogue in a city like New York, where the telephone service is in private hands, and users are bled most unmercif u l l y, were instanced.  private enterprise.",34
161,Mr ROBINSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I have never believed in private enterprise in regard to what have been called natural monopolies, such as the control of railway, postal, telephone, and telegraphic services. In Stockholm, whence we get most of our up-to-date telephone instruments, the charges to users of telephones are less than half the charges imposed by the Department here, and the desire in most countries is to reduce telephone charges. The Minister, however, wishes to increase the charges in Australia. At present, one has to ring up half-a-dozen times before he can communicate with the person to whom he wishes to speak; and under the toll system he would be charged for each ring. A recent copy of the 'New York Commercial, which has been placed in my hands, shows that the people of New York complain bitterly of the telephone charges there; but, in any case, the New York system is quite a different one from ours, in point of effectiveness. The Melbourne system is shockingly bad.",34

In New Zealand, so I have been informed by Sir Joseph Ward, the present Postmaster-General, not only is the houseto-house telephone system better than ours, but the long-distance telephone system is better; and I believe that it is possible to speak from one's private house with subscribers living 200 or 300 miles away. Such a thing cannot be done in Victoria. The charges for telephones, too, are lower in New Zealand than in Victoria. If the Minister wishes to win a name for himself as a good administrator I hope that he will veto any proposal to increase the telephone rates.",34
163,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,We hope that the adoption of the toll system will decrease the rates.,34

I would not object to the New Zealand rates, or to the Stockholm rates; but I object to rates such as are charged in New York, for a service which is very much worse than the New York service. Something should also be done to improve the long-distance telephone system of Australia. * I believe that the people in the back blocks of the other States are even worse eff than are those in the country districts of Victoria, but the latter are very badly situated.

Its officers say that the will not pay all charges-workin g expenses, interest, and maintenance-and , therefore, no part in any such undertaking. the people of Hamilton are asked, not to make good any possible difference between the actual returns and the expenditure, to subscribe in cash a sum equal to all charges fori the first year, and a sum equal to half those charges for the next telegram was delivered. two years, giving a guarantee for the five following years.

General that they thought that threeagreed fourths, or some other proportion of expenditure would be met, it would be probably reasonable to ask the people of the town to guarantee the remainder; but the mand which they are now making is one which prevents business from being done. I am confident that if this line did not pay bourne and Adelaide. during the first year, it would yield a factory revenue within a very short time. If a reasonable guarantee, accompanied a moderate deposit, were required, I sure that it would be forthcoming. Dimhave offered to pay my share of the cash required in order to assist the project, but TI think there is a great deal in the contention of the residents, that they are being, asked to contribute too much.

172,Mr ROBINSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"In all these cases it is necessary to restrict the number of guarantors.

I now suggest that dethe Postmaster-General should take into consideration the question of establishing telephonic communication between MelAlthough the resatisceipts from the business between the two capitals might not be sufficient to cover by a reasonable interest charge upon the outam lay', the revenue derived from messages I despatched to and from the various towns along the route would considerably add to the income of the Department.",35
173,Mr KELLY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Would the suggested line run through the, honourable and learned member's district?",36
174,Mr ROBINSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Yes; it would bring three towns in my electorate into communication with"" the capitals referred to. The trunk lines between Melbourne and BalJarat and Melbourne and Bendigo are among the most payable in Victoria, - principally because of the large amount of stock exchange business that is. transacted over them. Considerable stock exchange operations take place as the result of advices and orders exchanged between Adelaide and Melbourne brokers, and if a telephone service were established between the two cities, a considerable amount of share business would be transacted by means of it. Moreover, the line would prove of great convenience to visitors and business people generally. I believe that the residents in the Western District would greatly appreciate telephonic communication with the metropolis. Farming conditions in that part of the State are undergoing a great change, and stock grazing, and especially lamb fattening and kindred pursuits, are receiving miuch more attention than in the past. Auctioneers in the country districts intrusted with the sale of stock ""would be placed in a position of great advantage if they could communicate by telephone with' persons transacting similar business in Ballarat and other centres. I think that there is every reason why the Postmaster-General should inquire into the business prospects of a telephone line between Adelaide and 'Melbourne, and I trust that he will give consideration to the subject.",36
175,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The business done by telephone would result in loss to the telegraph service.,36
176,Mr ROBINSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I do not think so. I am informed by Victorian postal officials that the establishment of telephone lines has in no case involved any great loss of telegraphic business. If , before the establishment of telephonic communication, a telegraph service yielded, say, £ 1 , 0 0 0 per annum, and the telephone service, on being introduced, resulted in receipts amounting to £ 2 5 0 per annum, the telegraph revenue 'would not be reduced to the full extent of the latter amount. I am informed that the records of all the trunk telephone lines show that there has been a net gain to the combined services. I desire to refer to another matter affecting the convenience of residents in the country districts. A number of post and telegraph offices are established at railway stations in Victoria, and the Postmaster-General was good enough recently to connect certain towns in my district by means of the condenser system. The telegraph lines 'thus used for the purposes of telephonic communication are in many cases connected with the railway stations, and the railway officials refuse to permit members of the public to use the telephones in their offices. The condenser system was used to connect a station called Myamyn with Hamilton, and some time ago a resident of the former town wished to summon a doctor from Hamilton, twenty-five miles away, to attend upon a member of his family who had been suddenly seized with illness. He desired to use the telephone for the purpose, but was informed by the railway officials that he could not be permitted to do so, even though the case was one of urgency. He then had to despatch a telegram to the doctor, but was unable to obtain an answer except after con siderable delay. The telephone possesses the advantage of enabling persons to convey messages and receive replies without any appreciable delay. In the case in question, it would have been possible to ascertain by telephone whether the doctor was at home, and, if he were absent,' to call upon the services of some other physician. The difficulty which has arisen in connection with these railway offices might easily be overcome if the Postmaster-General held a friendly consultation - with the railway authorities. It seems monstrous that the public should be denied the use of a system established for their special benefit. The telephones at railway stations should be made accessible to private individuals upon the payment of the regulation fee, provided that they did not unduly interfere with the operations of the railway officials. I could well understand an objection being raised to the use of railway telephones by members of the public whilst trains were arriving or being despatched. I make these few suggestions to the Minister with a good deal of confidence, because I know that he represents a country electorate, and full y appreciates the neces. sity of affording greater facilities to residents in outlying districts. I hope that the matters to which I have referred will receive his fullest consideration.",36
177,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," The late Postmaster-General made some reference to the question of issuing a uniform Commonwealth postage stamp, and I thoroughly agree with him that it is absurd that we should continue the present system of issuing separate stamps non-interchangeable between State and State. am aware of the difficulty which arises from the operation of the bookkeeping clauses, and .the necessity for crediting each State with the revenue which properly belongs to it. But surely after the experience we have gained during the last five years, we ought to be able to make some arrangement for issuing a uniform stamp which will be perfectly fair to the States. Some little time ago, when I was in Adelaide, I inadvertently affixed a Victorian stamp to a letter which had to be conveyed a distance of only about a mile from the point of despatch, and the receiver was called upon to pay a surcharge of 4d. Such a state of affairs ought not to be permitted to continue, because it not only militates against the convenience of the public, but also operates prejudicially to the revenue. If postage stamps were made interchangeable they would be more extensively used than at present, especially for forwarding small sums of money from one State to another. I desire to direct attention to the question of printing the postage stamps required by the Commonwealth. At present the stamps required for each State are printed in the local Government Printing Office, except in the case of South Australia, where the work is done by a Commonwealth officer in the Postal Department. The cost of printing postage stamps varies to an extraordinary extent, when one considers that the work performed is of the same character, and the material used is of much the same quality in every case. At an early stage it occurred to the Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth that it would be advisable to have, whole of this work performed in one office. From the time of the transfer of the Postal Department to the Commonwealth, this question has been under consideration, and it has not yet been settled. I now propose to quote the prices at which these stamps can be printed in the various States. I find that in the Government Printing Office, Sydney, they can be produced at 7Jd. per 1,000 ; in Melbourne, at 5d.; in Brisbane, at rod. j and in the General Post Office, Adelaide, where there is a stamp printing department under the control of a spea. cialist, at 4d. Honourable members will see that the prices range from 4d. to iod. per 1,000. I understand that when Senator Drake was Postmaster-General, he obtained an estimate of the cost at which stamps could be printed in the various States upon the assumption that they had to perform I that class of printing for the entire Commonwealth. The estimate given by the Stamp Printer in Adelaide, who is a Commonwealth' officer, was 2^d. per thousand.",37
178,Sir JOHN FORREST,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,It is said that that amount would not pay for the paper that would be used. ,37
179,Sir JOHN FORREST,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The Government Printer says so.,37
180,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I want to ascertain what prevents this work from being done by the Commonwealth. The Treasurer has stated by way of interjection that the cost of the paper alone would exceed the Adelaide estimate of the entire cost of printing. I may say that that is a very recent discovery. ,37
181,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Apar t from that consideration, it is only a recent discovery on the part of the Melbourne Government Printing Office. This question has been under the consideration of successive Governments, and upon last year's Estimates a sum of £1,301 was voted for the purchase of a two-colour printing machine and of some other machinery, to allow of the work being done in Adelaide by the specialist in stamp printing. But for some reason or other, which I am at a loss to understand, that proposal has been hung up ever since. I find that when the Prime Minister was in Hobart, he sent a wire to the Postmaster-General, asking him not to call for tenders, and consequently the matter is today unsettled. These are the facts of the case, as can be proved by reference the to the official documents. I desire to ascertain why this change of policy has been adopted, and what influence prevents a large saving to the Commonwealth being effected. Is it merely a parochial influence, or is it a dispute between the Departments ? No less than three Postmasters-General have advocated a change in the interests of economv, and yet the matter has been "" hung up "" by successive Treasurers.",37
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The late Treasurer was opposed to it.,37
183,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I am quite aware of that, although I do not know the reason for his opposition. From a perusal of the official papers relating to the matter, it is difficult to conceive why he was opposed to it. When the Watson Government were in power, it was decided, on the recommendation of the then Postmaster-General, the 1 honourable member for Coolgardie, that all stamp printing should be done by the Commonwealth, and not by the various States. Accordingly a vote for that purpose was placed on the Estimates, and agreed to by Parliament. Reports were received from the Government Printers of the different States in opposition to the proposal. Naturally they did not desire the work to be taken out of their hands. They wished to continue the printing of Commonwealth postage stamps, because the price they were receiving for that work was in excess of its cost, so that they were actually making a profit upon it. Mr Gullick, the Government Printer of New South Wales, after describing the machinery which would be required to enable him to print the whole of the stamps required by the Commonwealth, stated that it would cost £2,000, and addedThe proposal to produce postage stamps under separate administration appears likely to lead to an entirely new expenditure to the Commonwealth, and to be a reversion to a practice in vogue in this State, and abolished after long trial, fift y years ago. The proposal was to produce postage stamps under one administration outside of him;. the Government Printing, Offices of the States, a fact Mr Gullick did not appear to grasp. If one State is to monopolize the whole work, I may fairly point out that the sum of ^2,000 spent in certain indicated directions would, in conjunction with the existing facilities most economically performed. of this office, full y equip the plant for of the whole Continent. Then Mr Carruthers, the Premier of South Wales, saysIn forwarding such report, I have, however, to enter an emphatic protest against the of any proposal which would have the effect of removing the work of printing postage stamps to the Post and Telegraph Department in any one of the States. For the reasons given by Mr. Gullick, in whose views on this matter I concur, I think it neither economical nor expedient that the suggested change should be made, though if it should be determined to concentrate the whole of the work of printing postage stamps in any one establishment, as Mr Gullick has pointed out, the Sydney Government Printing Office is quite competent to undertake it, after an additional expenditure of ^2,000. As I have already pointed out, the printing these stamps in New South Wales is 7 Jd. per thousand, as against 4d. mated [r 8] 4 in Adelaide, and it is estimated that this price can be still further reduced to 2^d. if the Department undertook this class of printing for the entire Commonwealth. The estimated cost of the plant required to fully equip that office is £1,350 as against £2,000 in Sydney. Upon the 2nd February of the present year, the Government Printer of Victoria, Mr. Brain, wrote to the Treasurer as follows ; With reference to your letter of 24th ult., inquiring when my report may be expected to be received in regard to the proposal that all postage stamps, & c , shall in future be printed by the Post and Telegraph Department at one of the State capitals, I beg to inform you that the present heavy pressure of urgent work in this Department has hitherto prevented me from furnishing the report asked for. I hope, however, to be in a position to forward it at an early date. Then comes die following minute from the Secretary to the Treasurer: Should we not ask Post-office to notify Treasurer of any contemplated action in respect of the vote for the machinery (Division, 4/4/6) before such action is taken. The vote having been passed, the Post-office would be entitled to proceed without further reference to the Treasurer. There is nothing in these papers to show that the Post-office is aware of any possible objection on the part of the Treasurer. It appears from this statement that the Treasurer had some objection to the proposal, and that it occurred to him that the Department might proceed to give effect to it without any further reference to The Prime Minister then wired from Hobart to the Postmaster-Generyil asking him to allow the matter to remain in abeyance until the Treasurer had considered of this the advisableness of having the work carried out in the office in which it could be A precis the work respecting the question of certain stamp printing for the various States being perNew formed at the Departmental Printing Office, Adelaide, was prepared for the information of the Treasurer, and in this adoption document it is pointed out thatThe postage stamps for New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, are printed in the Government Printing Offices of those States, respectively, those for Western Australia and Tasmania are printed in the Government Printing Office, Melbourne, and the South Australian stamps are printed at the Government Printing Office, Adelaide, by officials of this Department. It was ascertained in 1902 that the cost of printing the stamps in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, was as follows :As I 'have already quoted the figures, I cost of shall not refer to them againThe Departmental printer in Adelaide estithat the cost of printing postage stamps for this Department would be 2^d. per 1,000 for stamps of one colour; if of two colours, the would be the same, but a two-colour machine, costing about ^385', would be required. On the 9th October, 1903, the Secretary, Postmaster-General's Department, wrote that "" view of all the facts, including the reduced cost to the Postmaster-General's of production in Adelaide, the ability to print the postage stamps .required for the throughout the - Commonwealth in our own office at Adelaide, and the jealousy that has been created when stamps for one State are printed, the Government Printing Office in another State, it is, I think, desirable that the whole of the postage stamps, postal notes, & c , required, should be printed in the printing office attached to the General Post Office, Adelaide, under the control and supervision of the Deputy Postmassarily ter-General of that State, also that provision should be at once made for supplying to the Printing Printer at Adelaide the two-colour printing machine required."" This was approved by the offices, Postmaster-General (Sir P. O. Fysh) on the 19th idem, and on the 12th November, 1903, the vernment Deputy Postmaster-General, Adelaide, was asked for a report as to the additional plant that would be required in order to print in liis office at laide, pending the establishment of a CommonPrinting wealth Government Printing Office, all the posttransferred age stamps, postal notes, post-cards, both pictorial and plain, required for the whole of the Departin ment throughout the Commonwealth, and also the estimated cost of' any additional assistance or labourthat might be considered necessary under such circumstances. The Deputy Postmasteruniform, General replied on the 1.6th December, ing for a roughpr-oof of each stamp plate then in use, and certain statistics as to the issues stamps, & c , in the several States in 1902. were obtained from the otheT Deputy Postmasters-General,, and forwarded to him on the 2nd March, rgo4, and on the 22nd idem, he subthe mitted a. report from the Stamp Printer, giving the information askedfor, on the 12th November, 1903. On 1 a.th May, 1904, the honourable member for Coolgardie,. who was Postmaster-Geneable ral, wrote the following minute: Referring to stamrj printer's report of March, 1904, I think it desirable the Department should procure the best two-colour machine tant No action appears to have been taken on this minute. Reports were then received from the Deputy Postmaster-General, givthe ing the details of the. machinery that be required to carry out the whole of work. The Departmental Printer that the annual saving effected by the duction of the plant recommended-an ask honourable members to pay particular attention to this point-would , be approxiticulars mately £1,699 ios. He went on to point out thatWhen a uniform stamp was introduced, plant, plus another perforator, would besufficient to cope with the work, and produce the stamps Mr Batchelor. at a greatly reduced rate, and that the Depart1 cost ment would be able to undertake a considerable mnount of Departmental printing, thus saving the State printer's bill. In Then on the 23rd June, 1904, the Secretary Department Department wrote the following minute:With reference to the proposal to have the in printing of postage stamps, postcards, postal notes, and money order forms, executed in the printing office attached to the South Australian branch of the Postmaster-General's Department, I have to suggest that, while full series of postage stamps, each of a different pattern, are necesproduced and issued from plates and watermarked paper held by the Government Offices of most of the States, the printing should be continued as at present in those but stamps to be printed for States which have not hitherto had them produced in the GoPrinting Office of the State, as for instance, Western Australia and.

On another paper I have recommended for consideration the advisability of inviting designs, except as to the name of the State, 1903, askduring the bookkeeping period. 1 Postcards, pictorial and. plain, and also postal of notes and. money order forms of an uniform andThese improved pattern for the whole Commonwealth, - should, I think, be printed at Adelaide, as soon, as designs can be submitted and approved, and necessary plant can be made available. The Deputy Postmaster-General, Adelaide, to be asked to obtain and submit a full report covering the whole subject from, the Stamp Printer attached to his branch of the Department. The then Postmaster-General, the honormember for Coolgardie, asked that the matter should be treated as urgent, as a 21st great saving could be made by the use of the improved machinery. The Deputy Postexmaster-General of South Australia was then written to, and forwarded a further report as to the plant required. On the. 16th July, 1904, the Postmaster-General approved of requisition submitted for the machinery. would A note was made for the inclusion the in the Estimates of an item of £1,301 stated ios., as per the later list, in reintrospect of the new plant, and the Deputy d I Postmaster-General was so informed. On 5th December of that year, further parwere supplied, and on the 14th of the same month the amount on the Estimates was voted. On the 7th February, 1905, the Postmaster-General approved of tenders the being invited, and the Deputy Postmaster General was informed accordingly; but on the 13th February, 1905, the Prime Minister wired from Hobartasking that action in the matter be stayed the return of the Treasurer to Melbourne, the Deputy Postmaster-General was so instructed the same day. This is the information which was supplied to the Treasurer on his return from Hobart I shall now read a report submitted by Mr. Brain, in opposition to the proposal:In compliance with the honourable the Treaprinted surer's minute of 3rd inst., herewith, and also point in reply to your letter of 17th August 3,952, I have the honour to state with respect to the proposal to print in future all postage postal notes, and postcards required for ferent States at the Post and Telegraph Departof ment of one of the State Capitals, that i and other revenue documents are produced in the same Department as that which sells them, is a gTeater probability, if persons were clined, of frauds being committed by means collusion than there would be if these documents were produced and sold in two distinct Departtimate; ments. Of course, I do not wish to imply fraud is likely to be committed at any post situate in the Capital of either of the States. But in producing documents that are equivalents for money, it is only proper to adopt that which most effectually discourages and prevents the committal of fraud. It would occur to most persons that the distribution of this work over a number offices in the several States would be more calculated to open the door to fraud than would its concentration in the hands of a few carefully selected men. It seems to port :me that Mr Brain's suggestion is absolutely farcical. His report continuedApart from this, aspect of the matter, it would seem that the Treasury and not the Post Office is the Department under whom documents possessing monetary value should be manufactured. South Australia is the only State amongst those producing these documents where the postage stamps, & c , are printed at the post office. It is interesting to learn that because stamps are equivalents for money, the mechanical work associated with their production should be under the control of the Treasury. These are some of the reasons advanced by the Government Printer of Victoria against the proposal to effect a reform that would result in a saving of over £1,700 per annum. Stamp printing is a work which relates to the Post a.nd Telegraph Department, and it seems to me that it is no less fitting thati it should be placed Under the control of the Postmaster-General than that it should be controlled by the Department of the Treasury.",37
184,Sir JOHN FORREST,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I should be very glad if it were transferred. [148]- 2,40
185,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I am simply putting before the Committee the arguments aduntil vanced against the desirableness of making and in the system a change that would result in a very large saving. The proposal has been hanging fire for something like five years, and these are some of the reasons that have been offered against its adoption. As to the statements that South Australia is the only State in which postage stamps are at the General Post Office, I would out that the Government of last, No. South Australia, having had an acstamps, cumulation of deficits, felt constrained the difto adopt the most economical methods carrying out public services. f stamps The Adelaide stamp printer, replying to there, Mr Brain's strictures, pointed out that so in the latter was mistaken in supposing that of he had fallen into error in making his esand in regard fo the printing of that uniform postal notes, Mr Brain gave five office quotations, ranging from ns. id. down to 3s. 8d. per thousand, against his estimate method of 3s. 3d. per thousand, and a saving of some £2,000 was effected. The Auditor General was asked by the Post Office authorities to make inquiries during his visit of to Adelaide as to whether the stamp printer there was mistaken in his estimate, or had made his calculations on a wrong basis, and he furnished the following reI have the honour to report for the information of the right honourable the Treasurer, that, at the desire of the Secretary, Postmaster-General's Department, I have inquired closely into the question of the proposal made to print all stamps and postal notes for the Commonwealth at the Adelaide Post Office. The quotations, I understand-give n by Mr Cooke, the printer attached to the Post Office branch at Adelaide-were 2£d. per 1,000 for postage stamps, and 3s. 3d. per 1,000 for postal notes. I have examined this officer's calculations, and it appears to me that his estimates are reliable. He has taken into account the cost of paper delivered at the General Post Office, Adelaide; labour; wear and tear of machinery; type, and blocks; cost of ink; cleaning material; motive power; cutting; taking-and delivering stamps from and to the Custodian; numbering; banding; lining; designing; engraving ; interest on cost of machinery; and cost of 1 supervision. I find that Mr Cooke recently gave a quotation for the production of 2,100 copies of lists of money order offices-the amount estimated being ^140, and that the actual cost was £111 17s. 6d. This appears to show trie reliability of this officer's estimates. . That was the report of an officer who may be regarded as quite impartial. The Adelaide stamp printer is an enthusiast and a specialist in his work, so that he has been able to make some extraordinary reductions in the cost of stamp printing, and I see no reason why the Commonwealth should not take advantage of his expert knowledge. In contradiction to his estimate, there are only the statements of Mr Brain, which I have read, and a further statement in which Mr Brain declares that the cost of material alone would be more than the amount set down for labour and material. Mr Brain is of opinion that it would cost quite 2;]rd. per thousand for the paper, ink, and gum used ; but the Adelaide stamp printer before making his estimate obtained quotations from the firms who supply the paper used for this work, and. as a matter of fact, has ordered for the Adelaide office paper at the price he quoted. I have come to the conclusion that it is due to inadvertence that no vote appears on these Estimates for the machine to which I have alluded.",40
186,Sir JOHN FORREST,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That is so.,41
187,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Then I presume a thai the Treasurer will see that money is provided for its purchase?,41
188,Sir JOHN FORREST,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Yes . A sum was voted last year. As a matter of fact, did not know the facts when these Estivernments mates were before me.",41
189,Mr BATCHELOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The whole quesagreed tion was gone into very carefully by a vious Postmaster-General, The right honourable gentleman having made that pro mise, it is needless for me to make any they are entitled. further remark.",41
190,Mr FULLER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I have desire to delay the passing of these EstiCommissioners mates, because I belong to the recess party, any other State. and if the Government acted fairly towards the Opposition, and let us know what they propose to do, Ave should allow them to vernment. close the session as expeditiously as they desire. But as we have had no declaration from the Government on the subject, it is our duty to see that the Estimates are professional perly and reasonably discussed. I heard partment of New ""South Wales. what the honourable and learned member Wannon had to say in regard to the conamount denser system of telephone communication, cers. and, in justice to the late Postmastertirely General, who introduced the system in the interests of the people in country districts, I wish to say that in my constituency, various branches? and in other constituencies with which I am acquainted, it has been a succeive the benefit of the increments. cess. I trust that the present Postmasfar ter-General, who has declared his intention to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor in these matters, will extend the use of the system, and thus assist in the development of our resources. It is time that we heard what he proposes to do in connection with the administration of the important Department over which he presides. He has left it to the honourable member for Macquarie to defend these Estimates; but I think he should have something to say for himself. Probably if the honourable member for Macquarie had remained in office until now the administration of the Department would have been revolutionized. There are several matters to which I wish to draw attention. In the first place, I wish to refer to the case mentioned by the honourable member for Macquarie, in which postal facilities are asked for by the inhabitants of a district in South Australia. The Department estimates diat the return from a post-office there would be £ 5 0 a year, but the Railway Department of South Australia proposes to charge £ 4 5 0 year for the carriage of mails to and from the district, or £ 4 0 0 more than the post office would receive. This is an illustration of the manner in which everything is being I done by the railway authorities and Goof the States to oppose the Commonwealth, and to lessen the advantages of Federation. The Postmaster-General has to consider this case and has stated prethat a bonus might be given in some instances in order to extend to the residents in certain districts the facilities ""to which I trust, however, that he will sit tight and refuse to comply with no the inordinate demands of the Railway of South Australia, or of He should strenuously object to any fleecing of the Federation by any Railway Commissioners' or State GoI desire to refer to the vote of £ 1 , 0 0 0 proposed to be voted for the payment of increments to officers in receipt of salaries of £ 1 6 0 and upwards in the proand clerical divisions of the DeI should for like to know upofn what .principle this is to be divided amongst the offiIs the distribution to be left en. in the hands of the Deputy Postmaster-General, or is he to act after consultation with the principal officers in the Further, I should like information as to the officers who are to reSo as I can ascertain, it is intended that the money shall be distributed entirely according to the recommendation of the Deputy Postmaster-General. "" Any one acquainted with the administration of , that - Department must know perfectly well that the Deputy Postmaster-General cannot, Avithout consulting the heads of the branches, properly allocate the sum thus placed at his disposal, and it has come to my knowledge that some officers have - either been overlooked or have been very badly treated. £ 1 , 0 0 0 would not go very far among the officers of the professional and clerical officers of the Department, and I understand that special trouble will arise, owing to the fact that certain officers who have been recommended for increments will, for the time being, be in receipt of salaries in excess of those payable to other officers who occupy higher positions, and whose claims to promotion will be prejudiced by the temporary improvement in status of officers inferior to them: in rank. I hope the Postmaster General will interest himself in this matter, and insure that .justice shall be done to all parties concerned. I see that provision is made for a vote of £ 7 , 4 0 0 for the remuneration of officials in the Railway Department, who perform work in connection with the postal and public telegraphic business. It has been customary for railway officers in various parts of New South Wales to act as postmasters, and I should like to know how the amount which now appears on the Estimates^is to be parcelled out among these officials.",41
191,Mr MCDONALD,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The railway officials in Queensland do not receive any consideration ; the whole of the money is appropriated by the Commissioners.,42
192,Mr FULLER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I think that we should take steps to insure thai the money we vote for the remuneration of railway officials shall reach the proper hands. know of a case of one railway officer who has been acting as a postal official for four years without sufficient remuneration. It appears from the Estimates that £ 7 , 2 0 0 was voted last year for the purpose to which I have referred, whilst provision is made for £ 7 , 4 0 0 for the current year, but unless the case to which I have referred in New South Wales is an exception, the railway servants there have not been remunerated for the work they have been performing for the Commonwealth. If the same practice exists in other States besides New South Wales and Queensland, I trust that the Postmaster-General will see that a change is made, and that the Commonwealth snail nolonger rest under the unjust reproach of requiring services for which they are not prepared to pay the officers who render them. I am informed that school teachers in New South Wales who perform work for the Postal Department are paid direct, and I should Dike, to know whether a similar course could not be pursued in regard to railway servants. I wish to bring under notice the question of allowing telegraph poles to be used for the purpose of carrying private telephone wires. In one case in the Picton division of my constituency, an application was made to the Department for permission to affix to certain telegraph poles a private telephone wire, but the request was refused. Apparently there was no sufficient reason why the telegraph poles should not be utilized in the mariner desired, but the official prejudice against granting any special facilities to private citizens proved strong enough to put the owner of the private telephone wire to the necessity of erecting special poles to carry it . I trust that the Postmaster General, who has shown a disposition to t follow in tha footsteps of his worthy predecessor, will see that every reasonable facility is offered for the construction of private telephone lines.",42
193,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Hear , hear I",42
194,Mr FULLER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I have no complaint to make with regard to the failure of the Department to furnish telephone instruments, so far as my own constituency is concerned. Through! the courtesy of the Postmaster-General, I had an opportunity to test the efficiency of the telephone service recently established between Sydney, Wollongong, and Kiama. I was surprised to hear the I honourable and learned member for Wannon refer to the difficulty of working the condenser system in coastal districts because, so far, success has been achieved between Svdney and Kiaima, a distance of seventy-two miles. Furthermore, I feel quife satisfied that the service which is now being extended to Nowra, eighty-two miles from Sydney, will prove an efficient one. The condenser system has been successfully worked over a distance of 200 ' miles in some of the inland districts, where the wires are not subjected to the prejudicial effects of the sea air. The experiment of attaching telephone wires to trees in country districts has proved very, successful, and I trust that the Postmaster-General ' will continue sanction the erection of these cheap lines. In this connection, I have in my mind case in which the estimate of the departKiama mental officers made provision for the erecwould tion of expensive - posts upon which the wires could be hung. It was found imposwith sible to undertake that work op account the small revenue which it was estimated would be derived from the service. By seeing utilizing trees, however, in lieu of telephone poles, the line was erected, and is tomatter, day returning a fair interest upon its capijustice tal cost. The only other matter to which I wish to allude is the manner in which telephones are installed in some of the country offices. In many of these buildAt ings the instruments have been placed such a position that nobody can carry on a conversation with any degree of privacy. We all know that in rural parts, such as the Illawarra district, a large number of persons visit the post-office at certain gular hours. At such times anybody sending a telephone message is overheard by every person who chooses to listen Indeed, it is a mattari of comment Albion Park that a telephone message is never transmitted without the substance of j State of Queensland. it being known all over the town. As f at as possible, I think that these telephones some time. should be so placed as to insure to their users some degree of privacy.",42
195,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I am endeavourI ing to give effect to the suggestion of the honourable member for Parramatta that wherever possible "" silence "" be installed.",43
196,Mr FULLER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I am very glad to hear that. Then again, where there are a number of small towns close to a large centre of population, I do not think it fair to charge residents the same rate telephone messages as is charged to sons who live fifty or sixty miles away, who may be in communication with the metropolis some forty or fifty miles disthrough tant. The special instance which I have - in my mind is that of the important town of WollongOTig, the centre of the great southern coal-mining district of New South Wales. Near to that town are ten or twelve small but important centres, which enjoy telephonic communication with it. ' At sentations Wollongong itself there is an exchange, which is connected with Sydney. Seeing that the telephone service there is paying, it is unfair, for instance, to charge resiwhat dents the same rate for telephoning from to Wollongong ""to Kembla-whic h is distant only a few miles-as is charged for transone mitting a message to Albion Park or or Sydney. It seems to me that it. be fair to charge a reduced rate to those places which are in communication the central exchange. If the service of were not paying I should not venture to make a suggestion of this character. But that it is making a profit, I ask thePostmaster-General to inquire into the with a view to rectifying this inas speedily as possible. I recognise that the honourable gentleman is doing hisbest to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor. In so doing he is acting wiselythe same time, I think it is due to this in Committee tEat we should be informed, what he intends to do to bring his Department up to date. The late Postmaster General effected some very great and necessary! alterations during his tenure of office. reWhen the Department was transferred toFederal control, we placed in charge of it men who, however able they may have-befcn, werje iacbustom'ed to 'dealing with at comparatively small matters in the As a result, its efficiency suffered considerably for Since then, however, a great improvement has been effected. The Department was brought very much up-to'date by the late Postmaster-General, and trust that before the debate concludes the present occupant of that office will disclose to us the means by which he hopes to mainchambers shall tain its efficiency.",43
197,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," It seems to me that the same charge must be made against the present Ministerial head of the Postal Department as has beenis levelled against every other member of the for Government. No Minister appears to have perany policy. Whenever any strictures are or passed upon them they refer to what was done by their predecessors in office. All' this debate, it is their predecessors who have had to defend the Administration. None of the present Ministers seemto know anything about their Departments; they have not the courage to do anything in opposition to the reports of their officers.. In regard to .certain cases, I have made repreto the present Postmaster-General,, which he has admitted are unanswerable; and yet because his officers have reported! in a certain direction he has refused to do» is right. He has said : "" I agree with you,, but what can. I do?"" Upon one occaand sion, I told him that if I were in his tion I would show him what to do. tainly, I should not be controlled by - officials.. I cannot understand how men that in Tasmania and other States. - occupying the position of responsible isters can adopt such an attitude. name "" responsible,"" in this connection, - entirely a misnomer; if they were called ""irresponsible"" Ministers I could stand the description. The persons who tion of its population. are apparently responsible are the cials of the Department. of our Ministers seem to be possessed the courage necessary to enable them mark, out a definite policy for themselves, and to insist .upon their officers' giving - to it. In matters of detail it is right the officials should be recognised; but matters of policy should be shaped by Ministerial heads of Departments, and hy the officials. The late Postmaster-Gengether! eral deserves to be complimented upon stand which he took up. I have heard it stated that he initiated the condenser phone system. That is scarcely correct. What he did was to apply it more exthe tensively than did any of his predecesmen sors. The officials reported against it, claring that it was not satisfactory. But honourable member for Macquarie said :. any rate, we will try if , "" with the result that today it is working satisfactorily wherever it has been installed. Theextenexistence - sion of that system has conferred a great advantage upon the citizens of the monwealth. I claim that we should bring telephonic facilities, as near as possible to all the country districts. They are of great amended. value to the people, and no obstacle should be placed in the way of providing means - of communication between all rural centres - and the large! cities of the Commonwealth. ""One great difficulty in the way of securing - connexions of this character is that the partment charges 25s. per mile to erect wire along the existing telegraph poles. 'Thus, if a person who is resident eight from an exchange desires to be connected with it, he is required to pay £ 1 0 for the privilege of having the telephone - wire attached to the Government poles. I know of a. large number of men who - would be connected with various exchanges way Department demands £A5° P r an: if it were not for that charge. I made - some inquiries about the matter, and - was informed by an officer that the - cost of these undertakings had to be lated for the whole of the Commonwealth. The cost of the lines in Western Australia Queensland, where there are very large posiand sparsely populated areas, is extremely Cerhigh, and it is held by the Department my that the cost, in those cases must govern I Mindo not think that is reasonable. Whilst we The should endeavour to cater for the conis venience of the people generally, we ought to give each State some of the advantages underarising from the extent and situaI can unoffiderstand that the cost of a teleVery few phone line, some 200 miles in length, in of a sparsely populated part of the Commonto wealth, must add largely to the expense of the system, but the charge of 25s. per effect mile is only in respect of the up-keep. that Some gentlemen in my own electorate large wished to be connected by telephone with the Glen Innes, but the demand made by the not Department for this privilege was altoprohibitive. I inquired into the the matter, and found that the salary of the line inspector in, the district, and all the telecharges incidental to. his work, would not amount to anything like the sum which Department demanded from the gentleI have named. A private firm would denot attempt to do business upon these lines, the and the Postmaster-General cannot expect "" At such a system) to be successful. I do> not blame the Minister for the regulation, but I point out. that the reason given for its is, that the cost of the lines in sparsely populated areas must govern the Comcost throughout the Commonwealth.",43
198,Mr JOHNSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The regulation could be ' Mr LONSDALE - Certainly , and if the Postmaster-General is not a mere jelly-fish-if he has some grit, in himhe will make inquiries, and if his investigations show that it is desirable to adopt that Decourse, will cause the regulation to be a amended. If he does, I shall admit next session that I made a mistake in suggestmiles ing that he has no back-bone. I wish him to do what is right in regard to these mata year ters. Some reference has been made to the request which has been made for a mail service to Pinnaroo, in South Australia. It has been said that the Raile num for the carriage of the mails to that town, notwithstanding that the revenue obtained byi the Post and Telegraph Departcalcur ment from this service would be only £ 5 0 per annum. I think that the demand made by the Railway Department is a most audacious one. I admit that it is necessary in some cases - for the Post and Telegraph Department to pay more for a mail service than the revenue which is derived from it. I should not object to that being done in the case of mail services to sparsely populated districts - The Commonwealth, as well as the - States, should do everything possible to encourage the people to settle in the interior, and it must be recognised that the extension of postal and telephonic facilities to the remote parts of the Commonwealth must tend to materially promote settlement there. Kut,"" whilst I should not object to a sum being paid for certain services, in excess of the actual revenue derived from them, I certainly would object to the Commonwealth paying the amount demanded by the Railway Department for the carriage of mails to Pinnaroo. On various occasions, when I have applied to the Department to extend postal facilities to thinly settled parts of-my electorate, I have been told that they are prepared to pay for the carriage of mails to these places a sum equivalent to the revenue derived from the service, and I know that settlers in some parts have had to make good the difference between the revenue and the cost of the mails. I trust that the Department will not do in one case what it is not prepared to do in another. A suggestion has been made to-night that the amounts paid by the Commonwealth for postal and telegraphic services rendered by the States railway officials should be distributed amongst those officials. I do not altogether agree with that view. It is not my desire that any person should be sweated; but when the railway officials are receiving fair salaries from the Commissioners, it is only reasonable that the amount paid by the Commonwealth for the carriage of mails and other services Tendered . by the railways should go into the funds of the Railway Department. School teachers discharging the duties of a postmaster stand, however, in a different position. Their postal duties make great inroads upon their leisure, and they have often to remain on duty on Saturdays and Sundays, in order to deliver letters. That being so, they ought to be allowed additional remuneration. I am of opinion that it is time that we had a Commonwealth stamp. It is absurd for the Department to continue printing a different set of stamps for each State. It was all Mr Lonsdale very well to use up the issues printed prior to Federation, but it is certainly time that we had a stamp that might be used .in any of the States. It may be said that the adoption of this system would lead to a loss of revenue on the part of some of the States; but, inasmuch as New South Wales and Victoria have arrived at a mutually satisfactory arrangement, to avoid the issue of Inter-State certificates, we ought surely to be able to devise a system by which the revenue derived from the sale of a Commonwealth stamp could be so distributed as not to injure any one State. The sooner we rid ourselves of every cause of friction between the States the better. We should lose no opportunity to take a step towards a true Federation. Another reform which has been advocated during this debate is the introduction of penny postage. I do not ask the Postmaster-General to undertake any work that is surrounded with extreme difficulty, and I recognise that the task of bringing about such a reform would be_a most troublesome one. On various occasions I have addressed to the Minister letters with regard to the extension of the penny postal service in my electorate, and I returned to him the other day a reply which I had received, in order that it might be put in proper form. As if stood, it would have clearly indicated to the persons concerned that the officers of the Department did not know anything about the question at issue; and, whilst I may say some hard things of the honourable gentleman, it is always my desire to be fair to him. Penny postage obtains throughout Victoria. The Victorians are a smart people, or, at least, they fancy they are, and just before the establishment of Federation the State Parliament provided for the introduction of penny postage, anticipating, no doubt, that the Commonwealth would have to make good any loss which it entailed. They have since discovered that they made a mistake. Many sharpers "" fall in "" when they attempt their, sharp practices, and I am very glad that Victoria "" fell - in"" when it attempted to evade its responsibilities in regard to this and one or two other matters. We have in New South Wales a partial system of penny postage, which gives rise to niuch irritation. A charge of only one penny is made for letters posted and delivered in certain towns, while in others, a few miles away, the postage is twopence. I could give many illustrations of the irritation which this system has aroused, but it must be evident to honourable members that much annoyance is caused by the fact that, in some towns, a letter will be delivered within a radius of three or four miles of the office in which it is posted for twopence, when the people of other towns have the privilege of sending a letter to an address twenty miles distant for one penny. The Postmaster-General ought to be able to evolve a system by which penny postage could be gradually adopted throughout the Commonwealth. "" Evolution "" is the great word of the present day, and something should be done in this direction in postal matters. In some parts of New South Wales letters will' be delivered within a radius of thirteen miles for one penny, although by a new regulation the area to which penny postage applies in certain cases has been reduced to one milt. It is impossible for the Department to reduce the area in towns where penny postage prior to Federation extended over an area of thirteen miles, and there are cities in which the system applies within a radius of twenty miles. There is no penny postage in South Australia, and I believe that the system is only partially operative in Western Australia and Queensland. I recogntee the difficulty of introducing the reform, arid it seems to me that the best way to bring it about would be to gradually increase the area to which penny postage applies, and so to remove the anomalies that now exist. We know that the system has resulted in a loss, and that penny postage for the Commonwealth would result in a reduction of the amount of revenue returnable to the various States. There are other directions in which improvements might be effected by the Post and Telegraph Department. A new railway station is in course of construction in Sydney, and tenders have just been accepted for the erection of a central railway station in Melbourne. It seems to me, therefore, that the present is an opportune time for the establishment of parcels post-offices at the principal railway station in the capital of each of the States. A great many parcels are conveyed by rail, and the arrangement which I suggest will certainly be more economical than is the present one. If a parcels post office were established at the principal station in each of the State capitals, parcels could be delivered and received there, instead of being carried to and from the Post Office. Double handling would thus be avoided. So far as this matter is concerned, I speak as. an amateur; but it seems to me that the plan I mention would save time and expense. I have been reading lately of the methods adopted in England for the gathering up and sorting of mails, and while I do not think that our population is yet sufficiently large to justify the Department in running trains solely for the carriage of mails, I think that we might extend the sorting of mails on trains. For instance, the British and foreign mails put on board the train at Adelaide might be sorted during the journey, so that they would be ready for delivery at each town passed through. I understand that, at the present time, the Ballarat mails have to come right through to Melbourne to be sorted, and are then sent back again, which, of course, means considerable delay. If my suggestion were adopted, the Ballarat mails would be dropped from the express when it passed through that town, and the Melbourne mails would be practically ready for delivery when the train reached Melbourne. Then, on the way north, mails would be dropped at Albury, Wagga, and other important towns as far as Sydney, and so on to Brisbane. This system might necessitate a slightly greater expenditure than is incurred now, but it would save the employment of a certain number of sorters in the principal offices, and tKey might be used on board the trains. I hope that the Minister will show more backbone than he has hitherto shown. I do not call it showing backbone to-agree to everything recommended by one's officers. I like to see a Minister who will dare to do what is right in matters of principle, notwithstanding an official recommendation to the contrary. Coming back to the telephone system, I think it absurd for the Department to charge 25s. a mile for the maintenance of a wire carried on posts already erected. I should also like the Minister to set himself to gradually extend the penny postage system, as, for example, in New South Wales, where there is already penny postage in connection with the large centres of population, until the penny rate becomes uniform throughout Australia. I hope that the honourable gentleman, in answering the questions which have been asked by various honourable members, will show that he differs from his colleagues, in having a policy, and will tell us what is his policy. In my opinion, this Ministry will be known in history, not as the Ministry of all the talent's, but as the Ministry without a policy.",44
199,Mr BROWN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I wish to refer to a matter which I omitted to mention in my earlier address, and that is the application of the condenser system of telephone communication to country towns. A number of country towns are being brought into telephonic communication with each other, and it is becoming apparent that some alteration is needed in the regulations of the Department governing country exchanges. Hitherto, the rates charged by the Department have hindered the establishment of country exchanges. At the present time, what is known as the flat-rate system is universal, £ 5 per annum being charged for the rental of the telephones placed in private houses, and £ 9 for telephones placed in business establishments. This charge is, in many cases, prohibitory. The township of Parkes is connected by means of the condenser system with places like Bogan Gate, Trundle, Fifield, Alectown, Peak Hill, and other similar centres within thirty miles of it ; but to get the fullest advantage of this arrangement it is necessary to have a telephone exchange in the town itself, so that the business people there may be put into communication with people living in the surrounding district. An attempt is being made to establish such a change, but the high rates charged are an obstacle to its success. The business places in Parkes are alL close together, and near to the telegraph office, so that the telephone is not as necessary for communication between the business people there as it is in towns where the business places are more scattered. I think that lower rates should prevail in connection with country town exchanges, and I would suggest a rental of £ 3 per annum for private telephones, and £ 5 per annum for business telephones. There is no comparison between the business done on a telephone in a country town and that done on a city telephone. Sydney, for instance, the telephone of a large business house is being used continuously throughout the day, hundreds of messages being transmitted to all parts of the citv and suburbs to a considerable distance from the metropolis. For that service the subscriber pays only as much to the Department as is paid by a subscriber who has only a few calls a day.",47
200,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Some of the big busipractice, ness places in the city rent eight or nine telephones, and pay eight or nine subin scriptions. Postmaster-General.",47
201,Mr BROWN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"That is because' their business is too large for one telephone; but for a telephone doing the work I have described, only as much is paid as is cHarged*. for a much smaller and less valuable service in a country town. It is unjust that the charge should be the same in the two cases,, and it has been suggested that the toll system should be adopted in lieu of the flat system. I am not prepared to express an opinion upon the merits or the demerits of the former, but the .flat system certainly appears to me to be inequitable, and I think that if the Postmaster-General looks into the matter he will find that the usefulness of our telephone system can be extended by reducing .the charges in little country towns like Patkes, Condbbolin, and Molong. Another cause of complaint in country districts is that the telephone instruments supplied to country exchanges are such as have become obsolete in the large centres of population, and a report appeared in a recent number of the Forbes Times, giving an account of a public meeting held at Dubbo, to protest against this treatment. I do not know what .ground there is for the complaint, but if the policy followed by the Government is"" as alleged, it is a penny-wise and pound-foolish policy. Tomake the telephone system effective, the bestinstruments procurable should be supplied, and country subscribers have as much right, to consideration as have city subscribers. The honourable member for Riverina brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General the excessive nature of the fee charged for country post bags-£ 2 per annum. I think that in fixing a schedule for such a service, regard should be had' to the number of times per week the bag has to be made up. In cases where mails have to be made uponce a week, a smaller charge should be made than in instances where the bags In have to be sent out daily. Some persons have been in the habit of supplying their own canvas bags, and the practice proved convenient to both the postmaster and the mail contractor. Cases have beenbrought under my notice in which postmasters have gone to the trouble of tyingup the private bags, thjus preventing the lossof letters. They have now been informed, however, that they must discontinue the and it has been intimated that if"" persons require to have their letters placed private bags, they must use the article , supplied by the Department, and pay the annual fee of £ 2 . I trust that the Postmaster-General, will consider the needs of the country residents in. this respect, and. - that, he will see his way to reduce the - charge for private bags to ios. or £ 1 per ,annum, according to the number of. mails - despatched weekly. I am sure that if the - charge were reduced, the system would be much more largely availed of than at present.",47
202,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I - am very glad that the honourable member for Canobolas has mentioned the matter of private mail bags. I had intended to refer to it when I spoke on a previous occasion. I * look upon the present charge as an imposition. I do not agree with' the honourable member that the charge should be varied according to the number of occasions upon which the bags are used. All the letters received in country post-offices have to be sorted, and they can be placed in private bags without involving any extra work upon the officials. Therefore, it seems to me to be utterly unjustifiable to charge country residents £ 2 per annum for the use of such bags. In the large centres of population, we deliver letters to the residences of every - citizen, and yet we require country residents to pay an exorbitant fee for a very small convenience. It would be sufficient - for the Department to charge the cost of the bag, or to allow persons to supply their own bags. It is ridiculous to charge nearly one shilling per week to a person who desires to have his letters carried in a special ""bag. The other day a gentleman in my - constituency wished to arrange that the Postal Department should give him an extra service per week, and it was ascertained that the contractor demanded £ 3 15s. for the - extra work required of him. The gentleman referred to was perfectly willing to pay this amount, which he regarded as a fair charge; but the post-office authorities required him to pay in addition £ 2 per annum for the use of a mail bag. That seems to me to be an imposition that should not ""be tolerated. I suppose that the officials thought that the £ 5 15s. would not be paid, and that they would not be put to - any further trouble.",48
203,Mr BROWN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That was done according to regulations.,48
204,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"That is what the Postmaster-General says; but if the regulations provide for such exorbitant and unjustifiable charges, the soOner Ithey are done awav with the better. If the Postmaster-General does not adopt that course, we ought to remove him from office. We require a Minister who will do something, and not one whowill stand by regulations that are obsolete, and would be more in keeping with the conditions of centuries ago. We want a Minister with modern ideas, who will bring the Department up to date. I trust that the ""Minister will do away with the charge of £ 2 now levied upon persons who require to have their letters placed in private mail bags. If he does so, he will earn the gratitude of a large number of country residents. If the payment of the fee for mail-bags is to be insisted upon, we should charge every resident in the cities is. per week to cover the cost of delivering his letters at his own door. If such a charge were imposed, a revolution would take place. Residents in the big cities would not submit to any such charge. But the unfortunate people in the back-blocks are few in numbers, and cannot speak with one voice, and are therefore imposed upon. I trust the Minister will deal wdth these matters on broad and liberal lines, and administer hisDepartment »n the interests of the whole of the people. With regard to telephone service, I think that the Department should not aim at making any profit, but should seek to provide telephone facilities at the smallest possible cost, in order to extend to residents in the country districts the fullest advantage of the system. The honourable member for Canobolas was not quite correct in stating that the large business houses in the cities which use telephones pay no more than do the country storekeepers^ because I know of many cases in which one house pays for nine or ten telephones. I am not aware that obsolete telephone instruments are sent, into the country, but if the facts are as stated by the honourable member for Canobolas, the action of the Department is. on a par with the course it has pursued incharging for - the use of private mailbags.",48
205,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I find, on consulting my notes, that twenty-five honourable members have taken part in this debate, and I suppose that on the average each one has submitted four or five grievances. Therefore, if I attempted to deal with all the matters brought under my notice, I should have to speak at inordinate length, and should probably thereby incur the displeasure of honourable members. I propose to say a few words with regard to the postal policy of the Government, and to address myself briefly to some of the main points raised by honourable members. I hope that my remarks will not have the effect of bringing a number of other honourable members to their feet, because, after such' a long discussion-of which I do not in any .sense complain, because it has been fair and legitimate- I think the Estimates might reasonably be agreed to. The honourable member for New England has implored me to do something, and that will be my policy. I realise that it is better to do something, even if one makes mistakes, than to do nothing. The policy of the Government in regard not only to postal matters, but all other subjects, is summed up in the three words, ""progress with prudence.""",48
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What does that mean?,49
207,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"It means that I recognise that the Post and Telegraph Department is to a very large extent a commercial enterprise. We have to collect a large revenue, amounting to nearly £3,000,000, most of which is made up of pennies and threepenny pieces. Consequently, we have _ to be very careful in making promises which may involve lavish expenditure. were to grant one-half of the requests that are preferred, our present revenue would soon be absorbed. All our expenditure has to be provided for, as a rule, out of revenue, and I affirm at once that that is a very good thing, because when the public know that the money has to come out of their own pockets, they are disposed to be more economical than if they have access to loan funds.",49
208,Mr JOHNSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Does not the honourable gentleman think that the cost of administration may be excessive in some directions ?,49
209,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"In a great Department, employing between 11,000 and iz,000 officials, some mistakes are bound to occur. But I have no hesitation in saying that the administrative work of the Department will compare favourably with that of any other, not only in the Commonwealth, but in any country in the world. It is very easy to criticise, but when one becomes acquainted with the officers controlling the Post and Telegraph Department and other large' State institutions, hie must 'recognise that we have a number of capable officers. I quite agree with honourable members who have urged that we should pay our officers well, and nothing: would give me greater pleasure than to be able to announce that it was intended toincrease the salaries of those officers who have been so highly spoken of by the hon : orable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Macquarie. We have r however, to pay strict regard to the financial aspect of the matter.",49
210,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Does not the Minister think that we shall obtain more efficient service if we secure the very best men obtainable?,49
211,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Yes , I do. I think that we ought to pay higl^ salaries^ to the controlling officers; but we must hesitate to go beyond the present limit of £800 for Deputy Postmasters-General, whilst so many complaints are being made that the great majority of our officials are not in receipt of what they regard as a fair living wage. Let us take the case of the Deputy Postmaster-General 1 in New South Wales. Formerly the officerholding that position received £920 per annum. Before the present occupant, Mr. Unwin, took office, he was receiving £ 7 0 0 per annum, and upon his promotion his. salary was naturally raised to the amount-, that was paid to his predecessor. He was. If we given to understand, however, that whilstthat salary would be paid for the first year,, it was intended to regrade the offices in air the States, and that he would be paid the salary that Parliament decided to vote. ",49
212,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Yes .  told by the honourable member for Macquarie.,49
213,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I intended to propose a salary of £920.,49
214,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The honourable membergave way to the right honourable member for Balaclava, who was then Treasurer.",49
215,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I did not.,49
216,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I can prove it by referenceto Hansard.,49
217,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That is not true.,49
218,The CHAIRMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I must ask the honourable member to withdraw that statement.,49
219,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I withdraw the statement; but I say positively that theassertion of the honourable member is not correct. I intended to propose a salary of ;£92o.,49
220,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I rise to a point of order. I desire to say that my memory is clear that the honourable member for Macquarie - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member is making a personal explanation.,49
221,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I object to being misrepresented by the honourable member.,50
222,The CHAIRMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I understood the honourable member to rise to a point of order. If the honourable member thinks that he has been misrepresented, he will have the opportunity of making a statement subsequently.",50
223,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I desire to make a personal explanation.,50
224,The CHAIRMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The honourable member cannot interpose a personal explanation whilst another honourable member is in possession of the Chair. I would ask the Minister not to discuss in detail the matter to which he has been referring.,50
225,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I have no desire to discuss the matter in detail, but it struck me that it would be wise to supply the information asked for, because I understood it had been arranged that the whole of the discussion should take place upon this item, and that the Estimates should then be allowed to pass. The fixing of Mr Unwin's salary opened up a general question, affecting all the Deputy Postmasters-General, because in the other States a similar reduction has been made. In South Australia the salary of the Deputy Postmaster-General has been reduced from £ 1 , 0 0 0 to £ 6 5 0 per annum. I have as good an opinion of Mr Unwin as has my predecessor or the deputy leader of the Opposition.",50
226,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The view I take is that his salary ought to be fixed by the Public Service Commissioner.,50
227,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I do not like the introduction of the personal element. After all, my business is to provide such salaries as the Parliament will approve. Whilst I should like to pay these officers more all round, I cannot consent to do so until officers in the lower grades of the service have received increases.",50
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That Socialism. It means a levelling down.,50
229,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Las t night the deputy leader of the Opposition stated that the Postal Department was not paying. In reply, I should like to point out the position in which we really stand. At the present time we are constructing all postal and telegraph works out of revenue. Up to 30th June last we had expended in this connection £ 4 9 2 , 0 0 0 , and a further sum of £ 2 1 7 , 7 3 1 is provided upon this year's Estimates. If the honourable member for Parramatta will assess the total amount thus expended upon a basis of 10 per cent, he will find that the Department is almost paying its way.",50
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I do not understand the Postmaster-General.,50
231,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Does the honourable member contend that the Department ought not only to pay interest upon the transferred properties, but ought also to spend large sums out of revenue for the construction of these works?",50
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That is the decision of Parliament.,50
233,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"If we were to take credit for what we expend upon public undertakings in the way that an ordinary business firm would do, our revenue and expenditure would almost bal1 ance. Let us suppose that the interest upon 1 the transferred postal properties would amount to £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually. If we add to that interest at 10 per cent, upon £492,000-the expenditure upon' departmental works up till 30th June lastnamely, £ 4 9 , 2 0 0, we get a total of £249,200. During the current financial year we are charging the Department with the capital cost of new works and buildings, ^217,731, or only £ 3 1 , 5 0 0 less than the above-mentioned amount. Until the value just of the transferred properties is definitelyascertained, we cannot possibly take into account the interest on their cost. It seems to me that it is a mistake to expect that every service provided by the Department shall pay immediately. If we adopted the practice of carrying out only those works which would be at once reproductive, where should we land ourselves? It would simply mean thai we should not be able to afford sparsely-populated localities any conveniences whatever.",50
234,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The Department does not do that now.,50
235,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I disagree is good - with the honourable member. To those who advocate the abolition of the guarantee system, I wish to say that if they achieved their desire, they .would effectually stop many telephone extensions which are being undertaken tb-day. What dotes the guarantee system mean? Simply that in many districts where it is shown that a telephone service will not pay, the residents are asked to give a certain guarantee. The conditions of that guarantee have been modified from time to time. At present we go to the length of saying to the applicants for telephone extension, "" If you do not wish to give us a guarantee, we will endeavour to meet your wishes in the event of your consenting to erect some of the necessary poles, and to carry out some of the work.""  Government ?",50
236,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,It is.  master-General ask for a guarantee dn connection with the construction of the proposed trunk line from Melbourne to Sydney ?,51
237,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The honourable member had an opportunity to criticise that item when the Works and Buildings Estimates were under consideration, and he made very good use of it. As a matter of fact, the officers of the Department reported to my predecessor that the line to which he refers will return i o per cent, from the day it opens. If any member of this Committee can show me that a similar return can be secured by the erection of a telephone line, not only will I dispense with' the guarantee, but I will undertake to provide the service asked for.  master-General anything that he wantsupon paper.",51
238,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I know that the honourable member is very clever at showing a lot of things, but of course I must be permitted to refer any such matter to my officers. It is very for the honourable member for New England to exclaim, "" Why does not the Minister do something?"" But it is obvious that, in all these matters, some reference must be made to my officers.",51
239,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The General admitted that one case which I presented was unanswerable.,51
240,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The honenough, I will do so. orable member is misconstruing what I said to him. I extended to him a 'good ister deal of sympathy, but pointed out that sympathy without relief was not worth much. I further offered to meet him as best I could, and the matter to which refers is now on the verge of completion.",51
241,Mr KING OMALLEY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Why does not the Minister galvanize his officers into l i,51
242,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,They do not require to be galvanized into life.,51
243,Mr JOHNSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"In - many instances, the guarantees upon which the Department insists are too high.",51
244,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I desire to meet honourable members in every possible way. As we progress, I hope that we ; shall be able to make the conditions of the guarantee easier. But honourable members must recollect that I have been in office only a few weeks, and that the Government have had a very busy time during that period. I Jjave been twitted with being in favour of penny postage. As a matter of fact, I carried a resolution in the. New South Wales Parliament in favour of the adoption of that system; but financial considerations prevent us from establishing, it at the present time. Its adoption would involve the Commonwealth in a loss of about £2.50,000 annually. Is any honourable member prepared to tell his constituents that he is willing to impose that additional burden upon them? Moreover, a large deficit in the Postal Department would mean the withdrawal of many small services which are being extended to the country. I agree that it is desirable that we should expend money wherever it is possible to do so, in order to confer greater facilities upon the rural districts. That was the policy of my predecessor, and it is the policy of the Government.",51
245,Mr WATKINS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The Government are not giving effect to it .,51
246,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The Postal Department is practically the Public Works Department of the Commoneasy wealth. ' I sympathize with honourable members who are pressed by their constituents to secure to them all sorts, of services.",51
247,Mr WATKINS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"It is a case of extending svimpathv without affording them relief. ' Postmaster- Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I am endeavouring to afford relief, and if they will allow me to remain in office long,",51
248,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,How long does the Minwish to be allowed to remain in office?,51
249,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I have no desire to impose any limit upon mv tenure of office. I have been chided with living he on the fame of my predecessor. All I can say is, that it is a most substantia] thing to exist upon. It is not a political crime to give credit to a political opponent f e ? for the good work which he has performed. This House agrees, not only that my predecessor shook up the Postal Department, - and rendered good service to the Commonwealth, but that the honourable member for Coolgardie did likewise. The honourable member for Canobolas, the honourable member for New England, and the honourable member for Gwydir, have referred to the question of private mail bags. I have looked into that I find that, if the rate were reduced from £ 2 zs. to £ 1 is. per annum, it would result in a loss of £ 2 , 7 2 3 .",51
250,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,No charge should be made.,52
251,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I am aware that, in the opinion of my honourable friend, there are many matters in respect of which no charge ought to be made. I am endeavouring to ascertain whether some reduction cannot be made in the charge for this service. It seems to me that a man who has a daily mail-bag 'ought to pay a - little more than does the man who has a mail-bag made up only once or twice a week. I am inquiring into the matter, with a view to ascertaining whether some alteration cannot be made. I promise the Committee that something will be done.",52
252,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What about the officials?,52
253,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The honourable member may sneer at the officers; but I would remind the Committee that their only object is to advance the general efficiency of the Department. I feel satisfied that, whilst I follow the advice tendered me by the officers of the Department-by .men who are better qualified than I am judge of many of these matters- I shall not go very far wrong. There is a difsary. ficulty in regard to matters of policy; but when I desire to ascertain whether proposed service will pay, I naturally call for a - report from the officer who possesses the fullest knowledge of the facts. At same time, I feel that it is wise for ister to pay some attention to the represenbe tations of honourable members, because also have a knowledge of the facts relating to various claims for increased lities. I think that I have already given evidence that I am prepared to recognise that that is so.",52
254,Mr CAMERON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"What about the post office clocks? Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN' - I may say at once that, so far as I .am concerned, the day for .the erection .of post-office and the provision of costly clocks, has gone. Reference has been made to a number of other matters.",52
255,Mr WATKINS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What about the payment of officers discharging State duties?,52
256,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"We are endeavouring to arrive at a settlement with the States Departments concerned. Refermatter. ence was made to-night to the payment of railway officials who render services Io the Department. The Railways Commissioners, however, refuse to allow us to give their officers any remuneration. They say to us, in effect, "" If you desire us to perform certain services for you, we are prepared to do so; but an officer of the Department wfio is attending to your work this week may be sent elsewhere next week. You pay us for services rendered, and we will take care that our officers receive proper salaries."" If we are not prepared to accept their services on these terms, we must go elsewhere; but in; many cases it would not be convenient to make other arrangements. The case brought forward by the honourable and learned member for Illawarra has been answered already by the honourable member for New England, who explained that the position of a school teacher acting as a postmaster is altogether different from that of railway officials wfio are associated with our mails. As a rule, school teachers act as postmasters only in sparsely populated districts.",52
257,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,They have often to remain on duty on Sundays.,52
258,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"That is so.% to But we do not compel our officers to work on Sundays unless it is absolutely necesThe appointment of State school teachers as postmasters in small centres of a population is very convenient to the persons concerned, because their letters can be readily obtained by the children attending the the schools. It is only reasonable that, in a Minthe circumstances, a small payment should made to these officers for the services they which they render to the Commonwealth.",52
259,Mr WATKINS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What about postmasters postal facidoing State work?,52
260,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Postmas ters discharge many duties. Amongst other matters they are called upon to attend to the electoral work of the Commonwealth.,52
261,Mr WEBSTER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,And are not doing it very successfully.,52
262,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"They towers, brought the honourable member here.",52
263,Mr WEBSTER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,They did not.,52
264,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Our officers discharge many duties for the States, and we are endeavouring to make some arrangement by which the Commonwealth will be paid for services so rendered. It seems to me that it is desirable that we should get away from the old system, 'under which it was impossible to ascertain what an officer was actually receiving. It is much better that we should know exactly what our officers receive, and that a reciprocal arrangement, should be made between the States 'and the Commonwealth in respect of the services which they render each other. The Department has been criticised for its failure to adopt a uniform system of penny postage. In this respect we must hasten slowly. Varying rates prevail in the different States, and the introduction of penny postage must certainly involve serious fuiiaiicial considerations. It has been said that whilst the people of Victoria enjoy the benefit of the system, in many parts of New South Wales a twopenny rate is levied. The reform was brought about in Victoria shortlyprior to the establishment of Federation, but it has resulted in a loss of £50,000 per annual, which has to be borne by the State. At the close of the bookkeeping period-if some arrangement be not made in the meantime-somethin g will have to be done in the direction of uniform postage. It would be manifestly unfair, when all the States were contributing on a per capita basis to the cost of the service, to require the people of New South Wales, Western Australia, and some of the other States, to pay a 2d. postage rate, whilst in Victoria penny postage prevailed. That is my answer to the inquiries that have been addressed to me in this regard. Our desire is, wherever possible, to reduce the telephone rates. We wish' to introduce the toll system, with a view to popularizing the service. Under that system, those who have occasion to use the telephone only occasionally, would not be required to pay the present .high rates. I am looking forward to a reduction in the near future. The question is a big one. The honourable and learned member for Wamnon to-night declared war against the proposal, stating that if any attempt were made to increase the present rates, it would meet with considerable opposition. It is an easv matter to lower the rates, but it is difficult to increase them. As we have not yet reached the kernel of the matter. I do not bind myself in this regard, but the toll system will probably be introduced with a lower rate than that prevailing in connection with the flat system. In that event, those who desire to secure the use of the telephone at a lower rate will be able to avail themselves of the toll system. I look forward to the day when we shall have a telephone in every house-whe n its use will be possible, not merely for the rich, but for the poor. We hope to popularize the system. The only way in which to do so is to gradually reduce the rates, paying due regard, of course, to the position of the general taxpayer. Whenever any persons desire to avail themselves of the telephone service, but are not prepared to pay the flat rate, I shall be glad to discuss with their representatives in this Parliament a proposal to extend the service to them under the toll system-. We are about to prepare toll rates, and I feel that this will tend to popularize the service. It is 'necessary, however, that we should hasten slowly. So far, I have dealt with only a tithe of the questions that have been raised.",53
265,Mr CARPENTER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What about the wages of the relieving letter-carriers ?,53
266,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Sometimes a letter-carrier is on sick leave or holidays, and during his temporary absence we have to put in his place one who is familiar with his ""walk.""' Telegraph messengers are sometimes employed in this way; but, as the officer on leave draws his usual salary, the man who relieves him does not receive any increased pay. There are cases where messengers are acting as letter-carriers' without receiving extra pay, but they are only temporarily employed in that capacity. We d'o not desire to sweat any of our officials, and I am not going to take 'the responsibility of anything in that direction. If any of the charges of sweating mentioned by honourable members can be .proved, I shall want to know who is responsible for such a state of affairs. Our desire is to pay a living wage. Why, then, should I shoulder the responsibility of those who seek to sweat any of our employees? I propose to do justice to these men. I am inquiring into the cases that have been brought under my notice, and shall be obliged if honourable members will bring before me any instance of sweating, so that the injustice may be remedied. No useful purpose would be served by my discussing in detail all the questions that have been raised during the debate. I am pleased to receive suggestions from honourable members, and shall give careful consideration to those which have been made. I desire to thank honourable members for the very generous reception they have given to the Estimates of my Department. We have had a long discussion, but it has been a business-like one, and there has been no a'ttempt at a blockade. It is unnecessary, however, to ventilate in the House local matters of trifling concern. If honourable members will bring them under my notice, I shall' give them prompt attention, and shall be pleased to grant any service when financial considerations will allow of it . As to those which are on the border-line, I may say that I am always willing to regard small services from a generous stand-point, because it is the desire of the Government that the facilities of the Department shall be so extended as to meet with the approval of honourable members, and to gain for ourselves some credit in the country. Mr LONSDALE .(New England) From the remarks made by the Postmaster General, it might be inferred that I had spoken of the officials in derogatory terms. I certainly have not desired to do so. recognise that they have grown up in the service of the Department, and possess official minds. When they are asked to report upon any proposed service, they take care to be on absolutely safe ground. do not complain of that; but I do complain of the neglect of the Minister to formulate a policy that would lead to the officers of the Department preparing reports on different lines. The charge of 25s. per mile in respect of the upkeep for a telephone wire, where the posts are already erected, handicaps many people in rural districts, and is an outrageous charge to make. I think that the charge should, be graduated.",53
267,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The charge under the administration of the State was £ 2 per mile. It has been reduced to 25s., and when the Departmental officers report that the work can be done for less a further reduction will be made.",54
268,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The maintenance costs very much less than 25s. a mile, and if the charge were reduced a business would be developed which would be profitable to the Department. The Minister spoke of his policy being progress, with prudence, but it seems to be all prudence and no progress. The officials have put down 25s. a mile as a set price for maintenance all over the Commonwealth. But why should that rate be charged in Tasmania if the cost there is only ios. a mile ?",54
269,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I will look into the matter again.,54
270,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The officials say' that the maintenance of these wires costs 25s. a mile, and therefore, every one who uses them is charged at that rate. I do not think the cost is so much. At the present time, if a man is using eight miles of wire, he pays, in ten years, £ 1 0 0 for its maintenance, which is a monstrous sum. With regard to the loose post-bags, the Postmaster-General explained that under the State administration the charge was more. The question we wish him to consider, however, is whether the present charge is a fair one. If those living in a city, to whose door' letters are delivered twice a day, were asked to pay so much to cover the cost of the bags used by the carriers they would be up in arms against the charge; yet that is the treatment meted out to the residents of country districts. I can understand that it may be necessary to make a small charge to cover the cost I of the letter-bags, but I have given an instance in which a man who pays £ 3 15s. a year has been asked to pay £ 2 extra to have a bag made up once a week. The honourable member for Canobolas has men-I tioned a case in which an inspector gave the instruction that letters intended for delivery at one place were not to be tied together with string. That shows the working of the official mind. Perhaps the inspector thought that if the letters were tied together in parcels, the Department would lose the £ 1 , 7 0 0 received from loose bags. In my opinion, it would be sufficient to charge 5s. or ios. a year for these bags, or if those who use them supply their own bags, 2s. 6d. a year for the cost of making up and carrying them, f.do not advocate the doing away with guarantees in connection with the telephone system, because without them we should have requests for telephones from every little township, and the Department would be landed in expenditure from which it would get no return. But, in the case to which I have referred, in which the Department asked for a guarantee of £ 2 2 a year, the residents said, ""We do not want to trouble about guarantees. We will give you ,£100 in cash before you commence to erect the line.""' Notwithstanding that offer, their request was - not complied with, because an r official had estimated that a profit would not be obtained from the line. I saw the Postmaster-General in regard to the matter, and he admited to me that my case could not be answered. He gave me authority to see the inspector who had drawn up the estimate of revenue and expenditure, practically telling me that, although he was Minister, he could not do anything unless on the advice of the inspector.",54
271,Mr WEBSTER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Did the honourable member interview the inspector?,55
272,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Yes .,55
273,Mr WEBSTER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What did he say?,55
274,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I shall not tell the Committee what he said.,55
275,Mr STORRER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Is the honourable member in order in repeating his speech? I have heard some of his remarks already three times this evening.,55
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That is churlish.,55
277,The CHAIRMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The leader of the count. Opposition should not reflect on another honourable member. As I have already pointed out, this general debate is not strictlv in order, and the Minister has made a reply, which is generally looked upon as closing a discussion. Honourable members are rather abusing the concession made to them, and if the twenty-five speeches which we have heard are to be repeated, I shall have to exercise trie powers conferred upon me, and cause honourable members to confine their remarks strictly to the item before the Committee. I ask the honourable member for New England to refrain from referring to matters which he has already mentioned, and to bring his remarks to a close as speedily as possible.",55
278,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I do not wish to run counter to vour ruling, Mr Chairman, but I should like to point out that the honourable member for Bass could not already have heard what I am about to say, because I have not previously said it. When I met the inspector, I told him that I did not wish him to alter his report unless he could see in the matter as I saw, and felt that it should be altered. Mr Brewer was ""the inspector whom I saw, and I think that he will admit that I was absolutely fair to him in the matter.",55
279,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The honourable member saw the inspector in order to make him aware of some particulars which he had overlooked?,55
280,Mr LONSDALE,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Yes . But I told him that I would not alter rffy report for any man, unless I felt conscientiously bound to do so, and that I did not expect him to act otherwise. He made a report on my statements, and what I said in the matter has been borne out by facts.",55
281,Mr LIDDELL,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," Wit h regard to the supply of Obsolete telephones tocountry districts, I ask the Minister to giveinstructions to his officers that out-of-date, second-hand instruments shall not bedumped down in my electorate, but that new instruments shall be provided, seeing that the subscribers there pay as much as is paid - by the subscribers in the capitals",55
282,Mr TOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Parramatta) The Postmaster-General has to-night brought down a set of figures which are supposed to answer the statements which I made last evening, but which really confirm those statements. Among these figuresis an item of £.200,000 for interest, of which the Department now takes no ac",55
283,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That is the amount estimated by Mr Coghlan.,55
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I have no doubt that the amount has increased since the estimate was made, but I am willing to take it at £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 . The honourable gentleman has omitted to allow anvthing as a sinking fund on these properties. I estimated £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year for a sinking fund in regard to properties worth from £8,000,000to £10,000,000 . Then there is £217,000-for works; but the honourable gentleman does riot propose to charge that to the Department. That is the whole issue be 1 tween us. He proposes to take 10 per cent, of this amount and debit it to the Department; but what is to become of the other 90 per cent. ? Is it to be debited to some other Department? Et 3s spent every year. Therefore, I think that in all fairness it should be debited to this Department, in whose interests and in the facilitation of whose business the amount is spent. In view of the expenditure of £217,000upon new works and buildings, it remains true, as I stated last night, that the Department is in debit every year to the tune of £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 . I do not propose at this stage to make any observations with regard to the salary of the Deputy Postmaster General of ""New South' Wales, to which I shall specially refer at a later stage - In the meantime, I notice that the honourable member for Coolgardie is busily engaged - looking up Hansard., in order to find confirmation of the .'statement by which he sought to connect the late Postmaster-General with the proposal to reduce Mr TJnwin's salary. I do not think he will be successful. At any rate, the fact remains that he was the first, when he was in office, to pose the reduction.",55
285,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,And I am still prepared - to support it.,56
286,Mr TOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I shall be delighted if the honourable member will inform - us what was in his mind when he first proposed the reduction of the wages,56
287,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Does the honourable member call it "" wages "" when a man receives £800 per annum?",56
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I call it wages in that case, joist as I should refer to the wages of a man in receipt of £ 5 0 per annum.",56
289,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The honourable member had better go before his 30s. per week constituents and make statements similar to those he is now uttering.,56
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I hope to do so.. I do not think that one of those 30s. a week men will begrudge the salary paid to Mr. Unwin. I am reminded of the statement made by the Minister on this subject. I congratulate the honourable gentleman upon his generous mood. When the matter is one affecting honourable members he is prepared to give them mail bags, to relieve them of charges now levied, to give them free telephones, and to play the part of lord Bountiful to the whole Committee. But when he has to deal with the grievances of men who cannot appear before him, and who cannot represent matters for themselves he cuts down wages, on theplea that he is consulting the interests of those who are liberally paid. The postal officials of New South Wales who are receiving small salaries do not wish the salary of their chief cut down in this way. I should like to hear the honourable member for Coolgardie tell us something about his administration of the Post and Telegraph Department in Western Australia. When he was sitting on this side of the Chamber we used to hear him constantly criticising the administration in Western Australia. Afterwards he had a good term of office",56
291,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,For how long? I only had time to look in at the door.,56
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The honourable member occupied office for as long a term as the present Postmaster-General.h'as filled the position, but in spite of his intimate knowledge of the ramifications of the Postal Department in Western Australia!, he left it to his successor to make the changes which had been, found necessary,, aind to effect a saving of six or seven thousand pounds.. I should like to pro- know if the honourable member left any minutes onrecord to connect himself with mat great reform in the State of which he was the constant champion before he had an opportunity to take office? If he will insist upon linking the late Postmaster General with the reduction of Mr Unwin'ssalary, perhaps he will also endeavour to link himself with the great administrative reforms carried out in Western Australia. I would suggest to the honourable member that, instead of criticising the Estimates by interjection, he would do better to address himself to the consideration of the important matter to which I have referred..",56
293,Mr WEBSTER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I desire to make a few remarks with regard to the disabilities to which postal officers are exposed in the drought-stricken districts of New South Wales, where the temperature is high, and the officers and their families suffer severely by reason of climatic conditions. I think we: should introduce some system by which officers, who have done good service in the arid back-blocks, should be removed to more favoured localities. I know the case of one postmaster whose services are recognised by the Department as worthy of the highest appreciation, and who has been stationed for fourteen years in one of the worse districts of New South Wales. He has applied, time after time, for removal to a more equable climate, and although his own health has been broken, and his wife has become a conless firmed invalid, his request has been refused. Many other officers have had a similar experience, and they have still to remain at their posts, because, apparently, no means are provided for affording them relief. I desire, also, to direct attention to the conditions under which postal officials are required to act as electoral officers. I find that, owing to carelessness, or something worse, on the part of those responsible for the compilation of the electoral rolls, a very large number of electors in mv constituency have been struck off. I received a letter today which informed me that 800 names of well-known persons which had appeared in the old rolls had been omitted from the new rolls.",56
294,The CHAIRMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The honourable member cannot discuss that matter in connection with the Estimates now under consideration.,56
295,Mr WEBSTER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I desire to direct attention to the fact that certain postal cials are required to perform work under the Electoral Act, and that the remuneration given to them is not sufficient to induce them to carry out their duties efficiently.",57
296,The CHAIRMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The postal officials are not under the control of the Postmaster General whilst acting in the capacity of electoral officers; they are then under the authority of the 'Home Affairp Department.,57
297,Mr WEBSTER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"If the postal officials are required to serve two masters I can understand how all the confusion has arisen. I shall take another opportunity to bring this matter under notice, and I am sure that I shall be fully supported, because other honourable members will have similar grievances to ventilate. I trust that the Postmaster-General will, as far as lies in his power, insure that the officials of his Department, who are called upon to act as electoral officers, shall be properly remunerated.",57
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I move That the vote be reduced by £i. I take this course in order to afford honourable members an opportunity to express their opinion with regard to the proposal to reduce the salary of the Deputy PostWales. master-General of New. South Wales. feel that a great injustice is being done to that officer, and that some steps should taken to prevent him from being and degraded on the eve of his retirement from the service. This officer is being one man's work. treated unfairly, not only from the standpoint of his merits, but relatively to the salaries paid to the Deputy Postmastersthan General in the other States. As honormember able members are aware, a scheme of vision has been decided upon in-connection with these offices in all the States. I this should like to hear some reason for the change other than that which has been been adopted. furnished by the Postmaster-General. The only reason which he has advanced is that there are some officers in the lower grades of the service who are underpaid. If that be so, I say let us pay them adequately, but do not let us inflict an injustice upon the highest administrative officers in Department. That is the kind of Socialism in which I do not believe. It is a species of levelling down. I venture to say that when the Committee hear all the facts the case they will not agree to the prooffiposed reduction of Mr Unwin's salary. I understand that the whole scheme for the revision of the salaries attaching tothese high administrative offices has beenapproved by Cabitaet. It has been arranged that in New South Wales the salary of the Deputy Postmaster-General shall be reduced from £920 to £800, and that in Victoria it shall be cut down from £900 to £750.",57
299,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That does not apply to the present occupant of the office.,57
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,No ; the Government cannot touch Lt - Col. Outtrim'ssalary.,57
301,Mr TUDOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"But when Federation was established that officer brought over his salary with him, whereas the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales did not.",57
302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I ask the honourable member not to regard the matter in""that technical light, but to view it from the stand-point of substantial justice as between these two officers. In Queensland the present salary of the Deputy Postmaster-General is £700, and no reductionis proposed. I should like to hear the reason why that State has been so favoured?",57
303,Mr STORRER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The salary of the Deputv Postmaster-General there is less than 'that paild in both Victoria and New South' I Mr LONSDALE - Is there any comparisonbetween the work which has to be done inbe those States and that which has to be perhumiliated formed in Queensland?,57
304,Mr STORRER,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Yes . A man can do only,57
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"But one man'swork may be of infinitely more importance is another man's, as the honourable must recognise. I venture to say rethat, as an employer of labour, he hasfound that out. I should like to know why general scheme in regard to the salariesof the Deputy Postmasters-General has",57
306,Mr WATKINS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Hav e we had any explanation as to why the Deputy Postmaster General in New South Wales is to betreated differently from the officer occupying a similar position in Victoria ?,57
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"No . I presumethe that the honourable member for Yarra has furnished the only possible explanation. He says 'that when Lt - Col. Outtrim wastransferred to the Commonwealth service of he brought his salary over with him.. I appeal to the honourable member not to pay any regard' to such a technical consideration, but to decide this matter from the stand-point of substantial justice. repeat that that gentleman has been specially favoured in this connection. der 'if that is due to the fact that all the members of the central staff come from Queensland, and are therefore better able to appreciate the importance and value of the work done in that that done in the others. It is a strange coincidence that the central staff is composed of Queenslanders. In Western Australia the salary of the Deputy Postmaster General has been reduced from £700 to £650.",57
308,Sir JOHN FORREST,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What is the reason for that? The country is going ahead.,58
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Yes ; Western Australia is progressing by leaps and bounds. But the Treasurer does not take that fact into consideration. He is a party to this levelling dbwn process, and I hope that when he returns to Perth he will tell the people there that one of his first Ministerial acts was to reduce the salary of the Deputy Postmaster-General of that State. The right honourable gentleman need not point to his colleague, because I understand that this matter was. submitted to Cabinet. Consequently, he must shoulder responsibility equally with the Postmaster General. In Tasmania, no alteration is proposed in the salary of the Deputy Postmaster-General. But if the contention of the honourable member for Bass be correct he ought to receive an increase from £ 5 0 0 to £ 8 0 0 .",58
310,Mr KING OMALLEY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,H is salary ought to be reduced to £ 3 0 0 .,58
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I am satisfied to allow the Tasmanian representatives to settle that matter between themselves. I think that the revenue of the Postal Department in the various States fairly indicates the relative degree of responsibility attaching to the various officers. Viewed from that stand-point, what is the position? The estimated revenue of the Department in New South Wales for the current year is £1,000,000, whereas in Victoria it is only £ 6 9 6 , 0 0 0 . It is proposed that the Deputy Postmaster-General in the latter State shall receive, by way of salary, £ 1 0 0 more than the Deputy Postmaster-General in the former, although the revenue of the Department in Victoria is £300,000 less. I should like to direct the attention of the honourable member for Yarra to the fact that in Victoria the salary of future Deputy Postmasters-General has been fixed at I £ 7 5 0 , whereas in Queensland the occupant of that office will receive £ 7 0 0 . That is I wonto say, the former will receive only £ 5 0 a year more than the latter, although the revenue of the Department in Queensland is only £ 3 3 6 , 0 0 0 , or less than one-half that of Victoria. . In Western Australia, State than where the revenue of the Department is £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 annually, and in South Australia, where it is £ 2 7 6 , 0 0 0, the salaries of the Deputy Postmasters-General have been fixed at £ 6 5 0 .",58
312,Mr TUDOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"If effect were given to the honourable member's argument we should have to pay all the Deputy Postmasters General the same salary as was previously paid in South Australia, namely, £ 1 , 0 0 0 a year. Mr JOSEPiH COOK - Not at all. I am endeavouring to show the relative importance of the .work which these officers perform. In Tasmania, the Department collects a revenue of £ 1 1 3 , 0 0 0 , and the Deputy Postmaster-General there receives a; salary of £ 5 0 0 per annum. Mr KING O'MALLEY - He gets too. much.",58
313,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"There is another test which can be applied in this connection. In New South Wales, the Deputy Postmaster-General controls 4,000 permanent employees; in Victoria, he has 2,690men under him ; in Queensland, 1,260; in Western Australia, 1,334; in South Australia, 1,071; and in Tasmania, 416.. The Deputy Postmaster-General in New South Wales, who controls 4,000 men, will receive £ 8 0 0 a year, whilst the officer filling a corresponding position in Queensland 1 will be paid only £ TOO less, although he has but one-third of that number of employees under him. There is no equitable principle underlying the proposed revision of these salaries. These are two pretty good tests of the relative value and importance of the work performed by these officers. Having regard to these facts, I say that the salary of Mr Unwin is being unjustly cut down, and I shall be glad to hear what are the reasons for the action which has been taken. I think that a mistake has been made in slavishly following the technique of the Public Service Act. Why do the Cabinet wish to interfere in this matter? There is no obligation laid upon them to doso. The. Act makes a technical distinction Estimates: [REPRESENTATIVES.] between administrative offices and the ordinary offices of the Department ;, but that does not impose upon the Minister an obligation to take this matter into his own hands. It is still open to him to consult the Commissioner. His.predecessor did so. He was not under any compulsion, but he said, in effect: "" I would rather be rid of this responsibility, and place it upon the shoulders of the man whom the Parliament specially appointed to undertake it."" In passing the Public Service Act, honourable members did not intend that any distinction should be made. The fact that a distinction had been made between the two classes of officers was discovered subsequently by some of the lawyers in the service. We were under the impression that the Public Service Act would place every officer under the Commissioner. I , therefore, say that the Postmaster-General would have done veil had he followed the example of his predecessor in this respect. When th$se salaries came under review, he should have submitted tbem to the Commissioner, and have acted upon his opinion. I understand that that is what the honourable member for Macquarie did - Having consulted the Public Service Commissioner, who decided that the salary ought not to be reduced, he submitted to the Committee a proposal that £920 per annum should be paid to the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales, and that salary was voted last session. Why has this change been made? <The Postmaster-General has told us nothing, except that there are some other men in the lower branches of the service who are not receiving princely salaries.",58
314,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,B e fair; I have not had an opportunity to deal with the - matter.,59
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"We may all regret the fact that certain officers are not Teceiving better salaries; but that is no justification for reducing the salaries of men in the higher branches of the service. This reduction could not bring them any relief-eve n if they received every penny of it, it would make no perceptible increase in their salaries. I hope to hear the Minister justify the reduction. One other observation, and I shall have done. In apportioning these salaries, we have a right to look at the position of compared with other heads of Departments In the States from which they were taken over. When the office of Deputy Postprobably master-General of New South Wales was Postmaster-General. under the control of the State> the salary attaching to it was £920. per annum. Other offices which were rated at the same time still carry a salary of £1,000 per annum. I , therefore, think we are doing this officer a grave injustice in taking £200 a year off the salary which he received when under the State regime, notwithstanding that no reduction has been made in respect of the labour, value, or responsibility of his office. Another point relating to the present occupant of the office in New South Wales, is that he is just about to leave the Department. To reduce his salary twelve months before he leaves the Department is to degrade him in the eyes of every man in the service. If I were in his place I would not go to the office any more after my salary had been reduced; I should not, in such circumstances, like to face the officers there. I do not think that we ought to degrade public servants in this way. It does not contribute to the efficiency of the Department; it certainly does not add to its discipline. As I said last night, it is scurvy treatment to mete out to an old and tried officer, who has spent forty-five years in the service of the country. I hope that the Minister will yet agree to revise this item, and restore the original salary. At any rate, I ask him to do what his predecessor did, and what this House, when it passed the Public Service Act, intended should be done-to submit the matter to the arbitrament of the Public Service Commissioner. Let the Commissioner appraise the value of the services of these officers as he has already appraised the value of other officers' services, and let us pay them whatever amount he fixes. That would be a reasonable course to pursue. I bave yet to hear the reasons for discriminating, as proposed, between these officers. Their responsibilities are not by any means commensurate ; and the differentiation in salary does not represent the differentiation in their responsibilities, and in the importance of the work which they perform. That is my first criticism of the scheme as a whole.. Then, I say, that so far as the present Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales is concerned, he is worth every penny that he has been receiving, and that his salary, on that ground alone, ought not these officers as to be reduced ",59
316,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE, There is no man in the Public Service of the Commonwealth more capable or more 0 estimable than the Deputy Postmaster General 'Of New South Wales.,59
317,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Hear , hear.",60
318,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I think that he would adorn the Public Service of any country. - He is undoubtedly a loyal and devoted servant of the Government, and of the people of the Commonwealth. To show that my opinion of this officer is not a newly-formed one, I would point out that when this question was under discussion in this House nearly twelve months ago, I used these wordsThe proposed appropriation for the Deputy Postmaster-General in New South at j£o20, but I think that the feeling of the Committee is that these 'high salaries should be considerably reduced. I do not say that the gentleman who has been filling the position.in New South Wales is not a very worthy and able man, but the salary attached to the office was fixed at a time when the person holding it dealt .directly with the Postmaster-General of his State, and was responsible for matters of administration which now occupy the attention of the Central Staff. Now that these offices are becoming vacant, a proper and reasonable opportunity is afforded for reconsidering the value of the services to be performed by their holders. If we do not reduce those high salaries, we shall leave ourselves open to the charge, which has often been levelled against the Federal Parliament, of doing nothing to decrease expenditure. I think that we should now make a beginning, and thus justify the hope which the people entertained, that Federation would lead to the administration of this Department in a more 'economical manner. What gain would there be - from the transference of the States Departments to the Commonwealth if the higher officials in the service continued to draw the large salaries which were allotted to them when they had greater responsibilities? I do not wish to disparage the occupants of those offices; but it must be obvious to the Minister that their responsibilities are not so great, and that their duties are not so heavy, as when they were directly responsible to the Postmasters-General of the States. Their work has been much simplified, their responsibilities have been diminished, and therefore there is no justification for continuing to pay to them the high salaries which have hitherto prevailed, and for which provision is made on these Estimates. I reiterate the remarks which I made on that occasion, and think they are a sufficient answer to nearly every argument which the honourable member for Parramatta has advanced. I do not intend to pay any attention to his observations relative to my short tenure of office as Postmaster-General. No one knows better than he does how impossible it is for a Minister who remains in office for only thirteen or fourteen weeks to carry out an effective system of reform. But the honourable member was scarcely .fair when he said that I did nothing to reform the Department in Western Australia. I would! remind him that, in ridding the service of the official who was mainly responsible for the maladministration which occurred in that branch of the Department, I made a good beginning.",60
319,Sir JOHN FORREST,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The honourable member did not get rid of him.,60
320,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,He retired during my term of office.,60
321,Sir JOHN FORREST,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,He was going to retire 'before.,60
322,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,But I think he went Wales remains while I was there.,60
323,Sir JOHN FORREST,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,All the trouble has arisen since then.,60
324,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I do not wish to enter into a disputation with the right honourable gentleman, but I respectfully differ from that view.",60
325,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Is it not a fact that the officer in question received notice to retire before the honourable member ""took, office?",60
326,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That is so.,60
327,Sir JOHN FORREST,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,He asked to go. He was not given notice to retire.,60
328,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I am seeking to reply to the remark made by the Treasurer, that all the trouble in connection with* the Department has arisen since the retirement of this officer. Having regard to the fact that ,£920 was lifted out of the'safe in? the head office-unde r the very nose of the Deputy Postmaster-General, so to speak-it can hardly be said that all the trouble arose after his retirement.",60
329,Sir JOHN FORREST,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That was prior to the establishment of Federation.,60
330,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"That fact in nowise lessens the responsibility of the chief officer of the Department in Western Australia. I trust that the Committee will not be misled by the rhetorical flights of the honourable member for Parramatta, who, I am sure, is anxious to do all that he can for the'highly-paid officials of the service. I do not blame him when he considers that they are worthy of his support; but I should like to hear him champion with equal vigour and ability the cause of the officers of the Department who are receiving only £ 2 2s. or 30s. per week. That would do him more credit.",60
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I believe that I have championed their cause as often ashas the honourable member.,60
332,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"It would redound more to the honourable member's credit if , in stead of endeavouring to secure the continuance of a salary which, even as proposed to be reduced, would be a very generous one, he spoke in support of the cause of these poorly-paid men. The honourable member has chosen to cloud the issue as affecting the Deputy Postmaster General of New South Wales. So far from having any feeling against Mr U n win, I may say that I have the highest respect for him. I repeat that I consider him one of the most capable officers in the service of the Commonwealth.",61
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I guess that he would rather have cash than sympathy. Mr Mahon"" - Possibly ; but the honourable member must allow me to say that, in supporting the- proposal to reduce the salary of this officer, I am not animated by any personal feeling against him. I would put it to my honourable friend whether it is fair that a salary of £ 9 2 0 should be paid tb the Deputy Postmaster General ^n New South Wales, when the highest official in the Department-a n officer who has to administer the affairs, not of one State, but of six-receive s only jQSo per annum in excess of that amount?",61
334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I certainly think so.,61
335,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"If the honourable member had moved to increase the salary of the Secretary to .the Department by £ 2 0 0 , or £ 3 0 0 , . I should have recognised his consistency.",61
336,Mr WATKINS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Does the honourable member think that he has as much work to do as has the Deputy Postmaster General ?,61
337,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I think that he has infinitely more work than have any of ""the Deputy Postmasters-General, and that his responsibilities are also much greater. The Deputy Postmasters-General of al l the plain States are now discharging purely routine or £ 2 0 0 . duties. They are not called upon to advise the Postmaster-General on great questions of policy involving hundreds thousands of pounds.",61
338,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Yes , they are, so far as the State over which they preside concerned.",61
339,Mr WATKINS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The Postmaster-General acts on the reports of his deputies.,61
340,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"If a thousand pounds year is adequate payment for the Secretary of the Department, who is responsible for its policy, and for the most momentous steps, £ 9 2 0 is too much for the Deputy Postmaster-General for New South Wales, who does comparatively routine work. Mr . Unwin was under no misapprehension when he accepted his present post, and although he has drawn £ 9 2 0 per annum since he was appointed to it, he must have known from the debates in this Chamber that it was the intention of Parliament to grade the position.",61
341,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The debates in this House did not show that.,61
342,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"He was quite aware that Parliament would fix the salary on these Estimates, and that he had no claim to a salary of £ 9 2 0 .",61
343,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Althoug h the honourable member for Macquarie, when Postmaster General, resisted the reduction of this salary, one of his principal colleagues expressed a contrary opinion in regard to it .",61
344,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That may be.,61
345,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"That shows that the Cabinet was not unanimous on the subject, and had not determined to fix the salary at £ 9 2 0 . Why, therefore, has there been this display of heat, and these reckless charges against the Postmaster-General?",61
346,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I have made no charges; I have merelv argued the point.,61
347,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I do not say that the honourable member has made charges; but, unless my ears have deceived me, charges have been made. Mr Unwin, when he accepted his present position, must have been aware of the improbability of the salary being allowed to remain at £ 9 2 0 a year. He took it on that understanding, and will, therefore, have no right to complain of any action which Parliament may take in the matter.",61
348,Mr WATKINS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,And the Deputy Postmasters-General of Western Australia and the other States will have no right to comi f their salaries are reduced by £ 1 0 0,61
349,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Some of those salaries have already been reduced. The Victorian and salary has not been reduced because the officer who fills the position of Deputy Postmaster-General in this State occupied is the position prior to Federation; but it is proposed ""to reduce the salary to £ 7 5 0 when he retires. In Queensland, when the present Secretary to the Department vaa cated the pdsition now held by the Deputy Postmaster-General of the State, the salary attached to it was reduced from £ 8 0 0 to £ 7 0 0 . In South Australia the salary of the Deputy Postmaster-General has been reduced from £ 1 , 0 0 0 to £ 6 5 0 , though I am aware that the late occupant of the position there performed special duties as Government Astronomer. In Western! Australia the salary has been reduced from £ 7 0 0 to £ 6 0 0 . I should be the last to wish to inflict injustice on Mr. Unwin, who is a conscientious and able man, and if the honourable member for Parramatta, who thinks that an injustice is being done to him, cam suggest some way of recompensing him without interfering with the regular and consistent grading of the office, I shall support him.",61
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I take the ground that the office is worth quite £92.0 a year.,62
351,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I understood the honorthat able member to base his claim largely on the personality of the ootupant of the office.,62
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Not at all.,62
353,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Then I am more emphatically against the position which he has taken up than I was before. The honourable member has taken the ground that officers in the service of the State still ceive salaries of £ 1 , 0 0 0 a year; but the fact that the State Government pays extravagant salaries is no justificationfor Commonwealth doing so. If Mr Unwin had occupied the position prior to Federation, or had been appointed to it before the Public Service Act was passed, and before any grading was done, I should not sanction any reduction of the salary; but as he, like other Deputies, has accepted it , knowing that it might be reduced, I see no reason why we should not reduce it, if we think it right to do so. I am sorry that the honourable member for Parramatta has grown rather excited over the matter.",62
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Not at all.,62
355,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Then I should like to know what he looks like when he is excited. I am willing to do full justice to this excellent officer, and, as I have said before, if any means can be devised to give him what is considered to be his due, by way of gratuity on his retirement, I shall support any action that may be taken in that direction.",62
356,Mr WATSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I regret very much that the Government have thought fit to reduce the salarv of the Deputy Postmaster-General in New South Wales. It is stated that Mr Unwin was placed in his present position conditionally upon his being prepared to accept whatever salary Parliament might vote. Every officer in the service accepts his position under similar conditions, and .therefore that question does not enter into consideration. There is no doubt about the efficiency of Mr Unwin. He has spent practically a lifetime in the service, has done good work all along, and is still a thoroughly capable man. He will be called upon to retire within a year, and he is not concerned, as the honourable member for Coolgardie seems to imagine, merely about the difference between the salaries of £ 8 0 0 and £ 9 2 0 for one year, but about the effect - the reduced salarywill have upon the amount he is to receive by way of pension. It seems to me as Mr Unwin was appointed at a salary of £ 9 2 0 , it would be unfair to reduce his remuneration during his tenure of office.",62
357,Mr MAHON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,He was not appointed at a salarv of £ 9 2 0 .,62
358,Mr WATSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Yes , he was, and he has received, that salary for at least one year. It has been recognised as a principle by re- this Parliament that unless a general retrenchment scheme is being carried out, the salaries of officers shall not be reduced the during their tenure of office, except, of course, they prove themselves to be inefficient or grossly careless. I do not know of one instance in which an officer with whom no fault could be found, has had his salary reduced during his tenure of office, and I think that a very worthy gentleman has been singled out for special treatment in a most undesirable manner. I trust that, in view of the opinions expressed by honourable members, the Government will reconsider the position, and see if they cannot deal with Mr Unwin quite apart from the question as to the salary which would attach to the office under ordinarv conditions.",62
359,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Macquarie) I am sure that the honourable member for Coolgardie did not intend to do me any iniustice when he referred to my action in this matter. When the subject was under discussion last year, and the suggestion was made' that Mr Unwin's salarv should lie reduced, I took a 'Strong stand against it. I saidThe suggestion was then made that the salary attaching to the office should be reduced to £800 per annum. It is, perhaps, needless to say that I do not agree with that suggestion. I think that an officer who is qualified to fill such an important position should, by reason of his ability and experience, be able to command a salary of ^920 per annum. There is no doubt whatever as to the ability of the present occupant of lhat office. He bas to control a revenue which, last year, amounted to ^941,000, and an expenditure which aggregated ^gsojooo. ther, he has to take charge of the Government Savings Bank's transactions, and of all moneyorder and postal-note business. He has also to accept a responsibility which he was not previously called upon to bear. In pre-Federation days the Postmaster-General shouldered the responsibility of approving of practically all expenditure nexion with the Department, but at the present time it devolves upon the Deputy Postmasters-General. . . .

In view of the fact that I had been able to persuade the House that £ 9 2 0 was a fair salary, I felt sure I should be able to obtain that remuneration for the present I occupant of the office. In New South Wales alone there are nearly 4,000 public servants under the Public Service Commisprosioner, by whom salaries and positions are fixed ; and I ask what reason there can be for refraining from placing the Deputy Postmaster-General under the same control?

A Deputy Postmaster-Generd.1 has the supervision of works, involving the expenditure of thousands of pounds, and he ought to be protected against any suggestion that if he does not act in a certain way his salary may be interfered with. He ought to feel when dealing with departmental affairs that he has the protection of a man with no political leanings. I do not blame the Postmaster-General for the action which has been taken, because it has been decided that the Deputy Postmasters-General do not come under the Public Service Commissioner, so far as their salaries are concerned.",64
387,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Will the honourable member explain what he dad in connection with the matter when he was Postmaster-General?,64
388,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Honourable members may be 'anxious to go home, but I think that it is our duty to look after the interests ",64
389,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"B y securing a competent man to control the Postal Department in New South Wales we shall be conserving the interests of the taxpayers. Honourable members urge that the increase from £700 to £920, which Mr Unwin received, was a very large one, and yet they make no complaint about the Deputy Postmaster-General in Queensland, who upon his appointment to that position received an increase from £500 to £700. I trust that the salary of the Deputy Post1 master-General in New South Wales will Be restored to £920.",64
390,Mr BROWN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I intend to support the amendment of the deputy leader of the Opposition, because I desire the full salary of Mr Unwin to be restored to him. He is a very faithful and competent officer. He has been in the service for forty-five years, and has risen to his present position from the lowest grade. During the latter portion of his service the office of Deputy Postmaster-General in New South Wales was filled by Mr Lambton and Mr Dalgarno, who have since retired in quick succession in consequence of attaining the age limit. During their tenure of office Mr. Unwin had a large amount of work thrust upon him. He practically acted as Deputy Postmaster-General whilst nominally they discharged the duties of the office. Mr Unwin was appointed to his present position last year, when Parliament voted the full salary which has attached to it for some time, namely, £920 . Upon the present occasion, however, the Government, without assigning any reason for their action, ask the Committee to vote only £800. It seems to me that that is not a generous way in which to treat an officer who has rendered such valuable service as has Mr Unwin. Had he been appointed to his present position at a salary of £800 per annum the policy of the Government in this connection would not have been open to so much objection. But after this officer has been paid £920 for twelve months' service, and after he has given the , Department every satisfaction, the Government seek to 'reduce the amount to £800. They urge that the office is worth only £800. I venture to say that the salary of any position to which the same amount of responsibility attached would be appraised at considerably more than £920 per annumthe salary which the State originally proposed to give. I understand from the late Postmaster-General that if the decision of this matter were left to the Public Service Commissioner, the present salary would be maintained. I do not know what authority he had for making that statement, but apparently he spoke with some warrant. If that is the case, the position ought to be under the control of the Commissioner, and the Government should not be asked to fix the amount of salary. If he is competent to fix the salary of not only every officer under this gentleman, but every officer in other Departments, surely the amount of information he possesses qualifies him better to fix the salary of this officer than the Minister or the Committee can be! Itseems to me that a great injustice is being inflicted upon a deserving and capable officer, and I trust that, as the outcome of this - debate his salary will be restored to the amount which he received last year.",64
391,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE, I think that the Postmaster-General ought to give an explanation to the Committee.,65
392,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I am quite willing to give it at any moment.,65
393,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"All I want to hear from the Minister is an explanation of the reason for reducing the salary of this officer,",65
394,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," The honourable member for Parramatta was hardly fair, in the inference he drew concerning the Queensland officer. I believe that any one of us would be very sorry to think that because the secretary to the Central Office comes from that State he would be induced to favour a Queensland officer. I hardly think that the honourable membercould have meant to convey that impression, although his words were capable of that construction. The late Postmaster-General took sound ground when he said that the fixing of these salaries might very well be left to the Public Service Commissioner. But he gave his case away when he said that he had discussed this particular question with the Commissioner, and knew that that officer approved of the salary he had proposed. He would lead the Committee to believe that this appointment was made like every other ordinary appointment, and that no intimation was made to Mr Unwin that he was to receive £ 9 2 0 for only the current financial year. Whenan appointment is made in the ordinary course, what intimation is made to the gentleman who is appointed? He is informed of the salary which the position carries, but no special stipulation of any kind is made. To show what must have been in the mind of the late Postmaster General, I propose to read the telegram which was sent to Mr Unwin on the ioth February, 1905Governor-General in Council has approved your promotion to the position of Deputy Postmaster' General, New South Wales; salary attached to that position for current financial year to be at the rate of ^920 per annum, but to be subject thereafter to provisions of annual Appropriation Acts; such promotion to date from the ist July, 1904, for the purpose of seniority. Please note accordingly. Confirmation follows by post.",65
395,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That was following the wording of the provision in the Public Service Act.,65
396,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The honourable member is aware that that is a special stipulation which has been inserted in only two cases. The honourable member for Macquarie knows full well that I did not cast any doubt upon what he wanted to do, because I believe that right through he has been in favour of this high salary being given. The intention of the Cabinet must be quite evident to honourable members. A salary of £920 having been voted for the office, and Mr Unwin having been promoted from a positibn carrying £700, the Cabinet did not think it right to reduce his salary at that time, but it was clearly implied that there was likely to be a change made when the next Estimates were considered. Why was that inference to be drawn? Because ift was recognisedand I believe it is so recognised by a majority of honourable members and by the people of this country-that whereas a reduction of salary should be made when a certain amount of responsibility had been taken away, it should not be made in the case of an old officer who was in the same position as the Deputy Postmaster General in Victoria, who brought his salary over with him, and can legally claim it. As opportunity might offer, it was intended to grade the officers according to what was considered to be their responsibility, and to fix the salary which should be attached to the positions. The same treatment was meted out to the Deputy Postmaster-General in Western Australia. That conveys very clearly what must have been the intention of the Cabinet. However, it is for the Committee to say what salary ought to be paid to this officer. We cannot pay an officer according to what we think he is - worth. I know many men in receipt of £ 1 5 6 or £ 1 4 0 a year who are rendering - good service to the Commonwealth, but who I think are worth a great deal more. We are not in a position, however, to raise the - salary of every officer whom we know. It is highly - undesirable for any one to come here and canvass the merits of a particular officer. In my opinion, Mr Unwin is a very deserving officer. After listening to the honourable member for Parramatta, I intimated! that I was prepared to reconsider his position, seeing that he was going out of the service. I said that if it were thought .that we were degrading an officer who"" had served the country for forty years we ought - to reconsider the matter, but I was quite of the opinion that a salary of £ 8 0 0 was sufficient for the office. I dispute the contention of the honourable member for Parramatta that the way to calculate the salary - of an administrative officer is to consider the amount of revenue received, and the number of officers under his care. We know who controls the salaries of the officers to a very great extent. And the honourable member for Macquarie knows very well that a great proportion, probably one-half of the expenditure other than for salaries, is incurred by way of contracts, and is dealt with by the Central Office. On the other hand, the Savings Bank officials are responsible directly to the State authorities. In this way, the - responsibility of a this officer has been siderablv reduced. I would remind the honourable member for Parramatta that the salary of the Deputy Postmaster-General in Queensland was reduced from £ 8 0 0 to £ 7 0 0 as from the ist July. 190T. That was an indication of the evident intention of the Cabinet that the Parliament was to fix the salary. I admit that a fair case may be '-made out for reconsidering the position of Mr U n w in; but before attempting to increase his salary, we ought to consider what we propose to do with regard to many other officers who are receiving far less remuneration. In discussing this matter, I do not profess' to have any expert knowledge, because my administration of the Department extends over only a few months; but it seems to me that if the basis on which the honourable member for Parramatta puts his case is to be accepted, we ought to pay the Denuty Postmaster-General of Western Australia as much as we pay the Deputy Postmaster-General of Victoria. It may be asked why I take this view. I take it because the Deputy Postmaster General of Western Australia has greater responsibilities than has the officer occupying a corresponding position in this State. He is far removed from the Central A d ministration, and is called upon to recommend expensive mail services, or the erection of post-offices in connection with new gold-fields which may be blooming today and dying out tomorrow. He has to deal with a very large territory, and consequently his task, like that of the Deputy Postmaster-General of Queensland, is more responsible than is that of the"" Deputy Postmaster-General of Victoria.",65
397,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,And yet the honourable gentleman has reduced his salary.,66
398,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I hold that he is fairly paid. I would ask the honourable member whether he is prepared to raise the salaries of all these highly paid officials? When the honourable member speaks of this reduction as being the introduction of Socialism,66
399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The honourable gentleman is running away from his own argument.,66
400,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I aim not; I am merelv answering the interjection of the honourable member for North Sydney. Judging them by the payments made to officers throughout the service, we have con- placed these salaries on a fair basis.",66
401,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"If the rate of payment in the case of the Deputv Postmaster General of Western Australia is a fair one, then according to the honourable gentleman's argument, the salaries of some of these men ought to be considerably reduced.",66
402,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I am merely dealing with the honourable member's own argument as to the postal revenue of New South Wales, and the responsibility resting upon the shoulders of the Deputy Postmaster-General of that State. So fa r as Mr Unwin's position is concerned, I think that a case has been made out for further consideration. It was distinctly implied by the Executive minute, to which I have referred, that Parliament was to settle the question.",66
403,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Exactly .,66
404,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,If the honourable member had that in his mind,67
405,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The point is that I provided on the Estimates for a salary of £ 9 2 0 .,67
406,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"That is so. I do not wish to labour the question, but if we are going to eulogize every officer with whom we are acquainted, no matter what his grade in the service may be-an I hold that we ought to give as much conhas sideration to the man who is receiving only £ 1 5 0 per annum as we do to the officer who is in receipt of a salary of £ 8 0 0 annum",67
407,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Hear , hear; why not place this officer under the provisions of the Public Service Act?",67
408,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"We are claiming not discussing that point. I experienced pleasure in putting this reduced item on the Estimates. It is much more pleasing to increase the salary of an officer, esnexion pecially when one knows him, and believes him to be a good and faithfu l servant; but I must not forget that I owe a duty be obvious. to the taxpayers as. well as to other officers in the service who are drawing lower sioner salaries. In all the circumstances, I hold that the grading of this office at £ 8 per annum is reasonable, and I ask the Committee to stand by it. As regards Mr. Unwin, if the. honourable member for Parhave ramatta will withdraw his amendment",67
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I have been dealcers. ing, not with Mr Unwin, but with his office.",67
410,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The honourable member said that we were meting out scurvy treatment to Mr Unwin, and were attempting to degrade him. In view of the Executive minute left by my predesioner cessor, it must be obvious that the late Government considered that this salary was open to revision. If the honourable memsort ber for Parramatta wished to infer that because the Secretary to the Post and Teleexact graph Department came from Queensland he would attempt to deal unfairly with, officer in that State, I think that, flection, he will admit that the whole history of the Secretary goes to disprove the justice of his suggestion. I think that a case may well be made out for further consideration so far as Mr Unwin is concerned; but i seems to me that the grading of the office is a fair and reasonable one, and that, the responsibility attaching to it has been reduced to a large extent, the Committee might well allow the item to stand.",67
411,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," But for the remarks made by the Postmaster-General, it is probable that I should not have spoken during this debate. The honourable gentleman has paid the late Government the indirect, though unintentional, compliment that it has received, on more than one occasion, at the d 'hands of honourable members opposite. He alluded to what he savs they intended to do as a sufficient reason for what he has done; but I think that he ought to be preper pared to accept the responsibility for his own action. but",67

415,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"All the administrative heads of Departments. It was evident that, whether''the salaries were fixed by the Government, or the .Commiswas consulted and his grading accepted, some decision would have to be arrived at by Ministers prior to the final reto Parliament itself. Consequently, it was only right that we should indicate the position to the officer receiving the appointment, especially when consideration an of the salaries had not then taken place. upon reThat was the only object which we had in view in sending the telegram to him. It must be remembered that, apart altogether from the position of the Ministry, the Parliament itself took some responsit bility in the matter when, on the eve of the appointment of an officer to the position as of Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales, it fixed the salary at £ 9 2 0 per annum. The offer of the Postto it. master-General to reconsider Mr Unwin's - case is valueless, unless it means that will reconsider the question of the salary - to be paid him. Unless that be done, Mr. Unwin will lose the benefits of his fortycan five years of service in New South Wales; will lose not only the salary hitherto paid - the chief of the Department, but the pension of the chief.

As for treating officers in receipt of £ 1 - a year differently from officers getting - higher salaries, the honourable member for Macquarie does not propose to do that.

I understand that divisional inspectors are to be stationed at Armidale, Orange, West Maitland, and Wagga. I find that the inspector who is. to be stationed at Wagga instead of the officer at Orange is to be responsible for the inspection of post-offices in the western division of New South Wales, and I should like some more information on this subject. The inspectors should not wait until applications are made for the extension of postal and other facilities, but should make suggestions with a view to improving the public/ conveniences. It has been reported to me by some of the officials that until recently they were if they made suggestions to the officers at head-quarters, and I was very pleased when the late Postmaster-General, who did exceedingly good work in the administration of the Department, issued a circular inviting officers to offer suggestions. I should like to know whether any suggestions have been received, and what is their general character.",69
440,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE, I entirely approve of the scheme initiated by my predecessor providing for the location of inof his spectors in the country districts.,69
441,Mr WATSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That is a very old,69
442,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Yes , but the late Postmaster-General was the first to bring it into operation. The present arrangements have been in force such a short time that it is rather too early to express an opinion as to whether they are likely to prove satisfactory or otherwise. I believe, however, that when the inspectors become familiar with their districts they will be able to make valuable suggestions.",69
443,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What about the western district ?,70
444,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I think that some arrangement may be made for devoting a little more attention to it, but as it is a district of great distances I am afraid that it will be impossible to find an entirely satisfactory location for the tor.",70
445,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,I shall be quite content if the inspector responsible for the western district were located in the Darling electorate.,70
446,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I shall give the representations of the honourable member every consideration. In the same way that the Department is pleased to receive suggestions from its officials, I shall be glad to receive any recommendations that honourable members may be prepared to make. A number of useful ideas has been communicated to the central authorities by officials in various branches of the service, and I am. very glad to say that a spirit of healthy rivalry seems to have been aroused. We have received a number of suggestions with regard to locks and seals and other matters, and I believe that the present system will be attended with; satisfactory results. Mr Hallam, showed special aptitude, has been recommended ""for a substantial increase of salary, and for transfer to the professional division. Any officer who shows a keen interest in the affairs of the Department, and special ability, will receive every encouragement.",70
447,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," In connection with the proposed vote for the conveyance of inland mails, I should like to know whether the Minister has received any report with regard to the hours which maildrivers are required to work-?",70
448,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I have received a number of reports, which show that in the majority of cases where long hours had been worked by mail-coach drivers, the periods for which they were required to be on ""duty have been reduced. question of Providing, in contracts, for a maximum number of hours during which [ 49] J the men employed on coaches under contract with the Postmaster-General shall be required to drive, is receiving consideration, but difficulty has been experienced in applying one rule to the whole Commonwealth. The matter will receive further consideration when tenders are next invited.",70
449,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I should like to know the opinion of the Postmaster General with regard to the Pacific Cable. There is considerable loss on the working of that cable, and I quite agree with some of the remarks which were made on the subject last night by the honourable meminspec- ber for Parramatta. The three Governments which are concerned in this cable ought to be quite equal to devising some means to prevent this annual deficiency. I have always been opposed to the concessions granted to the Eastern Extension Company, and - I should like to reply to some remarks which I am informed the honourable member for Parramatta made last night in regard to the action of the Labour Party in this connection.",70
450,Mr WATSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,The Labour Party have objected all along to these concessions.,70
451,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"When the proposal to make these concessions came before the New South Wales Parliament, the Labour Party very strongly objected to it.",70
452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,How did the Labour Party object?,70
453,Mr WATSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,B y blocking the proposals who until the State Parliament was prorogued.,70
454,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"No one took a more active part in expressing those objections than Mr Griffith, the secretary of the State Labour Party, and a number of the members of that party, including myself, went as a deputation to Mr Crick, the Postmaster General, to further emphasize the position which had been taken in the State Parliament. The result was that the concessions were not granted by Mr Crick until January or February of 1901, when the State Parliament was not in session, and Federation had become an accomplished fact. When the State Parliament did meet in 1901, none of the members of the Labour Party, who are now members of this Parliament, were in the State Parliament.",70
455,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What did the The Labour Party in the New South Wales Parliament do when the State Parliament did meet?,70
456,Mr WATSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"Mr Crick was not then Postmaster-General, and the Commonwealth had been inaugurated.",71
457,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I was not a member of the State Parliament when it met in 1901. When the subject was brought up in the House of Representatives, there was no division on the motion, though there was a long discussion. The honourable member for Parramatta spoke strongly against the ratification of the agreement which had been entered into by New South Wales and Victoria, but the general tenor of the discussion showed that Parliament regarded its hands as tied by the action which had been taken by these States. Mr Kirwan, who was then member for Kalgoorlie, moved an amendment to postpone the ratification until after the Pacific Cable Conference, but, under the circumstances which I have indicated, the amendment was withdrawn. Any part I have taken has always been against any concessions to the Eastern Extension Company. Mr. JOSEPH .COOK - A harmless part, all the same. The Labour Party could never be got to ""bite.""",71
458,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I find that all the press messages from England come over the Eastern Extension Company's lines. It may be that this company are making concessions to the newspaper proprietors which the Pacific - Cable Board are not prepared to make-that the Eastern Extension Company are granting rebates, or in some other way are making less than the recognised charges. If that be so, it is the duty of the Postmaster - General to ascertain whether the Pacific Cable BoaTd cannot see their way to make similar charges. If , on the other hand, the Eastern Extension Company are charging exactly the ;;ame rates as would be charged by the Pacific Cable Board under similar circumstances, then the action of the newspaper proprietors does not appear to be very patriotic.",71
459,Mr WATSON,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The newspaper proprietors ""barracked"" for the Pacific Cable, in order to get the rates on the Eastern Extension Cable reduced, and that is the extent of their patriotism.",71
460,Mr TUDOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,What did honourable members expect?,71
461,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The Melbourne Age always advocates ""keeping the mdney in the country,"" and seeks to encourage local industries. But I remember that the honourable and learned member for East Sydney said on one occasion that that newspaper is free-trade in its commercial department, whilst protectionist in its leading articles. If the Eastern Extension Company's charges are the cheaper, then the newspapers are justified in using that line; but if that company is charging less than the recognised charges, the Postmaster-General ought to make some inquiry. As I pointed out a few days ago, the sum we lose on the Pacific Cable does not amount to quite so much as the subsidy previously paid to the Eastern Extension Company. At the same time, I should like to know whether the Postmaster-General intends to do anything in order to prevent this annual loss.",71
462,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," The question of the Pacific Cable has caused me a lot of trouble and worry, and it is certainly a very serious matter. The Government are endeavouring, as far as possible, to safeguard the rights and interests of the Commonwealth, and I am in accord with a good deal which fell from the honourable member for Parramatta last night. I realise, however, that we have a strong combination to fight, and I do not think I can reasonably be asked to disclose what the Government propose or hope to do.",71
463,Mr THOMAS,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Does the Postmaster General intend to do something?,71
464,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I certainly do. The whole matter has been before the Cabinet, and immediately some decision is come to which promises satisfactory results, I shall give the information to honourable members. Mr BROWN i(Canobolas) - I should like to know what the Postmaster-General intends to do in connection with the Orient mail contract. When the matter was being discussed,, the suggestion was made that if the' contract were ratified, steps should be taken at the earliest opportunity to give the Orient Steam Navigation Company notice of its termination, in order that a mail service might be secured on more favourable terms.",71
465,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I should like to inform the Committee that notice of the termination of the contract has been given, and tenders will be invited at the very earliest opportunity, that ample time may be given for competition, and that, if necessary, time may be allowed fnr tenderers to provide ships. I am giving the matter close attention, and will i<u=h it forward as much as I possibly can.. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 178 (Victoria), £620,402.",71
466,Mr TUDOR,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I direct attention to the item, "" Increments to salaries of £160 and over in the professional and clerical divisions, £ 6 0 0 . "" When compared with the amount set down for the other States, it appears to me that the amount set down for this purpose for Victoria is too small. I am given to understand that a number of anomalies will be created by reason of the fact that certain officers will receive increments, whilst others who are just as much entitled (0 them will not receive themv amount set down for this purpose for New South Wales is £1,000, and for Western Australia £450, although, according to the figures given to-night by the honourable member for Parramatta, the officers in that State do not number more than one-third of those in Victoria. For Tasmania, £350 is provided for this purpose; should like to know from the Postmaster General whether, in the event of the amount set down for Victoria proving to be insufficient, officers who will not receive increments out of the vote will have their position in the classification scheme affected? If that should be the case, we shall be undoing what we tried to build up in the classification scheme.",72
467,Mr HUME COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," As I understand the situation, it is as follows-: If , for example, there are twenty officers in any given Department of the Post Office in Melbourne, the amount of money provided on the Estimates for this^ purpose will not be sufficient to pay increments to more than half of those officers.",72
468,Mr DEAKIN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That is on the assumption that all are entitled to increments.,72
469,Mr HUME COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"The officers say that they are all entitled to them, and I understand that the Deputy Postmaster General is not in a position to discriminate between them.",72
470,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,That is in the General Post Office; but that does not apply to all.,72
471,Mr HUME COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"If the Minister will assure me that no injustice will be done to any of these men, I shall withdraw all that I am saying. I am assured that injustice will be done to some of them unless the Minister steps into [i49]- 2 prevent it. Assuming that twenty men are .entitled to increments, the sum provided will give increments only to ten. Though all are equally entitled to. promotion in this way, only half of the officers will be promoted, and if must be manifest that that will lead to all sorts of trouble and confusion for the Public Service Commissioner and the Department. I am told that in times past, with a desire to keep the estimates down as much as possible, officers at the head of branches have not asked the full amount required to pay all increments to the officers under them, and have trusted to get the additional amount required out of the Treasurer's advance account. The present Treasurer says The that he will not pay any increases of salaries out of the Treasurer's advance ac-. count;",72
472,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,Where did the right honourable gentleman say that?,72
473,Mr HUME COOK,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"I have it from the right honourable gentleman's own lips. If I the Department in Victoria, acting in the way I have stated, has asked for only £600, when £1,200 will be required, and the Treasurer will not pay the additional £600 out of his advance account, half of the officers will be denied the increments 'io which they are entitled, and an anomaly will be created which, as I have said, will lead to all sorts of confusion. The Minister should here and now make a statement to the effect that all officers who have the Public Service Commissioner's recommendation, and the approval of the head of their Department, will get the increments to which they are justly entitled, in spite of the fact that the full amount required for the purpose may not be provided for on these Estimates. If that statement is forthcoming all will be well, but if that statement cannot be made there is no doubt that anomalies will arise which it will be difficult to overcome.",72
474,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE," I shall endeavour to see that no such anomalies are created. I must, however, disabuse officers' minds of the idea that they are all entitled to increases. Increases are supposed to be granted to deserving officers, and of course consideration wil! have to be paid to all who are deserving. The matter is one which has given me a lot of trouble, but I shall look into it very' carefully to see that no anomalies are created, and that every -. Melbourne consideration is given to the representations which honourable members have made. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 179 (Queensland), £411,159; division 180 (South Australia), £255,281 > division 181 (Western Australia),£2S2i^6 division 182 (Tasmania), £115,605, agreed to. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. ORDER or BUSINESS. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",72
475,Mr KELLY,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE, Will the Prime Minister state what will be the order of Government business tomorrow?,73
476,Mr DEAKIN,FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE,"We shall ask the House to resume the consideration of the Estimates. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 12.10 a.m. (Thursday). [SENATE.] Cup,",73
