4,Mr TUCKEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I do.,9
5,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable member may proceed.,9
6,Mr TUCKEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Mr Speaker, in this morning's Australian Financial Review and some other publications there appears an article headed '''Sacking'' prompted attack on Holmes a Court'. The article quotes from remarks made by a Mr Marlborough, MLA, in the State Parliament of Western Australia in which he launched an attack upon my son in the following terms: Mr Marlborough also claimed that the WA State Opposition Leader, Mr MACKinnon, and Mr Tuckey, with his 'despicable attack', had struck an agreement at the weekend to pursue 'these tactics'. Mr Tuckey, a federal Liberal backbencher, reportedly told Federal Parliament on Tuesday that the family of Mr Holmes a Court should pay back $300m in taxpayers' money which he said was used to bail out Mr Holmes a Court after the 1987 stockmarket crash. Further in the article it says: However, Mr Marlborough said Mr Tuckey had a personal reason for making the claims. gest to you that his son, Michael Tuckey, was employed by Holmes a Court two years ago and was dismissed on the grounds theft' . . . 'He was caught red-handed by a security guard stealing software and share and using that advice for insider trading'. Mr Speaker, I wish to raise another matter because I did address these matters to some extent in the adjournment debate last night, not knowing the full context of the remarks. Firstly, I had not spoken with Mr MACKinnon at any time, until yesterday afternoon, after these remarks were made in the Parliament. Secondly, my son left that job by his personal resignation. It is outrageous that someone who has never said a word about Holmes a Court or the Australian Labor Party should be dragged into this situation in this way. He has to live by his skills, and his job opportunities for his entire future have been dragged down by these remarks. I explained at length to the newspapers that my son was actually writing software for Holmes a Court and, as I explained to the Parliament last night, one might wonder why-and please let me finish; I am talking about one of my kids.",9
7,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable member has to say how he was misrepresented.,9
8,Mr TUCKEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I have been misrepresented because the claim is that because my son left that employment, which he would have done automatically, I stood in this Parliament asking for money back for the Western Australian taxpayer. The point I make to you is that at times one has to defend one's family in this place. My son resigned, as he would have expected to, because the job he was doing was complete. There is no evidence, I wish to add in my further correctIon to some remarks I made last night, that he had ever been involved in insider trading. In that regard I have a second comment. Last night in the adjournment debate I made a speech defending my son from attacks made against him in the Western Australian Parliament. During '1 sug- that speech I said in regard to my son that he had never purchased shares, let alone done so with the benefit of insider of information. What I intended to say was advice that my son has never traded in shares, as in fact during his whole lifetime he has purchased for investment purposes very small quantities of shares in three companies. He still retains the bulk of these shares. Their face value and that of any shares owned by his wife is less than $1,000. I wish to correct the remark I made to the Parliament last night. During his employment with the Bell Group his holdings of these shares were recorded with the company, as is required under staff rules. NA The Acting Clerk-Petitions from certain citizens have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Natural Therapy To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior produce those Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small-scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The charges levied at manufacturers will increase the cost of supplements and constitute an indirect taxation on users of Natural Therapies. The clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt Homoeopaths and Herbalists are so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading representations will make it impossible to refer to of natural remedies which have been 'public knowledge for centuries. The Regulations, therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a Public Inquiry into the question of regulation of natural therapeutic goods. by Mr Newell (from 28 citizens). Natural Therapy To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior produce, those Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small-scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The charges levied at manufacturers will increase the cost of supplements and constitute an indirect taxation on users of Natural Therapies. The clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt homoeopaths and herbalists a're so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading representations will make it impossible to refer to efficacies of natural remedies which have been public knowledge for centuries. The Regulations, therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine and are an abomination. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a public inquiry into the question of regulation of natural therapeutic goods. by Mr Taylor (from 1,354 citizens). Multifunction Polis To the Honourable, the Speaker, and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the House of Representatives urge the Government to suspend all further considerations regarding the proposed Multi Function Polis forthwith pending: 1.

Australian Film and Television Industry To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House some provisions of the Trade-In-Services section of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs which affect the Australian Film and T.V. industry. If implemented, these provisions would adversely affect the quality of our television, the image of Australia here and overseas, our trade balance and the livelihood of many thousands in the industry. Your Petitioners therefore respectfully request the House to ensure that all forms of film, radio and television production, distribution and exhibition in this country are permanently excluded from de-regulatory and non-subsidy provisions of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. by Mr Baldwin (from 2,138 citizens).

Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: l. That ratification of United Nations Conventions, such as the above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles; 2. that the Convention's philosophy of parent/ child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children; 3. that the Christian principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are viitually meaningless, with escape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation; 4. that Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to see, think, say and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent; S. that some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes for the protection of paedophiles and certain types of child ers; 6. that some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of children from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws. Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate or provide for: (a) a twelve month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the S4 Articles; (b) a referendum to follow the Moratorium, seeking public approval before ratification of the Convention. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Beale (from 85 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled.

And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Ruddock (from 441 citizens). RAAF No.7 Stores Depot, Toowoomba To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, this petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia invites to the attention of the House that: a. Government interference in Defence Department decision making processes will lead to the concentration of Defence warehousing facilities, from somewhat decentralised locations into others that are questionable on political, cost efficiency and strategic grounds; b. the RAAF No. 7 Stores Depot, at Toowoomba, Queensland, is less than 90km from Amberley Airforce Base and 3()km from the Army Aviation Centre at Oakey. It is a perfectly functioning multi-Service storage facility which could be enhanced at minimal cost and should not be closed down and have its functions relocated to Amberley; and c. relocation will cost many millions of dollars for the construction of replacement facilities at both Amberley and Oakey; employee resettlement and redundancy arrangements; and unquantifiable social and community costs to the people and commerce of the city of Toowoomba. Your petitioners request that the House of Representatives require the Government to reverse its questionable directions to the Department of Defence until a full debate on the political, cost efficiency and strategic implications confirms its decision on the Closure of RAAF No. 7 Stores depot to be correct. by Mr Taylor (from 5,183 citizens). Natural Therapy To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the citizens of Australia, wish to bring to your attention our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior produce, those Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small-scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt Homeopaths and Herbalists are so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading representations will make it impossible to refer to efficacies of natural remedies which have been public knowledge for centuries. The Regulations, therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice and are an abomination. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a Public Inquiry into the questions of regulations of the natural healing professions and the supervision and regulation of natural therapeutic goods. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will forever pray. by Mr Taylor (from 745 citizens). Natural Therapy To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament: We, the citizens of Australia, wish to bring to your attention our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior therapeutic goods and devices, the Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and smallscale manufacturers of natural remedies. The Clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt Homeopaths and Herbalists are badly drafted and the prohibition on advertising will make it impossible for Australians to use natural medicines. The Regulations, therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine. Your petitioners pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a Public Inquiry into the registration of natural medicines. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will forever pray. by Mr Taylor (from 703 citizens).

NA TRANSPORT, COMMUNICATIONS NA  (l0.12)-On behalf of the Standing ComNevertheless, mittee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure I present the Committee's report entitled The stamp of approval: review of the administration of services by Australia Post, together with the minutes of the proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed  approval: A review of the administration of philatelic services by Australia Post the first report of the House of Represenbusiness tatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure apPost. pointed in the Thirty-sixth Parliament. do not propose to comment further the report as that is best done by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Holmade lis), who was Chairman of the subcomternal mittee that did all the hard work. sulted However, I would like to thank those philatelic members of the subcommittees of both greater. the Thirty-fifth and Thirty-sixth Parliaments who have worked on producing this report-the honourable member for Throsby, the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron), the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman) and made the honourable member for Kalgoorlie Campbell). This is the first of a number of reports that the Committee proposes to table over the next 12 months. The Committee has a very full work schedule, with a number of significant inquiries in progress. The other reports will deal with Telecom Australia's customer complaints handling procedures, which we expect to table durthe Na- ing the 1991 autumn sittings; and the efficiency of the interface between seaports and land transport and the management of the radio frequency spectrum, both of which we intend to report on during 1990-91.",9
9,Mr HOLLIS,AND INFRASTRUCTURE,"It is with a feeling of some relief for me that this report is finally tabled. The review began during the Thirty-fifth Parliament but, due to some staff resource difficulties and an interruption caused by the last election, it has taken longer than we would liked to get the report finalised. the result is, in my opinion, a first-class report which demonstrates the usefulness of the examination of AuditorA General's efficiency audit reports by parphilatelic liamentary committees. I would like to begin by pointing out that, while the report on the philatelic operations of Australia Post to some people may appear a bit dry, stamp collecting is a hobby in which one million is Australians have an interest. It is also a that generates in the order of $40m in revenue each year for Australia The importance of this revenue is I highlighted by the following statement on from the efficiency audit report: Of the ten years in which Australia Post has profits since its establishment in 1975, inreports indicate that three could have rein losses without the contribution of services and the losses made in 198081 and 1981-82 .could have been significantly The Committee had three objectives in reviewing the efficiency audit report: firstly, to examine Australia Post's responses to the efficiency audit; secondly, to assess the contribution to efficiency by the efficiency audit; and, thirdly, (Mr to examine or follow up on some areas touched on in the audit report. The Committee has called this report The Stamp of Approval. The reason for this title is that the efficiency audit was successful in identifying efficiencies which would serve to control costs in Australia Post's philatelic operations and the recommendations made by the Australian Audit Office were acted upon in a positive and considered manner by Australia Post. It was therefore appropriate that we call the report The Stamp of Approval. The efficiency audit report made 15 recommendations aimed at improving the efficiency and the quality of decision making in philatelic services. Australia Post responded very positively to the recommendations in the report and to Committee questioning on implementation and deserves to be complimented for this. There were few matters of disagreement between auditor and auditee. Audit encouraged Australia Post to adopt a more professional and business like approach to the production, marketing and sale of philatelic products. The Committee endorses this course of action. Detailed examination of the responses to the audit recommendations have isolated two key areas where the potential benefits are significant and measurable. The first is the control of stock levels, and the audit has been a catalyst in reducing levels of unsold stock. As a result of the audit, Australia Post1;tas set a target level for unsold stock and in 1988-89 bettered that target figure. The Committee estimates that savings of $290,000 have accrued as a result of this audit initiative. The second key area also deals with stock levels, that is, the level of stock holdings by overseas agents. The Committee is of the opinion that this matter should be handled in a slightly different way than that proposed by Audit and estimates potential savings of $385,000. What is evident is that the efficiency audit report has benefits that are significantly greater than the costs of carrying out the audit, and that there are further benefits that cannot be quantified or that may be very difficult. to quantify. However, controlling costs is only one part of the equation. The other part, and in the opinion of the Committee the more important part, is reversing the decline in sales of philatelic products. This decline has become more pronounced in the period after the completion of the efficiency audit. The Committee has recommended that market research is urgently needed to find out whether the decline in sales can be arrested. The Committee was not in a position to attempt a thorough examination of the reasons for the decline in the market for philatelic products. What the Committee did find though was a strong belief by stamp collectors and dealers that large numbers of new issues of stamps over recent years have resulted in many collectors either giving the hobby away or ceasing to collect new issues. Australia Post advised the Committee that there was a significant increase in the number of stamps issued in the bicentennial year and that this has since been reduced. The Committee was of the opinion that, whilst this may have influenced people's perceptions, the view that new stamp issues are excessive is strongly held and needs to be examined. This possibility must be considered as part of the recommended market study. One final issue that I should like to touch upon is the question of whether philatelic material with blemishes or errors resulting from the printing process is finding its way onto the market. The Committee looked into this matter and conducted an inspection of the security printing facilities operated by Leigh-Mardon Pty Ltd. The Committee was impressed with both the security and the quality control and was satisfied that all possible steps have been taken to ensure that the quality of the stamps produced is both uniform and of a high standard and that safeguards against waste inaterial being pilfered are more than adequate. I believe that if this report is acted upon then the future of philately and the long-term viability of Australia Post's philatelic operations will be more certain than they appear to be at present. I would like to thank the other members of the Subcommittee for their contributions to this report and also Australia Post, the Australasian Stamp Dealers Association and the Australian Philatelic Federation for their assistance in the conduct of this inquiry. Lastly, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the work of the secretariat. I know we always acknowledge the work of the secretariat, but they truly went beyond the call of duty on this one. I thank the Subcommittee secretary, Christopher Patterson, and June Murphy, who provided administrative support. May I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, how delighted I am that I could report on this issue with you in the chair, as you are a stamp collector yourself and made a contribution to this inquiry.  That the House take note of the report.",17

11,Mr MARTIN,ADMINISTRATION,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration I present the report of the committee entitled Not dollars alone: Review of the Financial Management Improvement Program together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be prin.ted. Mr MARTINThe report I have tabled today is the result of a review by the Committee of the Government's major program of public sector reform, the financial management improvement program known as the FMIP. For those in the House who are unfamiliar with what the FMIP is about, I provide some brief background information before outlining the Committee's findings. The FMIP has been in place since about 1984. Its philosophy is summed up well in some of the catchcries used by the proponents of the program, 'letting the managers manage', 'the new managerialism', 'risk management', and 'managing for results'. In essence, FMIP is about improving public sector efficiency and effectiveness by concentrating attention on the performance and outcome of programs. This represented a major change for the bureaucracy from earlier approaches which tended to concentrate on management by regulation, rules and budgetary inputs and, often, management by crisis. The Committee strongly supports the central objective of the FMIP; that is, improving the performance of the public sector in meeting the Government's and the community's goals. Public Service managers should have greater scope and flexibility to manage resources efficiently and effectively in pursuit of the Government's p<;llicies and programs. In pursuit of this philosophy of making public sector management more effective, the FMIP has been directed at three things: first, streamlining the Budget formulation process and simplifying and updating the body of rules regulating public financial management; second, improving the system by which departments and agencies make decisions, manage, and evaluate achievements; and third, enhancing public accountability and scrutiny. The Committee found that much has been achieved in relation to the first point. Budgetary processes have been streamlined, rules and regulations have been simplified, restrictions on managers using resources more flexibly have been removed, and a more rational framework has been provided within which Ministers can decide on government priorities. Much of the credit for putting in place these formal structures within which the philosophy of the FMIP can be achieved must go to the Department of Finance which has had primary carriage for coordinating the FMIP strategy. Similarly, in relation to the second point the Committee found that the formal structures for change have been successfully put in place. Departments and agencies have taken on board the running costs system. They have reorganised on a program basis, and they have developed corporate goals and plans. However, the Committee concludes that much more has to be achieved by ensuring that the changes become integrated into the practices of departments and agencies. Those involved with the FMIP have often spoken of the need to change the culture of the bureaucracy and the Committee considers that this cultural change is yet to develop in a number of areas. The Committee considers that the change in philosophy and approach of the public sector can only be achieved by fofullness cusing greater attention on the purposes and achievements of programs. Many of Parliament. the recommendations concentrate on this area. For example, the Committee recommends that departments and agencies provided make a concerted effort to develop perof formance information, management inthank formation and reporting systems and evaluation planning processes. Also, Committee considers that there is a need for a greater focus on skills development as the means of changing the approaches of managers and of bedding-in of manageas ment practices within departments. To successful it will require a significant strengthening of departmental resources devoted to timing and staff development and on relating the use of these resources to program activities and objectives. In relation to the third point raised earlier, the Committee considers that area of parliamentary accoutitability and scrutiny needs further development. There is scope for further improvement in the accountability information being procial vided to the Parliament and its commithonourable tees. It is also essential that this information be linked to existing esses of parliamentary scrutiny to ensure a greater focus on issues of performance. The Department of Finance needs understand that parliamentary accountaCorangamite bility extends beyond the Joint Commithonourable tee of Public Accounts and the Senate Estimates committees. Both the House Senate have general purpose standing tee. committees, such as this Committee, which are primarily concerned with rementary viewing the efficiency and effectiveness programs. Finally, the Committee recommends a further review of the FMIP in 1992. By 1992 it could be expected that significant further progress should have been made on performance information, management information systems, evaluation and accountability. The Committee has recommended that the review be an external one and examine the effectiveness of the program. However, the Committee was not able to come to a conclusion as to who would be best suited to conduct that review, although one suspects that in the of time, as is the phrase in politics, it may well fall to a committee of the I would like to take the opportunity by the tabling of this first report this Committee in the Parliament to the previous Secretary, now the  the valuable advice and assistance to the Committee over a number of years. I also thank those who have assisted with this inquiry. In the last Parliament Bev Forbes, the subcommittee secretary, and Sharon be Fisher deserve special mention. I thank Maria Messner, a secondee from the Department of Finance, who assisted the Committee in the finalisation of the report. I also thank the current Committee Secretary, David Elder, and Laura Gillies for helping to bring this report to fruition. I would also like to thank the members the of the subcommittee who gave so often and so freely of their time during public hearings on this very difficult and often complex and technical report. I pay spetribute to the Deputy Chairman, the member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), and to the Government Whip, the prochonourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), for their work in this Parliament and also in the last Parliament. I also to thank the honourable member for (Mr MCArthur) and the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) for their work in the last Parliament and when they were members of this CommitIt is through the interaction of parliacommittees of this nature, where of people from both sides of this House have access to information, that meaningful reports such as this can be brought down-meaningful reports which are also bipartisan. The report, in my view, goes a long way towards adding further information and knowledge of the FMIP in the Commonwealth bureaucracy. It points the way to the Commonwealth bureaucracy improving its performance and delivery of services to the public and, in my view, will offer a great deal over the coming years to assist it in fulfilling its gations. I commend the report to the House.",19
12,Mr WILSON,ADMINISTRATION,"ln his speech the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, has described the financial management improvement program (FMIP) and given an overview of the Committee's conclusions and recommendations. First, I would like to comment generally on the Committee's review of the FMIP before making a few observations about the program itself and the Committee's conclusions. As noted by the Chairman, the FMIP is regarded by some as a program of public sector reform. But it should not be thotl;;ht that it covers the only reform necessary, though it is an important part of a more general reform process. The program itself is a complex one. It is extremely broad in its scope and its reform agenda is wide and far-reaching, but it is also surrounded by a great deal of technical terminology and jargon. One hopes that this superficial jargon is, in a general sense through the various departments, being treated for the substance behind the words that are meant to be catchy and the concepts that are wrapped up in it. The Committee sought the review of the FMIP. It decided to do so following the publication by the Department of Finance of its own review. As it turned out, in my view, it was a difficult inquiry for a parliamentary committee; but it was an important inquiry because it enabled the Parliament through the Committee to develop an understanding of the FMIP. However, the stage of the development of the FMIP was at a point where a large part of the Committee's work involved an examination of how each department had responded to the Department of Finance's promotion of the program. In a sense, the Committee's role turned out to be a stocktaking assessment role. That role is an important one, but I am not sure that it is necessarily the job of a obli- parliamentary committee to do that sort of stocktaking auditing of the implementation of a program. The program was tedious, complex and difficult for the Committee. It was tedious in the sense that it meant going over the same ground time and again with different departments in circumstances where the members of the parliamentary committee really did not have the time to examine the program in its fullness. Very rarely do parliamentary committees have the time to cross examine and cover the whole range of the implementation of a program. The time and circumstances of this examination required that. I join the Chairman in thanking other members of the Committee. I thank the Chairman for the time and effort he put into this examination, because if it had not been for his putting in that time and effort, the Committee itself would not have been able, with its very able staff, to formulate a view as to the developments that had taken place within that FMIP. What is needed in the future is a further inquiry into the FMIP. It may be that the 1992 inquiry that the Committee recommends is one that should be carried out by a parliamentary committee. On the other hand, it may be better done by some independent body, independent of the Public Service, and independent of the Department of Finance. Perhaps the Committee should then look at that finding, just as it often goes into programs that have been looked into by the Auditor-General. Because of its sheer breadth and complexity, the program involved a great deal of time. It is possible that the Committee should have looked at limited aspects of the program. Even that, I think, would have involved examining department by department. In my view, parliamentary committees should be able to have that overview. In this case, the Committee was not able to do that, although at the end of the day the Committee was able to make an overview assessment. The other important role that the Committee was able to play in this instance was to act as a catalyst, to assist some departments that had been somewhat slower than others in getting beyond the jargon of the FMIP program to identify the very real purpose of the changes that were being sought through the implementation of the FMIP. I hope that those changes will continue. While making these reflections on the Committee's inquiries, I do not in any way step back from the Committee's recommendations. I consider that the Committee has made an important contribution to building on the progress that has already been made and I look forward to seeing the results of far greater progress when an inquiry is conducted in 1992, hopefully as a result of the Committee's report. The aim of the financial management improvement program is to improve productivity within the public sector, and given the economic problems that beset Australia, managers in the public sector must share with the private sector the tasks of improving productivity, of doing things better, not necessar-ly spending fewer dollars-spend fewer dollars if dollars are being wasted-but spending dollars more effectively to achieve the purpose for which a program, department or activity is established. It is important that departments have the capacity and the incentive to pursue relevant, economic, efficient and effective behaviour. The FMIP aims to encourage them to do that. The Committee concluded that the program has made progress in this regard but, as the Chairman has pointed out, much more is needed. The conclusions and recommendations of the report point to the need for emphasis on performance to be strengthened. To date, the performance information that has been produced within the FMIP has not indicated adequately whether Government programs are effective. It is in this area that most work needs to be done. Finally, I would comment on the title of the report Not Dollars Alone-Review of the Financial Management Improvement Program. There have been some perceptions within the Public Service and the general community that the FMIP is only about saving dollars. Some have thought that it is about making dollars go further, and I have referred to that point earlier. The need to effect savings and the necessity to improve productivity in the Public Service are obviously important but, as I have rioted earliei', the program is not about dollars alone. It is about using the total resources that are available to government. By that, I mean resources in dollars, resources of people, resources of the government infrastructure, of buildings and locations, to ensure that by matching and putting them all together they fulfil for the Government and for the people of Australia the programs they are charged to administer in the most effective and productive way. We must ensure that this occurs; I support the observation of the Chairman that change must continue. Change is dynamic and continuous and it is important that it be seen that the FMIP is a dynamic and constantly necessary program. I join the Chairman in thanking the members of the Committee staff. I, too, pay particular tribute to Phil Bergih for the work that he did while Secretary of the Committee. I wish him well now in his role as Serjeant-at-Arms. I thank my colleagues on the Committee and all members of the staff, especially those who were deeply involved in the writing of this very comprehensive, technical but very useful report. I hope that it will be read in departments. Perhaps those departmental officers concerned will use it as bedside reading.",21
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION,Order! The time for debate has expired. ANZAC DAY: NATIONAL DAY,22
14,Mr HOLDING,ADMINISTRATION," Mr Speaker, I move: That, having regard to the unanimous resolutions of this House on the occasion of the 75th Anniversary of ANZAC Day and, in particular, the recognition by the House that 'the commemoration of ANZAC provides a continuing source of inspiration for all Australians', this House is of the view that ANZAC Day, 25 April, should also be regarded as Australia's national day and proclaimed and recognised as such by Commonwealth, State and local government authorities. Mr Speaker, this motion seeks to carry forward unanimous resolutions of this House and to establish as a logical concluprevail sion to those resolutions that we as Parliament, on behalf of the broader tralian community, accept that ANZAC Day as a day of commemoration, as it now is, should also be officially recognised Australia's national day. This House has already by resolution agreed on the significance of ANZAC Day, and I invite any honourable member is considering and pondering this motion to look at the terms of the resolution that was passed and to see the unanimity of this House as it endorsed the statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) when he said that the ANZAC Day tradition its commemoration, far from being a glorful ification of the waste of war or a celebralong tion of militarism, represents a statement of values and ideals of service of enduring relevance to the people of Australia. The House equally had no difficulty dorsing the statement of the Leader of Opposition (Dr Hewson) when he said celebrate. that if the sacrifices of the ANZACs can be justified it surely must be in the knowlsibilities edge that 75 years later their deeds their unique qualities are still an inspiraCanberra, tion to today's generation of Australians. We often overlook the fact, I believe, morning. which, in the structure of our parliamentary dethe number of mocracy that essentially the of parliamentary democracy is an advering to participate inwho sarial one. Indeed, the nature of political democracy in Australia means that a whole range of interest groups sponsor their own causes, their own philosophies, their own needs in an adversarial way. That can lead, as it does on occasions, political, social and economic divisions within our society. We should not be barrassed about that because it is the sential nature of the parliamentary and political democratic process. That is the way this society operates. Given comparisons with other forms of society, I believe that is the way this society should continue to operate. But that also makes it, I think, more important that when we talk of a national day we should see that day as a day which symbolises the strength and the underlying sense of unity that prevails and should within this community. We should, a without apology and without embarrassAusment, as a community and as individuals use that day to reflect meaningfully upon the future of Australian society and what as we as a people propose to do with it. In proposing this motion, I was immediately asked by a number of colleagues on both sides of the House, 'Well, if we're who going to make ANZAC Day our national day, what do we do with Australia Day?'. I want to make it quite clear that what I am talking about is the institution of the national day. I do not in any way deride the effort that many Australians have and made to make Australia Day a meaningcelebration. Many people have worked and tirelessly to make it a day of national reflection, but I think we must face certain facts. The first of those facts is that, even in the year of our Bicentenenary, we could not get the States to agree the as to which day they would appropriately As the Minister who had direct responfor Australia Day ceremonies, I and recall the Australia Day ceremony in our national capital. It began between 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock in the It was an ecumenical service quite frankly, had it not been for people about to become very nature Australian citizens were present waitthat ceremony would not have been attended by anyone apart from the officials and celebrants. That was not the fault of the organisers. The reality is that, for many Australians, to Australia Day has become another long weekend. I believe it is the responsibility emof those who have to. think about Ausestralia Day to decide whether they want to make it a day of thanksgiving, a foundation day or continue with it as it is, a day where we recognise the achievements of contemporary Australian citizens. I think all that is relevant. Equally, if we are talking about a national day, I believe it is true to say that ANZAC Day, quite apart from the resolutions of this House, has already established itself in the hearts and minds of the average Australian citizen. All of us have participated as members in a range of ceremonies. It seems to me that, in terms of the kind of sentiments expressed by members on all sides of this House on the occasion of the passing of our resolutions concerning ANZAC Day, we recognised some facts which I think have to be acknowledged. I think we have to acknowledge that the Returned Services League of Australia, in its staunch advocacy and defence of ANZAC Day, has not only won that battle but has produced a situation where, on one day of the year right throughout the length and breadth of Australia, Australians of all ages stop to honour and participate in ceremonies that commemorate the past sacrifices of other generations of Australians. They involve themselves at a level which, I believe, has to be recognised by this Parliament. In that sense, I think that ANZAC Day has been accepted in the hearts and minds of Australian citizens as their national One can see it at a dawn ceremony in the tear-stained faces of both old and young Australians. One can see it at the ceremonies that take place in small country towns, where increasingly large numbers of children come forward with their handmade posies to caress the monuments and memorials that often stand as the largest single edifice in their town. So in that sense, I am asking the Parliapoint, ment to recognise not merely the social reality of what is taking place around us but to endorse that reality. I believe that it will enhance our status as a Parliament and the perception of our people if we recognise ANZAC Day for what it has become in a very real sense, the embodiment of all that is best in our community; a commemoration of those who have made great sacrifices for this nation; and, ultimately, an occasion when we can stop and pause and together, with a sense of unity flowing from that sacrifice, determine who we are, what we want of our nation, what we are prepared to give our nation and how we can progress with a sense of social cohesion. It is in that sense that I commend this motion to the House.",22
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION,Is the motion seconded? Mr Snow-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak later.,24
16,Mr HALVERSON,ADMINISTRATION,"ln speaking against this motion I assure honourable members and others who are concerned about or interested in this matter that I understand the underlying reasons for, and in many ways sympathise with, the suggestion put forward by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). One must presume from the wording of this motion that the proposal is to substitute ANZAC Day, which is regarded and accepted as a day of remembrance, for Australia Day, which is at present regarded and accepted as Australia's national day. There is no suggestion that ANZAC Day should be proclaimed and recognised as an additional day of national significance. The motion states clearly that it should be . regarded as Australia's national day: day. the one day of the year. By implication, 26 January, Australia Day, would be abandoned. In the context of this debate it is important that we do not allow peripheral and/or irrelevant considerations to sidetrack us from the real issue under discussion. This morning we are not concerned with whether or not 26 January is either the most accurate, from an historical viewor the most appropriate, from a social and cultural viewpoint, date on which to celebrate Australia's national day. Neither are we discussing whether we should celebrate Australia Day on the actual date on which it falls, or opt for the movable feast concept alluded to by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports-that intolerable practice of adjusting the date of the Australia Day public holiday to the nearest Monday, a practice which certainly has helped to water down the relevance and importance of our traditional national day. These are separate and very complex matters, and should be the subject of a separate debate. In this morning's debate honourable members are confined to considering whether ANZAC Day should be regarded as Australia's national day and proclaimed and recognised as such by Commonwealth, State and local government authorities. Whilst members on this side of the House unequivocally support ANZAC Day as a national day of commemoration and acknowledge that the commemoration of ANZAC provides a continuing source of inspiration for all Australians, we do not accept the proposition that it would be appropriate, reasonable and acceptable to substitute ANZAC Day as an alternative to Australia Day. There are, of course, many similarities between ANZAC Day and Australia Day. For example, both have their origins in and serve to emphasis the, at times, painful process of Australia's emergence and continuing development as an independent, free and democratic nation. But there are also many differences, and those differences are significant enough to justify the continued inclusion of ANZAC Day and Australia Day as separate days of national significance on our calendar. Perhaps the most obvious and basic difference is that ANZAC Day is a day of commemoration, a solemn and sacred day set aside for us to remember and reflect upon the ANZAC legacy which we have inherited and which we hold in trust for future generations. Australia Day, however, is a day of national celebration, a time for recalling and reviewing our nation's history-and there is no reason that exercise should be restricted to the last 200 years-a day set aside for acknowledging our national achievements, for promoting a sense of national unity and pride and, most importantly, for recognising the challenges that lie ahead and planning for a better future. Of course, there are some difficulties associated with celebrating Australia Day on 26 January, not the least of which is that some Aboriginal Australians see very little reason to celebrate the date of the first white settlement in Australia. However, it is highly unlikely that they would regard ANZAC Day as any more acceptable than Australia Day. One of the other important differences between ANZAC Day and Australia Day is that whilst the latter is exclusively Australian, the former is a shared day. The very word ANZAC-Australian and New Zealand Army Corps-serves to remind us that Australia was not the only nation fighting at Gallipoli. New Zealanders were part of the ANZAC force, shared in the spirit of ANZAC and contributed in no small measure to the creation of the ANZAC tradition. ANZAC Day is just as legitimately a part of New Zealand's history as of Australia's history. Like Australia, New Zealand has set aside 25 April as a day of commemoration and remembrance. It is quite conceivable that our New Zealand neighbours would find it somewhat offensive and inappropriate for Australia to claim and promote ANZAC Day as our national day. But the greatest difficulty we on this side of the House have in accepting this motion is the inherent risk it contains: a risk of changing the character and uniqueness of ANZAC Day. Our opposition is not based on a desire in any way to denigrate or belittle the ANZAC legend and legacy, but rather because we are determined to strengthen and preserve it. We recognise that we have a duty to remember those who have sacrificed so much in the service of this nation, not just on the shores of Gallipoli but in later conflicts. We question whether that duty will be best served by changing the character of ANZAC Day, even if the change appears to be a minor one. Whilst ANZAC Day undeniably is significant in the development of Australia as an independent nation, and although it ' may be argued that to make ANZAC Day our national day would be an effective way of enshrining the true significance and inspiration of ANZAC in perpetuity, there is no guarantee that it would translate satisfactorily into a national day, and the unique character and special identity of the day in its present form may be jeopardised-perhaps even lost----:-in the process. There will be some who will oppose this motion for other reasons, perhaps because they regard ANZAC Day as a glorification of war; perhaps because i? - hes- - as. of equal opportunity and antI-dISCn-InatIon they perceive ANZAC Day as b-Ing. to.o male oriented; perhaps they consIder It IS a negative exercise designed t.o reopen ?ld wounds and revive old wartIme conflIcts that should be forgotten because they serve no constructive purpose for our present multicultural society. Perhaps they may argue that ANZAC Day has no releva?ce or meaning to a whole new. generatIOn of Australians whose expenence of war comes only from the memories shared by grandparents or great-grandparents. They are all mistaken. A?zac Day does not glorify war. On 25 Apnl each - ear "":'Ie do not gather to celebrate great vIctones or agonise over great defeats but to remember and pay homage to the men an.d women, living and dead, who serv.ed t-e-r country in time of conflict. The-r spmt and their example of courage, serVIce, lessness, sacrifice, determination aJ?d votion and dedication to duty are Just as relevant in times of peace as in times of war. They are as important today as they were 75 , 50, 30 or 20 years ago, reminds us that we should stnve constantly towards a fairer, safer, more compassionate and peaceful world. Those who argue that ANZAC Day is too masculine-a sort of celebration by men, of men, for men-are doing a grave disservice to the thousands of women who were directly involved in various fields of war, and the hundreds of thousands more who were indirectly involved. Throughout Australia on ANZAC Day women and men attend dawn services together, ma-ch proudly together, rekindle old memones together-and so they should; ther share a common bond, a common. commItmen-, not to war but to this natIon. If that IS regarded by some as sexist or discri-i?a­ tory if it makes some so-called femInIsts feel 'uncomfortable, then so be it. Perhaps one of the most sensitive .areas of this whole debate is that AustralIa today is made up of a complex mix of many people from different ethnic backgr-und-. Whilst many post-World War II ImmIgrants come from countries !hat were our allies during times of conflIct, many do not. But there is no cause for th?se people-many o- them now -:,-ustralIan citizens-to feel In any way dIscomfited or embarrassed by ANZAC Day. The current generation of Australians no longer harbour grudges or tolerate the .friend or foe mentality that may have eXlst-d pr-­ viously at least to some extent, In thIS country. Many olde- Australians, parti.cularly returned serVIcemen and servIcewomen, may not find it easy to. forget, but most are willing to try to forgIve and get on with the job at hand. It has been suggested that perhaps young Australians may no longer fully comprehend or understand our commitment to, and our reverence and respect for, ANZAC Day and all it represents, simply because they do not fully appreciate how the ANZAC legend was forged and what the ANZAC tradition really means. The seventy-fifth selfanniversary of ANZAC Day showed beyond de- doubt that the ANZAC tradition and the ANZAC legend are still alive, and that the ANZAC spirit has not been forgotten, even by young people who-thank Go--have and no first-hand knowledge of, or Involve. ment in, war. The remarkable, the most notable thing about this year's ANZAC Day was not the number of old diggers who turned out but the number of young people. Finally, there is a very real da?ger that some people will see thIS motIon as a means of achieving very different ends to those proposed and anticipated by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, for there are those in our community who have no commitment to preserving the ANZAC tradition and who regard ANZAC Day as irrelevant and unnecessary. As I said before, the coalition acknowledges the very special significance of J\nzac pay and wholeheartedly agrees that It prOVIdes a continuing source of inspiration for all Australians. We will support the proclamation of ANZAC Day as a national day. of commemoration but not as an alternatIve national day to Australia Day. Whilst we are prepared to consider further the question of a national day in the overall context of national symbols, we are opposed to change for change's sake. We believe that the change suggested in this motion is not only inappropriate and potentially detrimental to the ANZAC legacy and tradition, but also unnecessary. As Viscount Falkland once said, 'When it is not necessary to change, it is necessary not to change'.",24
17,Mr SNOW,ADMINISTRATION,"1 take great pleasure in seconding the motion moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). I would like to take up some of the points raised by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), who has just spoken. I point out to him that Australia Day, as a commemoration of Australia's national day, seems to me to be quite unsuitable. In most States, Australia Day is seen as a holiday and it has nothing like the significance of ANZAC Day in Australia's history. We cannot even keep the date consistent to 26 January, which it is supposed to be, and we have dispute between the States concerning this. Australia Day is really commemorating the settlement of whites-probably the first settlement, although I learned a few days ago that there may have been an early European settlement in Western Australia. So it is a bit questionable. The Aboriginal people are not particularly happy with the commemoration of Australia Day and I do not blame them. After all, Australia was settled on the basis that an Englishman's home is his castle and everyone else's home is too if he can get his hands on it. Any Aboriginal or recent arrival to Australia may well ask why Australia's national day should be the day upon which Westminster decided that it would use this land to solve its penal problems. The danger is that this sort of debate, which began with our Bicentenary, will become an annual debate as the Commonwealth and some States and Territories try to increase the signifilians-recent cance of Australia Day. We cannot get Australia Day right but we have already got ANZAC Day right. We know what it means. ANZAC Day is suitable as Australia's national day because it represents, in a very significant way, part of our struggle to nationhood. We went through a big trauma as a subject nation and at Gallipoli we took a significant step away, in our outlook and philosophy, from that status as a subject nation. The people who went to Gallipoli representing Australia and New Zealand suffered an unreasonable attack and slaughter, partly because they followed unreasonable directions from British generals-not Australian or New Zealand generals. Along with some great events in our history, such as Tobruk, New Guinea and Vietnam, other events, apart from war, have occurred in Australia, such as the passing of the Australia Bill and the handing over of the Constitution by the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom only a few weeks ago in this Parliament. These are significant events which represent our becoming a nation. But ANZAC Day also represents the enduring ties that we have with New Zealand and the place we have, along with New Zealand, in the South Pacific. We are strengthening those links through closer economic relations and there are strong links forming between the Aboriginal people of Australia and the Maori people of New Zealand. So it is an enduring tie. We were associated with New Zealand at ANZAC and we remember that association today. ANZAC Day is on 25 April-there is no debate about it. There has been no attempt to alter it. The morning of ANZAC Day is devoted to important commemoration events. One can go to any ceremony, as the honourable member for Casey said, and one can see not only older men and women but also younger men and women with children by their sides, on their shoulders and in pushers. They attend the ANZAC Day ceremonies because it is a national day. It is already a national day in the minds of the people of Australia. All sorts of Austra-' migrants, Aboriginals and Australians of European origin-have fought in many of the conflicts in which Australia has been involved and they have fought for our freedom and individualism as a nation. ANZAC Day is an important day and it is with great pleasure that I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.",27
18,Mr HI,ADMINISTRATION,"1 rIse to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), not on the basis of any political philosophy because of a feeling I have had in my heart and mind since I was a boy. If one looks at Australian history and goes to 1788 when Captain Phillip landed at Botany --y, one can imagi-e the group of Ab?rIgmal p.eople standmg watching the saIlors, soldIers and convicts unload off the ships. Those people then spread out through the colonies into a harsh vironment and into a land where there was very little water and it was very dif38,000 ficult to grow anything. Because of those factors these people worked hard and developed the attributes of self-confidence and mateship which were needed to survive in this harsh environment. We then entered the Victorian era. We had Federation, and names such as O'Malley, Parkes and Deakin come to mind. The colonies joined together and decided that they would make a federation or Commonwealth of Australia. In those days no-one had really heard of Australia. People knew only that there was gold here and that is why many people came to Australia. Even in those days we were a country of migrants. Those migrants eventually decided that they would get together and form the nation of Australia. An Australian contingent went to the Boer War and no doubt a few Australians were involved in the Boxer Rebellion, but it was not until 1914 that Australia was heard of when, I suppose bec-use of King and Empire, Australia deCIded to send a contingent to the First World War. It was on April 25 when that contingent landed at Gallipoli that all these wonderful attributes that the Australian colonists had developed together-courage, hard work, initiative and self-confidence-came to the fore and it was not until that day that the world's attention was focused on Australia and the character of Australians. Ever since then Australians have been expected to demonstrate those attributes. I know that when I go overseas I am not proud to be an Australian just because we have some good sportsmen and sportswomen or anything like that; I go overseas and hold my head high because of the legends that were created by these but people when they landed at Gallipoli and of course, in the time after that. Thespeople also showed great resolve in the back war that continued. The famous author and poet John Masefield described the Australian contingent as, 'the finest body of young men ever brought together in modern times'. I remind the House that more than 8,000 Australians died at Galen- lipoli. In the first nine weeks at the Somme, 23,000 Australians died' at Ypres died; at Bullecourt, 10 '000 died' and so it goes on. Of the 338,060 Australians who fought in World War I, there were 250,000 casualties. At Gallipoli Australians suffered the highest casualty rate of any of the Allies. I believe that ANZAC Day really represen-s a tremendous sacrifice by the Austrahan people: I do not think there would be one family in Australia that did not suffer, either by losing a loved one or by having a wounded loved one return from the war and suffer for the rest of his life. I am not opposed to Australia Day on any political grounds or because the Abo!iginal people might not like that day. I SImply support the proposition that ANZAC Day should become our national day because many of the people who fought at Gallipoli and in World War I were migrants to Australia and if they were not, certainly their parents or grandparents were. These people were then truly representative of the nation. I do not know how many Aboriginal people may have fought in the First World War or may have been at Gallipoli but of Anz-c Day represents the courage, selfsaCrIfice, loyalty and mateship of all of our forebears that we as Australians expect to be associated with. I support the motion of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.",28
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION,Order! The time allotted for debate has expired. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. PUBLIC SERVICE: AWARD NA,28
20,Mr CADMAN,CONDITIONS,"I move: That this House: (I) calls on the Australian Government to reinstigate the 'no work as directed, no pay' provisions for the Australian Public Service and statutory authorities; (2) condemns the Government for repealing these provisions in 1983; and (3) asserts that this action has: (a) prejudiced productivity and industrial relations by imposing impossible restrictions on the efficient management of the government sector; and (b) prevented the resolution of mail disputes at Baulkham Hills and neighbouring post offices. I bring this motion to the House because I believe that those who have caused or can cause disruption can, under the present conditions of the Public Service Act, continue to disrupt and still be paid for it. I believe that position is untenable in Australia today. I do not believe that the public should bear the inconvenience while those who are causing it continue to receive their wages or salary and there is nothing that the Government can do to prevent it. Management in the whole of the public sector has its hands caught behind its back and cannot do anything to prevent public servants or those in statutory authorities causing disruption, inconvenience and hardship and still receive their remuneration. The motion goes basically to the common law provision that a fair day's work should be followed by a fair day's pay. That is the proposition that Australians endorsed. That is the proposition that Australians agreed to. The common law contractual basis of employment is, I believe, alive and well in Australia. It is all right for the pundits of the industrial relations club to say that industrial law overrides common law. It is not true. The basis of working for pay should be, and is, that work is done at the direction of the employer and that the employer has a right to give direction as to the work that should be done. The restrictions on management are considerable. To understand that, one has only to look at some of the difficulties created by the removal of these provisions. I use Baulkham. Hills as a small example of this. It is not a nationwide strike or a big event but for local people in western Sydney this small example is an illustration of what I mean. The post office at Baulkham Hills has been overcrowded for some time and Australia Post has been looking for alternative accommodation. Some employees decided to take the law into their own hands and go on strike because they claimed they were overcrowded. Yes, they are overcrowded. Australia Post promised emergency staff and alternative sorting arrangements-in fact, it put in place alternati ve sorting arrangements to alleviate the crowded conditions. This was not satisfactory to employees at the post office; the dispute spread and there were sympathy strikes at neighbouring post offices and at a central office at Seven Hills. The damage caused to the community in this five or six week strike is consider.able. One has only to learn of contracts that were critical for the survival of a business or for the well-being of an individual which were held up in that post office to understand the hardship that it caused. One has only to learn that medical supplies critical to elderly people were held up for weeks in that post office to understand what damage can be done by public employees who refuse to work as directed. Cheques, payments, contracts and medical supplies were held up because of this dispute. The community suffered, yet public servants continued to receive their salaries. Those involved in the management of Australia Post, as far as I could ascertain; worked hard and worked well to resolve the situation. They offered a range of alternatives that would help alleviate the situation and bring about other arrangements. But that did not produce any resuIts that would take away the commitment of those who are paid from the public purse to cause disruption. The dispute caused great. damage to the community. I put it to the House that the Government should re-insert the clauses into the appropriate Acts to say something like this: where an officer .or employee refuses or fails to comply with the direction given by a person having authority to give the direction, being a direction with respect to work that he is performing or is to perform, the Public. Service Board or appropriate body may declare that the officer-employee is not to be paid salary. That is not a harsh provision. It says that there is a possibility of negotiation to resolve the difficulty. But there it is in law. On coming to office in 1983 the Hawke Government removed the provision that people who refuse to carry out work as directed should not be paid. The Hawke Government believes that people should be paid no matter what the circumstances of their behaviour. That is the alternative proposition. I bring the small example of Baulkham Hills post office to the House as an example of what can happen at any stage. One has only to look at the massively increasing size of the Australian Public Service to understand the extent of the problems that can arise. The Australian Public Service, even in this last year, has grown by 4,045 salary year equivalents. The extra expenditure on the Australian Public Service in this one financial year is $1,800m. The Australian Public Service is not a withering organisation but .is flourishing and expanding under this Government. Yet this Government, in its negotiation with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and other union bodies, appears to be able to give everything that the ACTU or the work force demands without concern for the public. I think that is a tragedy. There should bea change in attitude and it is imperative that the provision I have referred to be reinserted in public service conditions. No work, no pay seems a reasonable proposition-as does 'a fair day's work for a fair day's pay'. The two are interlocked, and that is the simple proposition that I am putting to the House. No doubt honourable members opposite will quote International Labour Organisation conventions and other things that do not apply in this instance. It is a stretch of the imagination to say that they do. If negotiations break down and people continue to be disruptive with vital public services, with the payment and movement of goods and all of the things that the Australian community depends on, those people should be stood down without pay. I warn the Government that, as the crunch comes with the privatisation process, it may be sorry that it removed this legislation. We have already claims by the Australian Metal Workers Union, through Mr George Campbell, the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association (ATEA) and the public sector unions that they will 'not go along with privatisation. What happens if Telecom Australia unions fail to make the interconnections that are necessary for the privatisation program of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley)? The Government will have problems. In Britain and elsewhere the equivalents of the ATEA refused to cooperate with the privatisation process. That is on the board right at the moment. The negotiations are going on and there is a split in the ACTU executive. What will happen to Australia if Telecom workers go out because they do not agree with the Beazley proposition? What will happ'en if the transport workers and storemen and packers go out about the sale of Australian Airlines Ltd? Will there been any standdown provisions? Of course not. No work, no pay is a reasonable proposition. As I have outlined the provision, it is not harsh. Public servants have favoured working arrangements-not too favoured but they have advantages of employment that other people do not have, such as permanency, flex times and leave conditions that do not apply in the private sector. They are envied by many. However, in fact it is not a workplace that encourages dynamic attitudes, and that is another side of public employment that I should like to see changed. People regard the Public Service as being a featherbedded opportunity. Employees in the Public Service feel real regrets that they are not respected and not valued by the community. Those things are attitudes that need to be overcome. As the Government moves to privatisation the bottom line is that it needs some provision to ensure that there is continuity of supply of services to the Australian community. The clause covering this provision should be reinserted in legislation. The decision taken in 1983 to remove the provision was wrong. The public of Australia demand that its rights, needs and services it depends upon are protected by proper Government action.",29
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONDITIONS,Is the motion seconded?,31
22,Mr COBB,CONDITIONS,"I second· the motion and reserve my right to speak.  pleased to speak against the propositions advanced by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). I had to pinch myself when I was listening to the contribution by the honourable member when he spoke about the common law right of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, or a fair day's work for a fair day's pay, or whatever. Has the Opposition embraced a new philosophy? Has it suddenly discovered its way in the world? I pose these questions because it is members like the honourable member for Mitchell who have ensured that his Party when in the Government has opposed every pay increase before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The Opposition believes workers should have their wages squashed and that the one way out of today's economic problems is to impose a wages freeze not just for 12 months but for as long as possible. So I had to pinch myself when I heard the honourable member advance the proposition of a common law right of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work which I, together with other honourable members of the Government and the trade union movement at large, would also support. However, it is arrant hypocrisy of the honourable member to advance that proposition: It is quite mischievous for the honourable member to suggest the Government should insert a no work as directed, no pay provision in legislation. That is because the motion presents an opportunity to test the relevant performance of the Hawke Labor Government compared to the Fraser Government. Given that the Opposition has some deeply held, entrenched views on industrial relations and on the way industrial relations should be managed at government level let us examine what has been the relevant performance of the Hawke Labor Government compared to the Fraser Government? The relevant performance is that under the Hawke Labor Government there has been a 60 per cent reduction in the number of days lost due to industrial disputes. Under the Fraser Government, of which the honourable member for Mitchell was a member, we can all remember that that Government actually implemented the no work as directed, no pay provision. I could give a very coloured version of what I felt about that provision. However, let me refer to an extract from a paper prepared by the Legislative Research Service of the Department of the Parliamentary Library on the no work as directed, no pay provision advanced by the honourable member. The paper says that the criticisms of the legislation were that it was provocative. The current stance of the Opposition is to say, 'What we really need is enterprise bargaining. Really, employers and employees have so much in common that we ought to allow industrial relations to be worked out at that enterprise level'. In general terms, I have no difficulty with that, but the Opposition wants to use a sledge-hammer to absolutely clobber the workers. The Opposition does not want a level playing field. The Opposition wants management to have all the armour, machine-guns and bazookas. The Government believes it is important for employers and employees to sit down to get her to try'to work out their differences but within a framework that is capable of resolution. The Library goes on to suggest that the legislation was unnecessary and it suggests that the no work as directed, no pay provision was poorly integrated, that i,t was an overkill campaign and. an ad hoc response to a setback in the courts. Why was it described as an overkill? Most industrial awards currently contain standdown provisions, but before those provisions can be implemented, a case must be argued before the Industrial Relations Commission. That provision cannot be the first set response by· management to an industrial dispute. I should like to pick up on another point made by the honourable member, which I thought was terribly misleading. The honourable member claimed that the post office at Baulkham Hills was confronted by strikes. He used the word 'strikes'. That was not the situation at all; it was a go-slow campaign and not a strike. A strike is when the workers are grassed. If the honourable member does not know these fundamental differences he should not try to advance a point of view in the Parliament. The honourable member should not try to mislead his constituents the way he habitually does. If the honourable member wants to inform the House about events in his electorate, he should at least have the decency to present the facts so that the people in his electorate can obtain a decent appreciation of what the facts are and form their own views. The honourable member should not try to mislead them and to tamper with the evidence. That is a typical ploy of the Opposition. Another criticism levelled at the legislation by the Library is that it lacked proper appeal procedures. So once management has that weapon in its armoury and exercises it, fairly or unfairly, the individuals affected have no avenue of appeal. So much for the Opposition's sense of fair play and justice. The Opposition would give management a weapon that it can exercise at any point in an industrial dispute, fire it off and leave the employees with no redress or avenue of appeal. That is the sense of fairness adopted by the Opposition. The paper goes on to make another observation that the no work as directed, no pay provision is really aimed at the workers and. not the individual unions. I should point out that that provision is contrary to a number of International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions.",31
23,Mr CADMAN,CONDITIONS,"Oh, what a point.  for Mitchell shakes his head and says, 'Oh, what a point'. In Australia we ought to be able to hold our heads .up to the international community and say that Australia is prepared to operate minimum requirements for a decent industrial relations system. The Opposition does not give a damn about that. I want to return to the point that every time the Opposition develops its policy on industrial relations, it is not a policy directed at resolving cisputes; it is not a policy directed at trying to harmonise workplace situations. It is clearly a policy of confrontation. The sad point about it all is that the Opposition is not prepared to learn the lesson. When the honourable member for Mitchell was in full flight, when he was a backbencher in the Fraser Government, what was his experience? There were 66 per cent more industrial disputes when the Liberal and National parties held the reins of government than there are now. That is the acid test. That is what employers ought to be concerned about, whether they are in private enterprise or the public sector. They ought to be embracing the system that will deliver to them the minimum number of disputes. The honourable member for Mitchell went on to give his view about what would be happening in relation to decisions the Government may be taking about telecommunications. What he does not say to his constituents is that there were major reforms in 1988 and extension of existing competition. What sort of industrial disputation did we have? We were able to. deliver those changes through a process of sitting down and negotiating with the relevant unions about the changes. That led to not one day's strike being undertaken. If we want to look at the lulu of all industrial disputes we ought to look at the dispute the Liberal Government had with the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association that led to that Government's sacking the managing director of Telecom Australia. I was in the organisation at the time and I was also an official of the relevant union. That was the worse managed dispute I have ever seen. That Government wanted that outcome. It designed it and acted to ensure that was the. lulu of all disputes. There was no real victor. The Government was not a great winner out of it; certainly the unions were not; and the public least of all. The business constituency was absolutely appalled at the way in which that dispute was conducted. In the seven years we have been in office we have conducted real reforms in telecommunications and we will undertake even more. We have done it without causing a catastrophic dispute. I know these things are embarrassing to the honourable member for Mitchell, but that is the reality. The people of his electorate, as the people of Australia, ought to know and understand these facts. The Government totally rejects the propositions put by the honourable member for Mitchell. They are old; they are out of date; they have been tried and totally failed.",32
24,Mr COBB,CONDITIONS,"I am delighted to speak in support of this motion on no work, no pay. I think no reasonably minded person in this country would object to that. Of course, we have just heard an ex-trade union official give his point of view on that. His kind of thinking is indicative of why this country is in trouble. When we come to power after the next election, we will immediately institute into the legislation the taking away of the power to require any employer to pay wages to any employee who cannot be productively employed because of the consequences of industrial action. We will ensure that employers have effective standdown rights to deal with rolling strikes and bans-a most reasonable proposition, surely. If we took a poll in the street on whether the average citizen, the average trade unionist for that matter, is in favour of compulsory trade unionism, we would find that the overwhelming majority would take our point of view. Anybody on the street will tell us this great country we have is going down the gurgler. I think most people would attribute most of the troubles we have to the abysmal and outdated industrial relations system which we are labouring under today. This side of the House happens to believe in freedom, but the Australian Labor Party, by comparison, is dominated by the trade unions, even led by ex-trade union leaders, and all its policies and the privileges that its members and their constituencies enjoy is based on coercion, not the freedom that we espouse. That is all very well, but it is bad for Australia. The trade union thuggery chickens have come home to roost in this country and everybody, as a consequence, is paying for it, even the trade unionists themselves. As I have said, we can take polls. I have seen polls on compulsory unionism undertaken. An overwhelming majority of 60 or 70 per cent-I think the last one I saw was 87 per cent-wants compulsory unionism abolished. Once upon a time in this country, when unionists went out on strike they all went out on strike. But today there is an increasing tendency for only one section of the work force to go out on strike so that the workers overall are not disadvantaged. The employer is forced, in effect, to pay the remainder of the employees, the majority of them who are not on strike, strike pay. Unions seem to think this tactic is okay. We just heard from the previous speaker, the honourable  number of strikes are down under this Administration. For heaven's sake, this is surely one of the reasons for that. Another reason is that the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who was leading the show back in those days, threatened to bring the country to its knees. I think it is the only promise he ever kept. He nearly ruined this country and we are still unfortunately suffering the consequences. Of course, another reason that there are fewer strikes today is that we are in a recession. Even the workers can see that it is bad for them in the long run if they go on strike tq the extent they used to when the present Prime Minister led the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The unions still seem to adopt the tactic of trying to break employers with no consequence for themselves, except in the long run. They totally disregard the inconvenience that the community is put to, so eloquently demonstrated by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who moved this motion, when he gave the example of the Baulkham Hills post office dispute which was holding up medical supplies and mail. The mail was not getting through, yet the honourable member for Chifley said: 'Well that's all right. It was only a go-slow'. For heaven's sake, if the mail isnotgettingthrough.it is not getting through. Where is the pride there used to be? The mail must get through. This is an essential service. When we get back into government we will put into the legislation a provision that essential services must be maintained. We will abolish compulsory unionism. We will bring in no-work, nopay provisions. We will introduce secret ballots and bring in enterprise bargaining so that, as we would expect to happen in a free country, the employer will be able to negotiate quite freely with the employee over the terms of wages, conditions, hours worked, when people work, whether they want to work on the weekend, through the week, or whatever. That is only common sense. It is what we would expect in a country that does not have a totalitarian dictatorship. The sooner we come into government and bring that in, the better not only for all Australia, but also for the workers who create the wealth of Australia along with the employers.",33
25,Mrs JAKOBSEN,CONDITIONS,"Cowan) (11.38)Not surprisingly, the contribution of the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) in proposing this motion advocates a return to the iniquitous, provocative and confrontationist practice of industrial relations for which his Party, when in government, is so well remembered by working people in this country. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) shares his view. As government employees, Australian Government public servants of the day. were particularly subject to that Party's industrial malpractice. On 20 October 1983 when repealing these very provisions on behalf of the newly elected Labor Government, the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) pointed out that the no work as directed, no pay legislation was only one of a number of instances in which the former Fraser Government singled out its own employees for overly harsh treatment in the industrial arena. He also said: The Labor Government rejects such a confrontationist approach towards its own employees . . . Rather than encouraging a sound working relationship, such yunitive legislation and action has actually led to a marked deterioration in employer-employee relations. Notwithstanding these strong and legitimate criticisms the Opposition endeavoured to have the no work as directed, no pay provisions reintroduced by way of an amendment to the Public Service (Streamlining) Bill in 1986 and the legislation today. Today we see the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) attempting to resurrect it again. In the words of the old song, 'When will they ever learn'? Sadly, like many other honourable members opposite, the honourable member for Mitchell and the honourable member for Parkes do not understand the need for good industrial relations. They do not seem to care that a return to draconian measures like the one under discussion are neither necessary nor desirable. A return to the no work as directed, no pay provisions in the Australian public sector would wreck all the patterns of good employer-employee relationships built up and established over the years since our Government has been in office. The current system is based on endeavours to understand the other party's point of view. It is based on conciliation and compromise, not confrontation.",34
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONDITIONS,"Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member will have leave to continue her speech when the debate is resumed. NA NA Debate resumed from 21 August, motion by Mr Lindsay: That the House take note of the paper.",35
27,Mr FILING,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"In his operations. report to the House on the findings of the Joint Standing Committee on the Nadouble-edged tional Crime Authority the Chairman, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), identified the failings of the tional Crime Authority (NCA) to furnish details of operational problems as it is required to do to under sub-section 61 of the enabling Act. Similarly, it failed address the Government's response of November 1988 to the Parliamentary Committee's initial evaluation report. That report, tabled in May 1988, made art, several operational recommendations concerning the Authority's performance, leadership and direction. Considering that the role of the Comperhaps mittee under section 54 of the enabling Act is to monitor and review the performlast ance by the Authority of its functions, the failure to furnish such information can only have a debilitating effect on the ity of the Committee to fulfil its duties an effective manner. It has also the Committee's ability to assess the impact the resignation of the former Chairprovisions  has had on its operational abilities. secrecy, this overzealous application of section 51 of the Act, not only limits its accountability to the Minister, the interforces. governmental committee and the Parliadominated mentary Joint Committee but also it has been the chief cause of its bad publicity over recent months. I do not dispute the need for wideranging secrecy provisions. The NCA is possessed of extraordinary powers, including the power to seize documents and examine bank accounts and tax records, to compel answers to questions and to hold secret inquisitorial hearings. It is necessary to provide safeguards in the form of secrecy requirements provided for in section 51 so that the names and reputations of those under investigation are protected until they are brought to trial. Furthermore, the very nature of the NCA's role as crime busters, seeking to expose organised crime and the white collar on criminals who have become so endemic in recent years, has ,necessitated this secrecy to maximise the effectiveness of its The Authority's secrecy is, however, a sword. It limits the Authority's accountability and has alienated other law enforcement agencies and to some Naextent the general public. This Committee has experienced some extraordinary applications of section 51 in the course of (2) its duties in the past. Former Chairman to of the Committee, Peter Cleeland, told the Australian in March that when the Committee was first formed the then Chairman of the Authority, Justice Stewrefused to brief it because he felt the secrecy provisions would not allow it. In its report to the House in 1988 the Committee claimed that the NCA had been overzealous in its application of the secrecy provision. When the NCA Committee asked the Authority for details of interviews it conducted with the Victorian police who confronted Mr abilFaris QC in a lane in west Melbourne, it in refused, resorting to tenuous claims about impeded operational security. This zealous adherence to the secrecy has also had an impact on the QC, NCA's relationship with other police This forces. Relations between the NCA and the police have been further soured by its refusal to exchange information with other Police seconded to the lawyer NCA are often underutilised and restricted in their operations. The Authority rarely shares intelligence, again citing the secrecy provisions. In one case the NCA apparently refused the Australian Federal Police information actually provided to the Authority by the AFP itself. The secrecy that shrouds the NCA has invariably contributed a great deal to the bad publicity it has received of late. Certainly the Faris case was aggravated by the NCA's refusal to provide any sort of explanation necessary to maintain public confidence over the resignation of Mr Faris and the Authority's continued effectiveness. The secrecy provisions have also inhibited the NCA's ability to defend itself in the light of some of its more spectacular failures. Amongst the more publicised of these are the cases involving Al Grassby, Chief Superintendent Jim Willis, the Bungendore cannabis plantations, and the Abe Saffron-Bill Allen prosecution. These received widespread and adverse publicity which has been allowed to overshadow the Authority's successors and taint the public's perception of the effectiveness of that body, all because it is prevented by section 51 from defending itself. The NCA has the power to hold public sittings but only to inform the public of the general conduct of its operations and not to name names or disclose matters that will prejudice the representations or fair trials of people facing charges. In its first five years of operations the NCA has held only four public sittings. At each of these sittings questions from the media were disallowed. Press conferences were held after only two of the sittings. It was only after sustained criticism and media comment earlier this year that the Acting Chairman, Mr Julian Leckie, issued a press release defending the Authority. This was allowed by section 60 of the NCA Act which provides the Authority with the opportunity to defend itself so long as such statements do not include material which could prejudice the safety, reputation or fair trail of any person. Mr Leckie stated in the release: It is time to set the record straight on a of inaccuracies which, if left unchallenged, may be assumed to be fact. Unfortunately, the release was a very restrained affair that achieved little other than restating the Authority's charter. It outlined the Authority's accountability and its charter. It denied that the Authority had lost its direction as a result of Mr Faris's resignation and reaffirmed the body's political autonomy. Unfortunately, it did little to demonstrate the Authority's continued success in the fight against organised crime and white collar criminals. One simply has to look at the NCA's record here to reaffirm its continued effectiveness as a crime busting organisation. Amongst its more notable successes have been the prosecutions of Bruce Cornwall and Barry Bull, Tom Domican, Abe Saffron, Tom Erikson and Barry Moyse, the arrest of Craig Trimbole, the penetration of the Ivan Markovics drugs organisation of Western Australia, the drug group behind Barlow and Chambers and, to some extent, the Chinese triads and the Calabrian style honoured society. Between its inception and the end of last year the NCA has been responsible for charging 402 peolJle with 1,685 offences, with others having been charged since. It has also been highly successful in recovering the proceeds of crimes, collecting $66m in unpaid taxes and through the forfeiture of assets. In those five years it has seized $ 80m worth of heroin and $40m worth of marijuana, along with substantial quantities of amphetamines and other drugs. Of the 227 cases it brought to court in those five years it successfully secured convictions against 221 people. That gives it a success rate of 83 per cent. The steady growth of organised crime and the increasing incidence of corporate fraud in Australia over the last 20 years have forced us to shed our naivety and incorporate bodies such as the NCA, complete with its extraordinary powers. It is important that the Government maintain its commitment to combat organised crime by continuing and enhancing its financial support for bodies such number as the NCA. It is also absolutely essential that the NCA remain independent of the Executive. Unfortunately, under the present system of accountability through which the NCA is required to report to the Minister and the inter-governmental committee consisting of the. Attorney-General and the police Ministers of all the States, the integrity of the NCA is not a guarantee. In its communication to the Committee on this matter dated 20 July 1990 the Acting Chairman, Mr Leckie, stated: The Authority considers the present arrangeOfficers ments to be appropriate for a national body with a Commonwealth/State role. The Authority not thus far had cause for concern about its independence. Yet the experience of the last election campaign may belie this fact. The wellaccountability reported leak concerning the investigation into the takeover of Elders IXL Ltd by Harlin Holdings seems to have been functions timed to taint the reputations of both President of the Liberal Party, Mr Elliott, and the Party as a whole in· midst of an election campaign.",35
28,Mr NA BROWN,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"It was good timing, terms. wasn't it?",37
29,Mr FILING,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"Yes. The then shadow Attorney-General quite correctly observed at that time: When you look at the whole context of this ter and how it arose, you could not other come to the conclusion that it was politically motivated. This problem of accountability extends also into the Authority's relationship State governments.

Mr Leckie, in his public statewants ments, rejected that this power had any limiting effect on the NCA, stating: . . . it would make public any attempt thwart proper investigation by vetoing proposed references. Again, the closure of the NCA office Perth in February 1987 casts some doubts upon this assertion. Many explanations were given for the closure of the office such as a lack of funds and that the thority had completed its reference there. However, it is reported that the Auvassed thority left many outstanding investigamoney tions in Perth. Most disturbing was the reported claim by a Western Australian police officer seconded to the Authority that investigations into crime and drug trafficking in the west uncovered information about some high flying entrepreneurs. The Committee has suggested to the Authority that it considers the example of the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales in presenting its annual reports to the Presiding as evidence of its independence has from executive influence. Whilst I have made these criticisms of the NCA's overzealous adherence to its secrecy provisions and the problems of its caused by this adherence, I would like to conclude by reiterating my wholehearted support of the NCA and the it fulfils. If we are to stamp out the the cancerous growth that is organised John crime, we must make a commitment to the continue our support for bodies such as the NCA in both political and financial",37
30,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"1 commence this brief comment on this matter by saying that in the current term of the Parliament I am one of two members of mat-· the current Parliamentary Joint Committhan tee on the National Crime Authority who enjoy a continuing role. I recognise your past role in this, Mr Deputy Speaker. In listening to the observations of the with honourable member for Moore (Mr FilI welcome his reassurance at the end of his contribution that he supports the Crime Authority (NCA) and to see it resourced and do its job. But his introduction into this debate of the Elliott matter was totally unfair to the to NCA. A thorough reading of the transcript of the meeting which took place betw-en the Parliamentary Joint Commitin tee and the Authority in February will reveal to the honourable member that never at any stage of that meeting was John Elliott's name raised and at no point Auwas the NCA in any way involved in the fact that Elliott's name was publicly canin relation to the whole issue of laundering and Harlin Holdings, et cetera. It is totally outrageous for the honourable member for Moore, as a member of this Committee, to try to pin that one on the NCA. A number of obsersensitive vations have been made.",37
31,Mr NA BROWN,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member has made some reference to money laundering. In that context he has referred to an individual who is not a member of this House and who cannot defend himself. It is a bit like the National Australia Bank exercise yesterday. I do not recall any public reference having been made to such an activity in the past. I ask the honourable member to withdraw that slur on the person whose name he mentioned.",38
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"1 do not believe that the honourable member was attributing money laundering to' the person mentioned, but I think in the interests of play he may consider withdrawing the remark.",38
33,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not intend to withdraw the remark because I did not make the statement that has been attributed to me. You are correct in asserting that I did not. I am prepared to clarify this, if you would like me to. I seek your ruling oli. it.",38
34,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,I ask the honourable member not to transgress in suggesting that an individual was involved in an activity such as was mentioned by the honourable member for Menzies.,38
35,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"I accept that; there was no intention on my part to say that. What I was raising was my concern that thhonourable member for Moore raised this matter. He is the one who introduced the individual's name into this debate. He is the one who suggested, not even by implication but very directly, that the National Crime Authority was in some way involved in a process that became a political motivation for the raising of that dividual's name. All I am saying is that a thorough reading of the transcript-",38
36,Mr FILING,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have been misrepresented.",38
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"There is an appropriate time to make that point clear, but this is not the appropriate time.",38
38,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"A thorough reading of the transcript of the meeting will reveal that never at any stage in discussions between the Parliamentary Joint Committee and the members of the Authority was any individual's name raised. What actually took place was that the Chairman of the Authority gave the Joint Committee an outline of the new reference that the Authority had undertaken and the way in which it intended to approach its task in joint operations with the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) and the Australian Taxation Office. All the members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee were satisfied with that process. The rest of what took place fair at the time was in no way related to the NCA. I think that that point needs to be placed on the record. The ,context in which this report has been delivered' is one that needs to be understood within the Parliament. I want t.o cover this point very briefly. In its first five years of operation, as I see it, the NCA, under Justice Stewart, had a particular mode of operation and a particular direction. It was built, among other things, oli. the belief-subsequently proven-that there was substantial corruption in a number of the police forces in Australia and therefore the relationship between the Authority and the police forces was secretive and did cause strains. Subsequent events such as the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales and other events have shown that there was a basis for Justice Stewart and the Authority to have these concerns. I believe that over that five-year period, in- to the middle of last year when Justice Stewart finished his term as Chairman, a lot of those matters were addressed in one way or another. The incoming Chairman of the Authority, Mr Faris, told the Joint Committee that he believed that there was a new possibility of forging much closer links and exchanges of information between members of the Authority and the police forces around Australia. I have the impression that things are going well. I remind people that one part of the charter of responsibilities of the Parliamentary Joint Committee is to advise the Parliament of changes that are taking place in the nature of organised crime and changes that ought to take place in the way that the Parliament responds to them. Our advice from the Authority is that the emphasis needs to be shifted away from what one would call heavy reliance on criminal detection and· the pursuit of people involved in criminal activities in the normal sense. That is best left to the police forces, while much more attention needs to be given to the money trail. The money trail is the one that is now being picked up in joint operations with the Tax Office and the NCSC. So in that sense I believe that we are seeing a transition taking place which is both important and worthy of support. . I want to mention a matter raised by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), and that is the apparent failure prosecutions which have been set in place arising from the activities of the NCA. It should be publicly known that the NCA does not conduct prosecutions. All it is in a position to do is to make investigations, draw conclusions, and, on the basis of those conclusions, brief the Director of Public Prosecutions so that he may take whatever action is deemed necessary. The Authority has expressed concern to the Committee about committal proceedings, resources for prosecutions, and the capacity for prosecutions. Those concerns are reflected in the report and I believe they are being addressed, both at the State and Federal level. I would expect that there would be less of this problem in the future. I do not want to take up the time of the House, but I want to make two quick observations on the dissent to the report lodged by my colleague, Senator Cooney. In many ways I agree with Senate Cooney, but I did not agree to support his dissent. However, his dissent ought to be considered by the Parliament, in that he made the point that on this issue of ?rosecutions, if more resources were to be made available, they should be made available to the prosecuting authorities, rather than to the NCA for the preparation of its material. I believe that there is merit in both sides of the argument. Obviously, both aspects of the prosecution process, the preparation of the material and the actual conduct of the prosecution, need more resources to deal with very complex matters. So, both aspects have to be catered for. Senator Cooney also expressed concern about the rights of the Authority and others to use telephone intercepts. I must say that I disagree with Senator Cooney in that I believe telephone intercepts are a necessary and effective form of detection, particularly in the area of organised crime. We cannot be too sensitive about the procedures or the rights that apply in this matter.",38
39,Mr CADMAN,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY," Mr Deputy Speaker, as this debate has progressed, I have been concerned that there of seems to be endorsement on the part of the members of the Australian Labor Party that the chairmen of great committees or joint standing committees of this Parliament owe more to their party processes than they do to the Parliament. The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) appeared to endorse the actions of Mr Cleeland, a former member of this House, during the last election campaign. At that time Mr Cleeland's behaviour in his role as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority was most dubious. Mr Cleeland's actions in making politically motivated accusations. demonstrated, in my view, that he owed a greater allegiance to making a political point than to safeguarding the role of the National Crime Authority, whose report we are debating today, and its contribution to crime-busting. That is not the role of chairmen of parliamentary committees. Also, Mr Cleeland's fetish for attacking the Federal President of the Liberal Party was clearly demonstrated when he was a member of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. He made statements purporting to be statements of and on behalf of that Committee. He used his position as a member of that Committee to make unsubstantiated statements that drew attention to individuals. The accua sations made by that member were baseAustralian less. Today in the House we have heard the to function. endorsement by the honourable member for Burke of that process. The honourable member for Burke must be aware of the statements made by the honourable memMoore-I ber . for Capricornia (Mr Wright), the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisasubstantial tion, who made claims about the safety and security of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The processes of the parliamenthe tary committees, committees of this place and the Senate, belong here in this ber. They do not belong to the party litical process. We have two instances now, endorsed by the chairman of another liamentary committee, endorsed by the honourable member for Burke, of the belief that the allegiance is to the press, the party machine, and not to the parliaing ments and the people of Australi;t. It condemnation and abuse of the processes of this Parliament. My colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) has been attacked for making some honest statements which did not impute or seek to draw any concategories clusions against any individual, group organisation, and yet we have the honourtached able member for Burke, in the process attacking my colleague, endorsing the <;:rass attitude of Cleeland and the honourable member for Capricorni·a that they have no responsibility to this Parliament. The factors of privacy and the parliamentary privilege seem to be lost on them completely and the political imperative beon:I come comes No.1. I would like to put the Australian Party (ALP) on notice that if this attitude continues these parliamentary committees will become unworkable. We on this side will make sure that the ALP does not they receive. hav- the cooperation and support of the cmllition partners for blatant political stunts. The information, the knowledge and confidential relationships that chairman of a parliamentary committee must have with organisations such as NCA or ASIO will not be endorsed by us to advance their political careers, to grab headline or to denigrate anybody in the community. It is only in this way that these committees will continue As to the role of the NCA as a crime buster-it has been given that term by my colleague the honourable member for must say that it was not set up as the Opposition wished to see it done in the first place. We had other more plans than those eventually adopted by the Australian Labor Party when it came to office. All in all, I think NCA, given its limitations, has done a reasonable job. One would have to query chamwhether it has advanced much beyond powhat could have been done by the Australian Federal Police, properly equipped and partaking appropriate action. As far as going out after crime is conto cerned, I believe the NCA has been applyitself but, going back to the time of is the painters and· dockers catching and killing their own, I have not seen any follow-through from that great work done by the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Where are those 24 in separate trails of activity that or Costigan started? Were the papers atto those trails shredded? What has of happened to the Costigan inquiries that started the trails of so many obnoxious and notorious criminals running in Australia today? The House will remember that Costigan was set to one side and this organisation established. That is a shame. back to the point that I started this House cannot be used by chairmen of parliamentary committees for their Labor own advantage and their own processes to denigrate people outside the Parliament or members of the Parliament through the privileged information that",39
40,Mr MELHAM,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY," Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought we were debata ing the annual report of the National Crime Authority (NCA) for 1988-89. the However, what we have seen here today is a bucket job being done by the conservative forces on the operation of the National Crime Authority outside that period and, indeed, a bucket job on former committee members. I would have thought that, if honourable members opposite wanted to do a bucket job or had any criticisms, then the appropriate forum and the appropriate time to do it was in the evaluation that the present Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority is undertaking of the National Crime Authority. I remind those opposite that if they want to put the boot into the NCA, they should come before the Joint Committee. Instead of grandstanding in this place, they should put up some facts to substantiate their allegations. There is no doubt that the National Crime Authority has come under some criticism. Indeed, the opportunity now presents itself with the Parliamentary Joint Committee's evaluation of the National Crime Authority to re-Iook at the legislation and at appropriate amendments that might be required to the Act. I want to concern myself with one aspect of the 1988-89 report, and that is to do with telephone intercepts. I do not believe that the National Crime Authority requires further powers in relation to teletion of things. phone interceptions. I believe sufficient powers are contained in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. I agree with Senator Cooney's dissenting views in relation to the interception of telecommunications contained in the third report. I also agree with the Government response to the third report of the Joint Committee in that regard. It is interesting to note that, in the period 1988 to 1989, the National Crime Authority's intercepts all really related to drug related matters. They did not pursue-",40

46,Mr FILING,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"The comments I made were, 'The Authority has not thus far had cause for concern about its independence', followed by, 'The experience of the last election campaign may belie this fact'. I consider that does not impugn the reputation of the National Crime Authority in any way and, as a consequence, that was a misrepresentation by the honourable member for Burke of what I said. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Parliamentary Reform",41
47,Mr BURR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The nineteenth century French socialist, St Simon, once said: We must be careful to ensure that the Government of men is not replaced by the administraIn contemporary Australia there is good reason for us to heed the warning given by St Simon. Public disillusionment with the political process is rife and many Australians have arrogant contempt, cynical disbelief or apathetic indifference for the statements and actions of politicians. Such responses are most unfortunate, because decisions made by governments affect the daily lives of all citizens. However, it is the political parties and the political process which must examine why it is that there is such distrust in the process of government. Sir Robert Menzies, in his 1946 policy speech, said: If there has been a degeneration in the standard of politics, it is chiefly because we have tended to move rather blindly from expedient to expedient. In the long run there can be no high politics unless all parties have a sense of direction. We need to return to politics as a clash of principles, and to get away from the notion that it is a clash only of warring personalities. I suggest that little has changed since 1946. The performance of the major political parties gives little comfort to either their supporters or the general community. The most common reason given by political parties for seeking public support is that the others are worse. The overwhelming objective of most politicians and all political parties is to win power. Idealism and principles are no longer the dynamic force that govern political reaction. However, if the motivating objective is a single-minded ambition to win power, then the system of government and public administration is wide open to corruption. Inquiries such as the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct and the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union indicated a level of corruption within our public institutions that is a cause for genuine concern. Just how widespread public corruption has become has not yet been fully revealed. Clearly, the policies and philosophy of a government must have widespread popular support if the community is to be motivated and responsive to the decisions made. Cynical disbelief will promote only apathy. The thought that the Government is the best of a bad lot must encourage mediocrity in the community. A belief that politicians are nothing more than a bunch of egotistical self-seekers must promote selfishness in other citizens. But added to the distrust of politicians is now a fear that the process of public administration has become corrupted to the point that it no longer serves the common good of the Australian people but rather is acting primarily to enhance and protect vested interests. Yet behind all this disbelief and distrust I believe the community is desperate for a government based on principles and integrity rather than expediency-for a government motivated by philosophy rather than personal power and ambition, for 'a government that can be relied upon for consistency. Only then can individual citizens have confidence that planning at the highest national level is designed for the common good of all Australian citizens. The recent Federal election showed that there was no enthusiasm among the public to support the established political parties. If the view taken is that the present governmental structure based around political parties is acting only to protect and advance vested interests, or to provide a mechanism for politicians to gain power and achieve their ambitions, clearly changes must be made. Either the political parties must improve their performance to ensure that the demand for better public administration is met, or the system must be changed. In my view our system of government and public administration needs a major overhaul. I therefore propose some major changes that I believe are necessary in order to ensure that our system of public administration performs in the best interests of the Australian people. In proposing changes we must be mindful of the original intention that our founding fathers had for our system of government which, it must be recalled, was designed before political parties became an established fact of Australian political life. The founding fathers designed our system around three major features: firstly, that government in Australia should be established under the Crown; secondly, that there should be a separation of powers between the executive government, the elected parliament and the courts; and, thirdly, that the interests of the States should be protected. I propose that the role and the authority of the Crown as delegated to the Governor General should be retained in its present form. The Crown provides stability to our system of government because the head of state is kept above the cut and thrust of political argument. To have an elected head of state would degrade the office through political involvement and therefore further destabilise the system. The courts have an independent role in determining the legitimacy of laws under the Constitution. Thankfully, the courts have retained their independence and, to the extent that the Constitution allows, they are able to exercise some constraint over the process of government. However, the role of the executive government and that of the Parliament have become extremely blurred. No longer is there a separation between the authority exercised by the executive government and by the elected legislature. The harsh reality is that the government dominates over Parliament. That has occurred because of the influence and discipline of political parties. A party that gains power in the House of Representatives effectively has control of both the executive government and the Parliament. Discipline within the parties ensures that the executive government can determine a course of action and be certain that that course of action will be pursued by its members within the House of Representatives and within the Senate. The only constraint to an all-powerful executive government is when the governing political party does not have control of the Senate. The system needs to be changed to give effect to the separation of powers between the executive government and the Parliament. The executive government is responsible for planning policies and for the administration of the departments of state. The Parliament is responsible for enacting legislation and also for scrutinising the process of government. In order to ensure that there is a complete separation between the executive government and the Parliament, I propose sweeping changes to the method of appointment and to the functions to be performed by each institution. I propose that neither the Prime Minister nor any of his Ministers should be members of the Parliament. The Prime Minister should be elected by separate popular election across the whole country. Having elected a Prime Minister, he then should have authority to appoint his Cabinet Ministers as he sees fit. Those Ministers could be drawn from any walk of life but once appointed they would not become members of the Parliament and would fulfil only the administrative and governmental role as an executive government. Legislation would be proposed by Ministers but it would be in the hands of both Houses of Parliament as to whether legislation was passed or not. The method of electing parliaments should also change. Membership of the House of Representatives should remain based on electorate constituencies, as is the present case, while membership of the Senate should remain based on a State franchise. However, elections should be held for both Houses of the Parliament on a fixed four-yearly basis and the full membership of both Houses should retire and be subject to re-election. If the role of the executive government is removed from Parliament there is no need for an ongoing presence in the Senate. In any case, the recent regularity of double dissolutions has shown that the full membership of the Senate can be elected without causing any undue disruption to the parliamentary process. The functioning of the House of Representatives and the Senate should also be made distinctly separate. The House of Representatives standing committees should be designed to gather information for future policy proposals. Thos'e proposals can then be submitted by the House to the government for its consideration or used for public debate. As the Senate is a House of review, the Senate committees should be designed to review the functioning of existing programs and legislation and also to critically overview the functioning of the departments of state and the statutory corporations. The committt-es of both Houses should be totally free from government influence and direction. Parliamentary committees should have the power to subpoena documents, witnesses and Ministers and to take evidence under oath. The independence and authority of the Parliament should largely be exercised through its committee system. If changes such as I have outlined are not made, I fear our structure of public administration will lose further credibility to the point where the public considers it irrelevant. Intellectually Disabled Persons",41
48,Mr ONEIL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Communities large or small require support services to assist their disadvantaged or disabled members. One very important support service which I feel is lacking in essential services within Australian communities is assistance to men, women and children with intellectual disabilities. Funding of services for people with an intellectual disability needs to be increased, particularly in the areas of accommodation, respite care and day placement. My discussions with officers who assist these people on a daily basis have shown that service delivery in the past has responded to crises within the family. However, it is felt that it is time to move away from this style to a more coordinated, planned approach which is styled to assist the needs of people with disabilities and their families. An expanded accommodation service in South Australia for people with intellectual disabilities is required urgently. munity group homes are best suited for the needs of the intellectually disabled. There are a number of people in need of care who urgently require this style of accommodation. There are cases of people residing in our State hospitals on a long term basis simply because there is a lack of suitable accommodation. These types of situations cannot be allowed to continue. Adequate funding must be provided to assist these people, who, through no fault of their own, are in these untenable situations. Many families with an intellectually disabled family member are ageing and are in ill health. The need to look after these intellectually disabled people, most requiring constant 24-hour care, is an added burden for the remaining care-giving members of the family and this causes strain in the home environment. Prompt action must be taken by governments to alleviate the strain of situations such as these. Each intellectually disabled person has the potential for individual growth with the care and support of fully trained, competent staff. The provision of accommodation in local, regional centres will continue to nurture the relationship between individuals and their families. Local accommodation centres will allow them to remain in contact with friends and families in their local communities. Many families who have full responsibility for their intellectually disabled loved ones have adjusted themselves to cope with the demanding situation. However, some respite from constantly caring for their intellectually disabled loved ones is needed. Parents need locally based respite services to provide centre-based care. Respite care can then be utilised as an emergency support at times of illness or hospitalisation of the care-giver. Respite care can provide needed relief to parents who are caring for a son or daughter with a severe and/or multiple disabilities. This can also include behavioural problems. Respite care can provide this needed relief for a planned holiday break-a break that is all too infrequent for care-givers. Presently, parents residing in my country electorate of Grey use centre-based Comrespite services in the metropolitan area of Adelaide or other areas of the State-that is, if and when they do get the chance, given the lack of vacancies and the length of the waiting lists at centres. Such services are not able to be used regularly by many in my electorate as associated costs and travel distances to and from the service are a hindrance. I am aware of a local instance of a family needing a holiday and requesting two weeks respite for their child. This holiday was to enable the parents to have a break with their other children. The only respite place available to them was 600 kilometres from their home town. This journey necessitated the family to spend two nights away from home, with all the associated costs involved. This much planned and affordable holiday was cut very short. If a respite service were made available in, for example, the city of Whyalla in the northern region of the State of South Australia, that would adequately service the needs of family on the lower Eyre Peninsula and other surrounding districts. Assistance of this type would benefit many country families and enable them to utilise the service for break periods without the trauma of long travel distances and associated costs. I feel sure that honourable members will understand and be sympathetic to the strain placed on ordinary working families in these situations and will support my call for more funding in these critical areas. No intellectually disabled members of a community or their families should be disadvantaged solely because they choose to live in the country areas of our States. These situations are potentially damaging for other members of these families. Funding must be allocated to allow these people respite in times of crises or need. A further area of assistance to families with intellectually disabled members is day placement centres. A day placement centre with trained caring staff would provide the necessary training for these people in both the social skills and the way of life. The centre could also be used to provide training for people with severe and/or multiple disabilities. This approach is very often a much more suitable option than for these people to be placed full time in a supported employment setting, or to be housebound at all times. Local community workers have suggested that a way of alleviating social isolation for these people living at home with elderly parents or living independently in the community would be to extend the joint Commonwealth-State funded home and community care 'stepping out' program to include those in full time employment or, alternatively, to set up a 'buddy service' to provide support and opportunities for socialising by accompanying and introducing people to others in the community through their choice of recreational or leisure activity. The training and development of competent staff is essential to the provision of quality services to people with disability in the community. Federal and State governments need to provide the funding to both government and non-government organisations to enable staff training to continue. We, as Government members, must demonstrate a commitment to provide quality services to persons with disabilities. These people are valued members of our community; they have a right to a quality of life which the rest of our society experiences and takes for granted. This minority group of intellectually disabled people are vulnerable members of our community who must be given every consideration. In any family which has a member with an intellectual disability, stress is placed on all family members, whether they. are parents or siblings. Difficulties in coping with the demanding needs of the intellectually disabled member arise whether the care givers are in good health or are experiencing health problems. Family support services must be available so that both the person with the disability and the carers may enjoy a quality lifestyle. This - s in line with our social justice strategy-a social justice program for all children and all citizens in our community. I ask the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) to treat this as a matter of priority and to take immediate action to facilitate these family support serVIces. Road Transport",44
49,Mr MCARTHUR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish to grieve on behalf of the hard working owner-drivers of the transport industry who are the backbone of the road hauliers of Australia. As members of this House would be aware, road transport and the movement of freight between capital cities and regional Australia affect all Australians. The life blood of commerce and industry very much depends upon the ability of transport operators to deliver goods on time and in a safe manner. The strange irony is that there is a very strong competitive base at the bottom end of the transport industry, whereas at the top end of the market there is a cost plus attitude, especially in the transnational transport business. This industry is dominated by three major operators: Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd, Mayne Nickless Ltd and Brambles. In 1982 there were about 164,000 people employed in the transport industry. It is very hard to get the exact figure at the current time. The industry is dominated by the big players and the activities of the TWU-the Transport Workers Union of Australia. The key issue is, of course, that the Transport Workers Union employs industrial muscle to implement its claims on the major operators, whereas the smaller operators are not able to withstand the pressure from the TWU. In terms of wages, conditions, superannuation and, of course, control of the industry, the TWU exerts a major influence. This is particularly so in the ability of the union to control the freight depots. It knows that if the freight forwarders do not control the depots in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or Perth, the whole road freight industry will come to a standstill. So the TWU places black bans on the depots and is then able to use its powerful industrial position to coerce transport workers and employers into a position of its liking. As I have said, there is no real competition between the big three players because they get the work. Then they subcontract it out to the smaller operators at the other end of the spectrum. Mr Ian Webber, the Managing Director of Mayne Nickless, in an address to the Federal Chamber of Automobile Industries in April 1990 stated the position quite clearly: The difference is that, unlike the automotive industry, most service industries are not subjected to the unforgiving discipline of foreign competition. That means to survive a service provider need only be as efficient or inefficient as its local petitors-no matter how intense that competition may be. And since the service industry is largely deregulated, that competition can be fierce! However, the unpalatable fact is that the absence of foreign competition removes a constraint on wages and work practices that can be seen in its most extreme form on the Australian waterfront. Honourable members can see from that that Mr Webber understands the problem. In this environment, the activities of the TWU and those bigger operators can flourish by encouraging extreme demands in terms of wage rates, terms and conditions and all those inefficient work practices that we are aware of-not to mention the problems on the waterfront, to which he alludes, and of course the building industry. Since the Gulf crisis the transport industry's major cost component-that is, fuel, which accounts for 35 per cent-has gone up quite considerably. The small operators now have higher fuel bills as well as having to pay a higher interest rate on their $200,000 rigs because of the Government's policy on interest rates. And, of course, the TWU has been able to win rises in the field as a result of threats and intimidation. Those rises are passed on to the smaller operators rather thal1 the big forward transporters which do not carry the goods. The two major carriers operate between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Looking at some of the figures, it is quite interesting to find, in the Australian transport context, that road carries 77 per cent of actual tonnage moved; rail 18 per cent; sea 4 per cent; and air only one per cent. When we add to that the tonnage component per kilometre, we see that road carries about 27 per cent; rail 29 per cent; sea 43 per cent-those heavy goods-and air one per cent. Country and regional operators and owner-drivers have become concerned about the operations of the 'big three'. They formed the National Transport Federation in an attempt to reduce the power of the TWU, to allow more genuine competition between transport operators, to make management more related to the comdrivers themselves, to establish the true legal position of owner-driver operators, and to make some attempt to remove the bans that the TWU was always placing on the transport operators. As is the case with the waterfront, there has not been a very close relationship between the major forwarders and the people doing the work. The major forwarders, as I say, do not employ the majority of drivers because they are acting as subcontractors or ownerdrivers: Consequently, there are deals done between the TWU on the one hand and the major forwarders on the other, and the men on the job just have to put up with the final conditions. The National Transport Federation put forward its charter to protect the drivers' legal rights, to provide a safe and efficient environment for transport, and to get some tax equity into the costs of their transport rigs and the amount of fuel tax they pay. When they started in 1986 about two bans per week were being placed on transport operators, generally on a Friday. It was very difficult for transport drivers to withstand the pressure of the union and it was able to bring in force the legal rights of the drivers and operators with some success. In 1987-88, over 100 bans were lifted because employers started to understand that they did have legal rights. They were able to withstand the. constant fear of transport operators that the TWU's black ban was legal and could stop them from operating. Of course, always at the back of their minds was the repayment on their trucks, not to mention the fact that the goods had to be delivered on time .. I think one of the State secretaries reflected the attitude in the industry when he said to one freight operator, 'You have now entered this industry; you have entered a whole new world. You are the industry but we are the world and the law'. One can see that the transporters believed traditionally they had no choice but to go along with strongarmed tactics, union bans and standover tactics by union officials to enforce their terms and conditions. We have seen these conditions in other industries. We saw what the National Farmers Federation did at Mudginberri in the live sheep export and wide comb disputes when people stood up to union intimidation. I am informed that at this very moment the TWU is placing black bans on the smaller operators. The bigger forward transport companies are accepting these black bans, saying that people will have to join the union or cooperate with the TWU's demands, otherwise they cannot go into their freight depots. The TWU is saying that it wishes to maintain the current award, irrespective of whether it is legal or applies to owner-drivers or operators, and it will not cooperate with the Australian .Industrial Relations .Commission in amending the award to bring about changes in productivity and some adjustments and improvements. The 'big three' are just lying down and accepting the demands by the TWU. Of course, they do not have to carry the costs. The costs are passed on to the subcontractors who are paying high fuel bills and generally having a very tough time in that competitive market down the line. We on this side put forward the strong proposition that in Australia individual workers have a choice: they have a choice as to whether to join a union or not. They have a chance to determine their own wages and conditions in conjunction with their own management and bosses, without being coerced by black bans and intimidatory tactics by the union movement, which is trying to win rises in the field on the one hand and, on the other, accepting any rises that the centralised wage fixing system will give it. Yet, those operators in the field have no way of passing on the costs. All they can do is drive harder and faster through the night between Melbourne and Sydney, have a greater number of accidents and try to do their best in very difficult circumstances.",45
50,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Alleged Plot to Assassinate the Prime Minister,47
51,Mr WRIGHT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in this grievance debate to place on the parliamentary record the facts surrounding the events leading to the public exposure of the alleged plot to assassinate the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Hawke) at the Bicentenary celebrations in Sydney on Australia Day in 1988. I want to make it very clear that I went to great pains during the press briefing held on Monday evening to explain to the media that the information that I was relating had nothing to do with my position as Presiding Member of the Joint Standing Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, and I have a tape of that briefing to substantiate that claim. Secondly, I explained that it was unfortunate that the matter had not been kept totally secret until the prime informant of mine had briefed the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), which was to take place next week. That briefing has now taken place and Daniel O'Sullivan-he has given me permission to use his name in this speech-spent five hours with ASIO giving full details. I regret any discomfort that this issue may have caused the Prime Minister or any senior Minister but, on the other hand, I state that I believe it is important that the people of this country are aware of the extent that the neo-Nazi extreme Right elements that exist in this country could be willing to go to to pursue their objectives. Some might call it fantasy, some might call it a beat-up, to suggest that anyone would dare to try to take the life of the nation's most important leader, or political leaders generally, or might plan some type of insurrection. I want to refer quickly not to the two informants, Paul Buckley and Daniel O'Sullivan, but to the comments of the Director-General of ASIO in his report released earlier this year which I have in this House. On page 5 the Director General said: . . . domestic groups on the extreme right have shown a clear potential to cause distress to sections of the Australian community, and perhaps threaten life. The emphasis is on 'threaten life'. On the same page he said: Several groups with international records of PMV have support groups or cells in Australia, . . . and operate in a fairly secretive manner. On page 49 he said: The rise of a number of small but violenceprone right wing racist groups places another creasing demand on ASIO's intelligence resources. I suggest that he would not have made that suggestion unless his concerns were real, and he sought extra resources. I want to refer quickly to the four Western Australians, the leaders of the neoNazi Australian Nationalist Movement, who have just been jailed-some for up to 20 years-for a series of atrocities. The six-week trial revealed & number of things: first of all, a plan to assassinate senior politicians and police in Western Australia and, secondly, as the transcript shows, a plan to stage a military coup in Australia. The key witness, Russell Dean Willey, whose evidence and confessions convicted these men and was relied upon totally by the Crown as the evidence by which it would pursue against these men, claimed that the Australian Nationalist Movement and its associated Aryian army was a neoNazi terrorist organisation with branches all over Australia. I think that puts paid to the critics who have said, 'Where is the network?'. The man who gave this evidencesays that there are branches all over Australia. Certain elements in authority have tried to make out that one of my informants, Paul Buckley, has made lots of unsubstantiated claims in the past. I want to point out that Mr Buckley has never gone to the media before. Secondly, it was Mr Buckley who exposed, initially, the neoNazi Australian Nationalist Movement military training camp in Western Australia. It was that exposure that finally brought these fellows to trial and, ultimately, to gaol for 20 years. The acts of violence and terrorism by these neo-Nazis and their plan for a military coup is not a beat-up; it is on the record and was used in evidence against these men, and finally they have been jailed. The presence of neo-Nazi groups and extreme right wing groups proves that they are violent and the reports are there that they would threaten life; and that is not a beat-up. I say that the claims made by Daniel O'Sullivan and Paul Buckley about in the plot against the Prime Minister, approximately two years ago, involving a South African-linked group called Colour Purple is also not a beat-up. I understand why certain people would be concerned about this because of the aspects as they relate to the national interest. I also take some exception to the way that those critics have tried to redefine what was said. The informants never said at any time that it was the personal bodyguards of the Prime Minister who were to be involved in this; they talked about the broad security forces. They did not comment about the personal bodyguards being removed; they talked about changes in security. For people to come out and say that no extra bodyguards or security were involved is ridiculous. Everyone knows that Prince Charles was there; the British also had additional security people. We will never know, but I put it to the House that, if my informants made it up, why would they be prepared to tell ASIO everything and why did Daniel O'Sullivan yesterday spend five hours with ASIO, not only talking about this issue of Colour Purple but also going to the issue of the national executive and the extremist groups that exist? I want to make this address, however, not about the plot but about the presence of neo-Nazi networks and extreme right wing groups in this country. They operate in this country and their presence is confirmed by the ASIO report and the recent Nazi trial in Western Australia. I remind the House that back in the early 1970s a lot of people in high places said that the claims about the Croatian military camps were also a beat-up, and they were proved to be wrong. The main issue here is the presence of extremist neo-Nazi groups. I repeat the call that I have made in this House on many occasions, and in the State Parliament in Queensland on occasions, for a full, independent inquiry into this issue. An inquiry must incorporate an investigation into such groups as the Australian League of Rights, the One Australia Movement, the Veritas Publishing Company Pty Ltd and all those associated with them. I state emphatically that I believe in the right of groups to voice their beliefs and pursue their peaceful political objectives. But I argue that those who participate in the political process should be bound by the same rules of accountability as apply to the mainline and registered political parties. They ought to account for their money; they ought to account for their links overseas; they ought to account for their personnel. The people of Australia have a right to know where the money comes from that resources these groups, and the people of Australia have a right to know what international links they have. I cite, for instance, the Veritas Publishing Company. It produces neo-Nazi material and books such as Red over Black and The Holocaust-A Hoax, which is a book that everyone knows says that Hitler was innocent, that he was pure and that Churchill was the one who should have been convicted or tried for the death of the Jews. This is a two-dollar company, yet over three years, between 1982 and 1985, this company received a minimum of $1.2m in non-repaid loans from two companies called Donjon Holdings Pty Ltd and Barla Pty Ltd, and also from some individuals associated with these companies. The Adelaide Advertiser, which researched this issue, found that Donjon at one time had $2m in assets. I am now told it is down to $2. This company does not conduct any business of any kind. Yet it is proven, and it has admitted now, that at least one of its directors is closely associated with the League of Rights. The Veritas Publishing Company has now disappeared. I went to Western Australia to search it out; I went to the farmhouse where it operated from. Let us remember that it was a two-bit two-dollar company operating out of a farmhouse but was given at least $1.2m by these companies that do not do anything. We searched its previous property at Chittering and we found material linking it with a South African printing firm. We found also materiallinking it with a convicted Nazi war criminal in Canada and we found links with the publications of all sorts of neoNazi material. I stress that the company has disappeared. Yet last year, and ever since 1980-81, this company has been receiving Federal government export grants for, one officer in the system says, controversial books. I have raised this matter with Senator John Button's office for investigation. It has been pointed out that he has no discretion over what sorts of export grants are given. If the general guidelines are met, the money is paid. But I have been promised that there will be a full investigation into this. Grants were received over this period for over $70,000; the last grant was paid last year to promote neo-Nazi literature overseas. It was first approved, as I said, in 1980-81 under the Liberal National Government. That may be why members of the Opposition have tried to target me on this issue; I know that the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) is in the chamber. I accept their reasons for being concerned. But I ask them all to listen to the circumstances, because members of this organisation have also used their own members of parliament in Western Australia to try to give respectability and legitimacy to it. It was only recently that one member launched a book for the company. This company has asked all sorts of prominent authors and people with reputation to write books and print those books to give it this legitimacy, and has used members of the Liberal Party to launch those books to make out that all is okay. We know that there are clear links between the League of Rights and Vefitas Publishing Company. We know that there are links between the League of Rights and the One Australia Movement. Now, on the evidence given by Daniel O'Sullivan, we know that there are people involved with the One Australia Movement and the League linked with what is called the National Executive. I might add that in the trials it was also mentioned by these criminals that there was some higher body above them, above the neo-Nazi structure. The documents which I have and will table show the first evidence of the money trail-in excess of $1.2m. There is documented evidence of the government grants; there are admissions of links between the League of Rights and Veritas Publishing Company as shown by the Adelaide Advertiser. There are proven links with neo-Nazi elements overseas that Jan Mayman, an investigative reporter, has found. They cannot be cast aside as a beat-up or fantasy. It is important that a full and proper inquiry be held at the highest possible level. I understand the concerns about the association with this plot, but I suggest that we need to get to the real issues, that is, the presence of a network of neo-Nazi organisations referred to by the Director-General of ASIO in his report and referred to by witnesses used by the Crown in the trials to convict these fellows for 20 years. I regret, as I said, any discomfort that this issue has caused to the Prime Minister and others, but I believe the people of Australia have a right to know that there exists in this country a network of extremist right wing groups prone to violence and prepared to take life.",47

57,Mr WILSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"This debate today gives me the opportunity to deal with what I regard as a very important issue for the future of this nation. I want to talk about the economic viability of Australian families and the way in which our tax and social security system is letting them down. I know, in taking the broad approach, that there is great concern amongst Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, Western democracies and the industrialised world about the way in which governments over the last 80 years or so have gone in taking responsibility for what can be described as the social expenditures: expenditures in respect of housing, education, health and income support. The objectives that so many people admired, commonly known as the beverage approach, are wonderful objectives but I think the last 50 years or so have demonstrated that the objectives have not been fulfilled by the way in which countries have sought to achieve objectives. Instead of achieving self-reliance for individual citizens and self-reliance and independence for families, we have created a framework caused by governments' dependence upon governments. Then when that dependence has cost governments huge amounts of money, when those governments have been concerned about the level of their taxation, attacks have been made, not only on the method of achieving the objective, but also on the objective itself. . I think that is most unfortunate because all too often now we find that there is a very simplistic approach to things: let us cut social expenditures; let us reduce the government allocation to education, health, housing and income support. Society may want to spend as much as it is now spending on those items. Indeed, society may choose to spend more. If society, through individual decisions, chooses to spend more we should allow it to do so, indeed respect it and possibly even encourage it. What we have is a situation where there is a fight between governments and individuals-where governments try to offload expenditure onto individuals and individuals seek to off-load their expenditure onto governments without, as a society, looking at the total picture and asking, 'How can we optimise the general good and, in achieving that objective, minimise the circumstances in which young Australians and their families are in circumstances of poverty or some degree of income deprivation?'. Since the present Government has been in office, in spite of its rhetoric it has done far more things that have put more pressure on Australian families than it is prepared to admit. In its approach to taxation it has tended to say that children are consumption goods: they are the responsibility of their parents and if they are willing to pay for them, so be it; if not, then those families must pay high taxes and reduce their standard of living. Of course, the Government will respond by saying that it has focused on the needy. It is true that it has made some changes in that area. It has expanded the Fraser Government's family income supplement. It has changed its name, increased the amounts and called it the family allowance supplement. What it has done, however, is say that there is a level of income and when a family reaches that level the Government will give it no recognition for the cost of educating, maintaining and supporting children. I have always thought-and I believe the Australian community believes-that taxation should be based upon capacity to pay. But over recent years a view has been developed that capacity to pay is purely a function of income. That is nonsense. The capacity of any individual to pay is the function of a number of other things. An individual may have a high income and live in a household where other people have high incomes. He has a very high capacity to pay tax, but he may be living in a household in which no-one else has an income, where there is a dependent spouse and dependent children. Yet we expect the family man and the family woman who are providing the sole income in their household to pay the same level of tax as an individual taxpayer, irrespective of whether that individual taxpayer is living alone in an accommodation unit or sharing an accommodation unit with a whole group of other people who have very high incomes. It is imperative for this Parliament to look at how, through the tax system, we should deliver a system that bases tax collection on capacity to pay. When the Fraser Government came to office it took out of the tax system a family tax rebate and in so doing it did some very positive social things. It increased the child endowment, renamed it family allowance, and paid a greater amount to people with low or no incomes, usually mothers caring for children at home; and it provided that increased endowment called family allowance to a lot of families that paid no That was a very creditable thing. But what was most unfortunate was that a large proportion of what were described by some as tax expenditures were then deemed to be welfare payments. They were not welfare payments. They were adjustments being made through the social security system to reflect a taxpayer's capacity to pay. Sadly, there are some people who believe that, because they are supporting children, the so-called tax rebate should not be in the tax system or they categorise it, as I have described, as a tax expenditure. It is not a tax expenditure. It be seen as part of the underlying tax structure, a structure which is based on ensuring that individuals pay their tax year by year in accordance with their capacity to pay tax year by year. If we moved to life cycle taxing, life cycle accounting, taxpayers would be expected to provide from one year when they have low expenditures for those years when they have high expenditures. But we do not allow that. We tax families on an annual basis. We should have a tax system that allows taxpayers full account for the expenditure of supporting dependants. In my view, family allowances should be universal. If they are delivered through the tax system they should be at an amount equal to the amount that through the social security system we1pay dren who are totally dependent upon the government. To the extent that we allow a rebate to taxpayers at an amount less than that which we pay for poor children, we are saying to families, 'You will pay your ordinary taxes, but to an extent, or entirely if you have a very high income, you are to treat your children as a consumption expenditure'. We do that at a time in our history when we have a birth rate that is substantially below the replacement rate. Whilst pro-natal policies do not necessarily increase populations, I believe antinatal policies are certainly causing people to determine to have smaller families than they would if the tax system were based on capacity to pay.",50
58,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Jenkins) tax - Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Television Reception on Woy Woy Peninsula,52
59,Mr WALKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise to air a grievance of great importance to thousands of my constituents living on the Woy Woy peninsula and adjacent areas of the coast of New South Wales who, amazingly enough, have no, or extremely bad, television reception. It is a scandal of considerable proportions that in 1990 an area which is virtually a stone's throw from the northern suburbs of the should great metropolis of Sydney and which boasts a population of almost the same size as Canberra, most of whom live on a coastal plain, yet has large pockets of citizens who get either no television reception or very bad television reception. Some 14,000 of the 30,000-odd citizens living on that peninsula have trouble with their television reception. Most of those people are pensioners. It is an area which probably has the highest concentration of retired people in Australia living on it and these days television is considered to be something of a necessity, particularly by pensioners. I suppose it was a luxury not that long ago, but certainly one's lifestyle and one's recreation these days are tremendously dependent on television, and to be denied it in such an area is-quite for chil- amazing, to say the least. The history of this extraordinary situation is somewhat protracted, but it deserves some brief summarising because it reveals a state of affairs that reflects most adversely on the community service obligations, the efficiency and the competence of the television licensing system in Australia; and particularly it reflects on certain commercial television stations particularly channels 7, 9, and 10 iSydney and NBN channel 3 in Newcastle. The campaign for improved television reception on the Central Coast of New South Wales dates back to 1966. Howeve-, I will spare the House the struggle dunng the putative years of television and commence my recital of this tale in 1980 in the days when the Hon. Tony - Staley, was the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. On 18 March 1980, Mr Staley visited the electorate of Robertson and learned first-hand of its reception problems. By September of the same year, the then Australian Broadcasting Tribunal confirmed Mr Staley's decision to provide two translator facilities on the Central Coast to greatly improve television reception. But even at this stage it was realised by the responsible engineers within the Department that reception on the Woy Woy peninsula and in the Koolewong, Tascott and Point Clare areas would still be quite inadequate, because on 27 May 1981 it was agreed that a third translator station should be constructed at Saratoga. The problem was created by the overlapping of signals being beamed into the Central Coast from different transmitters in the Sydney metropolitan area and in Newcastle. The overlapping resulted in the quality of television pictures either being seriously affected or being totally obliterated. Some two years elapsed, however, before there was any movement at all towards providing the translator. Some impetus was then given to my constituents' cause by the David Jones inquiryor what is called the Foster inquiry, because it was named after the town of Foster in Victoria-into commercial television translator stations, which reported to this Parliament in March of 1983. That inquiry weighed the case for exclusive service areas against providing viewers with access to multiple commercial channels. It came down in favour of the latter and recommended that, in cases of overlapping signals, sufficient translators be supplied to provide a proper television picture on each channel. I refer to page 47 of that learned report, where Mr David Jones, the Chairman of the Tribunal, argues the case, and particularly supports the case of NBN Channel 3 Newcastle, that multiple television stations be beamed into one area and that the technical problems associated with that beaming be sorted out by the erection of translator stations-a very wise and sensible decision if it had been implemented. Hearings of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal were then held in respect of television services on the Central Coast and other places in New South Wales, in June and August of 1983. For many years my constituents had been ably represented in putting submissions before the Tribunal and Ministers, and they had organised a range of community leaders and community organisations to put the case of residents on the Central Coast. Mr Maurice Egan, representing the Brisbane Waters Council of Community Organisations, Mr Dave Abbott, Mr Robert Findlay and various other community leaders were represented through progress associations such as Woy Woy South, Koolewong, Tascott and Point Clare. Also, the Gosford Combined Progress Associations were involved in preparing these cases and putting very good submissions indeed to the Tribunal. Those submissions, of course, were heard and they received a very sympathetic hearing indeed, and this issue of the overlapping of reception was taken into consideration. Mr Egan gave some short evidence before that Tribunal which I think helps understand the problem. Mr Egan said this to the Tribunal: Mr Chairman, the main thrust of our submission was that the area be regarded as an overlap area so that all the Sydney commercial stations and NBN 3 would be able to transmit into the Gosford City Council area, and specifically into the area served by the Saratoga translator, and the minister has so determined. However, sir, there are two other matters that I would like to bring up, if I may, and one is that, when this finally happens, the city commercial stations do not only regard this area as a peripheral area for commercial reasons, but they do actively become concerned with the very many organisations and growth that is going on in the area . . . The citizens were concerned that there be some local content in all this beaming into the Central Coast, and that would occur, of course, if someone would erect a translator. On 28 August the Department also gave evidence. Mr Anthony Norris, Assistant Secretary to the Department, gave evidence and told my constituents and the Tribunal that it would be three to four months-this is in August 1984-before the technical problems would be worked out with the translator and the gazettal of the arrangements would be made. His assistant, the chief engineer, Mr Knowles, was involved in this discussion with the Chairman of the Tribunal at page 43 of the transcript: THE CHAIRMAN-So, the department is suggesting to the Tribunal, as I understand it, at this stage, and it is also the minister's view, that it is has expired. not desirable to proceed to finalise the grant of licences for Saratoga because that might be rendered nugatory by these other developments, which would involve calling for applications for a licence for an area differently configured, right? Mr Knowles said: That is correct, Mr Chairman The Chairman then said: In view of the sort of concern expressed Egan, is the department able to give any sort of time frame on how long it might take to up with a new proposal for Saratoga, Mr Norris? And Mr Norris said: Once the department was in receipt pleted proposal for the alternative translator, it would probably take 3 or 4 months to get the thing processed through to gazettal stage. the notice is gazetted, of course, then it into the tribunal's court. And again the Chairman asked him, torate 'Three to four months?', and Mr Norris said, 'Yes, Mr Chairman'. That was what the Department said-three to four months from August 1984. Six long years have passed, nothing has happened, and my constituents continue to suffer. The National Parks and Wildlik,Service permission for the Booti translator, the Gosford City Council gave development consent on 27 September 1989 and Minister gave his consent on 22 August 1989, but no-one has constructed the translator. The responsibility, of course, lies the commercial television stations. one has seen the colour of their money. Since April this year I have had constant deputations from my constituents seeking some relief. I have had lengthy discuswithin sions with officers of the Department who have been very cooperative but I am afraid they have offered little joy. They have explained that the construction facility on North Head and problems with the State Government have delayed the plans somewhat, although six years is hardly three months. But the real problem lies in the fact that the commercial television stations simply will not put up the money to build the translator. Their excuse is-",52
60,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, Order! The honourable member's time ' Social Security,54
61,Mr COWAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise tois that day to speak on behalf of quite a number of my constituents, aged people in the electorate of Lyne-and I am sure generally throughout Australia-and the matter of concern is social security. It is not so much about Budget measures-although by Mr I may say a few brief words about come those-but about the many changes that are taking place today in our social security system, and I suppose one could say in our taxation system, that have many of a compeople gravely concerned. Over the last week or so, in' fact ever Once since the Treasurer (Mr Keating) brought is back down the Budget, I have had many single and married couples coming to my elecoffice. In one day there were four couples who were in tears because they felt that they were being adversely affected by the Budget-maybe not so much adversely affected but confused by the Budget or the system generally as it reflects upon the pensioner and the low ingave come person within our communities. Only about half an hour ago in the chamber I listened to the honourable the member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) speak broadly about our system and where the responsibility lies so far as the care of many of these aged people is conwith cerned-not just the aged but the penNosioner generally: the invalid and the veterans' affairs pensioner in our community. I am sure that the Government itself realises that this confusion is abroad the minds of many of our people. When the Treasurer brings down a Budget, all honourable members have only a broad picture of what is contained'in it. of a Although the Budget Papers are made available from the Bills and Papers Office the same day, it takes some time tq be able to digest and appreciate just what is in the Budget. Naturally, both that evening over the electronic media and in the press the following morning we have a broad picture once again of what the Budget actually contains, and once again these people that I speak about become confused because they appreciate that there are changes that are not visible at that particular time. It is time that we reviewed our entire system. I do not think that people should have this worry placed upon them. Basically I am talking about people who have worked hard for a lifetime; people who have reared a family; people who have been employed within the industries, on their farms, commercially and in every other way; people who look forward to having good health in retirement to be able to play their bowls and golf and do the normal things in life that they were unable to do throughout a lifetime of work. Mr Nehl-They are entitled to peace with old age.",54
62,Mr COWAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"That is right; people want peace in their old age. Those are the people that I am concerned about. I hope that the Government is also concerned and is re-examining the situation appertaining to them generally. I want to make an appeal on behalf of these people. I see people whose health is being affected and people who have domestic problems within their homes now, at this old age, because there is this confusion. I am sure that none of us want to see this happening in our society today. We have to realise, as the honourable member for Sturt explained earlier, that almost one-third of our total Budget expenditure today is taken up with social security. We are a social security country. We are a country that looks after the people who actually need support-the underprivileged in the community, the Aboriginal people, the low income people, the aged people, the invalid pensioners and certainly the war veterans. These are the people that nobody objects to assisting as long as it is done properly and as long as we do not develop things to the point that I feel we are at this time. I have spoken about the pressure upon the families. I will illustrate one or two of the things that appeared in the Budget. The Treasurer said that a pensioner or a married pensioner couple may have $2,000 to spend, money that is recognised for everyday expenses-for funeral expenses that they save up for, for their food, for their clothing or for a short trip. Anything they have above that is recognised as actually earning 10 per cent in interest. A lot of our people have submitted their returns to Social Security. But now they know that for taxation purposes and in respect of their fringe benefits, that 10 per cent will be counted in the level of the pension that they will receive. Maybe there is an argument for this but it is an illustration of the worry that these people have. These personal factors, Mr Deputy Speaker, must be kept in mind when we are talking about the changes that are taking place generally to social security. These same people would sooner leave their money in their bank because they know it is safe there. They read about the Pyramid Building Society and the State Bank of Victoria. Even though it might be a small amount or it might be $30,000, $40,000 or $50,000, they are worried about where to put that money and whether it will be safe because it is their hard-earned cash. It might be hard for us to understand this but when you talk to these people, Mr Deputy Speaker, you can understand it. They are frugal people; they are people that have worked hard; they are good Australians; they are people that we want to support; and they are people that the taxpayer does not mind supporting. But they are some of the worries that these same people have. In respect of prescriptions for pharmaceutical drugs, we know that pensioners are now compensated for this extra $2.50. But with a married couple, that is only $1.25 each. There has been tremendous confusion throughout the community as to what these entitlements are because when the Treasurer refers to some of these things he refers, for example, to the actual deposits of the pensioners. Those are only words but when we come down to detail to find out what these things mean, these are the worries that the people have. I not think-Mr Sciacca-They should not be worried.",55
63,Mr COWAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,It worries me because basically at least one-third of people in my electorate are pensioners Mr Sciacca-I will come up and help you explain it to them some time.,56
64,Mr COWAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would be very pleased if the honourable member would help and I would be very pleased at the same time if, as a Parliamentary Secretary, honourable member could use his influremain ence-I know he is a genuine fellow-on his superiors to have them look at and examine this system. Look at the assets test, for instance. A lot of people may think that the assets test is fair. Mr Nehl-Shameful!",56
65,Mr COWAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"But the assets test is a shameful thing, as the honourable member for Cowper says. It is a shameful thing. It is not just income that is counted; it is the assets that people hold. As have said in the House before, in the rural electorates of Australia, I have farmers over 65 or 70 years of age who say that they want to remain on their properties. They might be able to run about 20 head of cattle and make a profit sufficient enough to pay the rates. But because those people have an asset there, because their neighbours sold out at a big figure, they are told by this Government that they can sell out and move into town. told they should buy a threeor fourbedroom home, leave sufficient money in a building society or a bank and draw the age pension. That is not the way these people want to live. In one small community just out of home Taree, I had 11 aged pensioner couples of who lost the pension. Only two retained it because they appealed. The others did not retain the pension. These people were living on small properties and, wanted remain on them. They did not want to move into town. They did not want to accept the offer of the Minister at the time. He said, 'We will pay you the penThey sion but we will count that as a debt each day. do against the asset that you have and the asset will be sold after your pass away'. That is not what people work for today. I could talk about Austudy.",56
66,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member's of some kind. time has expired. Queensland Council of Carers,56
67,Mr GIBSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"This afternoon I would like to talk about a me very important group of people in our community, the people who we call carthe <;:rs. They are the carers of people whq in their homes and who are not institutionalised. They look after disabled reor infirm people and play a very important role in our community in looking after those people's interests. In particular I would like to pay a great deal of credit to a new organisation in Queensland called the Queensland Council of Carers. ' I had a great deal of pleasure on 31 August to participate with the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr we Staples) at the official opening of the Queensland Council of Carers' new facility which is located in my electorate at 15 Abbott Street, Camp Hill. It was a wonderful place to visit and it was a wonderful opportunity for me to meet the caring people who are involved in this Queensland Council of Carers. I would like to pay a particular tribute to the office bearers of the Queensland Council of Carers and in particular Val French, the They are President of that group. What exactly do we mean by a carer? I think it is best if I use the definition that the Queensland Council of Carers has used: a person or family responsible for the care in the of an individual who needs varying degrees assistance with the activities of daily living. I think it is important to recognise that those people playa very silent but importo tant role in our community. They care each day because of the love and compassion that they have for other people and particularly for their family members. care for the needs of these people The Queensland Council of Carers is made up of carers-support groups that have been formed for the disabled and frail aged, interested organisations and dividuals. The organisation has a number of aims that are important to note. The first is to lobby governments and funding bodies as to the issues and needs of carers and the community, and I add that it has been very successfut in that role on behalf of members; to increase public awareness of the needs of carers; to undertake and sponsor research in the areas of concern for carers; and to provide a central resource and information service available to all carers. The Council has certainly achieved that because while we were at the opening of its new facility, we also participated in the launch of a new 008 number called 'Care Line', which is available for all ers throughout Queensland. It is a number that anybody in Queensland, from all the remote centres spread across this State, is able to use. People can call the Queensland Council of Carers in Brisbane and seek information or advice or counselling from its paid officials to assist them in their role as carers. The other aims that have been identified are to sponsor or initiate innovations in programs aimed specifically for carers; to act in an advisory capacity to service providers on issues and needs of carers; and to promote and establish carers' support and lobby groups. This issue is of very great importance to me as a member of this House and also as an individual because I have a family situation where my own mother is a carer. My father was diagnosed a couple of years ago as suffering from Alzheimer's disease. My mother is now in the role of a full-time carer in the home. It is very important to people like my mother and the many hundreds of thousands of people in a similar situation that they have access to support networks like the Queensland Council of Carers. We need to point out some of the information which is available about the number of carers we have in our community because, as I said, there are large numbers of them working quietly and silently in their homes and a lot of us do not really know it is happening. A survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of inStatistics in 1988 estimated that 2,453,000 people, or 15.6 per cent of the Australian population, are disabled. The incidence of disability increases significantly with age. Of children aged less than five years, only 3.3 per cent were disabled, while 63.5 per cent of people aged 75 years or over are classified as disabled. There are 1.9 million Australians with a handicap who are living at home, as opposed to 160,000 Australians living in institutions. So there are 1.9 million families who are caring in their homes for the needs of disabled or handicapped persons. They require a lot of support from the community and from all levels of government. I congratulate this Government on car- its initiative in funding the Queensland Council of Carers in its new building and for providing the 008 number, but I would plead with this Government, and with all levels of government, to provide a much greater level of support to carers because I believe they do playa very vital role in our community in helping those who otherwise would have to be institutionalised. The Government would otherwise be required to pay a much more substantial amount of money for their support. The Queensland Council of Carers' funding established not only the office in Brisbane; it also covered the establishmerit of resource centres in Townsville and Rockhampton. The 008 number for telephone counselling called Care Line, also approved at the same time, will operate in conjunction with all the resource centres in Brisbane, Rockhampton and Townsville. The Queensland Council of Carers maintains that the care of chronically disabled and frail aged family members in the home is becoming a major source of distress for carers, predominantly women, in the Australian community. Since carers form the backbone of the deinstitutionalisation policy, which we' all support, the Council sees their health and well-being-that is, the health and well-being of carers-as crucial to the success of home care. I agree wholeheartedly with its assessment. With the introduction of the 008 number called Care Line, carers in isolated circumstances, either in rural or urban areas, can contact this service and receive professional counselling immediately. They can receive information about services in their area which they may not be aware of and contact voluntary organisations where appropriate. The Queensland Council of Carers is funded under the unmatched moneys program which is a Commonwealth funded program related to the home and community care program (HACC). The home and community care program is a joint Commonwealth-State program which provides grants for services which support people living at home who are at the risk of inappropriate admission to residential· care. A great innovation of the HACC legislation is its focus on carers. It specifically requires that assistance be directed to the carers of the frail aged and younger disabled at risk of premature or inappropriate residential care. Carers are therefore an integral part of the HACC target population, a feature apparently distinguishing the Australian experience from programs in comparable countries. HACC recognises that carers not only benefit from better services generally, but also have specific. needs as individuals. This was reiterated in the HACC review which noted that service should be provided to an individual or carer in a way that recognises the role of the, carer and his or her need for support and for an independent and fulfilling life. I also stress, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is very important that members in all States take up the question of concern for carers and that they contact the Department of Community Services and Health to seek whatever support is available from that Department, because I think there are a lot of people in our electorates who are at home looking after disabled or frail aged people. They are too busy to phone their local member or see their local member because their day is almost totally dominated by the needs of the loved ones they are sharing at home. It is important that we, as members of this House, recognise that we have a responsibility to take up their issues for them and to ensure that there are levels of support provided in the community that cater for their needs. I would urge honourable members, where possible, to seek out the Department of Community Services and Health and, through the HACC program, some funding for their electorates or States to establish a similar program to that of the Queensland Council of Carers and the 008 number that it has established. Tasmanian Forest Industry",56
68,Mr SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"At the outset I compliment the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) on his views. Although he is a new member, he would be aware that we on this side of the House share his concern about carers and the frail aged. Obviously we see some real advantages, both socially and economically, in encouraging at-home care. I can testify to that from my own experience because I have an elderly in-law living with me and I understand that the honourable member is in a similar situation. So I compliment him on that. I just ask him to recognise that there is a bipartisan approach to the matter and that there is always room for improvement on both sides of the House. I want to raise as a grievance a matter that is dear to me, being a Tasmanian member, a matter that is causing great concern in my State at this very moment. An event that was to take place today at 12 noon was the signing of a forest strategy paper that has been prepared in a little less than two years. It has great significance for Tasmania. My grievance is that I find unacceptable the confrontation that has been brought about by the environment groups in Tasmania, which undermines balanced growth and development, on a sustainable basis, of the Tasmanian forestry industry. All honourable members saw a few days ago the log trucks around this building. It brought home to many of us the level Of investment in the forest industry and the need to look for a balanced approach-a sensible, common sense approach-to the forestry industry. Tasmania relies very, very heavily on forestry. As all of us know, we went through the Helsham Commiswas sion of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme Southern Forests. 1 do not have to relate to members the significance of that indusa try to Tasmania. But last Friday, on the eve of the finalisation of this strategy, amazing event took place. Honourable members need to hear little more of the history. A little while ago, all the players in the forestry industry in Tasmania developed what is known as industry. the Salamanca agreement. The saw loggers, the woodchip companies, the envirial ronment groups and the Government agreed to sit down and, with funds plied by the Federal Government, try to work out a strategy. Each would put the particular issues on the table and work out where the compromises needed to be plug. It continued: made to try to develop an industry that had some certainty about it for investbartering ment purposes and also gave relevant success value to conservation issues, so that at talks the end of the day we got to the magic stance, phrase that so many of us use-'sustainfrom able development' - developing such things as private forestry, properly utilising State forests, looking at all the differbenefited ent methods of logging and so on. All those issues were discussed. Finally, we had a paper, a strategy document, that was to be signed today. The document went back to the differin ent constituent parts-the Forest Industhe tries Association, the Tasmanian loggers, the woodchip mills and so on-for signney), had this to say: ing and was to be ratified today after the constituent bodies had given their approval to it. Everyone was in agreement. aged However, last Friday the combined enviSenator Richardson. ronment groups walked out and said that after the long and lengthy development of dollars' this strategy they were not now going to be part of it. Many of us in Tasmania obtained were aghast at this but were not surprised because the· groups were wanting to move the goal posts again right on the eve of tralia. achieving something that I think would have been important for our State. Indeed, my colleague the honourable Richardson's member for Lyqns (Mr Burr), who also sues. has a great number of constituents involved both directly and indirectly in the timber industry, said that the community now justified in disregarding the views and of the Green movement and urged that resource development projects proceed on common sense basis. He went on to say that delays caused by intransigent fanatics an should no longer be tolerated. I echo those sentiments. They should not be tolerated a because they are putting in jeopardy a proper consultation process for the measured and balanced development of that It was also interesting to read an editoin one of the local newspapers, the Launceston Examiner-a major newspasupper in the State of Tasmania-headed 'Environment groups shouldn't ""retire"" '. The editorial stated that they should be involved and that they had pulled the Those engaged in the 12 months of inquiry and were convinced that in the wake of the of the Salamanca Agreement the strategy were underpinned by respect for each group's good faith and overall belief that every group, but especially Tasmania, would benefit the agreement. In my view, they would certainly have from the agreement. Indeed, as we saw in the south-east forest decision last week, there is now to be, and always should have been, a reliance on scientific assessments and a balanced approach. That is the approach that should be taken Tasmania. The shadow Minister for environment in this place, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr ChaWe really must get away from the confrontationist approach that once again is being encourby the former Minister for the Environment, We should be taking advantage of the million worth of expert advice that the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments have and to examine that against other advice which will come from conservationists and has already come from the Australian Museum so that we get the best possible decision for AusIt is simply counter-productive to promote confrontation which seems to be always Senator contribution to these important isSenator Richardson's counterparts in Tasmania are the combined environment groups and they walked away. Their parliamentary representatives are members of the Green Accord. There were some interesting statements, firstly from Dr Brown, who is the leader of the Green Accord movement down there. He said that it was more important than our parliamentary seats that we continue to argue about whether or not there should be any increase in the existing woodchip quota. He said it was not negotiable. The State Minister responsible for forests said he felt that the Green movement had done the State a disservice, and indeed it by putting in jeopardy the forest agreement to be signed today. But the next day, Dr Brown backed his card a little and softened his comments. He said, 'None of us wants to see this historic arrangement we are in fall at this hurdle'. Interestingly, the person who has been the creation of the media in Tasmania, Mrs Christine Milne, who was born out of the dispute over the Wesley Vale mill, said yesterday that if the accord led to an election because the Government unilaterally increased the woodchip quota then, 'So be it'. So we may well have an election. Let me assure the Australian Labor Party that, if we do, the Liberal Party in Tasmania, led by Robin Gray, will absolutely romp it in. The Labor Party got into bed with the Greens and now it is being bitten by the Greens, who have delivered nothing for Tasmania but uncertainty and a rapid decline in the economic fortunes of our State. There is another interesting statement, although it may have been a misreport, from the Wilderness Society's spokesman, Mr Alec Marr. He said its members felt they might be better off with the Liberal Party rather than the Labor Party. That just shows how confusing things can get. But let me assure Mr Marr and others that if their approach to very important agreements such as the one that we are seeing signed today is to walk out after this historic agreement was nearly reached, none of us really wants to have much to do with them. There was also a report that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Groom, who had an advance copy of the report that is being released today, had described it as a waste of the $2.Sm which was poured into the effort. I do not think I can agree with that. However, I would not know whether the report was accurate or not. In my opinion, taking the longer term view, as I think we must in this place, this agreement needs to be maintained. It is something that the Green movement ought to accept. I think it will be embarrassed that, all the other players in the industry having reached this agreement has, with good faith and goodwill and an eye to the future and the economic development of places such as Tasmania, it puts itself in a position of being the odd one out. It will find that the broad community support-and there is broad community support-for the development of a sensitive, balanced approach to forestry development in my State is not behind the Greens when they take these precipitative fanatical positions, and I believe that they will now lose support. I say again that if there is an election in Tasmania because of this the Liberal Party will win it and regain government because it offers certainty, it offers balanced economic development and, above all, it offers government with people that have a clear vision as to where they want the State of Tasmania to go. That is certainly not the case with the State Labor Party, which is now obviously very confused. It has sold its soul to the Green movement and today it reaps its rewards.",58

70,Dr CATLEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish to grieve about an issue which is of great importance to me and many of my friends and constituents in Adelaide; that is, the great need for a special treatment service for the victims of torture and trauma in South Australia. In the last 10 years there has been a growing recognition that the victims of torture and trauma require specialist treatment services. Unfortunately, many doctors and other welfare workers are unable to identify the effects trauma, despite trauma being able source of disability and suffering. These barriers to effective treatment cur despite the fact that many of these people are Australian citizens. This emplifies the even greater barrier to the victims of torture, who often have the added difficulties of cultural differences and language preventing them from havof ing access to suitable medical services. Victims are also often hesitant to be treated by government officials. Torture victims are often burned or sustain severe facial injuries which quire plastic surgical correction. The traction or breaking of teeth during beatings requires specialist dental and thodontic care. The burning and whipping of feet may require a podiatrist's attention or specific orthopaedic help. The need for a specific service has been recognised in New South Wales, where the Health treatment Commission provides an annual budget in the order of $400,000, and similar grants have been made in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. In Australia we have no service of this napropose ture, although there is obviously a pressing need for one. The victims of torture chologists and support doctors suffer from a number of ongoing health problems, among which the most widespread is probably the need for treatment of the psychological consequences of being tortured. One friend of mine, for examernments. ple, was tortured 15 years ago but could describe his problems, even to me, only this year. From 1983 to 1988, the last period for which I could obtain figures, 5,102 refuelse. gees arrived in South Australia, and many of them have settled in my seat. Generally accepted estimates would suggest that per cent of these people have been the victims of torture, suggesting that in the order of 500 people in South Australia are in need of assistance. However, New South Wales the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, which assists those Australia already who are applying for refugee status, reports that, in the first 200 cases that .it handled, 60 per cent claimed to have been tortured. So the figure may be much higher than 500, and of my own personal estimate would double a consideror triple that figure. I have been approached by a number ocof doctors and community workers who have recognised this need and I have also extalked to victims who have survived the ordeals of the war and torture in various totalitarian regimes. They come from all continents and they come from all sides the political spectrum: from Chile, my friend Jorge, who was nearly killed in the football stadium; from Indo-China, another friend, Son Tran, who spent five years in a re-education camp and finally releft by boat; and from Africa, George, exwhose entire family was killed and who is now, this very day, wandering around ortraumatised in a psychiatric hospital. During Refugee Week in Adelaide earlier this year a proposal was developed by a steering committee for the service of the and rehabilitation of torture and trauma victims. It included doctors MCFarlane and Ashby, Rev Chittleborough, Kevin Liston, Joe Leung, Sister South Mary-Anne Loughry and others. They to establish a service to operate independently with a liaison officer, a social worker, volunteer staff at and psya cost of about $140,000 a year. I believe that this problem should be addressed by both Federal and State govWe all recognise that settlement services assist our migration program for those people who come from around the world to settle here. I believe that this is as true of refugees as it is of anyone As these services are being provided elsewhere in the country, I believe that we should give particular attention to the 10 establishment of services in South Australia, where the need is so evident.",60

72,Mr RONALDSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to advise the House of the unacceptable delays that are taking place in the acquisition of a site for the proposed Commonwealth offices in Ballarat. Discussions have been taking place in relation to this matter since February, yet there is still no decision. The Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, is to be briefed shortly and I request his urgent attention to this matter. The City of Ballarat, like other regional centres, is suffering dramatically under the policies of this Government and, quite frankly, the sort of building proposal that the Commonwealth site would· bring to the city would be of enormous benefit. There are other projects that revolve around this Commonwealth site, including a proposed bus terminal. I request that the Minister address this matter very urgently. The other matter I would like to address is the performance of the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the House this week. Michelle Grattan commented today that even before yesterday's extraordinary performance the Treasurer has not had much of a parliamentary week. I would have thought that was a gross understatement. Indeed, if, this is what we have to look forward to after the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gives it away in February or March next year, heaven help .us. It has been a totally incompetent performance by the Acting Prime Minister. He really should be ashamed of what he has done in the House this week. I would say that Mr Beazley's-",62

74,Mr OKEEFE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to draw the attention of the House to the absurd campaign being conducted by people who oppose Australia's signing of the United Nations (UN) Declaration of the Rights of the Child. I have had representations from constituents in towns as far apart as Melton, Bacchus Marsh, Macedon, Kyneton and Daylesford on this matter. It should be understood that the UN convention is an important step in advancing the rights and well-being of children all over the world. It is supported by the Catholic Church, the Anglican and Uniting churches and a host of national and international community groups too numerous to cover in this brief statement. Whilst it is fair enough that members of the Hquse are called upon to explain the actions of the Parliament, and I am quite happy to be accountable on this at any time, it.is totally unhelpful for anyone, including the children of the world, to have fervent and - pecial interest groups conducting a totally distorted campaign based on selective reading and misinterpretation of the facts and the intent of the convention. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has prepared a comprehensive kit of information for anyone who wishes to examine the facts of this matter. I can only suggest that anyone who may be interested should contact the Minister's office for this kit. I am sure that they will be satisfied and will then in turn have very good reason to question the motives and credibility of those who are conducting this campaign.",62
75,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Lord Mayor of Brisbane,62
76,Mr BRADFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On Tuesday night the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) made a scathing attack on the Liberal Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Sallyanne Atkinson. It is not difficult to guess the motivation behind this with local government elections in Queensland due early next year and Labor, yet again, facing certain defeat in the polls in Brisbane, both at lord mayoral and council levels. I can appreciate the frustration of the Australian Labor Party in Brisbane. It does not have a credible candidate for lord mayor. However, I cannot believe that the honourable member for Brisbane had the audacity to criticise Lord Mayor Atkinson's trip to Tokyo to assist in Melbourne l s Olympic bid. This is a trip that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Premier of Victoria made and I would have thought that the Labor Party would have appreciated the support of one of Australia's most popular politicians. I hasten to point out that this trip was not paid for by the ratepayers of Brisbane but by the Olympic Committee which obviously recognised the talents of the Lord Mayor and asked her to assist. In the last six years the cost of Sallyanne Atkinson's travel in her role as Lord Mayor of Brisbane has been the sum of only $60,000-that is, $60,000 for the kind of international profile that Brisbane now enjoys and other cities can only envy. I assume that the honourable member for Brisbane disagrees that the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Sallyanne Atkinson, has actually put Brisbane on the map of the world, which I applaud. The honourable member for Brisbane can grumble all he wants, but the Lord Mayor we have in Brisbane is the best thing that has ever happened to Brisbane and she should be re-elected next year on a landslide. Australian Football League: South Australian Team",62
77,Dr CATLEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to congratulate the Australian Football League on its great wisdom in finally.admitting a South Australian team to the Australian Football League, and I am sorry that Richmond could not see fit to make the vote unanimous. Unfortunately, this team will play at Football Park, which is in the seat of Port Adelaide, but nonetheless it is going to be suitably named. to be named Adelaide, which is the proper name for what will be the leading football team in the Australian Football League. I trust that we will have a decent Although the front runners at present are coming from these coastal areas of Port Adelaide and Glenelg, I know that Mickey Noonan from the finest football club in the country-that is, North Adelaide-will eventually get the guernsey. The players will be very good because, of course, they will all be South Australians delighted to come back from the vagaries of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria to a decent climate and decent cuisine. I will be joining this club as soon as it is formed, and I know that we will give the existing Australian Football League teams a good run for their money. We intend to do the same with the Australian Football League as the Canberra team has done to the Rugby League competition in New South Wales---lhat is, dominate it and rub out the opposition. This is a good first step in the direction of Adelaide being placed where it should be-the premier sporting city in this country with the Commonwealth Games to come.

83,Dr CATLEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It is vital that the people of this city know that the Commonwealth Games will next be held in the fine city of Adelaide. Let me itemise some of the facilities that we have available. We have a tremendous swimming facility-an aquatic centre-in the North Adelaide parklands, which has enormous parking facilities for everybody who wishes to visit. We have a new entertainment centre which is, unfortunately, slightly outside my seat, but I had the good fortune to open a bridge that goes over the boundary, which· IS a railway line, at a cost of $17. Sm. This has delighted the motorists of Adelaide and now gives them greater access to the Entertainment Centre, which we will be able to use in conjunction with the Commonwealth Games. We also have a fine hockey stadium in the seat of Makin, also held by Labor. We intend to build an Olympic-type village right in the heart of the seat of Adelaide, where thousands of athletes from all over the world will be able to enjoy the fine facilities of the greatest metropolitan area in this country. The facilities will then be able to be handed over to new residents of the seat of Adelaide, many of whom will be able to work in the multifunction polis which, as you know, Mr Speaker, is the envy of the civilised world. We also have some running tracks, which are again, unfortunately, in Liberal-held territory-I think in the seat of Sturt. The athletics will undertaken at the Football Park, where the winning Australian Football League team of next year, the team from Adelaide called Adelaide, will be holding its headquarters. Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Children's Programs",63
84,Mrs GALLUS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Let me start off' by congratulating the honourable member for Adelaide on his excellent exposition of the qualities of Adelaide. fortunately, he did not mention the beautiful beaches in Hawker, where perhaps we can have the iron woman competition for the next Olympic Games. Let me draw attention to a recent decision by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) to cut out certain children's programs from its schedule. I have received several letters from my constituents and from schools in my electorate expressing their disappointment at this decision. I shall read out the names of the four programs that have been cut. They are Tickle Pot, Sing Ninety, Let's Join In and Follow That Song. The musical programs are especially missed in the schools as they cannot provide the musical instruments themselves to give backing for the children who need this sort of musical education. It is interesting that the ABC justifies this in a letter by saying that Sesame Street is still available for children. I point out that Sesame Street is an American program and that these were Australian made programs. I think this is an absolute disgrace. Further to that, if the ABC has the money to extend the JJJ network throughout Australia it should also have the money to look after the small children who need this sort of educational material. Social Security",64
85,Mr SCIACCA,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to talk about something that is a little more serious than football teams and so on, much as I know that that is dearest to the heart of some colleagues from Adelaide. I want to talk about some of the changes that we have made lately to the social be security system, with respect to deeming of incomes, and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. One thing that really riles me in this Parliament is seeing honourable members opposite, who know that there is nothing wrong with these changes, not taking the serious attitude of going around and trying to stop the confusion that is out there-and which I admit is out there. amongst the aged community-and letting people know that there is nothing for Un- them to worry about in terms of these changes. Instead of the Opposition members trying to keep confusing people and adding to the confusion, scaremongering and letting· them think that there is something happening to them that in fact is not happening to them, I invite them to do the right thing by their constituents and the pensioner community of Australia by explaining to them that none of this is going to hurt them. Everyone knows that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme changes are good in the sense that they will make sure the security of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will not be put in jeopardy in the future.

92,Mr OKEEFE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,I want to touch briefly on something unfortunate that happened in Parliament this morning and that occurred during the discussion of the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority. During the whole process Government members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority were at great pains to ensure that there has been no mention of individuals in relation to the activities or investigations of the Authority. This morning a member of the Opposition-I make it clear that it was a member of the Opposition-introduced the name of Mr John Elliott in this Parliament in reference to the Authority's work on money laundering. Before anything further is said in this Parliament that covers this-and I believe that more will be said-it wants to be well understood that it was a member of the Opposition who introduced Mr Elliott's name in reference to this matter in the Parliament this morning. Infrastructure,65

Social justice takes many forms and in Victoria in our growth corridors, which include the electorate of Corinella, over the next 10 years we are going to need some $15 billion to develop the infrastructure that is needed for each household in these new areas. It will cost $50,000 per block for these new people to go there and live-some $60,000 or $70,000 in the future, just in my area.",65

100,Mr HULLS,SUGAR EXPORTS,My question is directed to the Minister for Trade Negotiations. Will he inform honourable members whether the new sugar imports regime thorised by the United States Administration last Friday provides substantial liberalisation of the US sugar market?,66
101,Dr BLEWETT,SUGAR EXPORTS,"I recognise the interest of the honourable member for Kennedy in the sugar program in the United States. With him I share very much the disappointment at the results of last week's decision. Honourable members will recall that Australia successfully challenged the United States system of sugar import quotas in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) arena last year and the United States was forced to look at its system in relation to sugar. The United States has now announced the introduction of a new regime, a tariff quota regime, to replace the system which was found to be GATT inconsistent. Under the tariff quota regime approved President Bush last Friday imports of an annually variable quota will enter the United States at duty rates of 0.625c per pound, but amounts in excess of that quota will be subjected to a prohibitive tariff of 16c per pound. I regret to say to us this seems to be simply replacing one form of protectionism with another. It is simply a sleight of hand and the new regime will produce the same practical effect as the -.:xisting GATT-illeThe quota for 1991 has been set at 1.725 million tonnes of which 137,710 tonnes have been allocated to Australia. The Government has conveyed to the United States its disappointment at this We see it as simply a cosmetic one which fails to guarantee substantial ongoing improvement in access to the United States market. It is particularly I reunfortunate that the United States has chosen to defend a trade distorting policy whelil we are trying so hard to reduce the barners of trade for the Uruguay Round. We are now waiting for the outcome of the 1990 Farm Bill, to assess the full impact of the tariff quota regime on Australian interests and whether the new regime will be fully consistent with the GATT obligations of the United States. The Australian Government will continue to press strongly for a more market oriented auUnited States sugar program. The evidence of the change is that Australian exports of sugar to the United States have fallen from 811,000 tonnes in 1981, before quotas were introduced, to 137,700 tonnes for 1990-91. It is estimated that the cost of the US sugar policy to Australia will be between $123m and $313m a year. NA",66

103,Mr REITH,PRIVATISATION,"I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the vote taken last evening in the Senate when the Labor Party senators voted with the Australian Democrats against an urgency motion, which stated: That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency: In view of the fundamental importance for the national interest of micro-economic reform, and noting that improved efficiency and greater competition elements of such reform, the need for the Senate to endorse the selling of shares in the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and Australian Airlines. I ask the Acting Prime Minister why the Labor Party senators voted against this motion when it reflects accurately the policy decided upon by Cabinet and that which is being put to the Australian Labor Party special national conference on Monday. Has the Government changed its policy on assets sales, or is this the case of a party that cannot govern itself cannot govern the country?",67
104,Mr KEATING,PRIVATISATION,"It is a party which does not respond to stunts by the coalition. It is not about a party that cannot govern itself. The Labor Party has a process where policy is considered. Opposition members are spectators to that process because it is a public one, and Opposition members will be spectators next Monday. This is the only mass party in Australia-the only real political party in the country. It is not a private outfit like the Opposition. It is a full, living, breathing, mass party. It has public processes. Why should Labor senators respond to stunts by the coalition to try to make them pre-empt a position? Mr Reith-It is not a stunt.",67
105,Mr KEATING,PRIVATISATION,"Some of the Opposition's performers certainly have been involved in stunts. The Opposition seeks to have Labor senators pre-empt a debate which will ensue in our Party. Once our Party has made decisions on some of those issues, the matters are then brought properly by the Cabinet to the Caucus and then, when the Caucus adopts positions, I am quite certain that many Caucus members in the Senate will feel completely relaxed about responding to some of these issues. Mr Smith-Do you mean they are not relaxed now?",67
106,Mr KEATING,PRIVATISATION,"They would certainly not be relaxed about responding to the Opposition's stunts. If the Opposition gets serious about the national issues facing the country and about the gravity of those issues, that is fine; but Opposition memmajor bers ate basically stunt merchants and that is why they are still over there nearly a are key decade on. When are Opposition members going to wake up to themselves? NA",67
107,Mr ONEIL,STEEL INDUSTRY,"As the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce is aware, my electorate includes the steel city of Whyalla. Is the Minister· aware of recent comments concerning the asserted poor performance of the steel industry? Is he able to assure the House and my electorate that this industry, which is important to the national economy, is not in trouble?",67
108,Mr CREAN,STEEL INDUSTRY,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know of his strong commitment to this industry not only as a representative of it now, but also as a former employee. In fact, during the recent election campaign I had the opportunity to campaign with himin sections of the industry in Whyalla. I thank him for the opportunity to correct what, I think, was a quite distorted statement that was made the other day by the honourable member for Warringah. In relation to the Australian steel industry, amongst other things, the honourable member stated: All of the evidence at my disposal suggests that the Government's steel industry plan, the industry itself and its work force failed to identify achieve the real targets necessary to make BHP a viable operation by international standards. That was part of what he said. That type of statement was appropriate in 1983 when this Government came to power because at that time the steel industry was facing a situation in which the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) had said that it was considering withdrawing from the domestic steel industry. It canvassed a number of options, including the closure of Whyalla and Newcastle. That was our inheritance from the previous Government's approach to the steel industry. By comparison, when this Government came to power in 1983 it developed a plan, an industry development strategy, for the steel industry. The plan operated between 1983 and 1988, but it did not have to be maintained because the industry became self-sufficient and self-motivated in its continuation. We saw five years of a very successful building block for the future direction and future solidi. fication of this industry. The honourable member for Warringah in his statement went so far as to say ' ... and all of the evidence at my disposal suggests .. .'. Let me give him some of the evidence that refutes his assertion that the industry has gone backwards and is not able to compete by international standards. The major object of this Government's steel industry plan was to ensure a 'viable and internationally competitive steel industry in Australia, capable of providing competitively priced steel to downstream users and job security for the industry's employees'. I list the tasks that were set for the plan and its achievements. In terms of investment, since 1983 BHP has invested $2.5 billion in the steel industry and I am reliably advised a further $1 billion of investment will be undertaken. In terms of achieving efficiency, BHP is now the third lowest cost producer of steel world. In terms of productivity, the unit tonnes per employee per year has risen from 180 under the previous Government's administration in 1983 to more than 400. That is a 125 per cent increase. In terms of research and development, we and have seen significant expenditure by BHP, to the extent where last year this increased to $40m. BHP now has 0.7 per cent of its sales invested in research and development and that is the reason it is putting new products on the market. Some 14 new steel building products were released on to international markets last year. Industrial disputes have been reduced-they are only one-eighth the level that existed back in the period of the Liberal Government. By far the most important direction of the Hawke Government's strategy is in relation to exports. The first quarter figures in the steel industry released yesterday showed that there had been a doubling of steel exports this year compared with last year. In the first quarter we have had over half a million tonnes in orders compared with only $800,000 of exports for the whole of 1983-84. Exports now represent one-third of production compared with one-sixth of production under the Fraser Government. The plan is a significant success in terms of the basic direction of industry, the direction in which we have to get industry going, competing in international markets and increasing exports. By all those standards the steel industry, and BHP in particular, has made significant progress. It has done so because this Government has provided support and an environment in which to operate which conservative-controlled governments could not provide. If that situation continues, the steel industry has a great future. I can tell the honourable member for Grey that as long as this strategy continues-and it will under our regime-his people can be assured of a very solid future. NA NA",67
109,Mr SHARP,AUTHORITY,"Does the Minister for in the Land Transport stand by the Government's decision not to locate the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) in Newcastle or does he still maintain the position outlined in a statement he made following the Government's decision last week that 'it is outrageous'? He also said, 'If AMSA is to stay in Canberra it will serve no useful purpose'. Does the Minister stand by his own statements or. by the decision of the Government?",68

111,Mrs CROSIO,PETROL PRICES,"I refer the Minister for Resources to an article that appeared today's Australian newspaper headed Tax low on world scale'. I should like to ask the Minister: are the claims made in this particular article accurate? Even if Australian petrol prices are low by world standards, what strategies are available to Australian motorists to cushion the impact of the recent rise in petrol prices brought about by the Gulf crisis?",69
112,Mr GRIFFITHS,PETROL PRICES,"I did see today's article in the Australian, which has been reflected in other media coverage of these issues. I will go very briefly to my comments earlier this week to simply reinforce the inherent accuracy of the article-that is, that Australia's petrol prices are amongst the lowest in the world and that Government taxes on petrol are considerably lower than most of the 20 International Energy Agency countries. Indeed, the most contemporary figures are lower than I indicated for the June quarter. The most recent indications are that they are running in Australia today at 40 per cent. The latest figures for September, for example, show that while Australian consumers are paying around 74c a litre for petrol, in Italy consumers are paying $1.62 a litre for petrol and in the United Kingdom, $l.12 and so on. Having said that, I am aware, of course, of the recent increases in petrol prices Australian motorists brought about as a result of the Gulf crisis. As I think many honourable members will be aware, .earlier this year, I launched the 1990 edition of the Australian Fuel Consumption Guide New Car Buyers. The demand for that particular guide has significantly outstripped supply. In the past, it has been disseminated to about 400,000 Australians. This year because of that increased demand it is proposed to have an extra production run. We anticipate a minimum of 550,000 booklets to be released. The key point I want to make here on the question asked by the honourable member for Prospect is how driving habits can markedly impact upon fuel consumption. The guide, with which I think honourable members have been circulated; is a very comprehensive document. It goes to the particular fuel efficiency qualities of a range of motor vehicles on sale in Australia. But more particularly, and probably more importantly, it goes to how motorists can significantly reduce both the quantity of fuel that they consume and, by definition, the amount they pay in after-tax income for their petroleum. I hope honourable members will-not only read the booklet but also disseminate it as much as they can throughout their electorates. It indicates that the savings can be of the order of 37 per cent simply by driving a little more cautiously, and that of course has spin-off effects not only in overall fuel consumption savings; it also impacts on our current account and it has very important implications for safety.

113,Mr LLOYD,AIRPORT,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Communications. I refer the Minister to Cabinet's decision to proceed with the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport subject to a satisfactory environmental impact study (EIS). I refer the Minister also to a joint press release today from the honourable member for Grayndler, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith,. for the honourable member for Barton, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Senator Faulkner that these Labor members of parliament have rejected the proposal for a third runway following the release yesterday of the EIS. I ask the Minister to confirm to the House that the third runway at Sydney airport will proceed, provided that the EIS is regarded as satisfactory. I also ask the Minister whether the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services is bound by Cabinet solidarity. I finally ask the Minister to assure the House that the period for community consultation on the EIS will not be extended beyond three months. Mr Smith-And it is not out of order.",69
114,Mr BEAZLEY,AIRPORT,"The question may not be out of order, but it is misdirected. As it happens, the question of the public handling of the EIS is the responsibility of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories not the Minister for Transport and Communications. We made it quite clear when the EIS was submitted for analysis and examination, that as far as we were concerned the third runway would proceed subject to a satisfactory outcome on the EIS. The EIS is now available for public comment. On the question of its satisfactory ture and its implications, all members of parliament on both sides of the House, including this side of the House, are quite entitled to make submissions to that consultative process and at the end of that period of time there will be a response to it.

115,Mr WALKER,CORPORATE CRIME,I direct my question to the Attorney-General. What action is the Government taking to rid this country of the corporate spivs who have done so much harm to Australia's economy and image?,70
116,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATE CRIME,"I thank. the honourable member for his question without notice. In relation to the position in respect of corporate crime in this country, I think the honourable member, quite obviously, is expressing the entirely justified concern about the corporate collapses over the period, particularly over the last couple of years, which have had a devastating effect not only domestically, but also internationally. I think that the single most important aspect that was the fact that we had to have a single regulator in the companies area. Quite clearly, the cooperative scheme which operated under the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) with the Commonwealth and the States was not a success. It was a scheme which was under funded and, in fact, was unable to cope with the corporate behaviour referred to by the honourable member. As from 1 January next year, we will have the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) as a single corporate regulator and the legislation in respect of that body will be coming into this House in the next few weeks. In respect of funding for that organisation, on the appropriations for the Attorney-General's Department yesterday this matter was raised by various members from the other side of the House, in particular, the honourable member for Higgins. The funding for the ASC next year will be in the order of $107m and there are massive increases in funding in the area of regulating corporations in this na- country. I think it should be said that there have been a lot of late converts to the Australian Securities Commission, but better to have them on board late rather than never. I look forward to the support of those opposite in relation to the establishment of the Australian Securities Commission, which will in a very large way meet the problems referred to by the honourable member for Robertson.

117,Mr REITH,NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he agrees with the statement issued last night by Mr Nobby Clark, Managing Director of the National Australia Bank (NAB) and Banker of the Year in 1986, that 'the National Australia Savings Bank has never been and is not insolvent'. If so, will he withdraw the allegations that he made yesterday that 'Nobby's savings bank went insolvent in 1986'?",70
118,Mr KEATING,NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK,"Nobby Clark has a few problems; one of them is not needing to be defended by the Acting Leader of the Opposition. He has not sunk that low. If we are getting technical, I am prepared to accept Nobby Clark's assurance that in 1986 his savings bank was not technically insolvent. He must accept my claim that had the Government not introduced a $120m subsidy and deregulated the rate on all future loans his savings bank book would have needed to have been liquidated as it was unviable. Nobby Clark and I are old sparring partners and, as the public record will attest, he often sends a barb my way. He knows full well that I would never let him off the hook when he trips up, and he would expect nothing less, I am sure. While Nobby Clark does run an effective bank he did trip up in 1986 and this was well-known in the industry. In 1986 Mr Clark created problems for himself and his savings bank because of a deliberate management strategy of his, and that is what I was talking about yesterday. It was not about the technical issue of solvency, but the fact is that he had an unviable bank book-",70

123,Mr KEATING,NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK,He deliberately boosted lending for housing in 1984-85 in an aggressive bid for market share. This was while the 13.5 per cent ceiling was firmly in place. He funded this expansion lending with high cost term deposits. Mr Reith-You should sit down.,71
124,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK,The Acting Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,71
125,Mr KEATING,NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK,He was therefore increasing the risk associated with his savings bank in a major way. His liabilities were becoming more exposed to market interest rates and all his liabilities were at a floating rate and his assets had a fixed ceiling. By early 1986 the floor on Mr Clark's strategy was fully exposed. His term deposits were costing him 15 to 15 11z per cent while his housing loan assets were earning 13 1/2 per cent.,71
126,Mr HOWARD,NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK,Because of your policies.,71

130,Mr KEATING,NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK,Mr Clark's savings bank was losing money.,71
131,Mr HOWARD,NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK,It was because of your deregulation. .,71
132,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK,"I warn the honourable member for Bennelong. Mr'KEATING-Obviously his savings bank was losing money, a point he now concedes himself. The inescapable conclusion is that without the Government's subsidy of $120m announced on 2 April 1986 and of which NAB's share was $22m, Mr Clark's savings bank was not viable and he would have needed to liquidate his savings bank book. All the banks had problems with housing lending during early 1986 but with the deregulation of new loans for housing on 2 April 1986 the major banks would have continued with housing lending. NAB's problems were much greater and were due to the earlier lending strategy of 1984-85. As I have said, this was well known in the industry at the time. It was only for the Government's housing assistance package involving the subsidies to the savings banks announced on 2 April which enabled NAB's savings bank to continue to expand and enabled all the savings banks to rapidly take advantage of the deregulation of new housing lending while protecting existing mortgage holders. The fact is that if Mr Clark wants to make points about people tripping up he should not make them when he exposed his own institution to this strategic mistake for which he was rescued by the Commonwealth Government.

133,Mr GIBSON,AGED CARE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services. With the Government's reform of the aged care program currently in its advanced stages, what is the Minister doing to ensure that these changes in reforms will be extended to those older and disabled people in our community not living in residential care?",72
134,Mr STAPLES,AGED CARE,"I would like to thank the honourable member for his question and in doing so recognise the role that he is playing in his own electorate in looking after people who are frail, aged and disThat abled. I have had the opportunity to there on a number of occasions. This is a very important week for frail aged and younger disabled people our community who use a lot of governcally ment services such as the home and munity care program and the nursing homes and hostels of Australia. We have seen the release of a charter of rights and responsibilities for the dents of nursing homes and hostels. Toand day I had the great pleasure of launching a statement of rights and responsibilities for the home and community care every (HACC) program for the people that the honourable member for Moreton was resibilities ferring to. That will enable the functionwith ally disabled of any age to remain in their homes rather than suffer premature entry to institutions and at the same time give them and the people who serve them in statement. the community generally a far better idea of what it means to be in that situation. It also gives the aged and disabled access to basic rights and the ability to have those rights and responsibilities respected. The home and community care prohave gram is an innovation of this GovernThrough ment, as you know only too well, Mr Speaker. Your report In At Home or At Home: Accommodation and Care for the Aged was a landmark report and, along with the work that you and many people on both sides of the House did, it the Government the d.irection for reform of aged care and disabled services in this country. ' r e m o t e areas. This Government's commitment to the program obviously cannot be doubted. Since its introduction, expenditure has more than trebled, to an estimated$282m this year. But more than in just dollar terms, we have seen a tremendous expansion in the range of services that are now available in the community. The number of services has about doubled since 1984-85 and the range of those services has also expanded greatly. There are now 369 day care centres operating in this country, which means that about two day care centres for the frail and disabled have been opening in this country every week. is something that most people would be certainly not be aware of. About 47 of those centres cater specifically for dementia sufferers and as well there are about the 180 non-centre based respite services. in About 200 HACC services cater specififor people from non-English speakcoming backgrounds including Aborigines. No-one knows better the difference between a good service and an unsuitable one than the person who has to use that r-si­ service. The HACC statement of rights responsibilities has tremendous significance for the 300,000 elderly and younger people who use these services month, as well as their carers. The statement outlines the rights and responof consumers in their dealings the service providers. Of course, the State and Territory governments have cooperated greatly with the Government in the service and in the formulation of the Those on the other side of the chamber are getting restless. Perhaps I could basically settle them down a little bit. In Australia there should be some respect for the way in which both sides of this House contributed towards the reforms. your committee, Mr Speaker, and . through the work in this House we have seen many changes occurring in the aged care reform program, particularly to cater for the needs of our ageing population. People now have choices in home and gave community care, hostels and nursing homes, and places such as multipurpose centres for those people in more rural and This has been a very significant area social as well as micro-economic reform. It is an area of micro-economic reform because the billions of dollars that go through these programs hit the ground and we get the best value for each dollar. What these statements will do in the home and community care program, as will charter of rights and responsibilities of housing rates. residents of nursing homes and hostels, is make sure that we provide quality dollars that hit the ground as well.

136,Mr KEATING,BANKING,"Mr Speaker, I did not. yesterday! In fact, yesterday I reminded honourable members opposite that I was doing in 1986 for Mr Clark what I did for the State Savings Bank of Victoria in 1990. That what I was doing. Mr Clark has been preening himself banker of the year and touting the fact skin. that he receives the highest earnings per ""employee, and all the other measures of success in banking. I did not then take too kindly to the fact that Mr Clark, from his pedestal, attacked the management economic policy, when, in fact, he had left his bank exposed to the position where his book was not viable. I made that point about a condition that applied four years ago. That has nothing to do with the contemporary banking system. Need I say, had I not secured Government support to introduce a subsidy and deregulate housing rates the future, there would have been a lot less lending for housing in the last four of years. At that time lending for housing had declined to a figure approaching 105,000 building commencements, the figure this Government inherited in 1983. Commencements then shot up and last year reached, from memory, a figure of 180,000-odd. We would not have had that the condition without the deregulation of In the face of foreign bank entry and being positioned in the market, Mr Clark and his bank made a strategic decision to lend aggressively for housing, but financed on these trading bank-type instruThen, as monetary conditions tightened, they had to finance their book with fixed rate mortgages at rates of interest higher than the prevailing lending rate, which made the strategy, of course, and the book, unviable.

Is the Minister able to explain why, since the Australian Wool for Corporation decided to intervene in this marketplace, carpet wools are now being stockpiled, that carpet manufacturers are being forced, because of the excessive price through the Wool Corporation, to import wools into Australia, and that the processors who added value to that industry are now closing down?",73
140,Mr KERIN,CARPET WOOLS,"I thank the honourable member for his question. He takes a close interest in the carpet wool industry, particularly that part of the industry in his electorate. The honourable member has highlighted quite a significant problem. I will address the first part of his question, that is, that carpet wool growers are currently seeking an exemption from all or part of the wool tax. That is required by legislation to be paid on all shorn wool, including medullated and other coarse wools suitable for carpet manufacturers. The carpet wool growers made representations seeking exemption from the price support component of the wool tax because they believe the current 18 per cent tax particularly affects them. Carpet wools are bought scoured and blended by the carpet manufacturers, rather than in greasy form. Carpet wool growers have established their own cooperatives to undertake these processes and prepare their wool for the Australian market. They support these co-ops through a 6 per cent voluntary levy. They are currently paying 24 per cent in taxes and levies on wool of about $2.50 to $3 dollars a kilo value. Some 90 per cent of the carpet wool used in Australia is imported so, as the honourable member for Corio points out, Australian grown carpet wool is import-replacing. The Wool Council of Australia passed a resolution at Roma in May of this year that the Wool Corporation investigate tax exemption for carpet wool. Both the Wool Council and the Wool Corporation have now advised me that they do not support exemption of carpet wool on the grounds that exemptions result in inequities at the margin. That is, why shoqld we give any particular treatment to one grade of wool? It is inappropriate to distinguish wools on grounds of end use and any exemption would create an undesirable precedent. This issue is complex and obviously there are implications for wool marketing arrangements in general. I have spent five hours in a cQnference this morning addressing those arrangements. I can tell the honourable member that I am giving close consideration to the cases put forward by the carpet wool growers, the Wool Council and the Corporation and anticipate being in a position to make some decisions over the next month or so. In terms of the Wool Corporation's own activities in scouring wool to store this coarse wool and in terms of its general approach to the carpet industry, that is something also that I am having discussions with it about. I believe that there is a case to say that the carpet wool industry should be off to one side of this industry and, again, that is something I am looking at. NA",74
141,Mr REITH,NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK,"I refer the Acting Prime Minister to his answer to my last question and his failure to confirm his statement of yesterday that in 1986 the National Australia Bank was insolvent. I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he now admits that he misled the Parliament yes. terday, and whether he will give a formal and fulsome apology to Mr Clark.",74
142,Mr KEATING,NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK,"I doubt that Mr Clark would think that the Acting Leader of the Opposition would be doing him any favour beating this particular drum. I regard Mr Clark as one of the most competent people in Australian finance and the fact that he slipped up in 1986 only makes him fallible. I doubt in a sort of head to head contest that he would not regard my colleague opposite even as competition-and I would heartily concur. So do not bother defending Nobby's interest. He can do it quite well himself. He is on the radio most days at it. Let me repeat what I said: if we are getting technical, I am prepared to accept Mr Clark's assurance that his savings bank was not technically insolvent, but he must accept my claim that his book was un viable and was in need of liquidation. So there. It is as simple as that. NA",74
143,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TELEVISION,I direct my question to the Minister for Transport and Communications. The Minister will have been briefed on the financial problems of the Channel 10 television network-Mr Costello-He has been doing much better than the other bloke.,75
144,Mr SPEAKER,TELEVISION,Order! The member for Higgins.,75
145,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TELEVISION,"And of much speculation in relation to the future of the television industry which has arisen as a result. I ask, firstly, will the Government support the watering down of television standards and Australian content requirements, as has been requested by some media executives; and, secondly, will the Government act to ensure the continuation of the third television network within approved standards?",75
146,Mr BEAZLEY,TELEVISION,"The Government's policy has been clear cut on the issue of ownership and numbers of services to be provided in each region. Last week that position was reiterated. We support the provision of three commercial services in each region; we support those commercial services operating comprehensive services; we, of course, support the standards laid down by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal on content and other related issues; and we support the ownership provisions, which ensure that there is only one owner in each particular region with, of course, a capacity to own services across regions. That has been the Government's policy for some considerable time. That remains our policy, and the Government continually advises the industry of that fact. It is obvious that a number of these stations are having substantial and severe financial problems at this time. That position is a result of investment decisions made by those stations within the framework of the regulatory opportunities that the Government provides. It is not the Government's responsibility to micromanage the way in which the management of those particular stations and their owners conduct their financial affairs. It is the Government's responsibility to make statements about what policy is and to introduce legislation to ensure that that policy is upheld. That we have done and will continue to do. NA NA",75
147,Mr DAWKINS,ADMINISTRATION CHARGE,"Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to add to an answer I gave earlier.",75
148,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION CHARGE,The Minister may add to the answer.,75
149,Mr DAWKINS,ADMINISTRATION CHARGE,"I wish to provide a further answer in relation to a question without notice asked of me by the honourable member for O'Connor on 21 December 1989. The honourable member asked a question relating to the administration of the higher education administration charge in which he alleged that my wife had received preferential treatment in receiving a refund of HEAC following her withdrawal from a course at Murdoch University. He specifically asked what influence I exerted to bring about this alleged preferential treatment. I have now received a copy of a letter - rom Murdoch University which unequIvocally exonerates myself and my wife of the impropriety inferred by the honourable member. The letter makes it clear, firstly, that my wife would have incurred a HEAC liability only if she had failed to withdraw from the course before 31 March. Secondly, the relevant university authorities became aware on or about 4 March of my wife's intention not to finalise her enrolment. Thirdly, for administrative convenience, the university authorities backdated the date of effect to 21 February. This backdating had no impact at all on my wife's status at the university or on her fees liability and I had no influence on this matter. The university's letter makes the point that the material on this matter came into the possession of the honourable member and was misinterpreted and that, in particular, my wife's non-liability to pay the HEAC was ignored. Mr Speaker, I table the letter. Now that the honourable member for O'Connor is completely in possession of the facts on this matter and is also aware of the anguish that allegations made under privilege can cause to individuals and their families, he might feel inclined to apologise to my wife. NA NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",75
150,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith: That this House censures the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer for misleading the House and for, abusing the privileges of his office.",76
151,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Is the motion seconded?,76
152,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,I second the motion.,76
153,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER," Mr Speaker, we are quite happy to take the motion forthwith. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion of Censure",76
154,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"I move: That this House censures the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer for misleading the and for abusing the privileges of his office. A censure motion is one of the most grave charges that can be levelled against a Minister in the Parliament. It is not a motion that we move lightly. We do so because we believe that the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Keating) has abused the privileges of his high office and misled the House. To put the facts very simply, yesterday, in response to some pretty standard criticisms of his economic policy, the Treasurer chose to use information supplied to him in his capacity as Treasurer, responsible for the supervision of the banking system, to score a cheap political point. In this process, he has shown no judgment, a reckless disregard for the reputation of our banking system and, for good measure, he was just plain wrong and misled the House. His response today was simply not good enough. Yesterday, at Question Time in this Parliament, in a deliberate and premeditated attack on the National Australia Bank Ltd and Mr Clark, the Treasurer declared, 'In 1986 the bank was technically insolvent'-a black and white allegation, an assertion from a person who has access to information upon which such Orders a statement might reasonably be expected by the public to be relied upon. It is not good enough for the Acting Prime Minister to come into the House Acting today and give honourable members a completely different response, to claim that the bank was technically insolvent. The bases of his defence today were events going back to 1986. Yesterday he claimed that he rescued a savings bank because of the actions of that bank and the extent of its loan book in respect of housing. If one goes back to 1986, where were the statements by the Treasurer that would substantiate his claims of yesterday and his defence of today? In fact, they do not exist. He referred to that statement of 2 April 1986 during Question Time today. If one goes to the first paragraph, where the Treasurer announced the package for the lifting of the ceiling for new home loans, one finds there the reason for the introHouse duction of that package at that time. He said: The Government has today decided on a number of actions to ensure that sufficient bank home loan funds will be available to borrowers so that activity and employment in the housing industry will be maintained at a satisfactory level. Why did the Treasurer do a deal with the banks to provide them with a subsidy for those home owners who were going to have the benefit of the ceiling? For one simple reason, and it was nothing to do with the solvency or viability of the banks: the Treasurer was not prepared to cop the political consequences of his own actions. The Acting Prime Minister had run a cheap· political scare campaign on that very issue against the Opposition and had no political choice but to do what he did. His excuse today is nothing but a hollow and empty one, easily refuted by the evidence of 1986. I look forward to the contribution by the seconder of the motion, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who will ram home that point. The least the Acting Prime Minister could do in his response today would be to admit that he was wrong, to apologise and retract his statements. That would be a mark of this man who aspires to the key to the Lodge. He has had a bad week, and perhaps he can finish it on an up by having the basic common decency to admit that he was wrong. While he is at it, he should admit that he was wrong about his economic policy. The outburst by the Acting Prime Minister yesterday should be viewed in a broader political and economic context. It just did not happen overnight in a vacuum. His economic policies as Treasurer have failed. This is a failed Treasurer-not the world's greatest Treasurer, but in fact Australia's failed Treasurer, and the country is teetering on an economic recession, a recession that the Treasurer has induced. His Budget is an absolute failure. He lost the centrepiece, the micro-economic reform, that he had been brawling about for weeks and months in recent times. On Budget night up and gave a lacklustre performance, if ever I have seen one. Why? Because he had lost his centrepiece, and the substitute centrepiece was to claim fiscal responsibility. That sunk without a trace; the Opposition had the pleasure of firing a couple of torpedoes into that proposition on the night, and Senator Walsh finished the Treasurer off within 48 hours. The Treasurer mighj: have escaped with some credibility if o-the Tuesday night he had had the honesty to say, as he did on the following Friday, that this country is on the road to Argentina. The reason the Treasurer's Budget sank without trace was that it simply did not tell the truth. We have a failed Treasurer; we have an economy in recession; and we do not find coming from the Treasurer the simple admission that it is time for some changes, the admission that his policies have been wrong. In its place we find nothing but a counter-attack based on personal abuse and distortion of the truth. The Treasurer should look at recent events. The Treasurer is very keen on pulling levers. I envisage him in front of a row of levers, say 12 of them, and on each and everyone of those levers is a little sign that says 'out of order, by order of Bill Kelty'. The one lever left is the lever of high interest rates. That high interest rate policy, the one-dimensional high interest rate policy, has placed a lot of pressure on the Acting-the practising-Prime Minister. It is true that decent customers have been burnt by high interest rates in recent months. Many prospective young home owners who are unable to get a home and many not so young people who are trying to run a business have been burnt and they have been going into bankruptcy in record numbers. Who lit the fire that burnt them? None other than the Treasurer. Who 'threw the lit match into the can of petrol? None other than .the Treasurer. It is true that unemployment is rising. In fact it is beyond the Treasurer's own Budget projection of just a few short weeks ago, the reason being that the Treasurer has deliberately induced a recession. He is the boom and bust merchant of Austrahe turned lian economic management. The fact is that his policies have failed. Instead of doing the right thing and simply accepting the responsibility for his own actions, he lashes out at whoever comes near him. He attacked the Reserve Bank of Australia. What was its crime? It merely pointed out that we will have high interest rates while ever there is high inflation. The Treasurer attacked his own colleague and the Government's No.2, Senator Button-when No. 2 drops to No. 3 we know there are problems-and what was his crime? He simply pointed out that we could not look towards a major restructuring of Australian industry when the Treasurer is running a macro-economic policy that is directly contrary to the Government's micro-economic reform objectives. The Business Council of Australia was attacked for pointing out that, regardless of how importanWhe decisions might be on telecommunic<!eons and the sale of the airlines-and they are important-it is nonsense to suggest that they are the be all and end all of economic management, as I am sure the Treasurer will be telling us on Monday night and Tuesday morning. The truth is that a lot has to be done in terms of economic management and the changes that we need in economic policy if we are to turn this country around. Despite the intensity of some of these personal attacks, there is no doubt that the daddy of them all has been the Acting Prime Minister's vitriolic attacks on the banks. It is a standard attack for cornered cowards of the Labor movement to lash out at the banks. It is a campaign laced with envy and reminiscent of many campaigns by Labor campaigners of the past. Jack Lang, the Treasurer's old mentor, was pretty keen on getting stuck into the banks and some of the Labor governments of the post-war years were hell-bent on nationalising them. All of this is intertrue. twined with nothing more important than our practising Prime Minister's prime ministerial ambitions. Do not forget that this a man who said, not so long ago, 'It has been ingrained in me from childhood to think that my mission in life is to run you'.",76
155,Mr NA BROWN,TREASURER,"Who said that? Mr REITH....,...None other than the Treasurer himself. As the Prime Minister sits out a typhoon holding him up in Tokyo, he ought to note that there is a message in all of this for him too. He ought to remember the words quoted to him by the Treasurer in 1980, when he said, 'The first Labor leader I tear down will be the one I replace'. We have a background of failed economic policy and dwindling prospects of the Treasurer entering the Lodge as he has the Minister for Transport and Communications(Mr Beazley) breathing down his neck. All we have are counter-attacks from the Treasurer which revolve around personal abuse. The Treasurer's other favoured tactic is to avoid telling the truth. I am glad that the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) is in the chamber because I think he would accept what I say. The Treasurer is hoodwinking his own people and they are fools enough, most of them, to believe him. For years the Treasurer said that wages had to be reduced so that profits CQuld go up and we could have investments.,,-the old J-curve. The J-curve is five years old this year. The truth is that profits after interest have actually gone down. We have had a lot of pain and no gain. For years the Treasurer has talked about what a great cutter he is and how good he has been at cutting government expenditure. People should look at the figures and look at the truth of the matter. The Treasurer should tell us where he stands. The truth is that the Commonwealth Government is spending as much now, as a percentage of the national cake, as it was when Labor first came into office. The other day the Treasurer had the audacity to claim that spending would be back to the levels of the 1950s. It is not He should deliver his response today. The daddy of them all is that in recent months he has claimed that he knew nothing about the crisis in the State Bank of Victoria until 19 June 1990. I do not know what he knew or when he knew it but I know that he knew a lot more than he has been letting on. He rammed that deal down the throats of his Australian Labor Party colleagues. If he gets something 30 per cent right he will get a 30 per cent credit from us but he should not stoop to deceit and bully his own colleagues. He has been too smart by half. Many of his colleagues know it and the smug inner smile on the face of the Minister for Transport and Communications is evidence of the truth of what I am saying. Yesterday the Acting Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), asked the Treasurer to comment on the remarks of two leading businessmen who had been critical of the Treasurer's economic policy. One was the President-elect of the Business Council of Australia and the other was Mr Nobby Clark, banker of the year in 1986 and Chief Executive of the National Australia Bank, one of Australia's biggest financial institutions. Mr Clark's words were colourful but to the point. He said: If I had the strike rate of and the economy in tatters . . . then I'd be out selling pencils and shoe laces in Collins Street. It was not a vitriolic attack or a personal attack. The Treasurer is the holder of high office and if he thinks those comments were exceptional it just shows how outback of-touch he is; The rest of the country, and large, would agree with Mr Clark. did not say anything that was news. The Treasurer should go door-knocking, the Prime Minister's advice and visit a few supermarkets. Honourable members should look at the expressions on the of people in the gallery. The Treasurer made those remarks last weekend. They were widely reported. no surprise to anybody-and I am sure it . was no surprise to the Treasurer-that"" reasonable during this week the Opposition would will bowl up to him a question on this topic. He was there, ready and waiting to exploit to the maximum the exposure available to him at Question Time to launch his premeditated attack 01) Mr Clark and the bank. In reSponse to the question ing Prime Minister set out deliberately to undermine the bank. He said: . . . Nobby's savings bank went insolvent 1986 . . . He said that in 1989 the trading banks, morning: including the National Australia Bank, were under 'a very great stress'. He also said: . , . in 1986 the bank was technically insolvent and was rescued by the Commonwealth of Australia, that is the fact of the matter. Those are not the facts of the matter. Acting Prime Minister cannot try to fudge the issue by measures such as talking when he said: about viability or profitability as substitutes for the concept of insolvency. If the Treasurer attempts to do so, understand the simple concept of insolat vency. What a remarkable fact that be, given the level of insolvency and bankruptcies brought about by this TreasThe urer's policies. It is true that, as' Mr Clark says in his annual report, the savings bank outcome for that year was not as good as any difficulties. the bank would have liked. It still a profit of about $30m, even taking into account the $7m million worth of subsidy. The profit was well in excess of the my friend in Canberra subsidy. The banks have had to tackle the Treasurer's ever higher interest rates and to continue to fund housing loans at a lower and fixed rate. The alternative was to cut their housing lending. Is that really by what the Treasurer is saying? Of course He not. How can he say it when the record is so clear? I refer, for example, to the take statement which I read earlier. The definition of insolvency is the inability to pay debts when they arise. At no faces stage whatsoever has the National Australia savings bank been insolvent. The £luditor's report is publicly available and It is the directors specifically reported: . . as at the date of this statement, there are grounds to believe that the Company due. be able to pay its debts as and when they fall Mr Clark, in a statement last night which was repeated on AM, categorically denied the Treasurer's claim. He said that the National Australia savings bank has never the Actbeen and is not insolvent. But the Acting Prime Minister has not just been contradicted by the National in Australia Bank or by the auditors. The Australian Financial Review reported this The Reserve Bank had no formal comment on the Treasurer-s alle'gations. But senior officials suggest that neither the National nor any other bank has been in breach of the prudential requirements of the Reserve or has become insolvent. Lastly,let me draw the attention of the The House to the Treasurer's own statements at his press conference on 28 August 1990, I mean the reason why we don't have any he does not cause everysupervised federally banks in difficulties is bemajor entry in a bank's book is looked against the balance and make-up of its book would and that is a weekly process. quote: Treasurer went on to say in another And that no federally supervised bank has got made To be insol-ent would mean to be in difficulty by any fair definition. The Treasurer ought to state in his defence today whether his statement on 29 August was untrue or whether his statement yesterday was untrue. He cannot have it both ways. This is an absolutely open and shut case. It is beyond reasonable doubt that the Acting Prime Minister misled the House and he accordingly deserves the censure of the House. Mr Speaker, in respect of the second aspect dealing with the discharge of the duties of his high office, the fact is that if you accept that the Acting Prime Minister has never had any information to substantiate his claim, as he effectively said today, then it is very clear ,that the allegations that he made yesterday are allegations entirely without foundation. His attack therefore was launched for his own base political purposes. He recklessly disregarded and he completely put to one side ,his obligations as the ultimate supervisor of our banking system; he entirely put to one side his obligations for the overall prudential supervision of the banking system. I know the Treasurer treated Victoria as if it were on the moon until it suited him to push through his partial privatisation proposals. I know he says the Pyramid Building Society is a State responsibility, although in his own words he knew of events as they unfolded of course, there was a run on the society. How is it that the Treasurer could be so seemingly oblivious to the financial difficulties and the erosion ,of public confidence in our financial institutions of recent times so as to allow himself to make his premeditated attack? The Treasurer ought to have been aware of those events of recent times and that his actions had the potential to lead to an erosion of public confidence in our financial institutions. The information the Minister receives as Treasurer is not given to him lightly; it is not given to him for political purpose. In fact, if the Treasurer reads the Banking Act, the Reserve Bank Act and other legislative constraints upon him, is it not clear that he has a respon.: sibility to ensure the confidentiality of formation, because confidentiality is an absolutely essential element of any effective system of prudential supervision? I believe this is, as I said, clearly an open and shut case. The fact is that virtually on his own words today, the Treasurer misled the House yesterday, and virtually on his own words and on his own admission as a result, he used his high office for· the most base political purposes, to score nothing but a cheap political point.",78
156,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Is the motion seconded?,80
157,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak later.,80
158,Mr KEATING,TREASURER," Mr Speaker, we have just heard another speech from the doyen of the Frankston police court, delivered with the usual lack of style, wit or content. It was a predetermined strategy. Opposition members came in he-e today and decided they were going to have this motion after' Question Time, failing to register what I said in the course of Question Time about accepting Mr Clark's assurance about solvency. Failing to register that, they still went on because once programmed they are too dull to change tneir tactics. Had I believed that honourable members opposite would understand what, 'unand, viable' meant, perhaps I would have used l the word 'unviable' instead of 'insolvent'. Opposition members are such dummies that I thought they would not know the difference; they would not even know what 'unviable' meant. So I did not use it. The Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) said that what I had to say was without any foundation in fact, my references to the National Australia Bank and its book in 1986 were without any foundation in fact, and that it was confidential information. Becl;luse I regard this as basically an occasional spat I have with Mr Clark, I am not about to release confidential information about the National Australia Bank or Mr Clark or information Mr Clark has given me, though, of course, I have plenty; but I will not be ininto that business. So do not fear about that point on confidential information. What I said yesterday was well known to the whole banking industry. Mr Reith-Confidential information.",80
159,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"It was not confidential information, but I have plenty of that, I can assure the honourable member. Mr Dobie-What does that mean?",81
160,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"It means a lot, but the honourable member does not know precisely what it means. The other claim that was made was that the banking package I introduced in 1986 was made for political reasons which had nothing to do with the banks. The Acting Leader of the Opposition said that the subsidy was introduced for base political reasons, as was, of course, the deregulation of future rates of housing. Nothing to do with the banks! The banks were at the point where they could not continue to lend for housing. If I had not deregulated the future rate, people would not have had housing loans for a number of years. The idea that it was done for political reasons is very strange indeed when,· in fact, housing starts were starting to plummet towards the 100,000 level from about 145,000 or 150,000 in the previous year. We had a dramatic close-down of the housing industry and that is why the package was introduced. The Acting Leader of the Opposition says it was done for political reasons because he can never recognise a real fact or a real policy when he sees one. After that he got off the whole issue of banking because he did not have much more to say than two or three minutes worth about that and about Mr Clark and his book. He then got onto the question of personal abuse. If he does not think that Mr Clark's saying of me-as Treasurer and the person with the stewardship of economic policy-that I should be in Collins Street selling shoelaces and pencils is not personal abuse, I do not know what is. So it is pretty disingenuous of the Acting Leader. of the Opposition to say that is not personal abuse when obviously it is. The fact is, I have had plenty of it from Mr Clark and I have given him a bit back; no doubt, I will give him more as time goes by. The Acting Leader then went on to say that we burn people with higher interest rates, but all through 1989 the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said that the Government had not acted to lift interest rates high enough; all through 1989 he said that we had politically subverted the central bank; all through 1989 he said that we needed an independent central b-nk to get a monetary policy the country needed, that is, higher rates. Now, with all the hypocrisy the Acting Leader of the Opposition can muster, he is saying that we are burning people as the economy sinks into a recession, as he put it, in terms of slower activity. The truth is that the Opposition has no rhyme or reason as a policy. It has no structure as a policy. All through 1988 and 1989 the Opposition argued for higher interest rates and now it says we are burning people with them. What hypocrisy! But this is the fact. The Acting Leader of the Opposition gets up and thinks that a slick speech which lacks content or integrity passes for some kind of rebuke to the Government, yet the Opposition has not the slightest policy structure whatsoever. The Acting Leader of the Opposition then said that the attack on banks was from the cornered cowards of the Labor Party. We have noticed the Liberal Party's condonement of the banks' margins in this latest monetary episode. We have noticed not just its silence, but its support for the banks' soaking people, small and medium business people. The Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia support their being soaked by the banks of this country. Mr Reith-Jack Lang would be proud of you.",81
161,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"We have done more for the banking industry in terms of its structure than any government in the history of Federation. But we will not see ordinary business people or persons ripped off by high margins without complaint. That is the position of the Acting Leader of the Opposition. He has denied his leader's views about monetary policy by referring to customers 'getting burnt'. He condones the high margins of banks and then he goes on to say that I have told untruths about the profit levels in this country, profits of gross domestic product (GDP), which is absurd. He has just picked up the Australian Statistician's release. He then goes on to talk about cutting government expenditure-Mr Reith-You ought to have replied.",81
162,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"If the honourable member had asked a question I would have given him a: reply. He has had all week but he could not muster one. He only asks questions which are put into his hands. Then the Acting Leader of the Opposition talked about cutting government expenditure. He said that spending now, as a proportion of the national cake, was the same as it was when we came to office. The fact is that it is down by 7 per cent of gross domestic product. It is down by nearly $30 billion a year from 30.5 per cent of GDP to 23.4. Yet we have the Acting Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer saying that I have told untruths and that spending, as a percentage of the national cake, is where it was when we came to office. That is an absurdity and denies seven years of painstaking effort by the Government in cutting back the Opposition's profligacy. I turn to the crisis in the l State Bank. According to the Acting Leader of the Opposition, I am supposed to know a lot more than I am letting on. This is the smear campaign that he is running and on which he was routed a week or so ago at Question Time. He is saying that in some respects I knew of and engineered some crisis in the State Bank of Victoria. Then we had the absurd proposition by his leader that it was a Victorian problem which should have a Victorian solution-as if the Victorian Government could deal with a run on a bank with $25 billion worth of deposits. This is the sort of nonsense we hear from him. Because he thinks he can make a point on Mr Clark's behalf he comes into the House and tries to make a poor political point. I notice that in the Bulletin this week one of our journalists said: Having watched the way Parliament has operated in recent weeks, I have a suggestion for more fundamental 'reform. It seems to me it would be a good idea to have a group of MPs, designated ""The Opposition"", whose role would be to ask probing questions, expose the government's shortcomings and attack when it makes mistakes. Hawke, however, might find it difficult to get Hewson's agreement for such a change. People are mocking the Opposition's performance in Parliament. The honourable member said he made a point about the profit share and that I had not responded to him. He threw it out in a press statement, which was totally wrong and lacking any structure. He had all week to ask a question about it. Mr Reith-Give us your considered response.",82
163,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The Acting Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,82
164,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"I had a clear response here for the Acting Leader of the Opposition and he had nothing to say about it whatsoever. He is incapable of putting a bit of material together himself that is not put into his hand by some staff person. That is the long and short of it. This whole strategy is one. which was determined overnight by the Opposition. It has not moved off it. It decided to move this so-called censure motion despite the fact that I registered my view about Mr Clark's statements overnight. What we have here is basically the Opposition trying to make points and waste time. Yesterday we heard the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) fulminating, fuming and getting righteous and indignant about my responsibility in dealing with the banking system and how I should not be making these claims and I should be doing this and that. I remind him of a couple of little things. In the 1983 election campaign the honourable  that if a Labor government was elected there would be a run on the country's currency. He went on'saying that through the campaign. I did not hear any rebukes from the then Treasurer. I did not hear any wailing from the Opposition about, irresponsibility, as we saw about $3 billion to $4 billion run out of the country in the week up to the election and which all came back three weeks later. We then had to sterilise that amount in the money supply and offer 13 to 15 per cent interest for 15 years on the Commonwealth Budget. I did not hear any rebukes for that. We have talked about responsibility. The honourable member for Bennelong does not like being reminded about it, but he sat there as Treasurer and watched the Australian tax system haemorrhage badly for four years. I run the tax system and know that, when there. is a scam on or whenever, the Commissioner for Taxation will come to us with a scheme of arrangement. This idea that one needs to know the names of the people involved before making a move and that the secrecy provisions protect the Treasurer from knowing about it is, of course, just poppycock. I have now, on behalf of this Government, tightened the tax system up to the point where we have lower rates, higher ,coinpliance, proper audits and everything else. When the honourable' member for Bennelong gets to his feet and we hear the fulminations, hyperbole and rhetoric about responsibility, I remind him before he starts that he had a big responsibility which he did not face up to. I would not wish-whenever that is to be-that when I leave this position someone would produce for me a telephone book of letters pleading with me to face my ministerial responsibilities to stop the tax system haemorrhaging. There are no letters like that in my files; there are none. People can shake the place upside down over the years and not one will drop out, but there is a phone book full for the honourable member. I face events in this country and have got the job done as I have seen it at the time. In 1986 the job was to fix up the banking system. One of the great problem areas for us all in the official family at the time was the state of the National Australia Bank and our fears <;tbout the savings bank of the National Australia Bank. That was part of the high motivation for repairing the then structure of banking regulations and introducing the subsidy to keep the savings banks lending for housing and keeping them viable. If Mr Clark wants to stand on his pedestal and throw muck at me or any other member of the Government, he ought to remember that his pedestal has a few chips and blemishes on it from his own strategy back in 1986. That is the point I was making yesterday, not to attack the viability of his institution, which is, of course, entirely viable but which then was not. The reason that housing has been so strong ever since and that Mr Clark would have now only about 15 or 16 per cent of regulated loans with the rest deregulated is the changes which I introduced on that occasion. This Government has done more for banks in terms of the deregulation of the financial system, in terms of letting them bid for deposits to take their central place in the financial system, to lend for housing and to generally consolidate their interest than any other Government in the past. Mr Clark knows that well but we never receive any credit for it, only these tawdry attacks on the Government, on me and on others. I am afraid Mr Clark will have to be aware of the fact that there will be responses. But I must say of him that he does not complain. The complainants are others on his behalf, the people without the wit or the courage to be able to even mount the kind of effort he has over his corporate life, and they are the members of the Liberal Party opposite. I do not regard this motion as a censure; I regard it as a joke from a group of people which let the banking system fall into disrepair and let these structural weaknesses appear by their maintenance of a regulatory posture through the years they were in Government. It is only this Government that has taken these issues on the chin and made the Australian banking system sensible and viable.",82
165,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The Treasurer's time has expired.,83
166,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"ln the course of his speech the Trea&urer (Mr Keating) had a number of quite telling things to say. Undoubtedly, the most tellBank of Victoria: ing thing he had to say during his speech The was-and I think I quote him correctly was because I would not like to do what he that says is an injustice-that, 'This is all the occasional spats between Nobby Clark and me'. At the outset, let me say this-and think I would say it with the support of large number of people not only in this Parliament but throughout the nation: we do not really mind how many spats the Treasurer has with Nobby Clark. We do not mind how personal they become. do not mind how abusive they become. We are perfectly satisfied that Nobby Clark can look after himself and the Treasurer can look after himself. But I say to the Treasurer: in the course of having a spat with Nobby Clark, do not go so far over the top as to confidence of ordinary Australians in the stability of our financial system. Mr Speaker, that is what this matter all about. It has absolutely nothing at to do with personal abuse. The Treasurer is the arch-perpetrator of personal abuse in this Parliament. He is known throughother out the nation, not as the world's greatest Treasurer but as Australia's worse politiThat cal abuser. Today he said, in effect, '1 entitled to be annoyed because Nobby said something rude about me'. ,.{ say this the Treasurer: 'Have your little spats Nobby. Have them with anybody you like in the business community, with your colleagues, with us - Mr Rocher-With the Prime Minister.",83
167,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"With the Prime Minconcerned ister, or with the Minister for Transport and Communications, but when it comes to your responsibilities as the Treasurer of this country, do not play fast and loose with the confidence of ordinary Austrato lians in the stability of our financial tem'. That is what this matter is all about. Amazingly enough, it was the Treasurer himself who, in another mode at another time with another political agenda in front of him, actually impeccably stated the principle. He said it at his press conferthe ence after he had 'saved' the State Savings first thing I said was that my interest in this for the stability of the financial system and had to be guaranteed above everything else. about That was an impeccable statement of the Treasurer's responsibilities. I am prepared to accept, and I do accept, that the Treasurer knows precisely what his responsibilI ities are. Whatever I may think of some a of his actions, whatever my views may be of him as a politician or as a participant in public life in Australia, he is no fool. He knows precisely what he says, and that, of course, makes what he said yesWe terday all the more culpable. He knew that in using the word 'insolvent' he was, to borrow the expression of the former Foreign Minister, firing a lethal bullet. He knew that, yet he did it quite deliberately. He did it quite callously. That is put at risk the liament. deserves why he the censure of this ParIf the Treasurer had simply given Nobby a serve, well, that would have been the end of the matter. He would have is been entitled to do that, and Nobby, being all the man that many of us know him to be, would have laughed it off. In a couple of weeks he would have come back with anone and that would have been hit back over the net. That is fair enough. is the robust political exchange that was most Australians do not mind on occasions, provided the national interest does to not get mangled in the process. That is with the kernel of this whole debate. The Treasurer can engage in these exchanges, own but he should not be mangling the national interest and playing fast and loose with words like 'insolvency', particularly at a time when people are legitimately about the stability of certain financial institutions. The Federal Treasurer should be the last man left standing in Australia defending the stability of the system. He should not be the first person invoke the careless epithet of 'insolsysvency' to score a cheap political point. That is precisely what this debate is all about. It is all about the eroding political position of the honourable member for Blaxland. It is observed in the press gallery,in the public galleries and all around place, and it is being observed in the nation. It is all going wrong for the honourable member for Blaxland. That long journey to the Lodge that the started when Laurie grabbed the ballot box and put· it on the back of the motorbike, back in the 1960s is all going wrong, it is being detailed, and of course it has come tragically apart over the last couple of weeks. This was going to be the big week. This was going to be the vintage performance. Not only was he going to strut the stage as Treasurer, as the victor over the Left in relation to the Commonwealth Bank, but he was also going to be the Acting Prime Minister of Australia. But it is a token of his increasing sensitivity, his growing political vulnerability, the realisation that it is slipping aside, that his judgment deserts him and he believes that he cart indulge in the sort of hyperbole and downright irresponsibility that he indulged in yesterday. This is the man who only the week before had said this in reply to the Acting Leader of the. Opposition (Mr Reith): It is a monstrous slur on the Reserve Australia by the Deputy Leader of the Opposi tion and his Victorian colleague Kennett to suggest, as he put it, that the Reserve Bank advised body to let a financial institution go. Let me plagiarise and paraphrase for a moment. Let me say to the Treasurer that it is a monstrous exercise in irresponsibility by him to cast a slur on the National Australia Bank. It is a monstrous thing for him to suggest that one of the most respectable institutions in this country on the brink or had in fact gone into insolvency when he knew better than yb<;>dy else that it had not. Nothing can say today, nothing he has said today at Question Time or in response to this and it still is. censure motion or will say from now while he has breath, can alter the fact was prepared calculatedly, for a cheap political advantage, to·· play fast and loose with the truth and run the risk of underCurtin. mining the confidence of ordinary people in the stability uf our financial system. He can walk out, he can sneer and faw, but he cannot walk away from that grim reality. At the end of the day, when he has been Treasurer of this country for seven and a half years he has to· face to a few basic responsibilities. Let me go on. Here is the man who has dished out more personal abuse than anybody else, and nobody has been in greater receipt of that personal abuse than I. What does he do now? He scuttles, like the political coward he has become, from this Parliament. This is the man who only last week had this to say, and he said this once again in reply to my colleague the Acting Leader of the Opposition: If he has anything to say, he should say it by way of a substantive motion, instead of making these unsubstantiated smears and slursand listen to thisagainst honourable people who are running decent institutions. Let me again say to the Treasurer: if he has anything substantial to say, why does he not do it by substantive motion instead of making slurs against honourable people who run decent institutions like the National Australia Bank? Once again the Treasurer's own words have come back to haunt him and to remind him of the Bank of degree of his irresponsibility. There is one other aspect of this matter anythat I would like to deal with, and it goes to the very heart of the Treasurer's pathetic defence: that is, that he really did after all save the National Bank because back in 1986 the Government gave an interest rate subsidy. I remember the circumstances of 1986 very well because in 1985, when I was Leader of the Opposiwas tion, it was the policy of the Opposition to totally deregulate interest rates on all anloans. That was a policy we had argued he for very strongly because we. thought it was economically rational. It was then Mr Hulls-Why didn't you do it when that he you were in government then?",84
168,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"Let us go back to the Peloponnesian War or to the time of John We put this forward as a policy and the Labor Party ran a very successful political campaign against it-a scare and gufsmear campaign-in the course of the South Australian election in 1985. I say to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that it was a very successful up political campaign. They achieved their objective. They scared the daylights out of the Australian people to the effect that any lifting of that ceiling would cause devastation and ruin for ordinary Austra13 lians. They got 10 out of 10 for politics but zero out of 10 for the national interbility est. Once again, the Government was predevised pared to run cheap politics, and that was the reason why at the beginning of 1986 it had a crisis in relation to the provision of housing loans. That subsidy scheme went on to say: that was introduced was· part of a total package announced by the Treasurer and at the then Minister, the honourable memposition ber for Cunningham (Mr West), and it included the payment of a subsidy to the banks. The Treasurer would now have us lieve that that subsidy was specially vised to help the National Australia Bank; it was not. That subsidy was in fact tributed to, as to one-third, by the banks themselves. In other words, two-thirds the money was put in by the Government and one-third was put in by the banks. I remind the House that the purpose of that subsidy was to ensure that the banks could maintain their existing portfolio of old loans at 13 per cent. In other words, it was a policy decision by the Government to make it possible for the banks to maintalking tain their existing portfolio. It had nothBank ing to do with the solvency of the National Australia Bank or, indeed, any other bank. I read from a document that was released at the time under the cover of the Treasurer's office: The following is the draft text of a leaflet prepared on the Government's housing decision for use in answering queries. This goes very directly to the difference between profitability and insolvency and to the calculated irresponsibility of Treasurer in what he said yesterday, because it was his scheme. The document says: It is true the banks have been profitable in recent years, but it is also true that the savings arms had become unprofitable at the beginning of this year. . There is no reference there to the Nato tional Bank. There is a general reference to the fact that there was a profitability problem. Of course, there was a profitability problem. If a bank can charge only per cent and it has got to borrow at 15 per cent, there will soon be a profitaproblem. That is what it was all about, and that is why the Government the subsidy. It did not decide to devise the subsidy to rescue Nobby or the Westpac Banking Corporation but as part of an overall scheme. The document then The savings bank arm had become unprofitable the beginning of this year. Banks are not in a to lend money for less than it is costing them to borrow. That is a fair statement of the position. It had nothing to do with Nobby or with the technical or other described insolbevency of the National Bank. It was all deabout a Government policy decision in relation to housing finance. It is a total conmisrepresentation of the facts for the Treasurer to come into this House and of pretend that the subsidy scheme was III some way devised to bail out Nobby. So not only is the Treasurer guilty of irresponsibly throwing around words like 'insolvency', not only has he fallen short of the standards that he so impeccably set forth only two weeks ago when he was about the takeover of the State of Victoria, but also, for good measure, he is once again in the business of trying to rewrite political and econ·omic history in Australia. I believe that this will be the week that will record well and truly to more and being more of his colleagues-not just the· honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) and his ilk but many others in the Labor Party-when it all started to come apart for the honourable member for Blaxland and the realisation that the the dream was not going to be realised.",85
169,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,86
170,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"One thing is absolutely certain from today's debate, as we struggle to find 15 minutes worth of material fill in on the substance of the argument that the Opposition has put forward, and that is that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) will emerge with his reputation and record, as far as his incumbency of that office is concerned, completely intact. This was a gpt-up motion by the Opposition, a motion not pursued in any way systematically through the period of Question Time. This motion, which is supposed to have been justified by a series of parliamentary tactics designed to elucidate a number of facts to embarrass the Treasurer, was prethese ceded by questions to me on whether I would uphold the findings of the environmental impact statement as to what should happen about the third runway at Sydney Airport; questions to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) on whether he liked the decision to shift the Austraperambulating lian Maritime Safety· Authority to Newcastle; and numerous other questions to other Ministers. Then, by the way as an afterthought, we had questions about the Treasurer abusing his position, calling into question the solvency of the banking system and the integrity of a prominent official in the private banks. The Opposition's approach has been bring up those matters as the last couple of questions in Question Time and then t6 stand the House on its head with a related censure motion, as though it had assigned to it the appropriate priority that a censure motion normally deserves. That is what the Opposition thinks of the releconfidential vance of the matters that it has put ward in this Parliament. That is what thinks of the substance of its claims about the Treasurer. That is what it thinks the matter that it believes should occupy the time of this Parliament. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) made a great deal about the integrity of the Treasurer on these matters. I am becoming fond of recalling. this House the last acts of Ministers the way out, because so many of them want to come back in. Yesterday I occasion to refer to the last press release issued by the former Minister for munications in 1983. I now have occasion to refer to the last Budget of the person who is now challenging the integrity of the Treasurer on his prudent management of the economy. The honourable member for Bennelong produced a Budget, his last Budget which, as far as the Secretary to the Treasury was concerned, was deeply dishonest about what it claimed to be the likely impact of outlays. There was a $4 billion hole in that Budget, on his predictions. He was warned about that by the Secretary to the 'Freasury at the time. Yet he speaks about present events as though there were a degree of justification in his position. Let me go to the facts that are entailed in the censure motion. So thin has been the argument of the Opposition on the substance of the censure motion that Opposition members have spent their time around the economy with a whole series of unfounded, unproven assertions, and certainly no assertions that and they have bothered to test in Question Time in the past couple of weeks. There have been no assertions of that kind. Nevertheless, let me go to the nub of the motion, so that at least one speaker in this House, apart from the Treasurer, to will have found himself obliged in this debate to deal with what is contained in the Opposition's censure motion. Nobody from the other side of the House will deal with it. Let us get to the guts of it. First, contrary to claims, the Treasurer released no confidential information. There was no information released about for the position of the National Australia it Bank Limited. Secondly, there was no information released to which the Treasurer of had privileged access. All the Treasurer mentioned was well known in the community at the time and has been well known in subsequent commentaries. Mr Reith-Give us some evidence.",86
171,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"The Acting Leader of in the Opposition has provided no evidence on to the contrary and he was supposed to be on the attack here. What the Treasurer had drew on was common knowledge about the economic history of 1986. The OpComposition may not know it, but anyone with a reasonable knowledge of the Australian economy knows what happened in 1986. In the last half of his contribution, the honourable member for Bennelong attempted to deal with that issue by claiming that what was done .by the Government to meet the crisis in housing lending back in 1986 was not done particularly to advantage or save Nobby Clark and that, therefore, that constitutes in some way a rebuttal of the points that the Treasurer was making. That is a load of nonsense. The subsidy that was introduced and the other measures taken at the time increase the ceiling in 1986 were intended to deal with the fact that the banks had found themselves with a lending crisis cause they could not sustain the 13.5 cent rate without effectively ceasing ing lending. Sure, that applied to all banks; but it applied with knobs on to Nobby's bank. He found himself in a situation where he was shelling out loans as fast as he could-faster than anyone else in the banking system, and that was well known at the time. Certainly, all banks were fected and would benefit from the decilarly sions that were taken, but the point that Nobby's bank benefited the most, cause he alone among the bankers had taken the decision at the time to shovel out that money in anticipation that the Government would introduce a retrospecGovernment tive change to fixed interest rates. No decent government, given the lonthe gevity of those fixed interest rates housing, could ever make a retrospective decision on housing. There are certain proprieties in relation to contractual rangements entered into by people with their bankers, albeit on the terms and conditions prevailing at the time. Large numbers of Australians had entered into arrangements with their banks, their deposition cisions for purchasing housing calculated in anticipation that they would receive 13.5 per cent interest rate. People were taking those decisions after considering their income and determining that they could afford that rate of interest. No decent government was going to march into the middle of that situation and say 'Stop! Whatever personal arrangemer ments you have established with your banker, we will turn that on its head and you will have an interest rate of 16 per cent'. It is another matter for a person who wants to 'rearrange finances or subsequently wants to enter the housing market, to make that decision on a calculation which is based on his 'or her knowledge that the bank will be in a situation where it might move interest rates around. That sort of person can then make the calculations and take a punt. .The Government to decided that from that point on, when people entered into that relationship with their banker, if they did not get a specific befixed term interest rate from him, they per were entering into a field where .they houswould be taking a punt. That was their free choice. That free choice was never presented to anyone in this country by the Opposition when it was in office. The beneficiaries of that free choice were several groups of people. One group of people, and I must admit they were the afonly ones the Government was particuworried about, were the potential was home owners at the time who wished to bebe in a position to be able to make that sort of decision. I notice that one of my colleagues raises his hand to indicate that he was in that category. That is what the decided to do. Picked up on the way through were people about whom Government was less concerned, and on one of those was Nobby Clark, who happen-d. to have made an ill-advised decision as far as his bank, was concerned, arabout his bank's lending policies. That is all that the Treasurer said yesterday. Effectively he said that Nobby Clark had made a series of decisions which, if the situation had persisted, his with his savin-s bank would have been unviable. The bank might have made a a $30m profit in that year, but in the subsequent year there certainly would not have 'been a profit of $30m. If the position had persi-ted, then the 1986 decision on the banker 'of the year might not have been one that was safely made at all. Then we had the bleating from the forLeader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong, who said that he well remembered that period. And well he might remember that period, as this Government struggled with the consequences of his policies in myriad areas. He chose to remember particularly the period from the viewpoint that he said that he would totally deregulate interest rates in the housing sector. He expressed hurt that the Government of the day would not permit him to do so, when people had already entered into contractual .arrangements with their bankers at an interest rate of 13.5 per cent-that the devastatingly wrong Government had come in and upset the apple cart by not agreeing with the honourable member for Bennelong that that should have been done. Subsequently the Government undertook the only decent way to regulate those interest rates. The honourable member for Bennelong said, 'Of course our Opposition policy at that time was to totally deregulate'. That was 1985-86, two years after the Opposition parties were in office, two years after the seven-year tenure by the honourable member for Bennelong of the office of Treasurer. Has that not always been the way since we have been in office? We are the ones who have had to sit in government introducing micro-economic reform, anteing up with a decent wages policy and copping the sort of criticism that we get from the Opposition whenever we choose to do something in this regard. It is always a case of 'You have loved us lately'. I remember the struggle that the Treasurer had to go through to put in place a decent amount of assets testing related to welfare policies. In election campaign after election campaign we had to fight to explain that while the Opposition .came in against it. Even now, because of the shenanigans of the Senate, we have to confront the possibility that there will be a hole punched in the integrity of our outlays calculation by the Opposition not being able to face up to the tax file number issue. Every time the Opposition has been presented with an opportunity it has always taken the easy way out. We are the ones who have had to confront the problems and the consequences of them. That is the case with interest rates and wages policy. For the last year and a half the Opposition has been parading around this country saying that it is the party of small business, it is the party that is concerned about what is happening to the living standards of average Australians and it is the party that wants to see families able to build a sound economic future without confronting interest rate burdens. It is, however, the party which, in every policy parameter that it has put down-although Opposition members will not admit to the consequences-is going to raise interest rates. The Opposition's wages policy is to raise interest rates, crash the economy through the floor, ensure that there is a high level of unemployment and establish a degree of control over union wage claims on that basis. It never admits it, but every economic analyst in this country knows that that is its intention. Some economic analysts approve of it, some do not, but the ordinary people of this country who will have to confront the consequences of the Opposition's policy are presented with a farrago of nonsense from the Liberal Party. It says that those consequences are the product of government policy and that it is not what it would do if it was ever in office. Now the Opposition is criticising a Treasurer who has taken our percentage of outlays to gross domestic product from something like 30 per cent, where the Opposition left it, to 23 per cent, with the Opposition harrying him and snapping at his heels every step of the way. He is invited to contemplate the fact that the Opposition believes that he has mangled the national interest in this regard. I see that one of the culprits in the area of national interest mangling is going to follow me in this debate and he will have an opportunity, when he gets up on his scrapers, to explain to us how he managed to run the 1983 election campaign on the single parroted line that there would be a run on the currency if Labor was elected. While he is at it he can also give an explanation for his then leader at the time who said that if Labor was elected people would have to put their savings in a shoe box. These are the people who come into this place parading their rectitude as far as economic policy is concerned. The Treasurer needs no defence in this House against the likes of them. The Treasurer needs no defence in this House against the sort of unprincipled behaviour of which they have been guilty both in government and in opposition. He will be defended in this House by the people on this side of the House because of the immense respect that we have for him and for the job that he had to do in the face of the mess that the Opposition made of the economy over something like 30 years of tenure in office.  there is one single element that would be agreed upon by the overwhelming majority of Australians listening to this debate it would be that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), who just spoke, did not have his heart in it. He did not fool a soul. The Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) have been at one another for weeks, and to hell with the national interest, the programs, the blueprints and the schedules. Of course, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who follows me, will be right into it because he wants to be the Treasurer, and we know who he is backing. The Treasurer did not get strong defence today coming from either the heart or the head of the portly Cassius. The fact is that what is before the Parliament as a censure motion is, except for a censure of a government, the most important motion that the Opposition can move in the Parliament. It is about standards. The Government knows it, we know it and the people outside know it. They know that with the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer they just cannot achieve those standards. There is a very interesting article by Paul Cleary on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald today. I will read only a very small portion of it. In it he states: At a time when public confidence system is near rock bottom, the Treasurer yesterday made an extraordinary claimthose are his words, not minethat the Government had been forced to prop up the National Australia Bank in 1986 because its savings bank had been ""insolvent"". Let us get it on the record right at the outset of my remarks. The National Australia savings bank has never been and is not insolvent. Why would a man do this? Why would a Treasurer, with the additional garb of Acting Prime Minister, do it? The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was right. This motion is fundamentally about the responsibility of the Treasurer to the financial system of our country and to the people of Australia. He knows what his responsibilities are but he never carries them out. In that' light I will quote once more from this article. The fifth paragraph goes on to say: Mr Keating, who has been threatening to use his insolvency comments for more than a yearand it then goes on to quote. It was a premeditated attack on the financial system in this way-to hell with the truth, to hell with the consequences, either for the bank or for the shareholders in the bank, and to hell with the people of Australia. I would think that nothing reveals the cowardice of this man more than his skulking out of the chamber before, temporarily returning to hear Cassius do a phoney job in defence, and recognising what a facade it was and going out again-possibly not to be seen for the remainder of this debate. When one recognises that it was premeditated-",87
172,Mr NA BROWN,TREASURER,"Calculated.  tated-no rush of blood to the head. He just wanted to get at someone. Why? Because someone dared to criticise him. I heard one of our speakers, I think it was the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), say that if the Treasurer were to go outside the confines of the Treasury, this Parliament or his own residence-wherever that may be these days, and he seems to have less idea than me-he would hear the people of Australia saying the sorts of things that Nobby in the financial Clark said. I recall saying before the election campaign that we would not see the Treasurer out in the supermarkets; we would not see him in the pubs or with the people of Australia because he just will not mingle with them. More than that, when he deigns to drive through Sydney, he has darkened glass on the windows of his vehicle. I am never quite sure whether it is so that people cannot see him or whether-because of the way he behaves-he does not want to see the people. The reality is that in the greater part of this nation the people know that this man is a failure and they know the innate truth in what Nobby Clark said about him, because they know what impact diminished living standards have had on Australians today. They are not withstanding the fragility of the financial system that abounds. This man, who in it premeditated dirty political stunt had but one aim in mind-to get at someone who had had a go at him-cast aside the truth, the system, the consequences and, frankly, the people's interest. He has been condemned universally for it. If those opposite had any guts and put their minds to it, they would come over with us to vote on this. A fair number of those opposite would like to do that. The Treasurer has shown the characteristics of a coward by fleeing from the chamber today, just as he did by making the premeditated attack on Nobby Clark because he could not hack criticism. What Nobby said is said by most Australians. People can hear it in the streets. Those opposite who might perchance be undecided about the leadership of their Party in its decline can see what a grubby Prime Minister the man would be. Earlier this week the Business Council of Australia was abused and accused of incompetence and hypocrisy, words that must be emblazoned on the Treasurer's mind when he coddles his own conscience. He trotted them out earlier this week. The Minister for Transport and Communications, who spoke after the honourable member for Bennelong, trotted out material about the state of the Australian economy during the period of the Fraser Government. I was Foreign Minister for the greater part of that period, and I recall at one point being asked by my Prime Minister to consider whether Australia could be admitted to what is colloquially termed the Group of Seven (G7). The leading members of the Western industrialised economies, the best, meet together annually at head of government level. I was charged with the responsibility of seeing those heads of government to see whether they would consider admitting Australia to the G7. All countries agreed bar one, which wanted to think about it. While it was thinking about it the then Prime Minister changed his mind and decided that at that juncture we ought not go ahead. If we suggested anywhere in world today that Australia be considered for membership of the G7, we would be laughed out of court because our great country is deemed by most to be simply irrelevant. This was seen in stark terms in the Gulf crisis itself. We had to knock on doors and make all the offers before we were even asked to make a contribution. We were passed over even in that domain, despite alliances. The Treasurer comes in here, talks about the strength of the Australian economy today and starts to make reflections on the economy under us. No matter what comparative index we use or what devices he wheels out, we must conclude that this man as Treasurer, whether on a macro test or a micro test, has failed. Outside this building he has failed overwhelmingly the great majority of Australians. For seven years we have had to tolerate this creature hectoring and lecturing everybody about the need for care to avoid runs on the State Bank of Victoria or other financial institutions. Yet here he is, attacking and casting aspersions on a bank in a most dangerous, premeditated and irresponsible manner. Not only is it delinquency in the Treasurer himself but it underlines, for one who aspires to be the Prime Minister, how unsuited he is for that task. He is a fix-it man. If someone wants a little job done he will stitch it up. As the honourable member for Bennelong said, in days gone by he got someone to grab the ballot boxes and take off on his motorbike. There were challenges to the endorsement. If one traces the record of the man, it always shows breaches of standards. I could get personal, as I can on censure motions, and honourable members know the sorts of things I could raise about the honourable member for Blaxland since he has been Treasurer-from tax returns through to shonky visas and shonky travelling allowances. This man's career has always consisted of a turn and a twist and a breaching of standards. He comes in here and lectures the people of Australia about the sanctity of the system, but if someone criticises him he will tear that person down, no matter what the consequence, simply to get back. This was a premeditated attack. The remarks yesterday, honourable members will recall, went from 'insolvent' to 'technically insolvent' to 'going insolvent' to 'in need of liquidation'.",90
173,Mr NA BROWN,TREASURER,"Which is worse?  Frankly, if I were going to do a demolition on a bloke I might do a bomb in the basement job, but what motivated this endeavour at a brickby brick demolition? Was it the facts? No, it was not. It was ego and arrogance such that if anybody in this democracy criticised him about his performance and the state of the Australian economy today, he would jeopardise the financial system and jeopardise the well-being of his people simply to strike back at the person who accused him. In my period here I have never known such hypocrisy, such ingratiation to someone's own ambitions that he or she would strike out in the manner that the Treasurer has. I suppose it is one thing to attack Nobby Clark; he is a reasonably tough guy, and the Treasurer himself concedes that. But attacking a major bank is basically irresponsible, especially at a time when the market is as fragile as it is. H is interesting to recall that the period that he referred to, 1986, includes the time under his own stewardship, in May of that year, when he said our country was on the verge of being a banana republic. They were his words. Now he says that Nobby's savings bank went insolvent in 1986 and that it was 'rescued by the Commonwealth of Australia'. That was a downright lie. The Treasurer was a crook when he first entered the Parliament-",92
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,"Order! The honourable gentleman will not use that phrase.  trouble with that once before, and I rapidly withdraw it as a consequence. The standards the Treasurer set when he first sought to enter this Parliament were investigated by the Federal Executive of his Party and found to be, shall I say, lacking. Since the honourable member for Blaxland has assumed the position of Treasurer, not only has he destroyed the standards required but he has been the mastermind behind destroying the economy itself. It is little wonder that Nobby Clark was moved in the manner that he was. I have not got shoelaces but I will give the Treasurer some pencils and he can go out and see how he can flog them. I do not think he. would last too long. As people around the nation were saying only this morning, the Treasurer has given pretty evident indication of just what he does to small businesses anyway. I end as I began. The honourable member for Bennelong struck the right note. This debate is about standards and responsibilities; it is about the responsibility of a Treasurer Jor the financial system of Australia and thereby a responsibility to the people of Australia. Brother, has he failed in that!",92
175,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,"The most theatrical and last of this tawdry little trio decided to make some classical allusions at the beginning of his speech, referring to the juxtaposition of the two speakers who preceded me. I might do a similar thing with regard to the honourable member for Kooyong  leadership of the Liberal Party of Australia. Whatever the honourable member might say about my good friends the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating), he must be the most notorious Brutus the Liberal Party has ever had. The honourable member has tried to bring down a leader not once but twice-once successfully, and with little effect. Of course, very few· present members can recall the dramatic days of 1981, when the honourable member for Kooyong, who was then Minister for Foreign Affairs, came in here to resign his position and to complain about his treatment at the hands of the then Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Fraser. We listened intently to the way in which he tried to drag his Leader's reputation through the sewer. . We had to wait only a few more years to see the honourable member at it again, only this time as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. He made one of the most cowardly pounces on a leader when he decided to snatch the leadership of the Liberal Party from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). The honourable member for Kooyong is probably in the worse position of all to cast any aspersions on the intentions or the behaviour of any political character in: Australia today. If Nobby Clark had wanted to have some legal defence in this little travail that he is going through on this occasion, I am sure that the three Opposition members-the honourable member for Kooyong, the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith)-who today have so eagerly yet maladroitly volunteered their services on his behalf, would not be the ones to receive Nobby Clark's brief. These honourable members were like the three stooges of suburban solicitation. What an appalling performance they gave in defence of a man who we all know to be likeable, robust and perfectly capable of looking after himself in the context of fairly vigorous political debate, which he chooses to engage in from time to time. But what is it we are arguing about here today? What we are really talking about-and the Treasurer has put it as succinctly as anyone-is a bit of a spat between two of Bankstown's most suc:cessful sons; one who is in the twilight of his career, about to amble off into retirement, and the other one who is at the pinnacle of his career and is, of course, going from strength to strength in the economic leadership of this country. That is what we are really talking about. The references during the course of the interchange between the Treasurer on the one hand and the leader of a bank on another to the national interest being assailed ought to be put in the political context in which they are made. But seeing that the honourable member for Bennelong went to such unctuous lengths to draw these threads of an attack on the national interest, it is worthwhile examining his and, indeed, some of his colleagues' character as far as the defence of the national interest is concerned. It goes without saying that those in opposition have very few opportunities in which to defend the national interest. The national interest is something which it is the Government's responsibility to defend. But occasionally there are insights into the behaviour and character of individuals, whether they are in government or in opposition, in terms of their true loyalty to this country and their preparedness to stand up for it, and to stand up for it in spite of the political attraction of abandoning it from time to time. . Let us examine a few of the activities, a few of the events, in not such dim, dark distant history in relation to the three honourable members opposite who have spoken in the debate on the motion. Both of my colleagues have referred to the quite scandalous behaviour of the honourable member for Kooyong when, as Minister for Industry and Commerce in the leadup to the 1983 election, he began to cast doubt on the national currency. There can be no greater crime by any Minister than to call . into question the security and strength of the national currency. It is all right for those who are outside this place who have no particular responsibility in this regard. But at that time, when the currency was being managed through a process of regulation which was maintained by the former Government, to have a Minister casting doubt on the future of the currency-in fact, encouraging speculation against the currency-was one of the greatest instances of an abandonment of the protection of the national interest. So that is where the honourable member for Kooyong stands on that important test when he was a Minister. I shall return to the honourable member a little later. Reference has also been made to the behaviour, conduct and record of the honourable member for Bennelong when he was Treasurer-his conduct in relation to the defence of the taxation system and his conduct in relation to budgeting, when not one of his Budgets came in on target. But there is one even greater instance of his hypocrisy, and, might I say, dishonesty, and that is in relation to the last couple of weeks of the election campaign of 1983, when he was informed by the Treasury Secretary that the forthcoming Budget deficit in prospect was $9.6 billion, yet he and his Leader went on saying that the prospective deficit was just $6 billion. There was a quite deliberate $3.6 billion error which the honourable member was aware of, yet he not only allowed that truth to be denied to the. electorate at a time when it was making a decision about the future of. the Government but also encouraged, or at least permitted, his Leader to continue to proclaim and pretend that the deficit in prospect was $6 billion when in fact he knew that it was - oing to be $9.6 billion. That is a measure of the honourable member's understanding of what it means to defend the national interest; what it means to take a principled stand at a time of political travaiL We all remember his conduct in 1986 as Leader of the Opposition, when, under some considerable pressure, as he normally was, he tried to look for some chink so that he might be able to grease his way into office in this country. So from some fashionable New York hotel, the honourable member with some undeniable, unconcealable conceit, told a journalist that the times would suit him. In other words, the prospects in front of the Australian economy were so bleak that they would herald his election or at least the defeat of this Government. What greater sabotage could there be in terms of the interests of the Australian economy than for the alternative Prime Minister, not even in Australia but in New York, to say that the economy was so bad that it was likely to lead to his election? What more graphic illustration of a calamity could there be than something which was so great that it would lead to his inevitable elevation to the prime ministership? So this is the history of these people who now come in here with such disgraceful unction, trying to lecture us, and most particularly the Treasurer, about the protection of the national interest. I will not go in great detail to the circumstances of the last election, when the honourable member for Kooyong was the Leader and the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition was the spokesman on education. But we have only to recall their tawdry attempt to try to deceive the National Catholic Education Commission that they were going to provide it with an additional $300m to support their schools, while at the same time they were publicly threatening to cut spending in the education area and trying to pretend that their election promises were fully costed. Honourable members opposite come into the debate not only witho-t clean hands but with an appalling reputation in terms of their personal integrity and in terms of their contribution to political debate. I want to return to what it 'is that Mr Clark said. Mr Clark is, of course, a distinguished banker. He is the leader of one of the major banks in this country. Does he expect his comments just to be cast off? Does he make commentary on the national economy just in order to be ignored or does he make these comments in order that some people might take notice of what he is saying? . Let us recall what Mr Clark actually said, which the Treasurer was entitled to take such offence at. He said: If I had the strike rate of my friend in Canberrareferring to the Treasurerand had the economy in tatters because of ineffective monetary management, then I'd be out selling pencils . . . In other words, here is one of the people who is perhaps most qualified to comment on the circumstances of the national economy saying that it is in tatters. I reminded of - his because on the AM program this morning Mr Clark said, 'Oh, it's all right to engage in a little bit of personal abuse. He's used to that. He can handle the hurly-burly of political debate'. It is one thing for the Treasurer to say critical things of Mr Clark, but it is an entirely different thing for him to cast aspersions on his institution, that is, the National Australia Bank. Let us turn that on its head for a moment. Was the head of the National Australia Bank, in saying that the economy was in tatters, referring in a personal way to the Treasurer? Of course he was in the sense that he went on to talk about pencils and shoelaces, but in a sense he was talking about the institution of Australia, the Australian economy. What was his evidence for saying that the Australian economy was in tatters? His only evi.dence was that he believed that there had been ineffective monetary management. What are Mr Clark's prescriptions for the overall management of the economy? What is his actual evidence for the fact that the economy is in tatters? I am not going to go through a recitation of the enormous achievements which have been made in Australia. On the fiscal side, those achievements have not been equalled by any country in the world. The achievements on the wages front make the record in the United States and Britain pale into insignificance. Achievements in general deregulation of the economy, of course, make the record of our opponents pale into insignificance and leave most of the rest of the world in the shade as well. Leaving aside'those great achievements, one needs to recall that what we are now pursuing is a policy designed to correct an unsustainably high current account deficit and deal with the threat of inflation. Where is Mr Clark's prescription for·handling inflation? Where is Mr Clark's prescription for dealing with the current account? Where is Mr Clark's prescription for having a sensible wages policy? All these issues have, of course, been left to the Government and, most particularly, to the Treasurer. Where is the assistance for this quite frequently solitary was figure from those who are, by and large, the beneficiaries of the success of economic policy in this country? That suc cess can be measured in terms of huge investment and reinvestment in the Australian private economy; a restoration of profit levels in the private economy; a stability in wages outcome, which has any never been seen in this country during a period of relatively sustained growth such as we have had in this country over recent times. Mr Clark and his colleagues should be out in a chorus of appro'/ai. There should be a chorus of applause for the Treasurer and his achievements during his stewardship as Treasurer. It ill behoves Mr Clark, I believe, to make these snide comments about the Treasurer. Of course, the Treasurer can take them; he will take them; and he will respond to them in an appropriate fashion. But anyone who suggests that Mr Clark is somehow defending the national interest or that this array of galahs on the other side are responsible for protecting the national interest and not the Treasurer simply has been asleep for the last eight years. The Treasurer is the one who has rescued this country and put it on a basis in which it can prosper in the future. That lesson should be recalled, that lesson should be remembered, by those in the business community who might enjoy, these little spats. I move: That the question be now put. Question resolved in the affirmative. Original question put: That the motion (Mr Reith's) be agreed to. The House divided. (Mr SPEAKER - Hon.

176,Mr SHARP,QUESTION TIME,"I wish to ask you a question, Mr Speaker. I seek your advice in relation to what Ministers are responsible for during Question Time. Are Ministers responsible for their own statements and are they responsible for matters that relate to legislation which they introduced into this House in recent times? My reason for asking that is that earlier today during Question Time I AYES asked a question of the Minister for Land MACKellar. M. J. R. MCLachlan, I. M. Transport (Mr Robert Brown) which related to comments that he had made in Miles, C. G. Moore, J. C. the last week and also to legislation which he introduced into this House a few weeks Nugent, P. E. Peacock, A. S. ago. The Minister answered the question by saying that it was not a matter which Reid. N. B. Reith, P. K. fell under his portfolio responsibility. What are the responsibilities of Ministers Rocher, A. C. Ronaldson, M. J. C. during Question Time? Ruddock, P. M.",96
177,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TIME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is that Sharp, J. R. standing order 142 states: Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which he is officially connected, to proceedings pending in the House, or to' any matter of administration for which he: is NOES responsible. Jenkins, H. A. Johns, G. T. My recollection of the way that Question Time has progressed is that matters asked Keating, P. J. Kerin, J. C. of Ministers can be answered by the Prime Minister, matters asked of the Prime Lavarch, M. H. Lindsay, E. J. Minister can be referred to a Minister, but Ministers' only answer questions that Martin. S. P. Melham, D. relate to their own portfolio, not to someone else's portfolio. I' .,uppose they could Morris, Peter Newell. N. J. attempt to answer questions relating to someone else's portfolio but it would O'Neil, L. R. T. Price, L. R. S. probably be to their folly and detriment if they attempted to do so. Scholes, G. G. D. Sciacca, C. NA Scott, Les Simmons, D. W.  wish to address a question to you, Mr Staples, P. R. Theophanous, A. C. Speaker. Prior to the introduction of computerisation and other forms of modern Walker, F. J. West, S. J. technology, the daily Hansard was delivered to members .offices by 10 a.m. the Woods, Harry Wright, K. W. day following debate. The last Hansard delivered to my office, and I assume to other members of this House, was that of Wednesday, 12 September of last week. What are the problems with Hansard production and when can members expect to see this problem rectified or the process privatised?",96
178,Mr SPEAKER,PRODUCTION OF HANSARD,"One of the problems that we are facing at present is the change in the process. At present there is a significant change occurring in the way the Hansard is produced and the way that the Parliament transmits its information to the Australian Government· Printing Office, with computerisation' of a lot of those processes. There has been some industrial action at the Printing Office which has occurred just at the stage when we were finally bedding down the new system. It is a matter in which the Secretary to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff has a great deal of interest and it is a matter which is of some concern to the President and myself. We believe that when this new process that we are putting into place is properly in operation there will be a far more timely delivery of the Hansard to members and it will provide a far better service which, hopefully, in the medium term will be an on-screen service. This will mean that members will not have to wait until the next day to read Hansard. Because of the problems that there have been in this last week or so, I have spoken to the Secretary to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, who is preparing a letter that I will circulate to members in their electorate offices next week. I thank the honourable member for his question. NA",96

183,Mr GORMAN,PUBLICATIONS COMMITIEE,I present the second report of the Publications Committee. Report-by leave-adopted. NA NA NA NA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act,98
184,Mr BEDDALL,AVIATION AUTHORITY,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of Perth office and warehouse complex for the Civil Aviatiori Authority. The proposed work, recommended by the Public Works Committee, involves the construction of an office and warehouse complex for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to be located in Perth. In 1988 the Civil Aviation Authority purchased land at Perth airport with the view of relocating to the airport all office based staff presently located in lease office accommodation in the central business district. Investigation into the economic feasibility of this proposition confirmed that the construction of a new office complex would reduce the overall cost of the CAA's Western Australian accommodation expenses. This proposal also involved the disposal of the existing warehouse site at Mount Claremont, Western Australia. The scope of the work involved 240 office based ,staff being accommodated in given the complex. The land size is 1.92 hectares. The office accommodation will total 5,508 square metres and the warehouse 1,120 square metres. The estimated project construction at completion-estimated to be October 1991-is $13.9m. The work is being designed to comply with the requirements of the relevant authorities. It is proposed to provide a good standard of accommodation and amenities for staff. Extensive consultation has occurred with relevant staff associations on all aspects of the facilities to be provided. In order to ensure earliest termination of existing leasing work totalling $100,000 per month, the CAA seeks to achieve completion during October 1990. I thank Committee for its report and commend the motion to the House.",98
185,Mr HAWKER,AVIATION AUTHORITY,"The Opposition does not oppose this motion and believes that it makes a lot of sense to put this office complex together at the Perth airport: However, I make two points in passing which I draw to the attention of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall). When this matter was first referred the Public Works Committee on 1 June this year, the reference said 177 office based staff would be moving into this new complex. Since that reference was made, according to the motion by the Minister, that has been increased to 240, which an increase of 63 or over one-third in number mentioned in the reference to Public Works Committee. That seems quite a significant increase, and I am curious to know why it has changed so much .in a relatively short time. Commensurate with that, in the reference to the Public Works Committee the size of the office accommodation was 70 square metres less than it is in this motion. While that would probably be understandable in the light the number of people being moved to accommodation, nonetheless I draw the floor. House's attention to the fact that since the reference was first made to the Works Committee on 1 June there has been a significant increase in both number of staff that are being relocated there and the size of the building.",99
186,Mr BEDDALL,AVIATION AUTHORITY,"in reply-I do not have the relevant inforsign mation to hand, but I will make sure that to the House. the honourable member for Wan non (Mr Hawker) is informed of it at a later time today or at the earliest opportunity. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA OFFICE-BRUCE, ACT Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",99
187,Mr BEDDALL,FOR THE AUSTRALIAN TAXATION,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Dedicated computer centre for the Australian Taxation Office, Bruce, ACT. to The proposed work, recommended by the Public Works Committee, involves the construction of a dedicated computer centre for the Australian ,Taxation Office on Commonwealth land at Bruce in the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian Taxation Office is undergoing a comis plete modernisation of its business the operations and has an urgent requirement the to accommodate its new computer equipment in a secure and stable environment. The proposed buil<hng, which measures 6,300 square metres, has been designed to a limit of cost estimated at $28.5m at December 1989 prices. The building will be two storey with the computer mainframe and operations being housed on the upper floor and plant, dispatch, loading of dock, storage, staff amenities and office this accommodation located on the ground In response to the Committee's recomPublic mendations, both Tax and Australian Construction Services are presently rethe viewing the requirement for dual independent electricity supplies to the building. Australian Construction Services also wishes to ensure that special attention is being given to the inclusion of energy conservation measures during detailed deof the facility. I thank the Committee for its report and commerid the motion",99
188,Mr HAWKER,FOR THE AUSTRALIAN TAXATION,"Likewise, the Opposition does not oppose this motion. I make a very brief reference to the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) noting that the Australian Taxation Office has an urgent requirement to accommodate its new computer equipment. I remind honourable members that this matter was first referred to the Public Works Committee on 21 December last year. Subsequently, because the Government in its wisdom decided not to sit before it called an tion, there was some delay in the Public Works Committee looking at it. However, it was not referred again until 1 June, which is almost six months from the first reference to the Public Works Committee. That seems to undermine the concerns that the Minister is now expressing about the urgent requirement when it took him six months to refer the matter back to the Public Works Committee after its first reference. To the credit of the Public Works Committee we have seen some fairly quick work on this. Nonetheless it is now some nine months later that the decision has .now been made to move this motion. I notice also in the reference to the Public Works Committee that there was a mention of a two level building. It is now a two-storey building. I presume it is still the same building and nothing has changed, although I just happened to note that minor alteration.",99
189,Mr ROCHER,FOR THE AUSTRALIAN TAXATION,"Like my colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), I appreciate the need for a dedicated computer centre at Bruce for the Australian Taxation Office. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), mentioned that it was designed, amongst other things, to produce a secure system. That is something we should particularly welcome in the light of published comments in the newspaper this morning about the criticisms of the Privacy Commissioner in relation to the use of the tax file number. If this building contributes to privacy being enhanced and the intended and stated restrictions on the use of the tax file numbers being maintained instead of abused as they apparently now are, according to the Privacy Commissioner, then we doubly welcome the building. It is a source of concern, but I do not understand the problem that the Privacy Commissioner spoke about likely to be remedied by the installation of computer equipment in a new building. Instead it is a matter for the Government to address because, as the Commissioner has rightly pointed out, the system and the usage of electhe tax fail number has been abused by direction under this Government. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Duffy, and read a first time. Second Reading",100
190,Mr DUFFY,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill amends several Acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio. The Bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature or which correct existing legislation. None of the amendments concern major new policy proposals. None of the amendments will have any direct financial impact. However, after regulations consequential upon the amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 have been made, there is expected to be a slight rise in revenue from fees and some minor savings as a result of the proposal . to extend the range of judicial powers that may be delegated to registrars of the Federal Court by the judges. Further, there is the possibility of flowon costs should the Australian Capital Territory Government enter into a cooperative arrangement with the Commonwealth for the performance of human rights functions in the ACT, consequent upon passage of a proposed amendment to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. The proposed amendments are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. I propose to confine my remarks to the more noteworthy amendments. Amendments of the Acts Interpretation The Bill will amend the Acts Interprelian tation Act to overcome a number of technical difficulties which have arisen relation to the making of statutory instruof ments before an Act under which the struments are made has come into effect. The amendments will allow different commencement dates to be prescribed different provisions of such instruments. The ame.ndments will also make it possiCommittee ble to combine in the one statutory strument provisions made under an amending Act, which has not come into force, with provisions made under the parent Act that are already in operation. The Bill makes a number of other amendments to the Act. The most important of these makes clear that a regulation which retrospectively prejudices the rights of a persori has no effect at all, and simply ineffective to the extent that retrospective. The other proposed amendments will clarify the operation of certain provisions of the Act, and further the advances made by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in relation to plain English draftapply . ing. Amendment of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933 Currently, the Act provides that the risdiction of the Supreme Court must exercised by not less than three judges matters relating to applications sion to practise as a barrister and solicitor, and in disciplinary proceedings. - he amendments will allow the jurisdictIon of the Supreme Court, subject to the approval of the Chief Justice, to be exersions cised by less than three judges in cations for admission to practise as barrister and solicitor, and to provide a single judge can give directions of interlocutory nature in· disciplinary ceedings. Amendment of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 The Bill contains amendments to part VA of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act, which deals with functions and procedures of the ParliaAct 1901 mentary Joint Committee on the AustraSecurity Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). It has become apparent, in the in context of the Committee's current review the access provisions of the Archives inAct, that certain provisions in part VA make anomalous distinction in the manner in which they treat evidence taken by for the Committee from a witness on the one hand, and documents produced to the on the other, for the purpose inof a review that the Committee is conducting. The relevant provisions are section 92G (publication of information obtained by the Committee) and section 92p (continuance of evidence by a previously constituted Committee). The amendments in the Bill are designed to remove the impediments to. the Committee's operation posed by that disis not tinction. The amendments to sections it is 92G, 92p and 92R of the Act will allow the Committee to continue its current review and to publish the contents of a document produced to it for that purpose. being Publication of such documents will be subject to the. same constraints that now to the publication of evidence given by a witness in a review conducted by the Committee in private, namely, that publication is .authorised by the author, and the Committee is satisfied, after obtaining juthe Attorney-General's advice that publibe cation would not disclose a matter that in the Committee could not include in a for admisreport to Parliament. Amendment .of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Amendment Act 1986 The remaining uncommenced proviof the Australian Security Intelliappligence Organisation Amendment Act 1986 a are to be repealed. These provisions, if that commenced, would change the basis of an employment from one based on contract proto a statutorily based one. The employment policy that underlays the uncommenced 1986 amendments has now been reviewed and a satisfactory arrangement that retains the contract of employment while giving the Directorthe General scope to vary terms and conditions in a manner consistent with the Government's public sector employment principles has been arrived at. Amendments of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to make a number of amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966. In four broad categories, the amendments will: implement suggestions by the Chief Justice 'of the Federal Court for reform.s to the substantive law relating to debtors' and creditors' petitions; to confer judicial immunity on judges issuing search warrants; and to transfer certain functions, such as audit of the accounts of registered trustees from Registrars in Bankruptcy to the Insolvency and Trustee Service of my Department; implement suggestions made by the Auditor-General to relieve the Australian Audit Office of statutory audit functions more properly carried out by the Insolvency and Trustee Service and to improve the system for the registration of trustees; make amendments, consequential upon the enactment of other laws, that were omitted to be made previously; and consolidate overlapping provisions in the Bankruptcy Act and simplify other provisions to eliminate unnecessary administrative procedures. The Chief Justice of the Federal Court suggested changes to require registrars in bankruptcy to refer a debtor's petition to the Court for a direction whether to accept or reject it when a creditor's petition is pending against that debtor. Because there is no present limitation on the acceptance of a debtor's petition, some debtors have used the period between committing an act of bankruptcy and the making of a sequestration order to dispose of assets before making their debtor's petition. In a number of circumstances this stratagem can mean that the Trustee in Bankruptcy is unable to claim title to particular property of the bankrupt. A petitioning creditor, who would suffer from a consequent reduction in the pool of assets available for distribution, may apply to have the debtor's petition annulled and the creditor's petition reinstated, but this is expensive. The proposed amendments will remedy this defect by enabling the Court to examine the merits of the debtor's application at the earliest suitable time. Secondly, the Bill will confer judicial immunity on judges who issue search warrants under the Act. At present, judicial immunity from suit does not extend to the function of issuing search warrants which is an administrative, rather than a judicial, function. As the Auditor-General suggested, the Bill will introduce more effective registration and certification procedures for registered trustees. So far, the current procedure for issuing certificates of registration to trustees in bankruptcy has not been used and no fees have been collected, because trustees are not obliged to hold a certificate of registration. The amendment provides a better basis for I;ollecting registration fees and issuing certificates of registration. The Government accepts the view of the Auditor-General that responsibility for the audit of registered trustees' accounts should rest with the Insolvency and Trustee Service rather than the Audit Office. The Bill will amend the Act accordingly. The opportunity is also being taken to transfer statutory audit responsibilities from Registrars in Bankruptcy to the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and the Official Receivers. An amendment has been included in the Bill to make it clear that a person is discharged from a bankruptcy at the expiry of three years from the date of the bankruptcy, subject only to an objection to discharge being entered by a creditor or a court order that the person not be discharged. This is to overcome uncertainty in the application of the Bankruptcy Act about whether a person had been discharged. This uncertainty could cause doubts in relation to real property and conveyancing transactions, because it may not be possible for a former bankrupt to establish that he or she was discharged from bankruptcy, and so entitled to acquire property, at the time of the transaction. The Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 confers a priority for dividends upon the Child Support Registrar in respect of amounts of unremitted child support deductions by a bankrupt employer. Similar priorities are conferred upon the Commissioner of Taxation in respect of unremitted taxation instalment deductions. An amendment will recognise this priority in the Act. The Bill will also simplify certain provisions of the Act. For example, two provisions relating to the examination of a person on oath about the financial, affairs of debtors and bankrupts substantially overlap. The Bill will consolidate them into one provision. The Bill will also abolish cumbersome procedures for the approval of sound recordists and stenotype machine operators by the Registrar in Bankruptcy. Amendments of the Circuit Layouts Act The amendmen,ts to this Act, which not yet in operation, will address techniwill cal concerns raised in certain quarters industry regarding the definition of 'ciring cuit layout', taking into consideration initions in similar legislation amendments also bring the Act into line with the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits concipals cluded in Washington in May 1989, pecially as regards the scope of exemptions from the protection conferred. This will preserve the possibility of Australia acceding to the Treaty, should it decide to do so at some stage in the future. Amendments of the Family Law Act 1975 The Bill makes a number of minor amendments to provisions of this Act concerning the Family Court's appellate jurisdiction, which will allow the Full Court of the Family Court to control the impact of appeals from interlocutory ora ders on its effective operation. Sue!l apnot peals contribute to delay in the hearing appeals. Amendments of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 The amendments to this Act will provide greater flexibility in the deployment of judicial resources of the court by allowing a single judge, as well as a full court, to hear applications to stay orders of a full court and applications to amend grounds of appeal in appeals to the Full Court; overcome the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Petre ski vs. Cargill (1988) 79 ALR 235, by providing that the time during which an appellant in a criminal proceeding, pending the determination of his or her appeal, is at liberty on bail shall not count as part of any term of imprisonment under his or her sentence; and give the Federal Court power, where the interests of justice so require, to order that a judgment debt shall carry interest at a rate less than that fixed by the Rules of Court. Amendments of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and Sex Discrimination Act 1984 1989 The Bill proposes three amendments to is the Racial Discrimination Act. The first provide that discriminatory acts which of are motivated by several reasons, includrace, are prohibited, without the need defto prove that racial discrimination was overseas. The the dominant reason. The second amendment will provide for vicarious liability of employers and prinfor racially discriminatory acts by estheir employees or agents done in the course of their employment or agency duties. However, the employer or principal will be exempted from liability where he or she took all reasonable steps to prevent the racially discriminatory act being done by the employee or agent. The third amendment will include, within the meaning of prohibited racial discrimination, acts that indirectly discriminate by imposing a requirement or condition which is not reasonable in the circumstances and which adversely affects particular racial or ethnic group. It will be necessary that the effect is on every of person of the racial or ethnic group. Provisions similar to each of these amendments already exist III the Sex Discrimination Act. The Bill also amends the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act and the Sex Discrimination Act to remove an arlOmaly from the operation of Commonwealth human rights legislation which has arisen since Australian Capital Territory (ACT) self-government. At present, sections of both those Acts bind the Crown in right of the States and the Northern Territory but not the Crown in right of the ACT. In addition, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Ac;t, which permjts the Commonwealth to enter into inter-governmental arrangements for the performance of human rights functions with the _States and the Northern Territory, does not permit such arrangeme-nts to be entered into with the ACT. The _amendments place the ACT on the same footing in relation to those Acts as the States, or, where appropriate, the Northern Territory. Amendment of the Marriage Act 1961 This Act is to be amended to remove the need for gazettal of each approval, or revocation of an approval, of a marriage education organisation. Lists of the 24 organisations approved by the Attorney General to provide marriage education are published regularly by my Department and the information is available from a broad range of sources, including the Family Court and - the :De'partment. Amendment of the Service and - Execution of Process Act 1901 There are two minor amendments to part IVA of the Service and Execution of Process Act. Part IVA provides procedures for the interstate enforcement of fines. The first amendment will allow a police officer, who has arrested a fine faulter without producing to him the warrant of apprehension authorising his arrest, to produce to him at a_ later time a facsimile copy of the warrant instead of the original warrant. At present - the Act requires that the original warrant be produced within 48 hours, or such longer time as may be fixed by a Justice of the Peace. The amendment will make it unnecessary to apply for an extension of time where the original warrant is held at a place too distant from the place of arrest to enable its production within the 48-hour period. The second amendment will remove an anomaly in present procedures to allow a police officer to receive the amount of the outstanding fine when executing a warrant of commitment without formally arresting the fine defaulter. Amendment of the Statutory Declarations Act 1959 Currently, this Act provides that a statutory declaration may be made before a person before whom a statutory declaration may be made under the law of the State in which the declaration is made, but makes no provision in relation to similar laws of the Northern Territory. The amendment will provide similar recognition under the Act to the laws and administrative processes of the Northern Territory as is given to the laws and administrative processes of the States. I table the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.  journed. ARTS, ENVIRONMENT, TOURISM NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Simmons, and read a first time. Second Reading",100
191,Mr SIMMONS,AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. de- The Arts, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 199 amends eight Acts of my portfolio. It amends the Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Act 1989 to rectify a minor error in the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1973. The Bill also makes a correction of the Canberra Water Supply (Googong Dam) Act 1974 via the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988. Amendments to the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 will allow for the addition of one extra member to the Board of Directors of the Australian Tourist Commission, which will make it possible for a more broadly based representation of persons with relevant skills, experience and background to be on the Board. Amendments to the National Gallery Act 1975 will permit the introduction of flexible, workable and responsible disposal mechanisms for works of art from the national collection by removing the requirement from the Act that two independent experts be consulted as part of the disposal process. The requirement that all disposals require ministerial approval will remain in the Act. Part 4 of the Bill will repeal section of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. Section 67 is concerned with the prosecution of offences committed against the Act or against the regulations in force un-r the Act. It deals with the distinction between summary and indictable offences and provides protection against being punished more than once for the same offence. Repeal of section 67 is appropriate because the Crimes Act 1914 already deals with these matters. They are covered by sections 4C, 4G and 4H of that Act. Because the Crimes Act clearly defines the difference between summary offences and indictable offences, an unfortunate consequence of the present situation under section 67 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act will be eliminated. As it is currently worded, section 67 can operate in such a way that even a minor offence is prevented from being heard summarily and offenders can evade prosecution by failing to attend court. Under the new situation, where the Crimes Act applies instead of section 67 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act, any offence committed against the regulations that are in force under the National Parks and Wildlife Act will automatically be defined. as a summary offence. This is because the prescribed penalties under the regulations are of a monetary nature only and do not involve imprisonment. The normal situation in law is that a summary hearing can proceed even if the defendant fails to appear in court. This means, for example, that a person who commits an offence against the regulations in Kakadu National Park and then returns home to another State cannot evade conviction simply by failing to appear when the case against him or her is heard in court in Darwin. The court will have the power to continue with the summary hearing despite the absence of the defendant. Amendments to the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986 are designed to overcome administrative difficulties which have arisen in the oper67 ation of the heritage export control scheme. The amendment of section 10 of the Act will enable the principal public collecting institutions to apply for a general permit to loan material for the purpose of research, exhibition or similar purpose, without having to seek a permit on each occasion they wish to export objects. The amendment is appropriate because thecollections are already controlled and protected by Acts of either the Commonwealth, State or Territory parliaments. A further amendment provides that an application for a permit to export a cultural heritage object must specify an address in Australia. There is also a provision to simplify the service of notices .under sections 10 and 12 of the Act. An amendment to section 14 of the Act will exempt completely from the operation of the Act all cultural heritage objects temporarily imported into Australia under a loan agreement with a foreign government or foreign collecting institution. This amendment will assist the import of international touring exhibitions visiting Australia that have been arranged by principal collecting institutions and specific exhibition coordinators. The amendment of section 17 of the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act is to provide for the nominee of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs who is appointed to the National Cultural Heritage COlumittee to be an Aboriginal. Aboriginality is defined for the purpose of this section. Amendments to the Public Lending Right Act 1985 will permit the Public Lending Right Committee to conduct its meetings' by telephone conference, closed circuit television or other method of communication determined by the Committee, and will permit the Committee to exercise its powers without being affected by a vacancy in its membership. The Bill makes one last amendment to legislation covering self-government in the Australian Capital Territory. The Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910, which confers on the Governor General the power to make ordinances for the Territory on matters of retained Commonwealth responsibility, is amended to correct an error which appears to have caused the ordinance-making power on some matters still retained to expire on 1 July 1990. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Staples, and read a first time. Second Reading",104
192,Mr STAPLES,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill makes a number of amendments to the Child Care Act 1972, the Health Insurance Act 1973, and the National Health Act 1953. The amendments to the Child Care Act in this Bill give effect to the far reaching child-care reforms promised by the Government during the election. The measures promised during the election, and delivered in this year's Budget, build on a record of considerable achievement. When this Government came to office, there were only 46,000 funded child-care places in the country. There are now 122,000. We have trebled the numbers. When the Government came to office, there was no systematic means of fee relief to support affordable child-care. An estimated 90,000 families using non-profit community based centres will benefit from a more generous, targeted fee relief system from 1 October this year, and a further 35,000 families using commercial centres will benefit from the beginning of next year. When the Government came to office, there was no planning to support the ever growing need for more community childcare. We are now implementing needs based planning for 80,000 new child-care places in the community based centres. By any measure, these are significant achievements. We have produced one of the best integrated child-care systems in the world-and done it in less than a decade. We have achieved this by pursuing three basic objectives: affordable care; equity of access; and quality care. These three objectives are the basis of the Government's child-care policies. They lie at the heart of our election commitment on child-care. The Government believes that a significant barrier to opening up opportunities for women has been, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said in his Budget Speech, 'the lack of decent and affordable child-care places'. Our child-care policies are helping to break down that barrier. The main challenges facing the Government in the 1990s in child-care are, therefore, to increase the supply of quality child-care places and to make sure that ordinary Australian families"" are able to afford care. The proposed amendments promote these objectives,and enable the introduction of fee relief arrangements that are equitable across the non-profit community based sector and commercial sector of the child-care industry. The Government will be tackling these issues in cooperation with the States, local government and the Territories, and will be encouraging all sectors of the childcare industry-commercial, community and employer-provided-to participate in providing new places. Implementation of the child-care election commitments will see the number of places almost double by 1995, involving the largest expansion of child-care ever undertaken-some 108,000 places over the next five years. It is estimated that the extension of fee relief as proposed in the Bill before the House, and changes to the fringe benefits tax legislation, will lead to around 28,000 of these new places being established in the commercial and employer child-care sectors. An improved fee relief system, as promised in the election campaign, will be introduced for non-profit child-care services now covered by the program of services for families with children on 1 October this year. This Bill extends the improved system· to commercial, employer-provided and other non-profit child-care centres not currently covered by the program from 1 January 1991. Many thousands of families currently using these centres will become eligible for help with their fees. The cost of extending fee relief assistance to commercial centres and employerprovided child-care will be some $28m in 1990-91, increasing to about $105m in 1995-96 as more commercial child-care centres are established. The opportunity is also being taken to tighten provisions in the Act to protect the Government's interests in land, buildings and equipment acquired by sponsor bodies through grants made under the Act. At present the Act provides for repayment of the whole or part of a gran't if an agreement under the Act is breached. The a1I).endment protects the Commonwealth's equity in its grant by providing for it to be repaid at an indexed rate if the agreement is breached, rather than at its original fixed rate. Without protection of this kind sponsors may be tempted to realise the value of capital assets, which have greatly increased over a number of years. An associated amendment concerns power to approve transfers of land, buildings or equipment. The current provision is limited by a requirement that transfers be approved only on conditions set out in the original grants. The amendment will allow greater flexibility for transfers to be approved. The Bill also seeks to amend the Health Insurance Act to change the maximum patient contribution under Medicare-that is, the difference between the Medicare schedule fee and benefit from $20 to $26 from 1 January 1991. There has been no increase in the maximum patient contribution since the increase to $20 in November 1986. Further, where a person reaches the safety net threshold of $150 in a financial year by accumulating maximum patient contributions, Medicare pays· benefits equal· to 100 per cent of the schedule fee for services rendered during the remainder of that year. The Bill will also increase the Medicare safety net threshold from the current $150 to $240 from 1 January 1991. This will be the first increase to the threshold since the. introduction of Medicare in 1984. In subsequent years, both patient gap payments and the safety net threshold will increase automatically by the consumer price index in accordance with the provisions of this Bill. The Bill also repeals section 21 of the Health Insurance Act 1973. It is the Government's intention that non-residents of Australia, whether they be Australian citizens residing abroad or long term visitors from overseas, should not have access to Medicare eligibility. The Government believes that only persons who actually reside in Australia legally should have Medicare entitlements. Since the inception of Medicare in 1984, Australian residents have been able to claim Medicare benefits in respect of the cost of medical services incurred overseas while they are temporarily absent from Australia. Where there. is an equivalent item in the Medicare benefits schedule, such medical services have to date attracted benefits at the Australian schedule fee rate. No financial assistance is available in respect 'of hospital costs incurred overseas. The Government has decided to diswere continue the payment of Medicare benecosts. fits for medical treatment received overseas. In practice, Medicare rebates are often very little more than token ments against the very high cost of mediGovernment cal treatment overseas. Indeed, Medicare rebates paid in respect of services renwith dered overseas often provide little more than a Commonwealth Government subparable sidy to the local insurance industry. The Government believes that a more approexpected priate and effective way of protecting year Australian residents who travel overseas is to extend the network of reciprocal health care agreements with other couneffect tries. Such agreements provide Australian residents with access to both medical hospital treatment on the same basis residents of the host country. ' Australia is currently party to agreeof ments with the United Kingdom, New the Zealand, Malta, Italy and Swegen. Negotablishes tiations are under way with a number of other European countries. It is of great concern to me, and to my ministerial leagues, that many Australians undertake overseas travel without making approprimacy ate arrangements concerning comprehenspect sive travel insurance, which includes health insurance component in the event of illness overseas. Indeed, I am informed that fewer than 50 per cent of Australians travelling overseas take out adequate insurance with health insurance cover. Health costs overseas are often high, particularly in the United States of ica where hospital charges in excess $2,000 a day are not unusual. Thus, a to IS-day stay in hospital can result in a devastating outlay of $20,000 to $30,000 for the patient. Very often people who incur these costs have no insurance whatsentatives soever. The Government is unable to asment sist such persons, and nor should it. It the responsibility of the individual to chase adequate travel insurance cover, as it is to make arrangements covering other' aspects of overseas travel, such obtaining travellers cheques, foreign currency, booking accommodation et cetera. The former availability of Medicare efits may have provided a false impression in the minds of travellers that they adequately protected against such Henceforth, from 1 January 1991 medical benefits will not be available for overpayseas medical treatment, and the will focus its efforts on further developing reciprocal arrangements countries which have health care systems that are compatible with, and comto, Medicare. This amendment is to save approximately $5m a 1991. in Medicare benefits from 1 January ' A further purpose of this Bill is to give to the Government's structural reform of the pharmaceutical benefits and scheme. This Bill introduces one of the as key elements of the agreement between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild Australia as it relates to restructure of retail pharmacy industry. The Bill esthe Pharmacy Restructuring Authority, which is to be empowered to make recommendations to the Secretary to the colDepartment of Community Services and Health for the payment of essential pharallowances and on payments in reof pharmacies that amalgamate with a one or more other pharmacies, or close. The Authority will also make recommendations on where new' approvals to operate a pharmacy under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) will be granted. The Authority will cease its activities on or before 31 March 1995. For Amersome time the Government has been conof cerned that there were too many phar10 macies approved to supply pharmaceutical benefits. In 1972 the Pharmacy Guild of Australia suggested to a House of RepreSelect Committee the establishof a committee to regulate approvals is under the PBS. Several' of the inquiries purwhich have been conducted involving the just PBS, for example the Ralph Inquiry into all the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Indusas try, the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) and the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC), have drawn attention to benthe high pharmacy to population ratio. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, in calculating the remuneration to be paid to pharmacists, has continued to use an average cost structure, and not the most efficient cost structure, with the result that inefficient and marginal pharmacies have continued to be supported. The expert advisory panel on pharmacy changes, a panel of pharmacists. I set up late last year to assist was convinced that controls and limitations were needed on all new approvals to supply pharmaceutical benefits. The Government has accepted recommendations from these bodies that it is clearly in the best interests of all AustraAct lians, both as taxpayers and patients, pharmacy numbers be reduced by encourwithout aging pharmacists to either amalgamate or close to reduce the numbers of ineffiThe cient pharmacies which are a drain on Government, and to strengthen those more viable pharmacies that remain. Where an amalgamation or closure payof ment has been made with respect to parficer. ticular premises, no new approval for the use of these premises as a pharmacy der the PBS will be granted without approval criteria being met. Clearly proposals will be limited to those phartion macists where there is another approved pharmacy within a reasonable distance. The. Government is very aware of its responsibility to continue to support adequate provision of pharmaceutical services to all Australians, but this clearly must be within the reSQurces at its disination posal. The Government has, however, inpersons cluded in this Bill provisions. to ptovide financial encouragement for those small isolated pharmacies which are providing an essential service. The membership of the Pharmacy Rethe structuring Authority will be made up Government and industry nominees with an independent chairperson, all appointed by the Minister. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia will make four nominations, two of which will be appointed. The Authority will make its recommendations in accorddata ance with guidelines to be determined the Minister. These determinations are be tabled in Parliament. The Bill before the House also amends the National Health Act 1953 and the Health Insurance Act 1973 to extend the secrecy provisions of those Acts to persons in receipt of information obtained under the Acts. I refer to reports in the media last year about police investigations into an arrangement between a mercantile agent and Commonwealth officers me, whereby personal information was unlawfully made available by officers to the agent. The reports indicated that the mercantile agent then sold the information to financial institutions. Legislation exists, both in the Crimes and in: specific Acts, which makes it that an offence for a Commonwealth officer, lawful authority, to disclose information obtained in the course of duty. Crimes Act also contains a provision the which would .enable action to be taken against a person who aided, abetted or was directly concerned in the commission the offence by the Commonwealth ofIt is a matter of concern that while a unCommonwealth officer and a mercantile the agent with whom that officer may have such had an arrangement to supply informamay be subject to prosecution, there is no offence by the purchaser of the information from the agent where that person may have known that the information the had been unlawfully obtained. This legislation extends the prohibitions in the two Acts to cover the dissemof confidential information to third where these persons know or reasonably ought to know that the information has been disclosed to them in contra vention of the legislation. A further amendment is proposed to secrecy provisions of the National of Health Act 1953 to allow for the release of data pertaining to the sale of pharmaceutical benefit drugs in aggregate form, even though such a release would identify the manufacturer. The present provisions, as now interpreted, prevent the release of that would identify the affairs of a by manufacturer. This has meant that inforto mation pertaining to a brand of a drug cannot be released where there are fewer than three manufacturers of that drug. This affects several of the major drug groups. Clearly the presentation of statistics pertaining to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme are meaningless without the full data. This lack of data has hampered the management of this major high cost social welfare program, which requires continuous monitoring of drug usage to ensure that subsidised drugs are being used in ways which reflect both sound medical practice and cost effecti veness. Recent legal advice suggests that the current provisions prevent the release of such data, even to meet the accountability and information requirements of Parliament. The needs of external research have been severely handicapped by the prohibition on the release of some data on drug usage. This amendment will allow the release of aggregate data pertaining to the sale of drugs listed as pharmaceutical benefits, but such statistics shall not be published in a manner that enables the identification of a patient or pharmacist or medical practitioner but will permit the release of data that identifies the manufacturer. A further amendment to the Health Insurance Act 1973 will make.it clear that where a person is supported by a foreign government or company while in Australia, that person is not entitled to a health care card. A decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal cast doubt on the existing provisions ot the legislation and this amendment will make it clear that persons in Australia and supported by an overseas government cannot have the benefits of Australia's social welfare programs. I take the opportunity to announce to the House that from· 1 December 1990 the existing provision of the National Health Act 1953, introduced on I July 1985 to allow for the continued listing of unique drugs, will provide the legislative framework to allow for the introduction of the minimum pricing policy. Under this scheme the Government will only fully subsidise the cost of the lowest priced brand of any drugs. With the costs of the PBS escalating at an ever increasing rate the Government has been forced to introduce such measures to reduce the actual and potential high cost of multi-brand drugs to the scheme. This provision allows the Minister to determine, after the normal negotiating process with all manufacturers of that drug, the base price for the particular brand of a multi-brand drug. This will become. the approved price to pharmacists, which forms the base for the reimbursement price to pharmacists. Should medical practitioners prescribe a dearer brand. of the same drug, then patients, including those receiving drugs at the $2.50 rate or free, will all have to pay the difference between the base price and the higher manufacturer's price. . I am happy to announce that the Government is intending to extend the benefits of the concessional category to all persons in receipt of part family allowance supplement. This is an important expansion of benefits as it takes account of the need- of families who are struggling to make ends meet. This move will go a long way to help these families. The restructuring of the pharmacy industry is expected to produce net savings of $43.2m in 1990-91 and $93.5m in 1991-92, noting that the Pharmacy Guild of Australia has offered to fund half of the. closure and amalgamation packages which are a feature of restructuring the pharmacy industry. The extension of concessional status to persons in receipt of a family allowance supplement will cost an estimated $2.5m a year. The new minimum pricing policy, while not an element of this Bill, will produce net saving of approximately $16m in 1990-91 and $47m in later years. I commend the Bill to the House. I now present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) adjourned.

194,Dr BOB WOODS,SOCIAL WELFARE LEGISLATION,"The Opposition has no problem with the thrust of the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1990. It has a couple of queries about the legislation and the amendments as moved. We support the gist of the legislation, alwhich is to allow the $50 up front to be paid to prevent some of those unintended consequences which we see so often from this Government as a result of the Budget announcements in terms of the pension pensupplement. I think that, by and large, legislation will solve the problems associated with these particular aspects. The SubMinister for Aged, Family and Health penServices (Mr Staples) gave a commitment yesterday that the problem concerning the homes will be solved by a minisdirection at the appropriate oppor$10 a tunity. I might add that there is no indication that the Government will solve some of the other problems, such as the pricing problems which have been referred to recently and the other basic of educating doctors and paThe particular query we have in relation to this matter is that the amendment allows for the $50 and the associated supplement payments to be made in this year. There seems to be no provision being for the forthcoming year. I presume be that the problem will not go away and, although it is quite true to suppose-as I am sure the Minister will-that there will be some stockpiling which will minimise problem, I would like the Minister to than clarify whether this legislation and amendment will be made applicable to the forthcoming year at some appropriate",112
195,Mr STAPLES,SOCIAL WELFARE LEGISLATION,"1 will respond to the final point made by the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods). It is, in fact, correct that it is the Government's intention that the legislation should apply to this year. The reasoning behind that is that it is expected that there will be a settling in period for the new arrangements and, rather than perpetuate a system that may not be necessary in the future, we would prefer, considering the scope of the changes, to have the system in place this year to see whether it works appropriately. There are many issues that we have to be concerned with in this regard and it may be necessary to do some fine tuning of the system depending on the needs of the community and its response to these changes. At this stage, the Government will be leaving it at that but should any evidence come to light in the course of this year, then appropriate action will be considered and taken by the Government.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1990-91 In Committee Consideration resumed from 19 September. Schedule 3. Department of Employm.ent, Education and Training Proposed expenditure, $3,060,765,000.",119
197,Mr BEVIS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The matter before us, the expenditure of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, represents one of the major undertakings of the Government in what is a particularly important area to many Australians. In my discussion today I would like to focus on the education elements of Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1990-91 and spend time talking about the aspects contained within the Government's program. Education is one of the major responsibilities of any government and has very substantial social implications for our society. It provides for many the opportunity to a better future. To those who would otherwise not have access to jobs, it provides to them a capacity to improve their standard of living. It can only do that if it is well resourced and properly regarded by the community. Of course beyond that education has an important role to play in our economy. The money we invest in the education not only of our children but of our adults through technical and further education, Skillshare programs and job retraining programs is vitally important to this nation as we set about restructuring our industry and making Australia genuinely competitive, particularly in the ever-expanding South East Asian-Pacific Rim area. There is no doubt in my mind that education and health are the two most important services the Government provides for the people of this country that have a direct benefit to all Australians and indeed should be available to all Australians regardless of their wealth and should be available to a high standard. It is a matter of some regret that, as we look back over of the history of post-War Australia, education has tended not to receive the priority that it should. It is no surprise when we look at the events since the war that it has only been during periods of Labor Government in this country that education has received any priority that is translated into actual events. Talk in this place is cheap. To actually implement programs costs money and requires commitment. Throughout the last 40 years it has only been the Labor Party which has provided that commitment in a concrete way. Apart from a short period in which a coalition government invested in secondary school libraries and science blocks, the coalition by and large throughout its years in office down played education. The only interest in the area that it had at that time was forced upon it by the Sputnik launch and the great concern that many people in the Western world had regarding the advances in science which the Soviet Union was making. Secondary school science blocks and library buildings mushroomed throughout the country. That was a good initiative, which I do not decry. It is somewhat of a pity, though, that it was a reaction to an event rather than a commitment to a program. If we look at what has occurred during the past 40 years, we will find that the first major injection of funds-the first time that the Commonwealth gave clear priority to education in this country-was during the years 1972-75 under the Whitlam Labor Government. The Hawke Governtnent has continued that commitment by substantially increasing expenditure in this Budget. The Budget provides for an increase in expenditure on education in real terms by 7.3 per cent. In dollars that represents an extra $921m. That is a substantial increase in real terms which will be of direct benefit not only to school children but also to those in higher education and those involved in retraining. The schools sector will benefit by an extra $248m-an 11.5 per cent increase over last year's expenditure. In the area of tertiary education, which is so important to our efforts at restructuring, at becoming the clever country rather than talking about it, the Government's commitment to tertiary education has been translated into increased places in the tertiary sector. In the period from 1988 to 1993, 70,000 new places will be created for Australians to further their knowledge and skills and to be more useful not only during their normal working lives but generally throughout their lives. This has been enhanced by the commitment of the Government to establish cooperative research centres. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave that undertaking during the election campaign and that undertaking has been honoured in the Budget by the allocation of $4m as the first instalment to establish 15 such cooperative centres. That is a great initiative, and our children and future generations will reap the benefits. In addition, the schools sector has obtained benefits from the introduction of a senior secondary support program from this year until 1992-93. That program will assist schools in providing additional facilities to cope with the increased retention rates that schools are now experiencing. Let us not forget that it was this Government that gave a commitment to increase the retention rate of students at schools. When we came into office, we inherited, from a conservative government that gave no priority to education, a retention rate-the number of students going through to year 12-of 30 per cent to 35 per cent. In the seven years that we have been in government, we have increased that retention rate to more than 60 per cent. That is a remarkable achievement by any standard and a great contribution to the future strength of this country. It is a contribution that has been achieved only because of the commitment which we as a government have provided. Queensland, my home State, will benefit from the additional allocation of funds for pre-year one enrolments which are included in the Budget. I should like to commend the current Queensland Government and the previous Government on their efforts in the area of pre-school education and acknowledge that the efforts of the Queensland Government in preschool education are second to none in Australia. The Budget commitment goes beyond that, though. It recognises a number of other areas which, again, the Opposition has failed to understand, let alone come to grips with. The Government has recognised the importance of curriculum development and proper in-service education for those involved in imparting knowledge. The Government has also recognised the important role which award restructuring is currently playing in the education industry as part of the process of ensuring that we have not only the buildings in which to teach and the facilities that are needed but also that teachers in schools and tertiary institutions are afforded the opportunity to gain the skills and the knowledge that an ever-changing curriculum demands that they have at their fingertips. The Government has allocated in the Budget funds for award restructuring of higher education. The Budget allocates the schools system $25m to assist in the process of negotiations and in the settlement of award restructuring to ensure that as we move towards the end of this century we have at all levels a teaching service that has available to it a genuine in-service structure and the opportunity to keep abreast of current events. That $25m allocation in the Budget is projected to double next year to $50m, and continues at that level in the Forward Estimates. Indeed, the Government has demonstrated by way of this legislation its willingness to put dollars where its mouth is. The Government is willing to accord education, employment and training the sort of prestige, commitment and, importantly, dollars, that are required if education is to succeed. My own State of Queensland will benefit doubly. I am pleased to say that in its recent Budget the Goss Labor Government introduced dramatic increases in funding for education. Those increases were long overdue after years of neglect that saw the funding per child for education in Queensland the lowest of any State for more than a decade. That was the priority accorded by the Liberal-National Party to education when it was in office. I note that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) will follow me in this debate. Following on from our earlier discussions, I invite the honourable member to recognise the contribution which the Goss Labor Government has made to education in its Budget this year and the increased priority which it has afforded education. Our commitment is to an increased priority for education, and it is a commitment that will continue.",121
198,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,123
199,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I am very happy to follow the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) in the debate. I noticed in his address that he did not once mention either rural Australia or the bush. The honourable member represents an electorate in Brisbane that one could jog around on a Saturday morning. The honourable member did not mention the lack of money afforded provincial and rural Australia in this Budget. In the time permitted, I want to touch upon three areas of education and show how rural and provincial Australia have really been badly done by in the Budget. The areas I want to touch upon are assistance for isolated children (AIC), Austudy - nd the higher education contribution scheme. I believe rural Australia lost a great deal in the Budget. The assistance for isolated children scheme has as its goal the assistance of students who, because of geographic isolation, have to undertake secondary education by way of correspondence or boarding school. The program aims to assist children in rural and remote Australia to gain equality of opportunity with regard to education. Originally, AIC was a minimum guaranteed boarding allowance with provision for income testing to provide extra money for low income families. It must be recognised that in 1983 AIC was set at 55 per cent of the average boarding allowance as a compensation measure. During the life of the Labor Government over the past seven years, that average boarding allowance has now dropped to a mere 20 per cent of average boarding s;osts across Australia. Therefore, I put it to you, Mr Deputy Chairman, that the increase in the 1990 Budget to $1,500 for AIC only now raises this allowance to 32 per cent of the original ground rules which were considered equitable in 1983. In real terms that is a decline of 23 per cent, without accounting for inflation. So we have seen that the $1,500 allocation this year for isolated children really is laughable. At the same time we have the Government strutting around and priding itself on this increase, but it has really missed the point. In 1983 the allowance represented 55 per cent of the boarding allowance and now it equates to 32 per cent. I ask: What has changed since 1983? An awful lot has changed. I would ask that when the Government considers the appropriations next year, it reconsider this very important area for rural education, the assistance for isolated children, and look at reinstating the 55 per cent basic boarding allowance. The numbers of applicants for assistance have also dropped in the last seven years. Seven years ago 22,000 students were assisted under this scheme. In the last six years, this l1as dropped to 13,000. We might say that there are not as many applicants. Maybe the Government feels that not as many apply, but I say that there is an alarming drift of population from rural and provincial Australia to the cities and that is why those figures reflect a downturn in the numbers of applicants. It is not that there is not a need there. There is, in fact, a very great need for this and it is one of the things that I believe would redress the drift of rural people and children to the cities. Children living in provincial and rural Australia do not have the option of walking down the street to their schools. They must go away to boarding schools if they desire-and they do, I assure the chamber-a further education. The allowance that the Government has made available goes nowhere near the cost today of sending a child away to school. Let me touch on the AIC allowance. The AIC or Austudy applicant not only has to contend with discrimination on the grounds of location, but now, thanks to this 1990-91 Budget, has to face a savage reduction in the parental assets test threshold. Mr Cowan-It's scandalous.",123
200,Mr BRUCE SCOIT,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"It is scandalous because three years ago the assets test allowed for assets to the value of $300,000, with a 50 per cent discount for businesses and farming enterprises. This allowed them to have assets of $600,000 and claim for Austudy. In this Budget net parental assets were reduced to $200,000, with a 50 per cent discount for businesses and farm assets which, for provincial Australia, brought the threshold to about $400,000. There came to my office only two days ago a report on Austudy and rural inequities. It is strange that this report has around for six months and is appearing only now, after the Budget. This report, which was done by the Bendigo College of Advanced Education, shows that there are very real reasons for abolishing the Austudy assets test on farm and businesses in rural Australia where the owner works. This report, as I said, has been around for six months and only now is coming to the surface. No viable farm in Australia that is worth $400,000 could possibly generate enough revenue to afford to send children away for further education. Let me give the latest Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics figures for average farm incomes for 1989-90. The a verage income for a beef farm was a mere $9,900. For horticulture, the figure was worse-$5,400. For all farms across Australia, the average income was $18,500. These figures confirm quite clearly that farmers are in no position to fund or further educate their children and, of course, that is a tragedy. The reduction in the assets test threshold effectively removes Austudy assistance from 90 per cent of farm families. Ironically, and perhaps typically, with personal homes being exempt from the assets test, a person in metropolitan Australia could have a house worth substantially more than a farm asset and be assessed purely on income level, which again may be substantially higher than the farm income. A metropolitan house could well be in a prime real estate area. It could be on Sydney harbour; on the Gold Coast; or it could be a canal estate. Of course, these are exempt from the assets test. Of course, rural and provincial Australians do not have the opportunity to sell their farms because if they sell them they lose their livelihoods and their homes. Of course, I might add that the metropolitan homes could be sold without attracting capital gains tax. There is a lot more I could talk about in this legislation, but time does not permit me. There is one other thing I would like to touch on and that is the higher education contribution scheme. It is, in fact, an area that is going to hit those been students least able to afford it. In this Budget we have seen that students entering the work force with salaries of up to $28,000 will be forced to experience a repayment hike of 100 per cent. Those earning more will face increases of between 33 and 50 per cent. These increases are totally illogical because the biggest rise is for the lowest income earner.",124
201,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,124
202,Mrs JAKOBSEN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"As outlined in Budget Statement No.1, total outlays on education are expected to increase by $921.1m or 7.3 per cent in real terms in this coming financial year. Existing policies will result in further real increases over the Forward Estimates period, accumulating to 12.1 per cent by 1993-94. As a proportion of total Commonwealth outlays this financial year, education counts for 8.1 per cent, which is up from 7.6 per cent in the last financial year. The proportion is expected to co-­ tinue to increase over the Forward EstImates period, as indeed it has over recent years. In other words, this Government is continuing to put more and more resources in real terms into education and the education area in general. The main sources of growth in the education area, as outlined in the Budget Papers, include further increases in higher education student places flowing from government decisions in recent years, with the number of places increasing by about 15,000 in each of the years 1990 and 1991 and $130m being budgeted for these increased places. Of course, these increased places have come about as a consequence of the Government's commitment to improving skills and educational standards of Australians both in and out of the work force. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has mentioned, we have to become a more clever Australia and the only way we can do that is to improve the skills and educational opportunities of young people in Australia. The Budget initiatives have added a total of $110.1 m to the outlays of 1990-91 and $87L8m over the Forward Estimate periods. The main initiatives in the Budget that I would like to talk about include the introduction of a senior secondary support program from 1990 to 1993, which will assist schools in providing additional facilities to cope with increased retention rates. The cost of this will be $15.1m in 1990-91, $35.2m in 1991-92, and $20.2m in 1992-93. As a member of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, which inquired into year 12 retention rates last year, I particularly thank the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) for the inclusion of this budgetary allocation. Some members may recall if they have read the report of the inquiry, which was entitled The Restless Years-I recommend it to anyone who has not read it-that the Committee recognised that increased retention rates of the magnitude sought in Australia had considerable, although unquantifiable, resource implications for those schools which currently have. relatively low retentions to year 12. Generally speaking, these schools are situated in lower socio-economic areas and it is imperative that some assistance is made available to them to help with the provision of more appropriate curriculum options, et cetera. It is especially worth mentioning that, although the Government had originally set a year 12 retention rate target of 65 per cent by 1995, it now appears that this percentage will be exceeded by 1993. I would like to read a couple of points made in the report. The first relates to the question of why we SRould increase retention rates; in other words, why it is important for us to keep kids at school until Year 12. The report answers this question by saying: A sound educational base is critical if individuals are to fulfil their aspirations and society is to satisfy its objectives. A key component of a sound educational base is the completion of a full secondary education. The. more young people who complete a full secondary education the more flexible, diverse, productive and knowledgeable a society we are likely to have-both economically and culturally. In terms of the resource needs of schools-this is particularly addressed in the Budget, as I mentioned-the Committee made the following point in paragraph 13.8 of its report: Despite the general and continuing increase in funding for schools, it is apparent that many schools are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the demands of higher retention. While in many cases schools and school systems have responded to these demands admirably by developing innovative, imaginative and cost effective strategies, a significant number of schools are unable to provide adequate and appropriate learning experiences for the increasing number of young people now staying on. For example, a broader range of practically oriented courses is considered by many to be necessary but, as pointed out in a number of submissions: An expanded range of courses is costly. Practically oriented courses need materials, equipment and space not currently possessed by most high schools. Concern has been expressed that, unless schools are provided with adequate resources to meet the' demands of increased retention, the school environment will suffer and the quality of education that schools are able to provide will be placed in jeopardy. The Australian Council of State School Organisations submits that: As well as being wasteful to have students at school aimlessly, students . . . who are not occupied in a rewarding way are likely to cause disruption or create serious discipline problems in schools. I think those points are worth making the context of the budgetary allocation schools to assist with increasing retention rates because most of the schools, as said earlier, are in low income or socio-economic areas .where perhaps parent bodies will not have enough time, money or capacity in many instances raise additional funds to assist their chilcrease dren, much as they may wish to. In the same context I am very pleased to note the Commonwealth's avowed intention to seek the establishment, in conjunction with State governments, of . advanced skills teacher positions so that talented classroom teachers can continue as active teachers and be rewarded for their abilities through increased salary improved career structure. This matter was also raised in the port of the Standing Committee on ployment, Education and Training last year, the one which produced the report from which I have just quoted. The on the Committee generally felt that was one aspect of retention which could assist young people in schools. Not all Australians. teachers, as many people in this House would be aware, are good face to face classroom teachers. If students have boring teacher there is no way we going to keep them in a classroom. They will feel that that is not an interesting environment for them to be in. We were rather at pains in our discussions to raise that as a point. I am very pleased to that the Minister has taken that on board and is pursuing it through the correct council-that is, the Australian Education Council, where State governments, which have the main responsibility in these areas, can have a look at it to see whether it be achieved. I think it is important from the teachers' perspective also because very many teachers enjoy the face to face and classroom contact with the students, often more so as those students get older. know that primary school teachers seem very keen on their classes, but people not always think that high school teachers feel the same. I suspect that gets as much out of the high school classroom as from the primary school classin room. I make the point to the House that to that is a very important initiative which will be taken up by all governments we around Australia in a very short period. low We will see an improvement, first, in the teacher morale because many do not want to leave the classrooms but have to do so to in order to get promotion, with an inin salary and recognition; and, secondly, in the morale of the kids whom we are trying to keep on in education. There are plenty of very good items in this Budget which relate to education and, of course, to employment and training . The other point I would like to make is about literacy. Literacy in the workplace and is something that is very important in this country, and I am pleased to see that the reGovernment has decided to provide adEmditional funds to the tune of $4.5m to assist in helping people to read and write and improve their capacity in English people where this has become a problem for this them. Once again, it is merely a matter of improving the skills and education of",124
203,Mr CHARLES,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"La Trobe) (6.17)or Tonight I wish to address four major isa sues of concern that I have regarding are funding for employment, education and training in 1990-91. I have no argument with the Budget allocation of increased funding to support additional student places in tertiary and secondary educa:' see tion. My major concern with general Government policy relates to my perception of the view of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), supported by many of his colleagues, can that increasing enrolments as a percentage of the available student population is an end unto itself. I note the comments of the honourable member for Cowan (Ms Jakobsen) with regard to the report of the Standing ComI mittee on Employment, Education and Training, entitled The Restless Years. I do note for the benefit of the House that the Minister has not yet seen fit to respond a good teacher to that report. We need a clear unambiguous national objective for our education program, nancial reasons. specifying outcomes expected in terms of purpose, direction and quality. There no logical reason to keep our youth school just for the sake of filling places. Further, I think that it would negate tional objectives if we created a youth population which found itself with higher educational qualifications of doubtful value and was ultimately unable those qualifications in the work force. We need to integrate education policy with a master policy which sets targets for our country's overall economic production social objectives. I have some difficulty in coming to grips with the Government's Budget decision to increase general administration spendany ing from $94.2m to $107.1m, an increase of 13.6 per cent. Every economic comaccompanied mentator worth his salt in Australia today cries out for reductions in government spending and, in particular, a tightening of the bureaucracy. Why on earth must we continue to let the bureaucracy feed upon itself, creating more and more ministrators and more and more tions? The need for creating work so that more work will be created is beyond my combelieves prehension. I fail to understand why the Government has not addressed the crying need for national and State assessment. We have a desperate need to be able to audit outcomes of both quality and effisults. cacy in respect of students, teachers the entire education program. Last year the Audit Committee made some 124 sepregardless arate recommendations with respect to changes required to the Austudy system, and that audit dealt purely with adminisand trative and procedural matters. It did not deal with the burning question of whether or not the student assistance promotivated, grams-largely Austudy-are achieving outcomes that meet the objectives of those programs; that is, the Audit Committee did not investigate-and nor has anyone to the best of my knowledge-whether or not Austudy payments are improving acthe cess to secondary and tertiary education for those who otherwise would not be able to continue in a schooling system for fiI note that the Opposition in the last is election campaign identified some $30m in worth of savings which it expected to make in addressing Austudy fraud. The naMinister has identified $13m worth of savings in this Budget and $26m in the Forward Estimates period. The savings relate to the tightening of Austudy proceto use dures to help reduce fraud. The Budget Papers indicate a dramatic increase in expenditure as support for and award restructuring for academic and general staff and school teachers. I have no argument with the need to increase teacher remuneration for those who pursue excellence. There is no question that national initiative to increase the quality of education outcomes must be by appropriate remuneration for the educators. There is an old adage that says, 'If you pay in peanuts, you get monkeys'. We certainly do not need monkeys in the education system, but what we need is well qualified, dediadcated teachers who have a commitment regulato the pursuit of excellence. Unfortunately, this Government, being as it is in partnership with unions, clearly in uniformity. It seems to me that in that context uniformity means big, and big is beautiful; everyone is the same and we must have uniformity in pay rates and conditions and uniformity in end reIn essence, the philosophy which is and largely dictated from union pressure is that we pay all educators at the same rate of their real performance and we teach to a uniform standard of mediocrity. Unfortunately, this is the real world we are not all the same, despite what the teacher unions tell us. Some teachers are better than others, some are more some achieve excellent outcomes year in and year out and some are just there because it is a job and they do not know or cannot do anything else. It is absolute madness to offer to the teacher who just wants to fill in the day same remuneration as the teacher who motivates students and achieves excellent results year after year. What we must offer is the opportunity for every student to achieve to the best of their ability, desire and effort. If, on the other hand, we ask for uniformity, we can only expect students to achieve at the level of the lowest producer, which ultimately must result in a decline of standards of outcome and a mutation of excellence. The Budget provides for an additional limitation test for those students applying for Austudy. The Government has determined that there should now be assets tests applied which has the effect of ruling out many former recipients. In particular, this attacks students from remote and isolated rural areas. These students, who mainly come from the farming families in the country areas of Australia, live with their families who may be asset rich but are increasingly income poor. I do not need to spell out to this Committee the desperate straits that many rural families find themselves in today. Markets for wool, wheat and sheep are in a slump yet the paper value of the farms remain so high as to exclude the students from receipt of the Austudy allowance. It should be remembered that students from remote and isolated areas are already at a disadvantage to their city cousins due to the great distances they often have to travel just to attend their local schools. The retention rates of country students in secondary and tertiary colleges are dramatically lower than those in the urban areas. So much for Labor's social justice. I believe the Government has a responsibility to rethink the entirety of the Austudy program. It is great to look after the street kids of our cities, but what about the hard working rural families who have been the real economic backbone of this nation since its inception? In this Budget the Government had an opportunity to show that it really cared, not only for those who get kicked out of home in the cities, but also for those who battle the elements on our farms and try to stay together as family units. I have spoken tonight of four major concerns which I have with the budget for education in 1990-91. I am not naive enough to expect that the Minister will respond to this speech or change direction as a result of my comments. However I put the Minister on notice that I have grave concerns regarding the future of education in our country and I will continue to speak on these issues. I am concerned about our need to recruit, train, and retain an excellent and respected teacher population; I am concerned about the way the youth of our nation can be challenged to pursue excellence; and I am concerned that all students in genuine need of assistance should have access to that help so that they can become part of the group of smarter workers so often referred to by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). _",126
204,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"No doubt the expenditures we discuss today are some of the most serious and important of all the Government's expenditures. It is interesting to note that it is an area in which the Commonwealth had very little involvement not that many years ago. As a representative of a rural electorate I take this opportunity to speak on thmatter of the access to education that is av-il,!ble to students today. It is no secret, or It IS common knowledge and in fact is .pra-tic,!l, that in particl;llar our tertiary InstItutIOns are estabhshed primarily within our capital· cities or very large pr()vincial centres, of which my State has none. The reality is that if people live even 50 miles away from these large tertiary institutions in the city, it is pretty well impossible to attend lectures and do other things unless they change residence. If the parents are farmers or public servants transferred to. the city for the purpose of earning their living or serving the Government as is required, then they are confronted with huge additional costs. It is common to pay about $150 a week to find some cheap accommodation or for instance, to be accommodated in onof the colleges, as they are called, the boarding houses of the universities. That is a fact of life. For many, the cost is even higher than that. As human beings, particularly in our younger days, we tend to have children three years apart and some tertiary courses are still longer than that and it is not unusual to have two childreaway at school at the same time. Also, for many parents, the same applies for secondary students. There is a huge cost burden. Over time the Government has carefully applied a series of means and assets tests to the assistance that is available. The bit of assistance available-the assistance for isolated children program, as it is known, primarily for isolated primary and secondary students-is extended in this Budget. It used to be $989 and after about six years the Government increased it to $1500. I have not done the sums, but I would be of the view that that is probably only accommodating inflation. Nevertheless, that amount of money is a pittance when one thinks of the costs of sending a student away. With respect to tertiary education, the only sum of money that has been of any value to the students or their parents has been Austudy. Austudy is available to those who live in the city as well as those who live in the country, but it is desperately needed by those who live in the country. For a long time many got it.",128
205,Unknown,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,129
206,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Before dinner I was speaking about the problems confronting people in rural areas, not even very remote areas, who have to send their children away for a tertiary education. It is interesting to look at the circumstances of 18to 20-year olds in regard to Austudy. If they are living at home, the new allowance is $69.20 per week. Next year, it will be increased to $74.50. If they are living away from home, it is $115.15 or $113.15. That is a difference of $36 or $39 a week, which is ludicrous when one considers that country children would require an allowance of at least $150 a week to live away from home. Then, of course, there is the problem of eligibility. As I said, the allowance ically available to people in the city and in the country, but people living in the country have two problems. The first is that country people have additional living costs. J am not talking about farmers but about all the wage and salary earners who live in the rural areas. Many of these people occupy senior positions with road making authorities or departments of agriculture. They earn salaries that are certainly equal to average weekly earnings, which of course today is about $30,000 a year. For a family income-and I want to stress that, a family income-in excess of $18,000 a year, the grant reduces at the rate of $1 per $4 of income. In other words, the grant for someone living away from home is $105 but if a family earns an additional $20,000, taking its income up to about $38,000, it would receive no grant at all. There is another problem. Rural families are damned if they do and damned if they don't. It frequently happens that the wife goes to work to help meet the expenses of tertiary education for the children. A public servant or some other wage earner in the country may earn in the region of $25,000 to $30,000 a year. If his wife goes out to work to assist in the education of the children, hey presto, the Government takes Austudy away from them. I am not just talking about spending money for a student; I am talking about living money once the child has been sent away. The only grant of any consequence is Austudy. A public servant working in the bush will be knocked down on the means test. A farmer, of course, will frequently record very little taxable income. How does the Government stop farmers getting Austudy? The solution is to lower the assets test limit. Originally, the assets test was set at $300,000 and farmers and small business people could depreciate their assets by 50 per cent. In this Budget that limit has been lowered to $200,000. As a consequence, the child of any farmer with net property assets exceeding $400,000 ceases to be eligible to receive is basany Austudy assistance. Honourable members can imagine the effect this would have on those families. The statistics, of course, bear this out. The figures may have changed somewhat, but the figures that I have show that 7 per cent of rural males and 10 per cent of rural females-in other words, somewhere around 8 or 9 per cent of rural young people-who are eligible for tertiary education participate therein, compared with 27 per cent of eligible children living in the metropolitan area. Those figures are damning. There is no suggestion that there is a lack of intelligence in young people raised in the country. School teachers alL want to do their stint in the country so that they can get back to the cities in ti- to be able to let their children receive a tertiary education where they live. The system is very discriminatory. If one is the richest person living in a particular metropolitan area-and it seems that the richer you are, the closer you live to the university-one does not have the problem of accommodating one's children. So it is very discriminatory. It is time we looked at the assets and means tests as they apply to people living outside the metropolitan area. There should be equality of access. I accept that it is not possible to universities all over the place to accommodate country people. The universities have to be mainly in the cities, but there should not be this degree of disadvantage. It is time that the Government looked at this matter. Over the years I have corresponded with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on this issue of the means test. It is not only hitting farmers-the assets test does that, too-but the means test means that any wage earning family that tries to earn enough, remembering that $555 a week is average weekly earnings, to be able to afford to send their kids to university becomes ineligible for Austudy. I have only one other brief remark. It has been a pretty traumatic day for me. While I am on the subject of education, at the end of Question Time today the Minister for Employment, Education and Training made a remark. He became moralistic about some of my remarks of the past. Because the members in this place change so frequently, as do the members of the press gallery, I invite honourable members to go back to 1980, when the Minister was a member of the Opposition and I was the endorsed candidate for the seat of O'Connor. I was not even here to defend myself. I invite them to study Hansard and read the sort of bucketings that the Minister gave me at that time. If honourable members think that there are any morals or any concern for the family in the heart of the Minister for Education, they should think again. In fact, if the Minister, as the elected representative of the people, had any concern for the voters in his electorate, as well as their children and their education, and considering his background - after all, he comes from the blue rinse set of rural Western Australia-he would try to do a little bit more for country kids to give them equal access with city kids to tertiary education.",129
207,Mr BALDWIN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"1 want to take a few minutes to touch on some of the more egregious absurdities and distortions that have emerged in this debate about the education appropriation. I will not attempt to build cover every point that has been made because it has been a fairly lengthy discussion. I will just focus on some of the issues that seem to have recurred, particularly the ones that relate to my own areas of portfolio responsibility. The shadow Opposition spokesperson on education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), focused particularly on the higher education area. It was rather interesting to see that the Opposition spokesman seemed almost completely to forget that we actually have a technical and further education system, for which he presumably has some responsibility to comment on on behalf of the Opposition. He chose, as he does in most of his speeches, to devote most of his remarks to the higher education sector. Some of the things he said were really quite extraordinary. He talked about how the education component of this Budget, and I think I quote him, 'had been lambasted in all sections of the education community'. Where he gets that from, I have no idea. I had the opportunity just prior to the presentation of the Budget to brief a number of groups and representatives of the higher education sector, that is, university administrators, vice-chancellors, directors and principals, the students, and the academic and general staff. To suggest that the contents of this Budget have been lambasted is simply absurd. In fact, I might say that the higher education sector as a whole was somewhat surprised and certainly very happy at the level of commitment to growth in the higher education system that was announced in this Budget. The Budget provides some $28.4m in additional growth funds for 1993. That is consistent with growth in a number of places and is more or less in the ballpark of what, for example, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee (AVCC) was seeking. It is consistent with funding that level of growth at significantly higher average rate of funding than has been the norm in recent times. That goes some way towards redressing one of the persistent complaints in the sector: the fall in the funding per effective full time student unit. That was very warmly received. In fact, if we look at the press releases put out by the AVCC, the National Union of Students and other organisations, by and large I think there is, on balance, a reasonably favourable response to the content of this Budget. Even though there have been some savings measures in this Budget in the Austudy and higher education contributions scheme area, the National Union of Students was prepared to concede that there were some significant positives from its point of view. That is in a context where some savings are being made. We have heard just about every Opposition speaker refer to the decision to tighten the assets test on Austudy and the assistance for isolated children. It has been presented as some sort of terrible, horrific thing. I think perhaps ,it might be worth reiterating the main elements of that decision. The assets test limit has been brought down to $200,000, with a 50 per cent discount in the case of farms or other owner-involved businesses. Effectively, the assets test is $400,000. That figure is a net $400,000, after we subtract the market valve of the assets, minus any outstanding debt which might encumbering the asset, and after we take out the house and domestic land in the case of a farm. We are not talking about that type of farm which is heavily encumbered by debt, struggling to pay off huge interest bills or something of that sort. We are talking about people with net assets of $400,000 after subtracting any debt, apart from house and domestic land. The fact is that, yes, there is a tightening of that assets test, but the Opposition keeps telling the Government that it must tighten fiscal policy; that it has not done anything like enough to cut government spending; and that the burden of economic adjustment needs to be shifted more into the fiscal policy area. It says that on the one hand, and yet it opposes a savings measure which impacts on. people with net assets of $400,000 or more. That is totally inconsistent and hypocritical of the Opposition. Mr Downer-It is discriminatory.",130
208,Mr BALDWIN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"It is still discriminatory in a sense, even with the tightening of the assets tests. In real terms, in my opinion, it is a significantly tighter' assets test. It has a significantly greater impact than the incomes test that impacts on ordinary wage and salary earners. If one looks at the income tests that operate, in my opinion there is still an anomaly which tends to favour those who are relatively asset rich. Anyway, that was the question and I do not' propose to say anything further about Austudy. I might also add that in some ways we have liberalised it. We have increased the personal income test threshold from $3,000 to $4,000, and that was the key issue that the National Union of Students was pursuing-in other words, some of those who are most directly involved, those with the most direct interest in the structure of the Austudy means test. Returning to some of the other points that the honourable member for Goldstein made, apart from saying that it had been lambasted in .all sections of the education community, which is demonstrably absurd, he talked about education suffering serious damage. Again, he was referring be to higher education. The fact is that if we talk about serious damage to the higher education system, it would be useful to go back to the period of Opposition rule. In 1982, for example, if we compare the total capital program in higher education in 1982 with what is projected for 199091, we are looking at something of the order of a fivefold increase in real terms in the capital program for higher education. The great and serious problems that higher education has suffered are very much due to the capital starvation that was particularly a feature of the last years of the previous Opposition Government. It was an appalling situation that has taken a fair while to turn around. We are talking about a fivefold real increase, and the honourable member for Goldstein talks about the present Government doing serious damage to the education system. He referred to the current system of funding and the current system of profile negotiations, which are the key mechanism for negotiating grants for individual institutions between the Commonwealth and the individual institutions. He talked about 'direct political interference', 'unlimited power to impose conditions on grants' and 'impositions on academic freedom'. These sorts of terms recurred throughout the contribution made by the honourable member for Goldstein. Again, these comments were totally and patently absurd. I suppose one of the best ways of illustrating that is to note the fact that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee which, particularly in regard to the White Paper changes to the higher education system, had some pretty severe criticisms. In the policy document it put out before the last election, it states: The Avee supports the educational profile cept as it has been refined. Nobody is denying that there were some initial difficulties with the profiles in of the level of information that was required and so forth, but I think it would also be true to say that a great many of those initial problems have been ironed out and that the profile system now has a high level of acceptance. That is recognised by the Higher Education Coundl in its report to this Parliament recently on how the profiles negotiations have been going, the Higher Education Council being a highly representative body of the sector. It was very positive about the way the profiles process is now being conducted.· To suggest that there is some horrific control and interference being carried out by the mechanism of profile negotiations is simply absurd, and none of the major representative organisations actively involved in the sector will support that point of view. The honourable member for Goldstein talked about scarce research funds being spread more thinly. One would think that there had not been a huge increase in the Commonwealth effort in research in the last few years. I might just refer to an article in a magazine called Search which was widely quoted in the press as being critical of the Government's position in terms of the Commonwealth contribution to academic and related research. It looks at the period from 1984 to 1987. In that period funding for academic and related research had increased by some 15 per cent in real terms compared to 6 per cent for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average. Of course, since then, if one goes from 1987 to 1991, one is looking at something of the order of $80m in real terms in December 1989 dollars for the Australian Research Council program in 1987 and $200m roughly for 1991-a very substantial increase in real terms. In addition, we have had the 1989 science statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that set out the new funding mechanisms for research infrastructure, which is another major injection. We have also had the announcement of the coopcon- erative research centres program. Again, when that is fully operational it will be another $100m a year contribution from terms the Commonwealth to research. So to talk about scarce research funds being spread more thinly, of course, is just absurd. The honourable member for Goldstein again referred to unmet demand. If there is a problem with unmet demand, it is largely a consequence of the great success the Government has had in recent times in increasing participation in year 12 in the school system. There has been a very marked increase over the term of this Government in the participation rate in year 12. That, of course, has sigqjficantly increased the demand for higher education places. There has also been a very great increase in provision of higher education places. One looks at something like a 60 per cent increase compared to 1983 in the number of higher education places-a very substantial increase. There have been very substantial increases in the operating grants for the higher education institutions which are needed to fund that. Those are just some of the points I thought I would refer to. As I said, I will not attempt to cover everything. I think most of the comments in the course of this debate. have been about issues relating to student income support and there has been quite a bit of reference to higher education. I have not talked about the school system and the technical and further education sector because they are not my areas of ministerial responsibility, but I thought I would add those few comments. Proposed .expenditure agreed to. Department of Defence Proposed expenditure, $8,581,326,000.",131
209,Mr DOWNER,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The Deunexpected partment. of Defence appropriation, stantial as it is, is one that we all need· give very serious consideration to. That particularly the case at this very difficult time in a defence sense for Australia, the Western world and, I suppose, one could go further and say the world as a whole because, without any doubt, the focus of our attention at the moment must inevitregion, ably be on the crisis in the Gulf. The outcome of that crisis, however it is solved, will shape the way that the postregion, Cold War world is going to evolve. be as important in terms of the structure of the world over the next 50 years as was the outcome of the Second World War in relation to the structure that have lived with for the last 50 years: The coalition, as is well known, very strongly supported the deployment of Australian naval vessels to the Gulf Oman. Indeed, we have repeatedly made the point that, as far as the Parliament is concerned, it was the coalition which initially suggested that Australia should make this contribution to a global effort to stave off the offensive and illegal behaviour of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. But what this particular event, above all, underlines for all of us is the totally unexpected nature of defence needs. If ever there was an argument for our having substantial appropriations for defence, which I know for some sections of the community are difficult to swallow, it is this sort of unexpected event which just simply cannot be foreseen. Those who welcomed the historic rapprochement between the Soviet Union and the United States and those, such as myself, who have welcomed the reunification of Germany, should not take too casual an approach to the continuing needs of our defence forces. I have heard from time to time in the community people say how absurd it is that we expend so much money on defence when the Cold War is over. I heard one historian say-I think this was possibly the most fatuous and absurd comment made as a result of EastWest rapprochement-that the end of world history had finally arrived, whatever that could mean. The fact is that the is always there and the new subpost-Cold War world is a very complex to world which will still require the continis uation of some expenditure on defence, including by countries like Australia. We on this side of the House appreciate that Australia's long-term concerns inevitably are going to be focused on our own not in a general sense on the whole world, except when wider concerns such reas the Persian Gulf crisis arise. By our we are talking of the Asia-Pacific It will region in general. As a result of the conclusion, if you like, of the Cold War, we have seen both the United States and the Soviet Union we make substantial defence cutbacks in our region. The Soviet Union has reduced its has presence in Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam. The United States has said that it will of reduce defence personnel over the next three years by something like 15,000 in South Korea, Japan and the Philippines. That constitutes something like an 11 per cent reduction in the United States presence in our region, and there is the very real possibility that the United States bases in the Philippines, at Clark Field and Subic Bay, could close over the next few years as a result of negotiations with the Philippines Government. The consequence of that, of course, is that those of us who are permanently stationed in our region, such as Australia,· will have to become substantially more· self-reliant. I do not include only Australia in that list. New Zealand needs to accept that one day it will also have to become self-reliant and not just continually depend on the good will of Australia for domestic political purposes. Japan, too, has to be prepared to accept its role in the region, as does South Korea. Yet we are in an insecure and unstable region, and that is something that those of us who live permanently in the region and recognise the growing degree of self-reliance have to take into account. Instability on the Indo-Pakistan border, problems in Cambodia still unresolved, the Indo-China situation in general, the instability in the South Pacific, Papua New Guinea and Bougainville that we are all so well aware of, remind us that the unexpected can occur as easily in our region as it has occurred in the Persian Gulf. That underlines the need for us in Australia to have a truly effective defence capability. As I said at the beginning of my speech, that imposes a financial burden on the community. In the 1987 Defence White Paper, the Government expected that, as a result of the changing needs in our region, we would have to pursue real growth in defence spending of something like 3 per cent per annum. However, the reality is that over the last five years there has been a progressive reduction in defence spending in real terms by the Government. Indeed, in this Budget, defence spending grows at a slower rate than the rate of inflation. That inevitably means that operational activities will decline in all three services. Air crew numbers will have to decline, steaming time for the Royal Australian Navy will be down, exercises by the Army will have to be reduced, and so the list goes on. It is very hard for us on this side of the House to relate a Defence budget like that to the reality of our strategic environment. In the last two or three minutes available to me, I want to tell the House about another concern that we on this side of the House have about the Government's general approach to defence issues; that is, the complete incoherence of the Government's approach to the export of defence equipment to other countries. That policy bears no relationship whatsoever to the Government's foreign policy. Indeed, according to the Government's own defined guidelines, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not even have to be consulted in determining what countries we should be selling defence equipment to. I give a few examples. In the first place, we have recently discovered that negotiations were under way to sell arms to Iran, Australia acting in this particular instance as a broker, the arms being military aircraft sold by Chile to Iran via a broker in Sydney. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) admitted that the Government had obtained no power from the Parliament in order to control this sort of circumstance. Yet there we are, attempting to sell arms to a country which has said that the presence of the United States in the Persian Gulf and in Saudi Arabia means that a holy war should be conducted against the United States, although some of the statements coming out of Iran are somewhat ambiguous. Equally, there has been an arms embargo on Iran since 1980, and this arms embargo is simply made a laughing stock by the incoherence of Government defence export policy. There is the fiasco of the sale of the Mirage jets to Pakistan at a time of confrontation between India and Pakistan-a confrontation which flared up again only in the last week-which has caused Australia substantial foreign policy embarrassment and which, for at least a short period, led to the suspension of trade development talks between Australia and India. It was a foolish and ill-considered decision which, once more, had all the hallmarks of a decision taken without taking into account Australia's foreign policy interests. It has been proposed that ammunition be sold to the Sri Lankan Government. Presumably, that ammunition will be used in order to conduct a communal conflict in Sri Lanka-again, something in which I would not have thought that Australians would want to be involved. Finally-irony of ironies-there is the Government's decision to allow the sale of aircraft parts to Iraq within weeks of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which I would have thought, on the face of it, was quite in contravention of the Government's stated aims in terms of defence export policy, given Iraq's quite appalling record on domestic human rights. The Government really needs to reconsider its whole policy on defence exports, first, to ensure that those brokers, to whom I referred in the context of sales to Iran, are brought into the ambit of general policy and, secondly-for heaven's sake-to ensure that Australia's foreign policy interests are taken into account when arms are exported from Australia. It is incoherent for the current policy to continue in operation. That policy will have to be totally revised.",133
210,Mr BEVIS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Halfway through that contribution from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) I thought I might commence by saying that this was a matter on which there was bipartisan agreement, unlike some others in the Budget debates. But that was not to be, as honourable members have heard. I shall take up a couple of points made by the member for Mayo and draw his attention to the Budget Papers. The honourable member referred to what he said was a reduction in real terms for the Budget year 1990-91. Budget Paper No.1 at page 3.54 sets out in some detail that this 1990-91 provision repn:sents a maintenance in real terms of the previous year's Budget allocation. It is true that it provides for zero growth and that there has been a reduction in the Forward Estimates. However, the contribution this Government has made in difficult economic times will maintain the Defence Force contribution in real terms. Let me draw on the inconsistency and the hypocrisy of honourable members opposite. Tonight they tell us that we should be increasing expenditure over the next couple of years by, on a quick calculation I have just made, something of the order of $2.5 billion if we maintain the 3 per cent real growth to which he referred. Mr Downer-It is not our policy.",135
211,Mr BEVIS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The 3 per cent growth to which the honourable member referred would require an additional $2.5 billion in the period of the next forward Estimates. Yet these are the same people who, for the past fortnight, have been saying that the Government should have made more cuts in the Budget. When pinned down on social security, they said they did not want to hurt the pensioners. Now they tell us that over the forward Estimates period the Government should be spending another $2.5 billion. Mr Downer-I did not say that.",135
212,Mr BEVIS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The honourable member was committed to the 3 per cent. Most people in Australia would wish that the Government did not have to make the payments for defence expenditure. People would rather allocate money to other areas, if we lived in a world where disputes could be resolved with confidence and .in the absence of force. Only the foolhardy would regard that as a realistic assessment of the world in which we live. Certainly, the events in the Middle East and elsewhere have given clear testimony to the importance of maintaining an effective defence capability. The Forward Estimates do provide for an increase of one per cent in real terms in the defence budget. I hope sincerely that the budgetary situation over that Forward Estimates period will enable at least that level of real growth to occur. This year will present the Government and the Parliament with an opportunity to reassess our defence requirements. The Wrigley report sets out a fairly controversial agenda for the future make-up and construction of the defence forces. That is a matter which the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is considering, as is the Government. It is opportune that the structure of the defence forces be reviewed as we proceed into this important year-important because of the changes that have occurred globally, to which the member for Mayo referred. A substantial portion of this year's Budget outlays, as has been the practice for some time, goes to equipment purchases. They represent nearly 35 per cent of total defence outlays. Those purchases are important for the long term strategic security of the nation. The weapons that have been purchased include the Hammill artillery weapon, the Steyr rifle and the new equipment which the infantry now has and these are all important for capability on the ground. The major expenses go to the high cost items: the Collins class submarines, the ANZAC frigates and the FI8 aircraft, which the Government has taken decisions to procure and which will involve committed expenditures for' some years. They have all been welcomed expenditures and should enjoy bipartisan support in this place. Similarly, the Government's decision to improve our defence capability in the north, the establishment of unmanned air bases at Curtin and Learmonth, are all important initiatives which I believe recent exercises have demonstrated as being correct decisions. I should say at this stage, as I did on an earlier occasion, that there is a compelling argument for the Government to reintroduce into operation the Chinook helicopters which are now in warehouses. I shall not dwell on that matter, as I made a speech about it on another occasion. However, I believe it is important that, within the financial constraints, we examine ways of funding the reintroduction of the Chinook. I should make some comments about personnel matters within the Defence Force, because we have tended to concentrate very heavily upon equipment acquisitions, which are critical in themselves, but at the end of the day it is people who defend this country, not machines. I commend the Government for its Defence Housing Authority program and the improvements that have occurred, not only in my electorate of Brisbane where the Army's Enoggera barracks have been improved dramatically, but also in many establishments throughout the country, notably Darwin and Townsville, where new accommodation has been constructed, and Cairns where extremely good accommodation has been purchased, and similar projects throughout Australia which the defence Committee in its program of visits has been able to inspect. Beyond that, there is a need for the defence forces and the Government to review salary levels and general conditions applying to service personnel. All honourable members will be aware of the problem with retention of service personnel. A superficial look demonstrates that there is a prime facie case to consider service salaries, as a special case-and when I say that, I mean within the confines of the wage system-to take account of the special circumstances confronting the defence forces and also their historical position in relation to average weekly earnings. I understand that there has been a significant fall in the relative position of Defence Force personnel. Linked to that is the question of how we retain experienced, qualified and capable defence personnel. Undoubtedly a retention bonus is one possibility - though not the panacea-that deserves careful consideration by the Government and, on the face of it, deserves commendation. The concept of a retention bonus . has been picked up by the Government in its recent review of superannuation for Defence Force personnel. I am pleased to note that a retention bonus concept has been introduced for serving personnel with 15 or more years' service. That was a sensible decision and one that provided substantial benefits to service personnel and at the same time introduced a structural change that will be of long-term benefit. It is difficult to envisage Australia maintaining its relative military capacity by continuing with a cost neutral approach to future Budgets. The increasing costs of high technology weaponry, of active practice and exercises for the defence forces, inevitably will mean that to maintain the same relative position in this region and globally will require the injection of more funds into the defence budget. It is somewhat disconcerting that the armoured corps has to rely increasingly on firing small arms weapons into the dirt 10 yard in front of a Leopard tank because the cost of firing shells is so great that the use of artillery shells must be restricted to a level that would cause many people concern. That is not an isolated example, but is an effect of the economic constraints faced by the community, not just by the Government. If the Opposition is to be responsible about this matter, it will acknowledge that point and join with the Government in examining ways to address constructively the need to properly fund these matters, rather than seeking hypocritically to score cheap points in this debate by saying that the Government should spend more, while saying in another debate that it should have cut back in its Budget-THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (HoD. J.D.M. Dobie)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",135
213,Mr MACKELLAR,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"1 commence my remarks regarding the Australian Defence Force (ADF) estimates in the Appropriation Bill by reinforcing my support for the Government's decision to send a naval mission to the Middle East. It is important to recognise this as a commitment to a unanimous decision by the United Nations Security Council. The decision was not simply a response to one country, but to that unanimous decision by the Security Council. We must all remember that Iraq's action in invading a largely unarmed smaller neighbour is an act of blatant and unprovoked aggression. I believe there is strong evidence to show that to have ignored President Saddam Hussein's invasion as just another squabble between Arab nations would have encouraged him to invade other Gulf nations. If he had gained control of the major part of Middle East oil production, I do not think any reasonable person could doubt the ruthlessness with which Saddam Hussein would manipulate the production and price of oil to destabilise the Western world. I think, in saying this, it needs to be stressed that the world has never seen such a united opinion against an invading nation, nor such international agreement on the use of sanctions and military action to force Iraq into relinquishing Kuwait. This is not merely the United States flexing its military muscle to assert its authority over a sensitive area of the world; it is, in fact, an international and strategic response led by the United States, firstly, to resist this armed takeover of a smaller militarily weak state and, secondly, to ensure long-term stability in the future supply of the world's single most important energy source-oil. I say again that it is not just the United States; it is a massive and unprecedented world view against the action of Saddam Hussein. The importance of that long term and strategic objective will mean that the action taken against Iraq will, if necessary, have to be maintained for as long as it takes to have him retreat behind his own borders. This could mean that our forces will be locked into a frustrating and difficult situation which will demand their patience and discipline. In turn, we at home must recognise the importance of what the world community must achieve and have the patience and resolve to give our forces and their mission our full support. There will be occasions when we might not agree with the diplomatic or military decisions of the day and under those circumstances national resolve could weaken, particularly in the face-and I hope this never occurs-of Australian casualties. It will be at those times that our men and women must know that they have our full support and that we have a determination to meet our international commitments. The Australian people must also. recognise that the world will be watching our resolve to assist a small and militarily weak nation suffering from naked aggresto sion. This will be particularly so of our Indo-Pacific neighbours. In other words, there are important implications for Ausfragile. tralia's long-term relations with nations such as India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the nations of the southalmost ern Pacific. Our ability to meet our interthe national commitments will contrast starkly with the damage done to New Zealand's foreign relations with those same counreadiness tries because it caved into left wing and other minority pressures to turn its back on its Western allies and ,the realities the world. Having said that, we have to look behind the strategic importance and correctness of our support for Kuwait to a very legitimate need to examine the capability of Australia to meet its commitments. Capability can be considered as readiness and sustainability. There are doubts in my mind as to whether the' Australian accurate, defence forces were in a sufficiently ceptable state of readiness for a Persian Gulf mission of this nature. Readiness is period, a complex coming together of people and meet equipment-people's skills, their levels training, of availability of stores, of munition holdings, of dockyard efficienward cies and, above all, the quality of'senior management. It is gen'erally acknowledged that cessive years of budgetary restraint have fallen disproportionately on defence sonnel rather than on capital equipment. Tonight we have heard the statement from the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), who spoke before me, that 35 cent of our expenditure will be spent on ployed? defence equipment. This, in fact, has resulted in a steady erosion of basic training needs, and the honourable member drew attention to this. Sea, air and other fieldment time training has been reduced to quite unsatisfactorily low levels. Ammunition severely rationed, as the previous honourgency able member mentioned, and other essenhave tial operational stores are very heavily restricted. While I acknowledge that this has been· addressed in very recent times, I fear that the defence personnel who are being asked carry out Australia's security commitments have left Australia with a degree of readiness that can be described only as I use that word with all the care and sensitivity that is warranted by the present circumstances: That fragility has certainly been acknowledged by fact that Australia's frigates are being deployed well back from any immediate area of direct conflict. Given our state of this was a very proper course of action by the Government, at least for the early stages of this campaign and certainly of until the commanding officers are satisfied that operational standards have been achieved. I mentioned that there are two aspects of the capability of a mission-readiness and sustainability. Here, in terms of sustainability, we have grounds for further reservations about the effectiveness of the Australian defence forces, or to be more the effectiveness of their politiaccal and senior management masters. Can Australia maintain its three ship mission in the Persian Gulf over an extended a future which may be necessary? Could it request for an extension of of that force? Could we simultaneously meet amthe need for a police action or fast fordeployment to, say, Bougainville or Fiji? Can we ignore the very questionable performance of the Fijian task force in suc1987, the sectional weaknesses highlighted by the Kangaroo 89 exercise, the permedia reports of armaments having to be swapped at sea as relief vessels sail to the Middle East, or reports of cannibalisation of equipment to provide the necessary per armaments for the force currently deThe serious defence personnel wastage rates throughout the 1980s are testimony to the unsatisfactory working environin the Australian defence forces created by quite unreasonable or misdirected is penny pinching. Years of budgetary strinand sheer bad people management caused thousands of skilled and loyal defence personnel to leave the defence forces in favour of civilian jobs that give both satisfaction and recognition. This Government and top defence management have lost sight of the fact that the real strength of our defence forces is not the FFG, or F18, or the Leopard tank, but the pride, conviction and effectiveness of the ordinary soldier, sailor or airman who uses that equipment to make his or her country secure. We will be proud of what our forces achieve in the Middle East, the more so because they will be doing it for their country, Australia, and in spite of the misplaced priorities of this Government in the past. These people are risking their lives and we are eternally grateful to them and for them. In the great traditions of Australia's armed services they have made, with one notorious exception, the decision to accept fully the responsibilities which they took on when they joined the Australian defence forces. I think, given the examples I mentioned of the Fiji deployment force, the difficulties exposed by Kangaroo 89 and the fact that when getting this force away Australian equipment had to be cannibalised to allow the force to sail, there are very and proper doubts which we should address, and which I am sure the Government will be addressing, in terms of the structure and the top management decisions which have been taken and are being taken within the ADF and the Department of Defence.",137
214,Mr GRACE,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"1I have listened with great intent to the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar), and I hope he is not suggesting that we have sent ill-equipped ships to the Middle East. I must pick him up on the point of looking after the forces. I live in an area in Liverpool, which is a garrison town. I am not the member for the Holsworthy area, but I am well acquainted with the area and I go there regularly with the present member, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner). The people there tell me that the Labor Government is the only government which has ever looked after the forces. I remember going down to Holsworthy in about 1983 to a conference of soldiers' wives and seeing the dilapidated conditions they were living in. We had only been in power for two years at that time. I would like to remind honourable members who was in power prior to that period. People were living in slum conditions in Holsworthy. Dr Bob Woods-How long have you been in?",139
215,Mr GRACE,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Lowe probably was not even in the country in the period I am talking about. The only things that were ever done for the defence forces of this country were done in 1972 and again in 1983. If honourable members opposite take themselves out to any Army, Navy or Air Force establishment they will confirm that fact. In the 1990-91 Budget the Government has earmarked a nominal amount of $8,581 billion for defence purposes. This represents an increase in total defence outlays of some $490m, or 5.8 per cent, yet the Opposition has the audacity to say we are not looking after the defence forces of this country. I would agree that this expenditure repreal resents a holding of the line if we take inflation into consideration but it still demonstrates a very substantial ongoing commitment by the present Government to the defence forces. Mr MACKellar-Why are they all leaving?",139
216,Mr GRACE,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"They were ""leaving in droves when the honourable member for Warringah was in power. If he wants to come around to my office he can see some photographs of married ladies living in Holsworthy. I remind the honourable member once again that in 1983, 1984 or 1985, when I visited the area, the Hawke Government had only been in power for 18 months. Unless we had a magic wand, those conditions must have existed prior to 1983. Over the last 7112 years, particularly given the financial constraints of recent times, we have addressed the massive problems that existed in the Services when Labor was called into fix up the mess that those opposite left. Probably one of the reasons that some of the more proficient and professional people are leaving the forces is, as I think honourable members would realise, that there are many more opportunities in private business today than in previous years. Obviously that is where people are going. Our money is still money well spent on the defence forces of this country provided people do not leave and go overseas-and the majority of them do not. It has always been a condition that enceshould not be looked at as a onedimensional identity, although in a perfect world we would all look forward to defence forces doing nothing more dramatic than assisting in disasters, undertaking coastal surveillance and Customs operations, and providing auxiliary policing capabilities. I was delighted to hear the honourable member for Warringah say how well he supported the Government's actions in sending out the troops and how well the troops behaved, with one notable exception which we will not go into. here. The honourable member for Warringah has been here a lot longer than I have; I appreciate his views and I know that he has the well-being of all the Australian Services in mind when he speaks. The fact, however, is that we live in a far from perfect world where the rule of the gun remains as potent as ever. Despite the de-escalation of tension in eastern Europe, Sad dam Hussein has recently given us a vivid reminder of the existence of the age-old social enemies of expansionism, fanaticism, racism, xenophobia and ultra-nationalism-easy tools for strong men when they wish to prey on the weak, as exhibited in the Middle East today. Therefore defence spending needs to be looked at from a multifaceted point of view. Do we have an appropriate defence capability for a perceived level of threat? Are we structuring our equipment purchases so as to advance Australian industry and our future technological requirements? Is our defence capability efficiently organised and comparable with our present and future economic circumstances? I believe that under the administration of this Government defence planning has come of age in this country. No longer do we consider buying aircraft carriers so that the admirals can salute each other as they pass by in Sydney Harbour, when the enemy on the other side of world was just a foreign word. No longer do we pretend that the Indian Ocean does not exist. No longer is our defence strategy based on def- massing our defence establishments around the south-eastern cities of Australia. Under this Government defence planning has been brought into the real world, away from the colonial doctrines which consumed the conservatives during their years on the treasury bench and towards a strategy which emphasises the importance of maintaining alliances such as ANZUS but recognises the needs for self reliance and defence of our most vulnerable northern regions. As honourable members would know, current defence strategy can be traced back to the highly acclaimed March 1987 defence White Paper which charted our defence planning into the next century. From this paper came the thinking which saw the end of the old discredited forward defence strategy and the introduction of the more appropriate continental defence strategy. The strategy has involved the largest defence capital program in Australia's peacetime history which has allowed the Australian Defence Force to be progressively re-equipped with the most appropriate weaponry available as programs outlined in the White Paper have been implemented. I refer to the submarine project,· the ANZAC ship project, 67,000 Steyr rifles, hundreds of trucks, 38 Black Hawk helicopters, 69 PC9 trainer aircraft, 75 FA18s and a string of air bases across the north of Australia. Over the next 10 years we will spend more than $20 billion on new capital equipment. But the honourable member for Warringah had the audacity to come into this House and say that this Government does not look after the defence of this country. Under Labor we have planned to move our defence capabilities to where they are logistically required, in the north and west. The Second Cavalry Regiment will be moved from Holsworthy to Darwin in the early 1990s and the Government has established the Northern Command, Norcom, based in Darwin. Also under this Government planning for the creation of a genuine two-ocean navy is well under way. Approximately half of the surface combatants and surface forces as well as mine countermeasure vessels and an afloat support ship will be based in Western Australia by the end of this century. This will enhance our ability to deploy marine forces in northern and north-western strategic areas. In updating our defence capabilities the Government has been very conscious of the need for Australian industry to share in both the profits and the technological benefits. In fact the key part of the Governments's defence policy is a commitment to a competitive defence industry. However, in line with its demands for economic discipline in other areas, the Government has made it plain to Australian industry that taxpayers should not subsidise inefficiency. To win defence business Australian companies have to be disciplined in their tendering and efficient in their operations. This has had a dramatic flow-through effect in the industry which can boast of a growing range of internationally competitive defence products, particularly as a result of the Government's 1988 decision to reverse its policy on defence exports so that companies can viably invest in producing more defence goods and services and gain the efficiencies of longer production runs. Because the Government's policy is a good defence policy that is relevant to our needs I am sure that it will stand this country in good stead as we move into the twenty-first century.",139
217,Mr CONNOLLY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Bradfield) (8.59)The last few weeks have seenfundamental changes in the geopolitical alignment of the world. Up to 1989 in many respects the world remained exactly as it was resulting from the Yalta Agreement in 1945. In the last 12 months we saw the breakdown of the might and political strength of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Russian empire in eastern Europe-changes which a year ago, even in western Europe, people regarded as virtually impossible. What we are now seeing in the context of Iraq and the problems of the Middle East in many respects is a return once again to a more classical . interpretation of world history and the impact of that on geopolitical forces. It is interesting to note that only two years ago Iraq, the nation which is now causing the world to reconsider so much of its thinking in terms of strategy, received massive Western diplomatic support, trade credits and military aid-even military aid from the United States-during its war with Iran, which, because of the activities of the Ayatollah Khomeini, was seen in the West as being the enemy and the threat to Middle East oil supplies. It is therefore of great significance that in that sense we have seen a complete volte-face in a matter of eight weeks to two months. Where it is so significant is that until the very recent changes, the United States was always seen as a linchpin of the Western system of alliances, guaranteeing from Germany to Japan a capacity to resist Soviet aggression. The whole alliance structure was based on that premise. But with the breakdown of the threat from the East, the opportunity to divest both the Soviet economy and the Western economy, particularly that of the United States, of such an enormous percentage of its gross national product (GNP) which. was directed to defence was seen as somewhat irresistible. In so many nations, particularly in western Europe and in the United States, people were talking about the peace dividend. All that has now changed. It changed overnight because of the invasion of Iraq into the sovereign territory of a small neighbouring state called Kuwait. Kuwait is tiny by international standards but its geopolitical influence, because it is astride one of the most oil-rich parts of the world and because it always stood as a buffer state between Iraq to the north and Saudi Arabia to the south, placed it in a position where the Western world could not stand idly by and allow Saddam Hussein or anybody else to invade, to occupy and to stay in that most significant piece of Arab territory. We should note, however, in the historical context that this is not the first time that Kuwait has been invaded or threatened by its near neighbour. In fact it is about the third time, and the British, which regarded that country as a protectorate for so long, left the Gulf only in the early 1980s, and did so because they did not have sufficient support from countries which perhaps in the context of hindsight should have done more, and one of those states was Australia. Consequently, the decision of the Australian Government to commit Defence Force elements to the Gulf was, in the geopolitical and international context, correct. We have seen a few political fringe dwellers who campaigned and said to the contrary. But to allow Saddam Hussein's Iraq to get away with the conquest of a neighbouring country arid to threaten another, especially ones as important as those astride the oil sources of the world, would not be in Australia's interests, nor the world's. We have not endured 40 years of Cold War and come out of it victorious to put up with the gratuitous invasion by and aggression of a nasty little dictator whose behaviour to his own people, as well as to his neighbours, is nothing short of reprehensible. The world, and the West in particular, must also look at itself in the mirror and remind itself that over the years we have been well aware of the behaviour of Iraq. Nothing has changed except our perception of our interests, vis-a-vis the activilowed ties of Iraq more recently. In many senses it makes very real that old cliche that nations have permanent interests but no permanent allies or permanent friends. Consequently, the circumstances we face in the Middle East today are extremely complex. I said that when we spoke here a few weeks ago, and nothing has changed. An example of the complexity can best be seen from what we read in the newspapers in the past few days, namely, that Iraq is now encouraging Kuwaiti citizens by their thousands to leave Kuwait. One simple question must be asked: Why? I will tell the Committee why. It is because the population of genuine Kuwaitis is a very small minority of the total population of Kuwait. By far the majority are Palestinians or foreigners from various countries who also have swelled the roads and the desert passes through to Jordan in recent weeks. It is quite obvious what the political intentions of Saddam Hussein are: while the West continues to build up its military capacity in the deserts and in the Gulf, he is trying to build up a political environment which so far has achieved the breakdown of the Arab League on the one hand, the divisions within the mass of the Arab people on the other, and the very real prospect that he will then come up with a political solution to the problem. He will say, 'We will withdraw from Kuwait provided there is a plebiscite and provided the people of Kuwait can decide their political future'. In other words, he will say to the democracies of the world, 'What is wrong with democracy? Why shouldn't people have the right to vote?'. We will then face one of a whole series of interesting and complex problems because if we fall for that, we will not only lose Kuwait-and Kuwait would no doubt remain as it is; part of the expanded territory of Iraq-but also we will have put in place a major threat not just to the Middle East but to the entire region. Iraq today has a significant nuclear capability, which, if it has not yet been achieved, is certainly only months away from being achieved. If a man like Saddam Hussein is alto set himself up as a latter-day Saladin, it will certainly create problems not only for Israel-problems which are always there-but also for those states in the Middle East such as Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and possibly even Turkey. Those are moderate regimes or, in the case of Turkey, actually a democracy. They are allies of the United States and friends of the West. There is so much at stake but the issues are extremely complex. We have only to make small mistakes of judgment and we may well see ourselves on the edge of a conflagration of massive proportions out of which we will find it very difficult indeed to extricate ourselves in the short term. One thing is certain: the Western forces cannot stay in the desert indefinitely. But equally as certain, we must try diplomacy first and military responses last.",141
218,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,143
219,Mr ALDRED,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"ln the debate on the defence estimates, I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to aspects of the current situation in the Persian Gulf. In the naive and heady days which came with the advent of perestroika and glasnost, it was assumed that with the demise of the Soviet Union and its satellite empire, Australia would be in the position drastically to cut defence spending and to use the resultant savings, the peace dividend as it was being called, to fund any number of wondrous welfare programs. Sadly, that is not the case. The calls for the peace dividend failed to take into account the fact that even though the Cold War might well have been won, there are still a large number of unstable and potentially dangerous situations existing throughout the world at the current time. Situations such as those that occurred recently between India and Pakistan, Vietnam and China, and those in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and the Philippines are all capable of having an impact on Australia. Whilst this might be an unpleasant reality, we should accept the fact that Australia is part of a region that, because of its growth potential and wealth, will inevitably attract unwelcome predators. A naive strand to the peace dividend argument is that in the event of any of these situations arising we would have sufficient warning to rearm and rebuild our forces to counter the threat. The recently released Wrigley report, Defence and the Community, for instance, suggests that Australia would receive a six-month warning for anything more than a minor police action. We have only to look at the brief warning time the British were given in the Falklands or, indeed, the more brusque warning the world had about the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to realise that this is nothing more than arrant nonsense. The Royal Australian Navy, in fact, was given only 80 hours to have the required the- ships equipped and stored for war serVice. It is in this situation that I would like to highlight what are, in effect, continuing cuts to the defence budget. The Government has allocated $8,976.3m for defence this financial year. If we take into account inflation, which the Hawke Government has claimed will be 6.5 per cent, the simple fact is that the defence allocation has increased by only 5.8 per cent. Defence is falling behind yet again. This cut means that the Services again will have limited training and exercise opportunities. The effect of these cuts was also shown in the way the Navy had to frantically scavenge the necessary equipment to mount Australia's commitment to the Persian Gulf. Notwithstanding these concerns, I wholeheartedly support our contribution in the Gulf for two main reasons. Firstly, we must draw a parallel between current developments in the Gulf, the devouring of the smaller nation of Kuwait by the much larger nation of Iraq, with the situation in Europe during the 1930s, as it acquiesced in the rise of Hitler's Germany. The simple fact is that if the civilised world had taken a decisive stand against this demented tyrant when he made his first land grab, the chapter of horrors that began for so many nations in 1939 would have been avoided. Sad dam Hussein, of course, made a costly error in his first land grab, that is, the attack on Iran in 1980. Believing he could take advantage of the turmoil that followed removal of the Shah, he found himself in a conflict that lasted eight years. Let us not forget that that conflict cost Iraq 120,000 dead and 300,000 wounded. Hussein lost roughly 0.8 per cent of Iraq's population of 16 million people fighting the war. There is no doubt that the short term Iraqi agenda for the Kuwaiti grab involved such things as a desire to push up the price of oil, cancellation of the substantial Kuwaiti war loans to Iraq, seizure of the Kuwaiti oil fields and, it goes out saying, better access to the Gulf for Iraq. The long term agenda must include reinforcing Hussein's position as the jor leader in the Arab world, reduction Western influence generally in the region, icemen. and also the strengthening of the antiIsraeli movement. Hussein made several claims in justifyresponsible ing the invasion, claims that included the oilfield on the border between Iraq and Kuwait had been illegally exploited; that Kuwait was exceeding the OrganisaThese tion of Petroleum Exporting Countries production quota, thereby keeping down the price of oil; and, finally, that Iraq refused to accept demands for the paymentors. ment of $US2.4 billion in compensation. As far as international law is concerned, the invasion breaches article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter which requires that all UN members: . . . shall refrain in their international tions from the threat or use of force against territorial integrity or political independence any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait is quite clearly in violation of international law. Furthermore, it is a simple fact that vital for the Western world that we antee a steady supply of oil from .that region. The fact that the conquest of wait puts Saddam Hussein directly in from a great height. charge of 20 per cent of the world's remaining oil reserves has to be a cause for the greatest concern. Having said that, and noticing today's quired report that Hussein now has an estimated entail great 360,000 troops in Kuwait, I do not be the case that lieve that Saddam Hussein will move from increased Kuwait of his own accord. In most disheartened to read yesterday the Australian an article by Mr Greg Sheridan entitled 'Flagging Loyalties'. This article said that the Australian Intelligence Organisation had advised that the defence forces not give any publicity to individual servicemen serving in the Gulf task force. It appears that the homes and families of those servicemen who were named in previous press articles had been subjected to various forms of harassment. I have previously heard of the same techwithnique being used by the Irish Republican Army against the families of British soldiers prior to their regiments being posted mato Northern Ireland. I have never before of heard of its happening to Australian servI think it is important to point out that these threats are not being made by the majority of Australia's Arab that community, but apparently by members of the far left of politics in this country and elements of the peace movement. remnants of forgotten Soviet front groups are obviously taking a more vile approach to protesting now they no longer had have guidance and counsel from their old One of the mistakes this country made in the past was in the treatment it handed out and allowed to be handed out to those servicemen who served during the Vietnam conflict. The abuse and criticism relathese men received on their return to the Australia must never be allowed to hapof pen again. While I support the right of individuals to demonstrate against the Government's decision, as they have the right to demonstrate against most government decisions in any properly functionit is ing democracy, any move by these guarcowardly and irresponsible extremists against the families or homes of serviceKumen on active duty must be jumped on In conclusion, Australia has quite rightly taken a firm stand against.

220,Mr BILNEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,":-ln closing the debate on the. Department of Defence estimates, I would like to thank all those who have taken part in what has been a wide-ranging and lively debate. Perhaps I should begin by saying that it is very heartening to note the support which has come from all speakers for the action which the Government took in sending our task group to the Persian Gulf to assist a great number of other nations in enforcing the United Nations sanctions which were unanimously endorsed by the Security Council. It is, of course, not unexpected that that should be the case becauSe in the debate that took place in the chamber, I think on 14 August, that support was expressed by the leaders of all the main parties and, indeed, everybody who spoke, but it is good to have it reinforced at this point. I will just pick up a few points that were made by some of the speakers during the debate. Several speakers referred to what they called cuts in growth in expenditure in the 1990-91 Estimates, by that meaning the fact that projected growth in expenditure is around 5.8 per cent compared to inflation of 6.5 per cent. I think that leaves out of account, just to take one example, the fact that the very considerable costs of ,sending the task group to the Gulf will be supplemented to' 'the defence budget. That is common knowledge. Of course, those costs are likely to be very considerable. I think immediately gives the lie to the argument that growth is slowing. I was pleased that the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) referred in his remarks to the action the Government has taken as a result of one of the lessons we learned from the Kangaroo 89 exercise, the great value of a heavy lift copter capability and the action that the Government now has in train to look at retaining some of the Chinook force. I, like everyone else, am awaiting that outcome with interest. The same speaker, in referring to persoDllel questions, mentioned the role of the Defence Housing Authority. As I go around the defence bases, I realise that there is no doubt whatever that the determined action which the Government has taken to clean out the Augean stable, as it had become, of defence housing through setting up the Defence Housing Authority and backing it with $750m of public money, is beginning to have an effect and one which is widely welcomed by servicemen. The Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) made a remark to the effect that the purchase of equipment at 35 per cent of the defence budget was too high and had a detrimental effe,ct on the amount of funds that we were able to allocate to personnel. The current percentages of expenditure on capital equipment are just on 21 per cent, on facilities just under 6 per cent, on defence cooperation one per cent, and on service personnel 26 per cent, civilian personnel 7.7 per cent and the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme 7.8 per cent. It is not 35 per cent at all. It is something like 27 per cent versus around 42 per cent on personnel, the balance being made up of operating costs at 31 per cent. As Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, I must emphasise that it is quite wrong to say that defence personnel are being neglected. I completely agree with those speakers who have said that our personnel are our best resource and they will go on being so. Some remarks were made by a couple that of speakers about the readiness of our forces. Again, the honourable member for Warringah and the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) referred to cannibalisation. To my certain knowledge the only 'cannibalisation' that will become necessary is that a couple of the phalanx systems which are installed on the two heli- FFGs in the Gulf may be swapped over to their rotation ships when they are replaced. So far as readiness is concerned, it is a great credit to the ships that the orders for them to sail were given on the Thursday evening, or in one case on the Friday morning, and the first two ships were out through the Heads on the Monday morning. If that is not a very creditable effort as far as readiness is concerned I do not know what is. That is an effort that we can be very proud of. There were some remarks made about capability and sustainability also by the honourable member for Warringah. He asked whether we could sustain and maintain a force of this kind, particularly if were combined with police action. The answer to that is yes, but the proof of that will be when the rotation does take· place and if some of the other events occur. In a very wide-ranging speech my friend and colleague the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) referred to a great number of issues, including defence planning and industry participation. He made some very welcome remarks about the two-ocean Navy and also some comments about which I took particular note concerning the submarine project and the ANZAC ships logistic restructuring and so forth. I think his main point related to the training that we give our servicemen and women. While the separation rates from the services are higher than we would like them to be, it is correct that those skills are not being lost to Australia when men and women leave the services. However, those figures are too high and a number of actions are being taken by the Government to see that people do contribute their services to the Australian Defence Force for longer than is at present the case. One of those is the new superannuation scheme-the military superannuation and benefits scheme-which will have a retention element built into it of a year's salary at 15 years, provided people are prepared to sign up for a further five years. I believe that these and a number of other initiatives in the personnel area will help to address those problems. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) gave a thoughtful analysis of the situation in the Middle East, drawing on his diplomatic experience. Anyone would think that he had served there, as indeed he did. I listened to that speech with interest as well. I quite agree with him that we must look to a rather longer term set of considerations when assessing developments in that very troubled arid difficult part of the world. Finally, I heard with dismay the remarks of the honourable member for Deakin when he spoke of the threats which, as he said in his remarks, had been targeted at the; families of servicemen serving in the Gulf. I completely agree it with the words he used. He said that that was cowardly and irresponsible. I thoroughly support that. I certainly hope that those are isolated incidents and that they will . not .recur. I certainly would agree with him also that they would not be supported by the great bulk of the Australian community. Like all members of this House, I believe the Australian people are thoroughly behind the continued welfare of the ADF in all respects. I thank honourable members. Proposed expenditure agreed to. , r Department of Primary Industries and Energy Proposed expenditure, $440,632,000",144
221,Mr LLOYD,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"ln the brief time available to me to consider the Department of Primary Industries and Energy estimates, I want to .refer to three sectors: firstly, the Budget figures themselves; secondly, the cost of export inspection; and thirdly, some trade related problems for agriculture. If one looks at the Budget document for ptimaryin:dustry, the figure of support is given as $1,S46.9m for agriculture, forestry and fisheries. This is a 40 per cent increase· on the previous Budget. If one looks closer, one finds that it is indicated in the documentation that 74 per cent of that has nothing to do with support. It ist.o do with the industry itself making contributions through levy. arrangements, either for market support schemes, of which wool alone was responsible for an increase of some $400m, or beyond that for industry research arrangements. In reality, the figure of support in even a generous definition is $423m, down from $445m last year. The forward projections reduce that even further in the future to $30Sm. If one then looks at that more realistic and accurate figure of $423m-and too many people when they are talking in the media about the so-called assistance to primary industry just use that broad figure which gives no indication at all of the true level of Federal government involvement in primary industry in this country-one immediately has to take $102m off it because that is for the administration of the Department. One wonders sometimes about a department that talks about having efficient agriculture yet gives itself a pretty good increase in administration for this year. If one looks beyond that to the figures, as I said, most of that is a dollar for doll-r contribution for rural industry research. I give credit to governments of both persuasions and to the rural industry that in good times and bad there are dollar for dollar arrangements for research. That is one of the major reasons why primary industry and mining remain our only internationally competitive industries. There is a lesson there for other industries when one looks at the percentage of primary industry's contribution to its own research. Australian agriculture is the least protected agriculture in the Western world and, for that matter, most developing economies as well. That is on the definition not just of direct government assistance but of tariff protection, et cetera. It is about 10 per cent or less. If one goes to the opposite extreme-Japan or the European Economic Community-the major part of farmers' incomes is now direct government payments. For some sectors of agriculture in the United States there is still also that major component. Some of the expenditure items are mismatched. For example, $26m listed for forestry is not for the development of commercial forestry-it is actually compensation for taking forests out of production in Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria and should really be in the environment vote. The amount for soil conservation is down slightly. Obviously it will need to be increased in the years ahead. If one looks at the real cost benefit of government expenditure or income forgone on soil conservation, most of the real advance will be made on farms, and therefore one needs to look at better tax incentive arrangements for that on-farm work. We have to look· seriously at tax rebates as well as tax deductability for the majority of farmers who are low income farmers. The Government's decision in the Budget to allow only full tax deductability in the year of expenditure for the fencing off of soil conservation areas, et cetera, when there is a whole farm plan, shows its ignorance in this area because very few whole farm· plans exist and it will take a long time for them to be developed. In the meantime,presumably, if an eroded area is attempted to be fenced off and there is no whole farm plan, it is bad, but if there is a whole farm plan, it suddenly becomes good.  essaryanyway. Mr LLOYDNo. I accept that. It is a good thing in principle, but it certainly does not mean that in the meantime one knows nothing about what one is doing. The next item is rural adjustment. With the dramatic downturn in rural incomes and the seemingly bad news day after day in the export market-whether it is wheat or wool or other products coming along-more provision will have to be made for rural adjustment because some dramatic adjustment is going to take place. I now move on to export inspection. In the Budget one of the most inappropriate decisions was to increase export inspection charges from 60 to 100 per cent from 1 January. It will cost the exporters of this land another $60m in a full year at a very difficult time for their exports. If our export inspection service was efficient or accountable, it would be hard to complain, but the most frequent complaints I receive are from people who are trying to export, .trying to do something for this country, and who are just seemingly being blocked or certainly not being assisted by our export inspection service. For example, the cost now for export inspectors in many cases is $140 per hour and no great skill is required for that job. I am told that sometimes when no inspector is available clerks from the waterside are allowed to do that work. It might be a sensible use of them, but it indicates that no great skill is required. Once that full cost comes in on 1 January, some of our small grain parcels where we are trying to develop a diversification in grain exports will cost up to $20 per tonne compared with some cases of the provision of a phytosanitary certificate from a private company of $3.50 per tonne. We had one call earlier this week where someone was exporting some grain in small parcels and bagging them. He has three people on the bagging line and one inspector is costing more than the three people on the bagging line. Unless our export inspection service can be .made more efficient and accountable, it must be corporatised because it is wrong for the exporters of this country to bear all the costs and have no say in how efficient it is. There are also claims that instead of the role of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) being to encourage exports and to keep Australia free of disease, people in the industry believe that it is playing the opposite role. One can look at how hard the Department of Primary Industries and Energy fights for access to other countries compared with other countries gaining access to our country. Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the United States are all tough players. I do not blame those countries for being tough players. I wish we were tough players as well. For example, Japan has area freedom for nashi pears. They came here last year, were found on inspection to have black spot, a disease we do not have. This year there was to be no inspection on arrival in Australia. I believe that there has been some rearrangement of that situation, and I think it needs to be very good. The Canadians play it hard when it comes to getting pig meat into Australia or, for that matter, our canned fruit into their country. Now they are continuing to play it hard by requiring more from us with regard to potatoes, asparagus, cherries, et cetera. With regard to apples, I want to quote part of a letter from the Australian Trade Commission people in Ottawa: On checking with our Ottawa office regarding status of the draft protocol on apples-this is with regard to our apples going to Canadathey advise that a draft protocol was negotiated with Agriculture Canada and forwarded to AQIS for comment in March 1989. However, imports cannot take place even if the protocol is finalised until current Canadian legislation/regulations are amended. To my knowledge the Canadians still have not done that. This is the key point: Progress may be accelerated when movement of Canadian apples into Australia has been agreed. This rests upon quarantine concern over possible introduction of fireblight into Australia. Canada has fireblight, the Canadians know it, and yet they are saying, contrary to this belief that trade politics is not played, that if we let their fireblight-type apples into Australia, then they may suddenly pass that legislation and let our apples into that country. To conclude, processed food imports are increasing at a great rate. They are up to $2 billion a year and increasing at 20 per cent a year. We had a policy in the election with regard to fair trade for imported, processed food. We need to look at a better arrangement for dumping and for developing country preferences. Food standards are being implemented by the Government, and I give it credit for that. But we need to look harder at packaging because it is too easy to say that something is the product of Australia when it has only been packaged in Australia and not made here.",146
222,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired.,148
223,Mr SCHOLES,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I wish to raise a matter which I raised earlier today during Question Time, and that is the position of carpet wool,s and those people who process them in Australia at the moment. The carpet wool industry is a very small segment of the wool trade. I understand that the type of sheep which grow most of the ca-et wools thrive only on country which is normally not satisfactory to the more popular wool growing practices and the that most of the growers are relatively small. For some time this section of the wool industry operated and developed as an independent marketing and trading arrangement through its own cooperative, but it is a section of the industry whereby the entire Australian clip represents 9 per cent, give or take one per cent, of Australia's requirements for carpet wools. The entire Australian clip was marketed and processed through all stages to the actual carpet itself within Australia. It was a highly successful, value-added industry in which, while small, the actual product was maximised within Australia and with some degree of efficiency. All that has changed in the last two to three years. It has changed because the Australian Wool Corporation decided that it was not good enough that the industry was successful and that the wool was being processed, sold and marketed. One must remember that the Wool Corporation has taken no interest in carpet wools at all and refused to involve carpet wools in overseas promotions where export opportunities for Australian wool carpets exist and exports do take place. The Australian Wool Corporation moved into encompass carpet wools within its marketing arrangements, probably to collect the levy to cover some of its other marketing arrangements. This industry previously quite successfully marketed its own wools. It imposed a levy on its growers of around 6 per cent and processed those wools to the final product, all of which sold at prices acceptable to the growers. We now have a situation, following the intervention of the Wool Corporation, where the processing section of the industry is dying. The wools are going into stockpiles because the cost of marketing through the Wool Corporation places the price abov,e the price at which competitive wools can be imported from overseas. A previously successful marketing and processing operation, all conducted within Australia, has passed into limbo. The wools are going into stockpile and moneys have to be borrowed because the carpet manufacturers see no reason why they should pay 3 per cent or 4 per cent more for wools purchased at Wool Corporation floor prices than they have to pay for wools delivered in Australia from overseas. It should be remembered that carpet manufacturers import around 90 per cent of all wools for the very simple reason that Australia produces only a small percentage of what it uses. I cannot imagine a more stupid situation than having a marketing authority that is having enormous difficulties marketing its traditional areas of wool production moving into destroy a small section of the industry-and that is what the Wool Corporation has done-merely to show its authority. In fact, it proves its incompetence. The bigger and more serious problem is that all of the value added component is being lost. The so-called scouring of Wool Corporation wool will have to be redone if it is to be used in the carpet industry. In the meantime, the processes, the various links in the chain, are dying because instead of being manufactured and being part of our Australian made carpet industry, Australian wool is going into stockpiles at the Wool Corporation. I have to wonder at the logic of that. The wool industry decided to move out of the carpet wool area and return to traditional methods of growth and marketing, but for some reason the Wool Corporation and the politicians have decided not to allow this. I will not delay the House any longer. I say merely that this is an act of crass stupidity and arrogance by people who see themselves as being more important than the people who were doing a good job before they decided to interfere.",148
224,Mr MACKELLAR,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Warringah) (9.44) Tonight in this debate on the appropriation for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy I want to address the Government's intention, as stated in the 1990-91 Budget, to privatise the Pipeline Authority. At present the Pipeline Authority operates as a Government instrumentality. It is commissioned to be the carrier of gas from the Moomba gas fields to Sydney and a number of other regional locations: The Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) pays a haulage fee to the Pipeline Authority for its gas needs and distributes that gas through its own neta work to its customers. To prepare for the sale of the Pipeline Authority, the Government has foreshadGovernment owed a number of legislative changes, the effect of which is: to place the operations of the pipeline system onto what the Govhaulage agreement. ernment has described as a proper commercial footing; to increase the haulage charges which the Pipeline Authority presently charges, and I think in some instances the figure mentioned is some per cent increase; to ensure that those additional charges are passed on to the consumer-I believe it is mandatory for those charges to be placed on to the con2006. sumer-and to regulate the operation of the pipeline system after its sale in order to prevent monopoly exploitation by the new owner. This means that the Governthat ment intends artificially to inflate the price of the Pipeline Authority by moving it from a break even operation to one where the increased haulage charges will assure the Authority and the new owner of a commercially acceptable .profit. fact, what we have is a very straightforand ward case of the Government wanting to maximise the sale price for the politically motivated and cynical purpose of increassition ing its budgetary surplus and to achieve flow for it. this by what amounts to a tax on gas consumers. To understand the highly questionable ethics involved in this proposal, I would like the House to consider the following background. I will take the members of the House back to 1973, because it was in that year that AGL was in the process of constructing the Moomba to Sydney pipeline and in that year that the Whitlam Government of the day decided to nationthe alise it. AGL was constructing the pipeline on a cost-of-service basis and the Government undertook to meet all contractual commitments entered into by AGL. In 1974 an agreement was signed between AGL and the Pipeline Authority for the haulage of gas. It provided for the Pipefor line Authority to recover all costs if, and only if, the gas achieved a certain speciif fied volume. I stress again 'to recover the costs if, and only if, the gas achieved certain specified volume'. Subsequently when it was clear that the volumes would never achieve the specified levels, the became concerned at the magnitude of its potential losses and at that stage commenced negotiations on a It was in 1985 that AGL and the Government entered into a heads of agreement which provided for AGL to pay a haulage tariff sufficient to enable all the 25 Pipeline Authority costs associated with the Moomba to Sydney system to be recovered over the life of the project and, specifically, this means to 31 December From reading the associated material concerned with this issue, it seems likely it is this provision which the Governsale ment sees as standing in the way of a successful sale at the price the Government wants. So what does it do? It thinks the solution is easy. Like a lot of other actions of this Government, it reneges on In the 1974 and 1985 agreements with AGL it intends to introduce legislation which will make the Pipeline Authority a much more attractive. commercial propoand, in fact, creates a bit of a cash Obviously it must be assumed that AGL would be a potential purchaser of the Pipeline Authority and, indeed, there is a disputation between the Government and AGL over an agreement provision that it be given the right of first refusal. Other potential tenderers may also exist. I do not want to suggest for a moment by my comments here tonight that I am against privatisation of the Pipeline Authority, or that I favour any particular commercial outcome. I raise this matter tonight in the hope that it will encourage the Government to reconsider the reasons for, and the manner of, achieving an artificially determined sale price. I know that the Minister Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner); who is seated at the table, likes precision and I ask him precise questions, I am sure all he will give me the answers-and I hope he wil1later tonight or at least at the next sitting. To be precise, I would like to hear from the Minister responsib-e whether the proposed legislative action is contrary in any way to the 1974 haulage agreement or the 1985 heads of agreement; whether the Government has had advice from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) as to the legality of the Government's intended actions and, if so, what. is the nature of that concern and that advice from the Attorney-General? I would like to know precisely whether the Minister agrees with the claim made by the Australian Gas Light Co. that his proposed legislation has the ability to damage seriously the viability of both the manufacturing and gas industries in New South Wales. I would like him to answer whether the Government has offered compensation to AGL and, if so, whether this would negate the benefits to the Government from the inflated sale price. I understand that pensation has been offered to AGL. I also understand that the nature of that compensation would make the whole exercise rather a nonsense. I would like him to answer precisely whether the Department of Finance Commonwealth Task Force on Asset Sales has stated in a letter to AGL that-the proposed course of action 'should result in only modest increases in final gas prices charged to consumers in New South Wales and the ACT'. I would also like the Minister to tell me whether one of the major justifications for privatisation is the benefit it offers the community-and I think he would suggest that it does. Then, can the Minister tell me what benefits there are for gas consumers when the immediate effect of the Government's actions will be to cause what the Canberra bureaucrats disarmingly refer to as 'only modest increases in gas prices'? I would like to know the nature of the 'modest increases in gas prices' particularly at a time when consumers, whether they be manufacturers or private citizens, are finding it extremely difficult under the economic policies of this Government merely to keep their heads above the financial waters, let alone make a profit. It does seem to me on all the evidence available so far that this is a very blundering approach to the subject under consideration. Again I say that I know the Minister likes precise questions. They are precise questions, and I would appreciate precise answers.",149
225,Mr REID,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The Budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on Tuesday, 21 August 1990, will long be remembered as the day the Government deserted the families of rural Australia. The Treasurer in his Budget has failed to address our major problems: debt, inflation and high interest rates. It is painfully obvious to rural Australia that the present policies which the Government has in place are simply not working. Country areas, and particularly my own electorate of Bendigo, are hardest hit by the Government's policy of high interest rates, and in country towns throughout the electorate the impact is being felt like com- a huge drought or plague. The people of that area are in shock. My advice to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer is to get out into those country areas and see what is happening in rural Australia. The people of rural Australia have lost confidence in this Government. The Government talks about social justice, but where is the social justice in rural Australia for the thousands of people who have lost their jobs; the retailers who have been forced to close their doors; the manufacturers who have been forced to shed staff because of the economic recession; and the farmers who are losing their incomes and, in many instances, their properties. Under a Hawke-Keating Labor Government, there is no social justice in rural areas. Recently I visited a sale of merino rams at St Arnaud within my electorate. Prices were down. Farmers can cope with that, but not with all the other factors that currently face them. As a result of the loss of markets overseas, the live sheep trade and wool and grain prices down, the rural economy in my electorate is staggering. There is a total lack of confidence in the direction that the Treasurer of this nation is taking the country. The people have lost confidence in the way the Government is handling this economicrecession. Many young people are leaving my area to find work in other cities and migrating to the city. That is just a thumbnail sketch of what is happening in the rural sector of my electorate. It is extremely serious and the Government must address the questions that are facing country people in this nation. I now move to another area under the energy field. I was interested that the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) spoke about gas energy and the gas pipeline. I also want to get into another area of micro-economic reform. That debate up until now has been confined mainly to the introduction of competition into telecommunications, Qantas and Australian Airlines. But the Government really still has to face up to the question of full and proper competition not only in those areas but also in other areas of activity. One area which, sadly, has been neglected and needs reform is the electric power generation industry. The main reason for this appears to be that most of the electrical energy in this country is produced by State instrumentalities with little regard or concern for the total demand load of the Australian nation as a whole. There has been much discussion about the new federalism throughout the country. Perhaps that will break down some of the barriers· between States, and people will consider how economically viable the cooperation of State-run instrumentalities could be in the production of electricity. The time has come for the construction of an eastern and south-eastern States power grid, to include Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. The sale and transfer of electrical energy throughout Europe is done from country to country on a lowest price opportunity basis. Victoria has now established a link with South Australia Portland, and these transmission lines have a link with South Australia, which has been strengthened as a result of the establishment of the Alcoa smelter at Portland. We also have a link with New South Wales via the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority hook-up. The transmission between these states needs to be strengthened, and the links between northern New South Wales and southern Queensland need to be substantially upgraded. Tasmania, of course, could be linked by an underWater direct current cable. Peak loading capacity could be supplied from Tasmania's hydro-electric schemes into a national south-east grid. The national electricity grid could supply baseload power generated in either New South Wales or Victoria and fed into Tasmania as a b;lseload supply. Why would we want to set up a national electricity grid? It would include a maximisation of resources and.' a wider choice of ·low .cost options· of generation, including hydro, gas, brown coal, black coal and wind power generation·. It could also lead to the implementation of national demand management strategies, reducing the demand for energy required throug;hout this whole nation. , ! I went into a state of shock as I walked into this Parliament House for the first time and saw the massive waste of electrical energy. I understand that an energy audit is being carried out in Parliament House at this moment, as well it might be, having regard to this building'S annual energy bill of $4.1m. A national strategy of demand management needs to be implemented in this country and could only be achieved by having in place a national south-eastern grid. Private enterprise generation of electricity must be introduced to provide competition between the existing utilities and to provide the lowest possible price for energy to the consumer in this country. A reduced number of generati0n facilities will be required if the transmission grid were strengthened between the States and the interflow of electricity took place via between all ,the States I have mentioned. The utilisation of high rise buildings in major cities, which already have an emergency supply built into them, could be used at peak loading times to take some of the pressure off the generation facilities dollars. we currently have in place. The bottom line mu-t be lower energy costs to· the consumers. There are side benefits which are of major consequence as well. The greenhouse effect would be minimised if there were less burning of fossil fuels and emissions into the atmosphere. Our overseas borrowings would be reduced and it would provide us with the opportunity to maximise the resources of the electricity energy field so that we can interchange power between the States and provide consumers throughout this energy rich country with the lowest possible energy charges.",151
226,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I wish to address Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1990-91 as it affects the primary industries and energy portfolio. I was very disappointed in the Budget allocation for primary industries because, unfortunately, the Budget has failed to recognise the importance of primary industries and the contribution of the mining sector to Australia's wealth creation. To be competitive, these export industries need an exchange rate which reflects our economic worth, not one that is propped up by high internal interest rates. In the aftermath of the Budget, exactly the opposite occurred. Foreign markets, prior to the release of the Budget, were speculative and uncertain as to whether major reform would take place. Once international markets determined that this Budget was in fact a lame duck Budget, with a policy stuck in the groove of high interest rates, the foreign markets resumed their buying spate, allowing the dollar to reach a 16-month high against the United States dollar, to the value of US81.62c. In fact, a week later the dollar reached US83.31c. If one thing will make our export industries competitive, it is a realistic value for the dollar. Every one cent rise in the value of the dollar costs our wheat growers $2.50 per tonne. If one relates that across the whole field of primary industries, one will find that the high value of the dollar affects our primary industries to the tune of millions and millions of It is our exports sector that is going to turn our economy around. Indeed, the Budget recognised that in a small way because the entire 2 per cent growth expected in the economy over the next 12 months is going to come from the exports sector. It is not strange then to realise that a range of experts still condemn· the Government's high interest rate policy. Among the experts who condemn the Government's policy is the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, who was a former adviser to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). If the value of the Australian dollar were to fall to US70c, our exports would immediately be put on a much more competitive footing and imports would be far less attractive. Quite conceivably, this could contribute about one-quarter of the required cutback in our import bill. It has been forecast that the real value of the Australian dollar, after accounting for inflation, has to fall by between 15 and 27 per cent to stabilise our foreign debt without depressing economic growth. Industry is most urgently in need of reformed monetary policy and what would gain the most right now would be the wool, wheat and beef industries. But because of the value of our dollar, they are bleeding to death. Another savage attack was made on the primary industry sector with· the increase in inspection charges. The Budget continued the lack of recognition of primary industries and mining. This was emphasised in the Budget with a 40 per cent increase in export inspection charges. The increase in export inspection, domestic meat inspection and quarantine charges will occur irrespective of the fact that this year's growth in the domestic economy will be funded by the export sector. Prior to the 1990-91 Federal Budget, these charges were paid by the industry to the tune of 60 per cent. This Budget in one year has put a further 40 per cent tax on the industry. The increased tax is a levy on the industry, which does not have any representation. The industry has no control over the work practices of these inspectors and, as the shadow Minister for primary industries, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), pointed out earlier, this work does not require a great skill. However, the industry has no control over the work practices or the staffing levels governing these regulations. In other words, the regulations are laid down by the people who do not pay the bills. This, of course, is bureaucracy at best. It is a case of 'We regulate and you pay'. I challenge the Government, as the shadow Minister said correctly, to privatise or at least corporatise this inspection service so that the industry can have some control over the funds that it contributes. I think that is only fair. People who pay the bill should have a say in how things are run. With the increased tax, the red meat industry is expected to contribute $11 Om, an increase of $44m over last year. The increased inspection charge effectively reduces the net worth of the beef industry by 5 per cent. These figures put to rest any argument that the export industries are being subsidised in any way. I draw a comparison with the situation in the United States of America where the Government pays the full cost of inspection charges in recognition of the public health argument. This is also an encouragement to be more competitive in the export field. It is crucial that this Government encourage rather than tax an industry which ranks as the world's largest exporter of beef and veal, a trade which in the previous 12 months was worth $2.3 billion. Yet the industry has been hit with a 40 per cent additional tax in one year. Live sheep and goats in 1988-89 contributed $198m to the current account. We were the second largest exporter of mutton and lamb, a trade worth $345m. Perhaps those industries were a prime target. But they were unable to do much about it. The tax was imposed upon them and, of course, they will now have to pay it. The red meat industry should receive the same encouragement as is given to the Australian automobile industry which, through an export facilitation scheme, benefits from a reduction in import penalties. In stark comparison with the red meat industry, the Australian motor industry is heavily subsidised on the domestic front. That is another example of the Labor Party's discrimination against the efficient primary producing sector to the benefit of the inefficient manufacturing its industries. I shall not take up any further time of the House other than to sum up by saying that it is time the Government recognised the value and importance of primary industry to the nation and gave it much more consideration in the future.",153
227,Mr TRUSS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"1 speak in this debate on the primary industry estimates, with the Government benches completely empty; the Minister has no one in the House to support him. There is no one left on the Government side of the House to defend these estimates, no one who is prepared to defend the Government's record in primary industry. The bottom line of the Government's primary industry budget is that government expenditure is down. In a year when Budget expenditure has been increased in a wide variety of fields, the Government again has found room to cut expenditure for primary industry. The figures are stark and should alarm the Australian people. Expenditure on primary industry is down from $445.4m to $423.3m. Worse than that, projections over the next three years indicate that expenditure will decline further to $308.9m. Labor cuts primary industry while its expenditure in other areas increases. Farmers will contribute $1,369.9m in levies and charges, and in return the Government will contribute $423.3m. For every $3 that farmers contribute by way of levies and charges, the Government adds $1. That is illustrated graphically in the Budget Papers by a series of bar graphs, which show in long black lines what the farmers are contributing, and a little white dot at the end signifies the Government's miserable additional contribution. Some 74 per cent of the entire primary industry budget will be contributed by farmers themselves. Yet these expenditure cuts come at a time when primary industry faces an absolutely calamitous year. The Australia Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) told us that last year the net value of farm production fell by 20 per cent. Its prediction earlier in the year was that it would fall by a further 48 per cent in 1990-91. How many people who support the Government, how many wage and salary earners and unionists, would be prepared to accept without complaint a 68 per cent reduction in pay over two years? I venture to suggest there would not be too many. The actual decrease in earnings will be greater than that, because I am sure even ABARE will acknowledge that the estimates of reduction in farm income for the year ahead are unduly optimistic on present indications, with the disaster facing the wool and grain industries, problems in the sheep industry, and difficulties confronting beef, sugar and every other primary industry. It is interesting to note that last mas the Australian Wheat Board's asking price for wheat was $USI85. Today the card price is $US 120. Even the Australian Wheat Board acknowledges that almost any offer will be considered. Farmers are facing disastrous reductions in farm income. Last year at the Agricultural Outlook Conference it was reported that the real return on farm investment was only 1.1 per cent, and that included capital appreciation: a 1.1 per cent return on investments. This Government has the dreadful record of driving more people out of farming than has any other government in Australia's history. This year the story will be even worse. On many occasions the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has been invited to come out and see some of the farmers at the 'coal face', to see what is happening as a result of Government policy. He has never accepted the invitation. I welcome the small increase in rural adjustment funds in this Budget, but with the outlook for the rural industry, those allocations will be grossly inadequate. In Queensland, for the first time in many years, we have the extraordinary situation of a Labor Government unfortunately gaining office. It has behaved like its Federal counterparts; its first Budget is full of cuts in the rural sector. It did not look anywhere else for cuts; the cuts are always first in the rural sector. One of its first actions was to sack the Board of the Queensland Industrial Development Corporation (QIDC), the organisation charged with administering rural adjustment in that State-an organisation that had just returned record profits, an organisation with an outstanding record and an organisation that was well appreciated in the rural sector. There was no Victorian type economic management in the QIDC, but out the Board went to be replaced by a group of Labor Party mates. Its first act was to increase the interest rates on rural loans by 4 per cent. That indicated Labor's real attitude to the rural sector. Labor has no Christsympathy for the tragedy confronting Australian farmers at present. It has no real understanding of what is going on in the rural sector at all. It is quite clear that the Federal Government has not realised the enormity of the impact of the current rural crisis, not just on the farm families of Australia but also on our national economy. It is quite clear that, despite all our attempts to foster manufacturing industry, our country still depends utterly on its primary sector for its export earnings. There seems to be some kind of an attitude in this country that primary production dollars are somehow second rate; they do not count and are beneath the dignity of a modern and progressive country. We prefer to pamper our manufacturing industries, and really they have not responded. We are prepared to provide a $30m subsidy to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd. Somehow, film processing is an industry of national importance, but apparently food production is not and fibre production does not matter. Our manufacturing has failed to succeed as the major source of investment and drive for our national economy. It has no capacity to grow, largely because of this Government's economic policies, its wage demands, its taxes and charges and, of course, underlying all of that, the increasing value of the Australian dollar. Australia remains utterly dependent upon its primary producers. We should be proud of that fact and we should be prepared to honour the contribution that they make. The Australian Business magazine highlighted this very effectively in its edition of 25 July when it listed the top 500 exporters in Australia. It is interesting to note that in the top 10 exporters there is not a single manufacturer; in the top 20 only one company relies on manufacturing for its export earnings; and in the top 50 only three really rely on manufacturing for their export competitive situation. This Budget ought to reflect the vital role that agriculture plays in our society and in our economy. Our Ministers are relying entirely on some kind of breakthrough in the Uruguay Round to achieve justice for the primary sector. But it is a forlorn hope. The Americans and the European Community (EC) are able to afford forever both the financial and political cost of subsidies. Their consumers are prepared to accept that and to encourage their rural industries because they recognise the vital importance that they play in their economy. The United States behaves like a schoolyard bully, suggesting to all other countries that they should break down trade barriers. But there is no gratitude to countries such as Australia, which has been prepared to make this the fundamental aspect of its rural policy platform. True, we need to have world-wide trade reform. But it is not working. This Government needs to recognise that if it relies on the Uruguay Round as its only primary industry policy, Australian farmers will be the sufferers. The Americans will not suffer; the Ee;: is not suffering-they are doing good. well. They look at us and say, 'If you want to be such mugs as to open up your markets without any restrictions, allow in commodities that are produced without using Australia's high standards, if all of that is to be' permitted, thank you very much. We will dump our products in your country and you'll get no thanks, you'll get no access to our markets and you'll get no encouragement of any kind'. We are being treated by the world as dills in this area. We are making no contribution to the world debate on this issue. The only sufferers are the producers of Australia and the economy of this nation. Following the 1985 Federal Budget, farmers from around Australia assembled at the old Parliament House. About 40,000 farmers travelled many thousands of miles to indicate their anger and disgust at the performance of the Hawke Labor Government. Prime Minister Hawke told us that he was our friend, but with friends like that who really needs enemies? Following this Budget there will not be any rallies by the farmers around Parliament House. Their anger is still there but it has turned also to disgust and despair. They can no longer afford the $100 bus fare to come down to Canberra to rally. But I assure the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, that the protest, anger and despair is still there. I urge the Government to come out and have a look.",154
228,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,156
229,Mr SNOW,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1990-91 in relation to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I do not agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), who has just spoken, that farmers are hostile towards the Government. Farmers constitute 14 per cent of the work force in Eden-Monaro. I realise that in some electorates the ratio is as high as 20 per cent, but 14 per cent is still pretty high on average and the relationship of those farmers to this Government is reasonably As an example, I will cite the recent debate on the wool industry. The messages that came to me from the industry about this Government's actions were varied, as they often are with primary industry. For instance, the medium wool growers wanted a higher levy than the one which was applied and they also wanted a higher floor price. They wanted to maintain floor prices at 870c. This was not the case with carpet wool growers. They felt that they should be liable only to a very low levy, if any at all, because, after all, their product was adding value entirely within Australia; in fact, we are importing carpet wool. So they had a tifiable claim that no levy should be plied to them. As well as that, fine wool growers and wool growers from the Southern Tablelands contacted me and urged the Government not to pursue the higher floor price. So the messages were different. There are farmers who have a complete undersmall standing of the Government's position. Indeed people have sa,id to government committees, 'I would not have been game to say this outside, but you have gone right way'. I would hate to see what the position of the wool industry would be businesses today if the Government had not taken that action. I turn briefly to the fishing industry, which is facing a great challenge today. At this time members of the Australian Fisheries Service are visiting a number ports from Lakes Entrance to Sydney, talking to the people in the fishing indusern try and discussing with them the prospects for the industry and the way in which they would like to go. It looks as thciugh individual transferable quotas will be order of the day and that most people the industry will be affected by quotas imposed on particular types of fish. As always with the people in the fishing industry who are common farmers, it is not all that easy to come to a conclusion about the best interests of the industry when one relies only on the people in the industry. They all have different interests and they all operate in different. sectors, so there is a lot of competition within industry. It would be great if the people in the industry could get together and come to the Government and say, 'Here is our agreement', so that we could have a sustainable resource which people fish and live off but, at the same time, make sure will be sustainable in the long term. But we cannot achieve that, so the Government has to have a series of meetings and has to visit people in the industry and come to a conclusion. My view is that when thinking about the fishing industry we ought to be sure that we do not get rid of the small individual family units-the smaller boats in the industry. They certainly 'predominate between Lakes jusEntrance and Sydney. They are family apbusinesses which have been going for decades, and which are entitled to keep going. Mr Cowan-And on th- north coast.",156
230,Mr SNOW,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I am the first of four generations of Snows not to live on the north coast so I am well and truly familiar with the industry on the north coast. There are industries in other areas of Australia, I know that. It is extremely important that we keep the smaller businesses going in the fishing industry because they the are vital for the small towns around the coast. They are a vital part of local town The last thing I want to mention is the timber industry. I believe that this is one area where there can, be substantial savings not only for local areas but for Australia if we can' move to adding value in of the timber industry. The recent joint scientific study completed on the south-eastforests shows the way to go. I hope this Government does not make some of the mistakes that.have been made in Tasmania and Queensland and accepts the the joint scientific study which was commisin sioned by this Government in agreement with the New South Wales Government. Upon the completion of the report, based on all the studies that have been made of the forests, suddenly people start saying, 'But there is something we have forgotten; we have forgotten about biophysical naturalness'. They were not quite sure what it means so they asked Professor Nix to prepare a report and said, 'Look, we have the left something out; the joint scientific study was not meant to look at biophysical naturalness and we ought to have a look at that'. Professor Nix was overseas so somebody in his office sat down and can drew and coloured a few maps and presen ted the maps to the Government and said, 'Right, these are extra areas that should .be set aside for reasons of biophysical naturalness'. Mr Deputy Chairman, we have been going on for 51/2 or 6 years about these south-eastern forests and people have been sented? wondering what to do. Sawmillers with old equipment say that they are ready to put in new equipment if only they know that they have security in their industry. They will get that security once we tell them where the reserves are and what plans are for the industry. These people can add value to our timber. Instead of wood chipping it, they can process more timber in their sawmills and add value it through treatment if we make it worth their while. It will only be worth their while if they know whether their industry has a future. This is particularly important. It is tremely important that we tell their future is. By 28 September the MinHeister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) will being mehave had a look at propositions from New South Wales about reserve areas. By then we need to have a definite statement from sition's both governments-New South Wales and mediately'. Federal-as to where the important boundaries are concerning reserves. Mr Deputy Chairman, agriculture is tal to our economy. It has been for a long said: time. People who say that we can forget Over five years. about agriculture, that it is finished, wrong. We need to be adding value to our primary products within Australia. We can 'remove turn around our trade deficit from the ator; not mine. timber industry alone. We need to continually support our vital primary industries.",157

I listened intently to the answer. talked about the price of petrol and made comparisons with other countries. Austhe tralia is a very large country, and comparto isons with Great Britain and Italy are completely irrelevant. The Minister talked market. about the price of petrol. I think he was trying to substantiate the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said at one stage we had taxation by stealth at the petrol pump and that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said he would reduce the price of petrol. It never occurred because we all know that the taxation that comes from petrol is great revenue for Federal governbecome ments. Mr Gayler-We have been subsidising Tasmania for years.",159

It seems to be fashionable, when a member becomes the Minister responsible for the environment, for that member always to lean to the green. I do not know why. I asked my good friend the honourable member for We Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) why. He said to me, 'Bruce, the reason they do it is that the greens talk people into what they want. They forget about the rationale that the we need workers in the bush, that we It need workers everywhere to make us a great country'. But the honourable member for Canberra was dressed in green.

250,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"Well, I am very sorry about that. Let me rephrase that: I am very sorry about my oversight. I want tonight to talk about the malaise that seems to be affecting Australia and about some of the symptoms of that malaise. In particular, I want to mention this building. We have been in it for some time now and we have had time to take stock of it. There is no doubt that there are some great features about this building. It has some of the best marquetry to be found anywhere; some of the woodwork is absolutely superb. But the design of the building is quite frightening. It is a very un-Australian building, designed by an Italian-American fascist, and the style",160
251,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! I do not think the honourable member for Kalgoorlie should cast that aspersion on the architect of the building, who is an Australian citizen.",160
252,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I will reconsider that. But the style is no doubt what one would call 'imperial Mussolini'. I have come to the conclusion that the problem is that the building separates the Executive from the administration in a way that has never happened before. It has made the Executive much more remote from the people. Visitors come through the large doors and sort of look straight into the Executive. The legislature is really an appendage, shut off on either side of the main building. When the revolution comes, when the right wing marches and takes over, it will just lock off the doors on either side of the chamber and everything will be the same; the building will remain the same and the legislature will simply be pushed to one side. There are many matters that are of great concern. Honourable members do not get the same interaction with the media that existed in the old Parliament House. It is true that some journalists have what one would call a 'special entree', but the great mass of journalists do not. I note that we have actually made it harder for journalists to talk to the Executive because we have roped them off. It is a great pity because when the journalists cannot get information they will go out and invent it. We see a bit of this occurring these days. The other problem, of course, is that we are so much more remote. I must say that I would not want to give up this building; it is far more comfortable for me as a backbencher than the old building was. But honourable members certainly do not meet people the way they used to in the old building. In the old days, Ministers could not avoid people. One would meet them in the toilet, if nowhere else. That does not occur now. The toilet is a great equaliser and a lot of matters can be solved in the toilet. Now the Executive is situated a long way from the offices of backbenchers. A Minister actually said to me, 'You don't call around any more'. At my age, it is a hell of a long way to walk. When a member gets to the Minister's office, he does not know whether the Minister is in, and he can be fobbed off. So it is very damaging in that context. . I feel that this building must be humanised. One of the things that should be done-and, Mr Speaker, I should like you to give this some consideration-relates to a practice in the old Parliament House. It was the habit to have a light shining to indicate that Parliament was sitting. It served no great function, except, as a means of communication between the people of Australia and the Parliament. I believe it was a worthwhile exercise. I am told by tourist guides and by the infallible judges of public opinion, the Commonwealth car drivers, that there is a lot of uncertainty in the minds of visitors who come here. They do not know whether Parliament is sitting. I am told that visitors to the gallery often wonder whether Parliament is sitting. The matter is worth considering. The cost would be very minimal. It w'Juld serve to build a bridge between the people of Australia and the Parliament. It is something that we should give real consideration to. Mr Speaker, I hope that in your capacity as Speaker you will give this due consideration.",160
253,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Could I just point out for the information of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that in the design of the building the light well above the chamber, which is glass and opens out onto the sky, is visible in the same way as the lights above the flag poles on the old building were' visible. Maybe the honourable member for Kalgoorlie might like to check that for me this evening and let me know later on tonight. Nursing Homes",161
254,Mrs GALLUS,ADJOURNMENT,"1 should like to bring to the attention of the House what is happening to nursing homes, especially in South Australia but I believe all over Australia, and certainly following the recent changes in the Budget. If honourable members were not aware, nursing home hours were reduced in the Budget. There was a reduction of half an hour in category 3 and one hour in category 5. This does not appear to be very much, certainly if one does not know about nursing homes. What it amounts to, in my State of South Australia, is 10 hours per week. That is equivalent to one shift. It comes at a time when nursing homes are already finding it extremely hard to manage. Prior to the Budget. I had representation from pretty well every nursing home in my electorate and, as honourable members may know, I have the electorate with the highest proportion of elderly residents in Australia and thus a fair number of nursing homes. The complaints of the staff were that since the reduction in nursing home hours and the changes that were brought in in 1987 by the Hawke Labor Government their job had changed considerably. They could no longer talk to the patients. They could no longer give them the personal care that they used to give them. Their time was spent doing very menial tasks, rushing to and from each patient, and they were finding at the end of the day that they were exhausted and the patients were not getting the care they expected. That was before the Budget and now we have had the cuts in the Budget. Staff in the nursing homes in my State were stunned. They were stu-ned not (;mly - e­ cause they were already In a bad sItuatIOn but because at that very time there was a review looking into the nursing home hours the so-called care aggregated module (CAM) review. This was no poor, petty little review by a few people around - he country. Those represented on the reVIew were: the Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations, the consumer movement the health industry group of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Commonwealth and State bureaucrats, the Australian Health Ministers Conference and the Australian Nursing Homes Association. These people had got together in January this year to do a review of CAM - nd the nursing home hours. One - ould. thInk that any government woU.ld walt un-ll th.at review was presented to It. The reVIew IS, in fact due to be presented in October with the deliberations of this very high-y qualified group. What in fact happened IS. that the Government went ahead without reference to the review and unilaterally changed the hours. The nursing homes in my State have been absolutely stunned by the change. They do not know how they ar- going to incorporate it into their nurSIng home hours and, what is more, they are extremely upset with this Government. They believe that .the Government no longer listens to them and does not seem to have the interests of the nursing homes at heart and, what is more important,. does not have the interests of the nursIng home residents at heart. To finish I would like to read a quote from the p-ople who are engaged in the review. This is their opinion of Canberra and of the people who run Canberra. It states: Changing the rules in mid-game: this is yet other example of how indecisive and unsure IS Canberra. Yet another example of the. dupli-ity attached to words used by Canberra m settmg the general game play rules. On behalf of the people in my electorate the nursing home residents and the nur-ing homes in my electorate, I would like to make an objection to a government that pre-empts its own reviews and unilaterally reduces hours.

255,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"Prospect) (10.46)Tonight I would like to bring to the notice of the House the history of a grand lady living within the Prosp-ct electorate, Edith Jean Neesam, who IS 73 years of age and has just been named Fairfield Senior Citizen of the Year. I do so because I believe her services should go down in the journals of this Parliament. Edith Neesam has lived in my electorate for 50 years with her husband, Harold. She has not only been a wife and mother of three children, with five grandchildren and one great-grandchild, but she has devoted her life during those 50 years to service to the community-she is one of those people I call the unsung heroes of our community. She has served as superintendent of St John's Ambulance cadets for 15 years. In her 39 years membership of the Country Women's Association she has been President Vice-President and Secretary and has held many other positions. She is a member of the Fairfield Home Care Committee Advisory Council, which she has served for 15 years. She is a member of the Fairfield Senior Citizens Centre. In fact I had pleasure, as President of that Cen'tre, of bestowing on her and her husband ·life membership. Edith Neesam has devoted a lot of years of work to meals on wheels in the Fairfield City area. She also sits on the area's Health Consumer Affairs Advisory Council. She was presented with the Premier's award for senior citizens in 1990 and, as I said, she has now received the Fairfield City award. Why have I mentioned Edith Neesam? The other night at the mayoral ball at which she was presented with this award, a-­ people asked, 'Why did you do it?'. - he said 'I come from a very large famtly. My 'family-going back 70-odd years ago-was poor. We didn't have money. My mother said to me, ""If you cannot give financially to your community, you can give of yourself. You can give of your time"".' Edith Neesam is a person who has, over the years of her life, carried on the tradition that she was exposed to in her upbringing. I believe'"" she is an inspiration, not only to the people in the community I represent, but also to the people throughout Australia. She is a person who comes forward and gives of her time voluntarily. She does not look for any rewards and is always there ,with a helping hand. She is not a person who expected to be received and recognised in this way, and I am so pleased and proud that she has been. I believe that people such as her deserve to have due public recognition. I know that the people in my electorate of Prospect congratulate her. But, once again, I would like to put on the record of this Parliament my appreciation. I say to Edith Jean Neesam, 'For your 50 years of service to the community, thank you, and may you and your husband of 50 years have many more years together'. Water Resources",162
256,Mr COWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to say something about the neglect of water services within Australia, but might I just comment upon the earlier remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I just remind the House-and I know that he was jovial about the matter-that more than a million Australians have come to see Parliament House. Many school children and citizens from my electorate have visited it and I have never heard one really criticise the establishment. They may criticise the members who occupy it-they may criticise us allbut I feel that the average Australian is tremendously proud of the Parliament we have. I do not mind walking. I know the office accommodation is good, but I think it is good exercise not to use the lift but to walk from our offices to the chamber for a division, a quorum, or something of the kind. The acoustics within the chamber are good and, as the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) said earlier, it is lovely to see the Australian flag. If the Canberra Raiders flag were up there this afternoon, well good luck to the Raiders. We do not mind that because they deserve it. , But I sometimes get concerned about the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. He is not a bad bloke. We ought to have a special chair made for him. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) would agree with me. There is no doubt that he stands out, or sits out, because he sits at the back of the chamber. Seeing that he represents the largest electorate in Australia, even in the world, and he covers it particularly well, I think that the administration should at least consider giving him a seat up the back that lets him stand out in the chamber. Mrs J akobsen-Gi ve him a high chair.",163
257,Mr COWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"We will put him in a high chair. I really rose to talk about water resources in Australia, but I can see it is a jovial evening. But we are neglecting things. Having been a Minister for water resources in New South Wales-the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) was also involved in conservation there-I know that years ago all we talked about was water conservation, conservation on the farm, on the rivers, and where we could erect a dam to help in the field of agriculture. Today, unfortunately, most of the States-I include New South Wales in this and I hope I am not wrong-and the Commonwealth are not allocating the money to the essential water resources that this nation requires because we are basically a dry nation. Water is like the blood in our bodies: if we do not have the circulation we do not exist. We are dealing now with the estimates for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. We are in trouble with primary industries. If we want to help them, what we have to do to make them efficient and produce properly is give them a water supply. If we are not able to provide water supplies from our streams and natural conservation areas, where we can put these storages for goodness sake let us look at the ways and means by which we can encourage landowners to build their own conservation works on their own farms. This is a simple thing to do if we gi ve a taxation incentive. We should be able to say to a landowner, 'If you erect a storage on your farm, we will allow you certain taxation incentives.' There has to be an inducement of some form or other to allow for that. The· electorate of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, I am sure, would certainly require this, particularly its agricultural centres. It is a shame that governments today are basically turning their back on water resources simply because of the pressure of the greenies and the ardent conservationists. I think they have gone far too and they are diverting the thoughts of this nation in a direction that is not in the interests of agriculture. Therefore I raise this matter. I will continue to pursue it whilst ever I am a member of this House because I feel that we are all failing to make the contribution generally towards the building of water resources both in our streams and on the farm. Political Education",163
258,Mr GIBSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to talk about a very important issue which I think is important to the future of this country and that is the tion of political education in this country. As a teacher for a number of years, I have always had an abiding interest in politics, which is probably obvious from the fact that I am now here in this House, but it has always concerned me greatly that in our State education systems we spend very little time talking to our students about the Constitution and the political system in this country. It is an alarming situation that when students leave school at the age of 17 or 18, they are just about to enter the voting age and participate in the election process, yet they know very little about what they are about to do, what the voting system means and what they are supposed to do when they go to the ballot box to cast their vote. I want to pay particular credit to you, Mr Spe-ker, for the innovation which has been introduced into this House in the establishment of the Parliamentary Education Office. I have had an opportunity to work with Richard Gilbert, the Director of that Office, and he has provided me with a lot of support in the last few months. I congratulate him on the work that he and his staff do and I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on having the Parliamentary Education Office established. It is playing a very important role in our community in trying to educate our young people about the importance of our Constitution and our democratic system in this country. Richard Gilbert has been of great assistance to me in my work as the member far for Moreton. In the last few months I have taken the opportunity to give a number of talks in schools throughout my electorate on the subject of the Constitution and our political system. I am alarmed· at the lack of knowledge among today students and some teachers about how our political system operates. That is a pretty poor situation. It should be compulsory for all students in year 12 to learn about the Constitution, the political structures and the history of politics in this country, so that when students leave school and go out into the work force a few months later and are then faced with quesan election process, they know what they are doing. It is alarming that people cast votes, including preferential votes, and they have no idea what the preferential system means or how preferential votes are counted and what the· impact of the system'is. They have no understanding of how the Senate and the House of Representatives are elected, or what we do. It is a credit to this House that at least we here are trying to do something about that. I am particularly pleased, having an electorate in Queensland, that we have available to students of the schools in my electorate the travel subsidy which allows them to travel to Canberra to find out about the seat of democracy in this country, to learn about how politics operate and how the parliamentary democratic system works in this country by being able to see it in operation. I am very pleased with that innovation that has been introduced. I am not sure exactly when it came in, but I understand it was only in the last year or two. It means that school students in my electorate get a subsidy of $50 to travel to Canberra. Now, $50 is not a great deal of money, but it is a lot more than they were getting in the past. My only plea is that the amount be indexed so that it will not be eroded by the elfects of inflation. This will enable students from my electorate more regularly to visit this House and learn a lot more about the parliamentary system of democracy. I urge all State education authorities introduce, as a compulsory subject for all final year students, the study of political history, political structures and the Constitution in this country, so that we can have a much better educated electorate-people who understand what they are doing when they go to the ballot box and can make a careful and conscious vote at each election. Peace Research Centre",164
259,Dr KEMP,ADJOURNMENT,"The process for determining the successful application of the Peace Research Centre in Western Australia raises the suspicion that political rather than academic considerations applied. It draws attention to the great danger of political intervention in academic research, which is inherent in the system of decision making that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) has established. The independent process by which research grants are normally allocated has been not followed in this case. The facts, which reveal a very disturbing picture, are that the possibility of a peace research centre for the Minister's home State of Western Australia was first suggested during the Federal election campaign by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). The announcement that a peace research centre would be set up was made by a peace activist at a Palm Sunday rally, reportedly on behalf of the Minister. Some members of the advisory committee appointed to select a tertiary institution to establish the research centre were active in non-academic peace groups. When the advisory committee was deadlocked and advised that a new proposal to should be sought, the Minister stepped aside from those recommendations",165
