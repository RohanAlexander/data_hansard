2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Pursuant to standing order 18, I lay on the table my warrant revoking nominations of the honourable members for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and nominating the honourable members for Mallee (Mr Forrest) and Dawson (Mrs DeAnne Kelly) to be members of the Speaker's Panel to assist the chair when requested to so by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker. NA Procedure Committee",13
3,Mr REID,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the committee's report entitled Provision for members to make short speeches in the Main Committee, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",13
4,Mr REID,COMMITTEES,"The recommendations contained in this report represent another develMinisters opment of the Main Committee to meet the needs of members. In 1993 the Procedure Committee first recommended the establishment of a committee to consider a second stream of business and provide more time for members to contribute to debates on government legislation. Since then a number of changes have been made to make the Main Committee more flexible and to expand the opportunities for members to express their views on all the matters which come before the House. Debates on committee reports and government papers have proved successful innovations. This report recommends a further extension of the type of business conducted in the Main Committee. It proposes that each Thursday in the Main Committee a IS-minute period of members' 90-second statements be held at the beginning of the meeting and a half hour adjournment debate take place at the end. The recommendations are the result of an inquiry into whether members need more opportunity to make short speeches on unspecified matters of concern to them and, if so, whether the Main Committee could be used for this purpose. The inquiry was prompted by a letter from a member which noted the limited opportunities for members the to speak in the adjournment debate in the House. The committee gathered the views of members on the issue through a questionnaire. The responses to the questionnaire indicated support for an expansion of opportunities to do raise matters in short speeches and showed a preference, among those responding, for an adjournment debate style procedure. The committee also saw virtue in using a welltested and familiar procedure and in maintainReport ing a degree of consistency between the procedures used in the House and the Main Committee. Under the proposal, an adjournment debate would take place only on Thursday for a maximum of 30 minutes. The flexibility to commence the debate earlier or to negative the adjournment to complete an item of business would be retained, as in the House. would also have the same opportunity to extend the debate for up to 10 minutes to respond to matters raised. The committee recognised that the introduction of an adjournment debate would represent an extension of the type of debate which has been conducted in the Main Committee so far. The guiding principle of the Main Committee is cooperation. Only business on which it is hoped agreement can be reached is referred to the Main Committee. However, this does not mean that debate in the Main Committee should not be lively or spirited or that members cannot introduce controversial matter into their speeches. The standing orders governing the operation of the Main Committee ensure that real disagreement on how its business should be conducted effectively stops its operation. This principle has been upheld by the proposal that any disagreement on the question of the adjournment would automatically close the committee down. Despite the risk of introducing this different style of procedure into the Main Committee, the committee saw a number of possible benefits apart from increasing the opportunities for members to raise issues of concern to them and relieving the pressure on the adjournment debate in the House. This step would help to mitigate the perception that the Main Committee is of lower status than the House. It might also encourage livelier, more spontaneous debate, especially given the smaller, more intimate nature of the Main Committee seating arrangements. The more members who participate in the proceedings of the Main Committee and the more people who watch or listen to it, the greater its level of effectiveness and acceptance will be. At this stage it is recommended that the adjournment debate be introduced into the Main Committee on a trial basis so that its effects can be assessed before instituting a more permanent arrangement. The recommendation for a period of 90-second statements in the Main Committee is also proposed on a trial basis. There was some disagreement among committee members as to whether members' statements would be as effective in the Main Committee but we agreed that the best way to assess the demand for this procedure was to give it a trial. It is proposed to have the Main Committee meet 15 minutes earlier at 9.45 a.m. on Thursdays and allow 90-second statements until 10 o'clock. Both the proposals contained in this report were prompted by representations from members, both formally and informally. They are an opportunity to make better and different use of the Main Committee. I hope that, should they be implemented, members will support them in the right spirit. I commend the report to the House.",13
5,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"This report, Provision/or members to make short speeches in the Main Committee, from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure essentially brings together two different elements of parliamentary practice and procedure. The first relates to the opportunities for ordinary members of the House to raise issues of concern to them-frequently, although not exclusively, matters concerning issues in their own electorates or concerning their own constituents. For a long time there has been difficulty in providing adequate debating opportunities for members to raise these issues. The opportunity which most members take advantage of is the adjournment debate. As a member of the opposition, I know that there is usually quite a keen contest for opportunities to speak on the adjournment debate. Indeed, I dare say that from the government side-certainly government members of the Procedure Committee indicated this-the situation is a good deal worse: for government members the opportunity to raise issues from their electorates does not necessarily arise as frequently as they would wish. The Procedure Committee had approaches from government members and was also mindful of the comments by the member for  proposed that the Main Committee meet between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday to discuss constituency statements. We have endeavoured with this proposal to allow for additional adjournment debate opportunities so that more members than presently do have the opportunity to raise adjournment issues in the House via the Main Committee. The specific proposal is that each Thursday in the Main Committee a IS-minute period of members' 90-second statements be held at the beginning of the meeting and that a half-hour adjournment debate take place at the end. So this is about giving members additional speaking opportunities. The other thing that needs to be noted is that it involves a broader role for the Main Committee. The Main Committee has been established only in the last few years and its role is still an evolving and, to some extent, experimental one. It has been confined to matters which are not controversial or not contested. It is not possible to have a vote in the Main Committee, so clearly that is a place where we cannot move amendments and the like. Nevertheless, it has proved to be a worthwhile debating forum, and what is being proposed here involves an extension of the role of the Main Committee. There is an element of experiment or trial and error about this because it is clear that Main Committee can function only on the basis of cooperation. For example, if either the government or opposition members leave the Main Committee, they deprive it of a quorum and it cannot continue to function. It is possible that, in certain adjournment debates or other circumstances, members will get upset about what is being said and will deprive the Main Committee of a quorum. So the Main Committee will have to continue to function on a consensus basis, and in putting forward the report the members of the Procedure Committee are mindful of that. We are keen to see that consensus basis continue. Nevertheless, we do feel that the Main Committee may be able to do more work than it is presently doing. The addition of the 90second statements and the adjournment debate opportunity will provide scope to do this. This is a move which has been the subject of a survey on opportunities for members to raise matters. The overwhelming number of members who were surveyed on this issue did feel that they needed more opportunities to raise issues and did support the idea of additional adjournment debate time. From our survey we got back 57 responses from MPs and of those some 45 members or 79 per cent said that the present speaking opportunities to raise constituency matters were not adequate. When we asked them the next questionwhether they would support an extension of the sittings of the Main Committee for a halfhour debate of an adjournment kind-some 86 per cent or 49 of those who responded said that they would like such an opportunity, and a majority of those believed that it should be a five-minute opportunity so that it mirrored the present debate which takes place in the House of Representatives. Similarly, the majority of responses-some 63 per cent of those surveyed-said that they would support additional discussion in the Main Committee enabling opportunities for constituency statements or 90-second statements. So, with that level of support from members of parliament, I would hope that the committee's recommendations are implemented. (Time expired)",14
6,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allotted the for statements on this report has expired. Does the member for Bendigo wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a later occasion?,15
7,Mr REID,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later, and in doing so I pay tribute to the former chairman of the committee, the Hon. Kathy Sullivan, the member for Moncrieff, and members of the committee for their fine work in presenting this report to the House. Leave granted.",15

The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report",15
9,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the following reports together with the minutes of proceedings: ANZUS after 45 years: Seminar proceedings, 11-12 August 1997; Sharpening the focus: Seminar on the Simons committee report, 11 July 1997; and From empire to partnership: A seminar on the Commonwealth of Nations, 20 August 1997. Ordered that the reports be printed.",15
10,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"In opening I would like to commend the work pf the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), congratulate her on her elevation and say to her that I think the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure has been excellent. I think it is a great advantage to this House that we do have opportunities to debate issues of that sort. Secondly, tabling these three reports, to my mind, in a place like this and· at this time illustrates one of the problems that we have with the parliament. I think it is a great pitynot perhaps to us individually as parliamentarians but to Australia-that three fundamental subjects should be dealt with in a way which allows a perfunctory addressing of topics which are absolutely critical to Australia's future. It worries me that there is inadequate opportunity for debate on matters of this ilk, although they are so important. There are three reports, and I have just tabled them. The first, on ANZUS, related very much to the affairs of the Ausmin talks which the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) undertook in Washington only a few weeks ago. They did identify many of the issues, and I will speak a little on it. Sharpening the focus: Report on a seminar on the Simons committee report again is a very important subject for Australia, not just on the question of how much development assistance aid should be provided but the nature of the report, the emphasis it gave and the fact that it was the first report for so years. The third report, on the Commonwealth of Nations, which is a preliminary to the visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Edinburgh tomorrow, is equally important. It is a pity that there is not more opportunity to debate each of them. Each of these reports results from seminars held by the joint standing committee. I think the seminars are a very useful way to look at a foreign policy or defence issue. We conducted these over the winter and, while the seminars do not necessarily provide the same opportunities for detailed scrutiny as a full inquiry, the seminar process certainly enabled us to bring together a diverse range of individuals and groups to discuss the significance of each of the issues. The dialogue between all of the participants is extremely constructive, and one of the major benefits at each of the seminars was the interchange of ideas between people from quite different backgrounds and points of view. The committee has held a series of these seminars since July 1996, and I think all of us feel that not only has it been worthwhile from our point of view but I am glad to report to the House that we have had very considerable positive feedback on the format and the processes they follow. On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all of the government officials, members of the diplomatic corps, business representatives, academics, members of the NGO community, members of parliament and members of the general community who attended these seminars and contributed so much to their success. My personal thanks go also to those members of the joint standing committee who participated in and made these seminars possible and so worthwhile. I would like to make some brief comments on each of the reports, and hopefully will have a further opportunity in the Main Committee to debate each of the subjects as I believe they deserve. The first seminar dealt with a review of the Australian aid program  The seminar was held at the request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The report itself, many as members will remember, was released in early May. At that time the minister undertook that there would be a period of wide public consultation before the report was considered by government. Our seminar was one of many seminars and conferences on the subj{(ct held around the country. The committee was very pleased to have all of the members of the Simons committee present at the seminar, and indeed they all participated fully-Paul Simons, Gaye Hart and Professor Cliff Walsh-and also the Director-General of AusAID, Trevor Kanaley, and a significant number of his staff. We were also pleased that the Head of the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD, Mr James Michel, who was visiting Australia at the time, was able to join us and contribute to our discussions. The Simons review is the first major review of the development assistance program since the Jackson report of the early 1980s. It was the general feeling that reviews of this kind need to be done somewhat more regularly-a 13-year gap is too great. One of the recommendations of the Simons committee endorsed by the joint standing committee was for the establishment of an advisory board to assist AusAID management in the direction of the development assistance program. Hopefully, with such input the process of finetuning the aid program will be simplified for all involved. The seminar did not set out to cover all aspects of the Simons report. Anyone who has examined that report will know that it is an extremely comprehensive examination of the aid program. However, the seminar did look at issues such as overseas trends in development assistance; refocusing the aid program, taking into account geographic and sectoral factors; soft loans and concessional financing; the question of whether Australian aid should be untied; and the whole issue of NGOs and their role in the Australian aid program. The Simons committee report carries the title One clear objective: Poverty reduction through sustainable development. The joint committee supports the concept that a prime motivation for a development assistance program is humanitarian. But the committee is concerned that too narrow a definition of poverty might be adopted. Development assistance encompasses a range of activities designed to improve the standard of living of people in developing countries, through infrastructure projects, educational activities or assistance to micro enterprises, as well as immediate assistance to those suffering from hunger and homelessness. The committee agrees that assistance should be through sustainable development activities. The committee also acknowledges that other policy objectives may be met through the aid program, without detracting from its fundamental purpose. After all, a fundamental purpose of aid is to satisfy the taxpayers that the expenditure of those funds is to the advantage of Australia. The joint standing committee has made 15 recommendations in all regarding the Simons review and the general running of the aid program. The committee remains concerned about the obvious resource implications, both staffing and budgetary, for AusAID should all of the recommendations of the Simons review be instituted. This will obviously be a matter of great importance for the government at this time of budgetary restrictions, but will have to be addressed if Australia is to maximise the impact of its aid budget. The second report deals with the ANZUS alliance. The seminar on the ANZUS alliance, held in August 1997, assembled some of the most pre-eminent and authoritative speakers from Australia and the United States, and of course some from New Zealand, to share their views' on the current status, relevance and future prospects for this security treaty. The alliance with the United States continues to be fundamental in Australia's defence agreements. Few dispute this. The previous government's defence white paper accepted the value of the US alliance as a key element of Australia's defence policy, and this government's recently released foreign and trade white paper reaffirms the importance of this relationship. The seminar sought to inform the parliament, and the wider public, through open discussion of all the provisions and implications of those provisions of the treaty. The one great internal change in ANZUS since its inception has come about because of the adoption by New Zealand of its prohibition of ship visits by nuclear powered vessels. Discussion took place on current New Zealand defence policies, regrettably without official representation from the New Zealand government. As I mentioned, there were participants from New Zealand there. New Zealand's suspension from trilateral activities is an unresolved issue for the alliance, although this apparently is of greater concern to Australia than to the United States or New Zealand. The committee, in reporting its views of the seminar, chose to keep its remarks brief. In so doing, the words of the individual speakers have been allowed to stand by themselves. While individually noteworthy, these presentations collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the alliance and of its continuing value not just for Australia but also for the United States, and for regional nations. Following two days of discussions, the consensus emerged that there remains for Australia distinct advantage in maintaining the ANZUS relationship. The third report concerns the Commonwealth of Nations and, given the imminent Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Edinburgh, it is particularly relevant. The committee was interested in examining whether the Commonwealth remains quite as relevant in the post-apartheid era and in the post-Cold War period and, indeed, whether it is of even more relevance given the momentous changes in the international arena that have occurred over the last decade. The Commonwealth has changed in many ways since it was called the British Commonwealth, and it was quickly apparent to the committee that a number of misconceptions still exist about the organisation. The seminar covered topics such as the role of CHOGM and other meetings; public perceptions of the Commonwealth; the 'unofficial Commonwealth'-that is, the vast number of non-government organisations that exist among Commonwealth countries; the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association; trade and investment issues; and human rights and the Commonwealth. Time does not permit me to go into any depth on these issues, but I would recommend the report and the transcript of the seminar to all who have an interest in the Commonwealth and the remarkably diverse benefits that flow from it to Australia. I conclude my remarks by thanking once again all those who gave their time to particivery pate in these seminars. In particular, I would like to thank the secretariat of the joint committee, Joanne Towner and all those who were contributors to this process. The committee has found the seminar process to be a most useful means of exploring issues in a comparatively short time frame, and believes the reports contain a number of issues that merit full consideration by government. I regret that I have so little time to deal with them, but I do commend the three reports to the House.  the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), I would like to commend the three reports by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to the House. I would also like to acknowledge the role of the chairman, the right honourable member for New England, in initiating this particular form of committee activity for the joint committee. He has certainly made it his own, and I concur with his remarks. I believe it is a very useful forum for bringing disparate people together to discuss important issues relevant to the nation. I could be unkind and suggest that we are perhaps seminared out for a little while. If that is the case, I have no doubt that next year we will still be having one or two seminars, but again I commend him for introducing this format. All of the reports are important and in the brief time that is left to me I would just like to say in regard to the seminar on the Simons committee report, Sharpening the focus, that one needs to consider that this was done against the backdrop of a disastrous initiative by the new Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in abolishing DIFF and a number of other funding mechanisms for our region that caused an absolute uproar. As has· been pointed out, the Simons committee is the first review of overseas aid in 13 years since the Jackson report. When we think of overseas aid, it really is an investment in humanity. It is a small contribution that we make but if we wish to be good world corporate citizens, as I would hope all Australians would want to be, it is a small investment in humanity. I know that my party is reconsidering a couple of the important issues addressed by the Simons committee and they include the quantum, or level, that we should really set in terms of overseas aid. Like the chairman, I have difficulty with just one focus for overseas aid. I certainly believe, although I commend poverty reduction of course, that sometimes overseas aid should have a broader focus than just that. The seminar on ANZUS was very important because there is no more fundamental agreement or arrangement for our national security, and it is really interesting, as has been pointed out, that it has survived New Zealand dropping out of what was a tripartite arrangement because of its objection to ships visiting with a nuclear capability. I thought the seminar certainly benefited from lots of illustrious contributions and, indeed, even the chairman's illustrious contribution in one session, but I would also like to commend to people the contribution by the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, who gave an excellent overview of the Labor years and the future. The present government suggests that it has already, in 18 months, improved the Australian-American alliance. I have got no doubt that it has put a great emphasis on that, but it is very false to suggest that there was somehow not a preexisting, excellent relationship contributed to by a number of defence ministers. We do not do enough to publicise the importance of the ANZUS treaty and the benefits that accrue to all Australians through it. I am one of those who believe that into the future we need to be looking at new and different ways of strengthening it. If I have one particular fear it is that the treaty is more important to Australia than it is to America. I believe, without in any way denigrating the strength of the current relationship, that in defence and strategic terms we probably need to move to become just a little more self-sufficient than we currently are and perhaps not quite so dependent on the United States of America, but the US is the last remaining superpower that we want to move closer to. I do not dispute that we want to have the joint operations and interoperability, and I see all these things as beneficial. (Time expired)",15

14,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report on treaties tabled on 17 June and 26 August 1997 entitled Tenth report, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",19
15,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, before I speak to this report, may I add my congratulations to my two Queensland colleagues the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), on his elevation to the outer ministry, and the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), in far assuming parliamentary secretary duties for the important portfolio of Foreign Affairs. I also want to support what the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said in relation to the lack of time that is allocated to some of these reports. I support what he said about the three areas that he tabled reports on but also, in the light of comments that have been made to me both by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), a similar comment could be made in terms of the treaties debate. The report I have just tabled deals with two treaties which were tabled on 17 June 1997 and all but two of the treaties tabled on 26 August 1997. The latter will be the subject of later reports: the Australia-Indonesia maritime delimitation treaty, and the economic and commercial cooperation agreement with Kazakhstan. As none of the treaties dealt with in this report raised particular issues of concern to the committee, in each case we have recommended ratification as proposed. However, they do raise a more general issue for the committee and for the parliament, one to which frustratingly we seem to refer at the tabling of each report. In his statement to the House on 2 May 1996 about the reforms to the treaty making process, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) said, in part: They will also ensure that every Australian ual and interest group with a concern about treaty issues has the opportunity to make that concern known. Consultation will be the key word ... My committee agrees with the minister but takes a strong view that consultation is not simply a word but a meaningful process. In this 10th report we considered 11 treaties. In all cases, information about these treaties was provided to the states and territories through the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties process of officials. In a number of cases this was the only consultation which took place, in spite of the fact that there are well-known bodies which should have been given the opportunity to put their views forward. This is simply not good enough; either the minister's words mean what they say or they do not. Some of the more cynical individuals and non-government organisations making submissions to the committee over recent months have suggested that we are both a mouthpiece of government and a ratification rubber stamp. Let me assure the House that we are neither and that we will continue to explore the issues objectively and independently. I feel sure that ministers and the parliament would want it no other way. On 25 August 1997 my committee colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) referred to a perceived difficulty in changing the narrow view of consultation that exists in several departments and agencies. Unfortunately, that situation persists. Clearly it is in the unambiguous interest of the executive and of the parliament to enhance the process of consultation if the government's commendable and groundbreaking initiatives in treaty making are to be maintained. I hope that every effort will be made to that end. Once again, I would like to thank all of my colleagues in both houses and in all parties for their assistance with a heavy but worthwhile workload. I commend the report to the House.",19
16,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,"The chairman has mentioned that there were 11 treaties in this report; two of those treaties were tabled on 17 June and the balance on 26 individAugust. The topics were very varied and included discrimination against women, nuclear matters, trade, over-the-horizon radar, trade in endangered animals, and mutual assistance in criminal matters. So you can see that the committee dealt with wide-ranging issues in relation to treaties. The committee supports ratification in all cases. But there are a number of comments that I would like to make. For example, the chairman mentioned the consultation issues-and I would like to touch on those in a short time-and the lack of consultation in some cases. The treaty and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, CITES, was one of the more interesting groups of those tabled on 26 August. There were a number of wide-ranging amendments that Australia supported. One that attracted some media attention was a decision not to support amendments which would have downgraded and down-listed the species in three African countries. Under that convention, Australia could have lodged an objection but to do so would have made us effectively a non-party for trade in the products of that species; that is, the import of ivory and the products mainly of elephants. The minister indicated that he thought that we would have weakened our position rather than strengthened it and I think the committee agreed with that in relation to that treaty. Accordingly, Australia will retain its ban on the trade of ivory and on elephant products under this treaty. While this is unlikely to have a significant effect, tourists may seek to bring souvenirs and small items made from elephant hide into the country. I would also like to say a few words in relation to the functions of the committee. The committee, I believe, is performing a very useful function. It scrutinises all of the treaties that have been before the parliament. It is a very good committee to be a part of as a member of the House, given one's exposure to the wide-ranging matters that come before the government and before the House. The committee is, therefore, a very useful tool. This is the 10th report in the 13 months that the committee has been operating. The issue of consultation that the chairman dealt with needs to be addressed. It keeps coming up in the committee's work that consultation does not seem to be occurring. The government structured this joint house committee because of the view, under the Labor government, that there was not enough consultation on the treaty making process. I concur. It is very important that there is more consultation with state governments, industry groups and community groups that are interested in various treaties by the government departments dealing with these treaties, prior to their ratification. There is certainly a major lack of consultation and it needs to be rectified. I am sure the committee will be looking at this issue. As the chairman said-and I agree with him-the committee should not be a rubber stamp for the executive but should be acting as a house committee to make sure that those groups have access to consultation.

20,Mr NAIRN,COMMITTEES,"Eden-Monaro) (1.09 p.m.)On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's report entitled Industrial elections: The role of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in conducting industrial elections, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",21
21,Mr NAIRN,COMMITTEES,"As chairman of the committee, it is a great pleasure to table today the second report by that committee. This report is the result of an inquiry into the role of the Australian Electoral Commission in conducting industrial elections. Many people would be aware of the role the ABC plays in conducting federal elections approximately every three years, but few would realise that between those federal elections they undertake many hundreds of elections on behalf of trade unions and employer organisations. The bulk of those elections are conducted without much fuss or controversy, although there have been some notable exceptions over the years. To many people it may seem quite remarkable that my committee has been able to produce a unanimous report on such an inquiry. It is one of the unfortunate aspects of politics that the general public does not get to hear often enough of the cooperation that does occur between all political sides a lot of the time. This report is one of those occasions. I believe that the committee has put together a number of recommendations that will further improve the electoral processes in industrial elections. The inquiry attracted 39 submissions and we held six· public hearings. The report includes 18 recommendations. I would have to say that part of the reason there was agreement within the committee was that there was considerable agreement between the various organisations making submissions. The ACTU and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry were not at loggerheads on the terms of reference, for example. One of our recommendations is that the rolls should be cut off 30 to 60 days before the opening of nominations. We have made Report this recommendation primarily to allow the returning officer ample time to put together the best possible roll. Few would disagree that many rolls in years past have left a lot to be desired. The ACTU agreed that something should be done and felt that a cut-off date between one and three months was reasonable. The issue of a member's contact address created some debate. The use of workplace addresses was raised by some as a potential contributor to ballot rigging. However, in the much publicised case of the 1994 CEPU election, which was declared invalid by the courts, less than five per cent of ballot papers went to workplace addresses. There was strong evidence from the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association that residential addresses should be provided. In their evidence they said: The propensity that might give rise to for ence with the ballot is manifest . . . particularly with an organisation which has a fairly large number of part-time workers with a high rate of turnover. The committee has recommended that, in developing model rules between the AEC and an organisation, as far as practicable the membership records of an organisation shall contain residential rather than workplace addresses. I mentioned the 1994 CEPU election, on which we received some evidence. It was expected, as it was a recent example of an election invalidated by the courts. However, we were not swayed to recommend attendance ballots as a result of the obvious fraud that took place in that particular election. We are of the view that a number of our recommendations will assist in overcoming some of the illegal activities that occurred. I must comment that, during our visit to an Australia Post mail centre in Sydney, I was a little surprised just how much manual handling still occurs which could give rise to fraud by someone intent on doing that. New generation machinery is, fortunately, not too far away and will help to limit that problem. Our recommendations call for a substantial increase in penalties for illegal activities related to industrial elections. We also want to see the ABC have a greater capacity to instigate inquiries where irregularities are alleged.

25,Mr EOIN CAMERON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) acknowledges that Australia's health system is reliant on a successful private health insurance industry complementing the public health system; (2) notes with concern the neglect of the former Labor Government to stem the exodus from private health insurance between 1984 and 1996; (3) calls on the Australian Labor Party to agree to supporting incentives for private health insurance as part of its policy platform at its annual conference in 1998; (4) expresses its support for the incentives providbe ed by the Federal Government for people to maintain private health insurance and for who do not have it, to take it out; (5) calls on private health insurers to minimise any premium increases which may force more Australians to reconsider their membership; (6) welcomes any further policies which encourage people who can afford to take out private health insurance, to do so; and (7) calls on the Government to refer the issue of private health insurance and the Australian health system to the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs for further solutions to alleviate the decline in private health insurance caused by the policies of the former Labor Government. It was Graham Richardson, a former Labor minister for health, who said that if private health insurance fell below 40 per cent the health system had a big problem, because it put extra pressure on the public hospital system. Today the number of Australians covered by private health insurance is 31.9 per cent, nearly 10 points lower than the level which Mr Richardson said was the danger point. In 1983 when Labor was elected the level of private health insurance was around 63.7 per cent. This motion urges the House to acknowledge a number of points and take action to improve our health system for the benefit of the Australian people and the generations of Australians to follow. No doubt some decisions that need La be taken may not be politically expedient, but it is time for politicians and electors alike to acknowledge that decisions need to be taken in the context of what is right and necessary, and not what will win or lose the decision maker votes. There is no doubt that Australia's health system is reliant upon both successful private and public health insurance sectors. Graham Richardson acknowledged that, as I mentioned at the commencement of this debate, and it is imperative that the policies of government provide for and encourage the development and success of both private and public health insurance. If one of them falls apart, then the whole system will start· to fall apart. Therefore, I believe it is essential that there are changes made to Medicare which need to taken to provide for its long-term sustainability. Further, we need greater incentives for those private health insurance so that the industry is confident also of long-term sustainability such that both systems complement each other . to provide Australia with the best health system available. That is the basis for this motion: to get the House to acknowledge that what is needed are policies which will ensure the viability of private health, policies which will reduce the burden that is presently on Medicare and policies which provide a safety net for those who can least afford to look after their health. I have recently surveyed my constituents on a number of issues, including health. The vast majority support the concept of and want private health insurance; however, they want a greater incentive to join. They have told me they want incentives such as gap insurance, full tax deductibility or a reduced or negated Medicare levy for those who join private health insurance. When two-thirds of people drop out of private health insurance because of price and 13 per cent drop out because of the inability to get gap insurance, then these statistics should be addressed. These matters need to be taken into consideration in the context of health policy formulation and all options need to be considered by the government and the opposition. Ignoring them will see the continued exodus from private health insurance and an increased burden on Medicare. I shall state at this stage that I applaud the establishment of Medicare. It was a good policy in 1983-84. Now, however, I fear that Medicare in the form in which it was established and the purpose for which it was established has just about reached its use-by date. Unfortunately, one reason for its having reached its use-by date is that, after its establishment by the then Labor government, the health policy of the Labor Party was to sit back and do nothing. After Medicare was established we literally had from 1984 to 1997 an exodus from private health insurance which placed an ever increasing burden on the public health system. During that time, despite acknowledgments from the then government that private health insurance was important for our health system, nothing was done to stop the exodus. Nothing was done to provide for the long term sustainabiIity of Medicare. We have had their former ministers acknowledge-Brian Howe had and Graham Richardson has-that they should have done something. It is too little, too late, I am afraid. Now is the time for action and that is what this motion calls for. While Medicare perhaps catered for the health needs of our nation in the early 1980s, it is insufficient to adequately cater for our nation's health needs as we approach a new millennium. While my motion supports the private health insurance initiative of the Howard government, I am not so naive as to believe that it is enough, but a step in the right direction is better than taking no step all, or indeed even walking backwards. Today's debate is also an opportunity for members opposite to enunciate the health policy of the Democrat Labor Party, or at least the principles of a health policy and, in particular, the extent of its commitment to private health insurance. The Democrat Labor Party must today tell Australians whether it supports a health system where the public health sector is complemented with private health, or does it believe that Australia's millionaires and rich should be subsidised by Australia's battlers? I note the shadow minister will not be speaking in this particular debate, which is a shame, because I am sure Australians would like to know what Labor's health policy is and how they intend to fund it. It cannot be denied that aspects of Medicare are akin to welfare. For example, the provision of bulk-billing to all Australians is an extension of welfare to Australia's rich, even though they do not need welfare. If we only bulk-billed those who required it-pensioners, unemployed, low income earners and for the treatment of children under two-there would be more funding for public hospitals. Doctors have been vocal of late about withdrawing bulk-billing across the board. That would only hurt the battlers in the community. That is why, as with every other form of welfare, bulk-billing should be means tested. All of us here can be bulk-billed just like pensioners, but we do not need bulk-billing, whereas pensioners do. That is the farce of the system. Those who can afford to cater for their health needs are using scarce public health money, restricting those who desperately require the services. of our public health system from getting their much needed treatment. Where is the incentive for those to go into private health insurance? The incentive is to use and abuse the public system. Medicare provides free treatment to those who can afford to pay. Certain aspects of Medicare are basically health welfare and as such should be provided on the same terms as other welfare in this country, that is, the provision should be means tested. I do not believe that our health system is at sustainable without private health insurance. That is why we need policies that encourage membership of private health insurance. It was the ideological bankruptcy of the previous government which prohibited the progress of our health system. I say to the Democrat Labor Party: do not let your ideology stop your supporting something that is essential for the survival of our health system-that is, the private health insurance industry. I will quote from a speech made by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) last year. He said that the support of private health insurance 'is not an ideological end in itself; it is a simple, practical, common sense way of ensuring that state public hospitals survive'. A rejection of the necessity for private health insurance in our country will be a rejection of our battlers, who require the public system so desperately. Accordingly, I call on the House to support the incentives provided by the Howard government for people to maintain private health insurance. While it may not see people start rejoining, it will at least start to put a base on the exodus from private health insurance, which the former government deliberately and negligently ignored. Furthermore, it is essential for private health insurers to do all they can to minimise any premium increases which may force Australians to reconsider their membership. The insurers know as much as anyone their importance to the national health system, and they will increase premiums at their own peril. However, the ultimate burden is on government to maintain a health system kinds which is rock solid and fulfils the need Australians. Our health system has not done that for some time. Notwithstanding the intrinsic measures of the last two budgets to improve our health system, it seems that more needs to be done. Following the election of the Labor governthrough ment in 1983, a tax summit was held to attempt to find a consensus to improve the system. Recently the Prime Minister (Mr ment. Howard) announced that a tax reform task force would look at updating the tax system. Perhaps it is now time for something similar for our health system, with an eye to ensuring the sustainability of the system based on the public health system being complemented with a private health system. Notwithstanding the work of the Productiviwithout ty Commission, my motion also calls on the Standing Committee on Family and Commeaningless munity Affairs to hold an inquiry and make recommendations for further solutions alleviate the decline in private health insurAustralia. ance caused by the policies of the former Labor government. Committees can be biparbut tisan most of the time, and an inquiry by the committee on this issue would need to be just that. In the 1996 federal election campaign, Graham Richardson said: Unfortunately, Labor aren't recognising the big problem. It is still a huge problem ... that people scrapping, are deserting private health they are. It isn't a problem any of you will worry about tomorrow, but in 10 years time it will be huge. It is time for an honest assessment of our health system by all sides of politics so that we can properly provide the solutions to the problems. I urge the members opposite support this motion so we can start our health system before it needs palliative care. Dr Southcott-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak at a later time.",22
26,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Regrettably, the mover of this motion, the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), came forward with absolutely nothing in the the way of suggestions which would solve the of problems that he was referring to. I of and other members are happy to support any motion before the House which recognises the value of the private health insurance system in Australia. Quite clearly, Australians want choice in health insurance. Labor governments have given them that choice-first the establishment of Medibank under the Whitlam government and, a decade later, tax through Medicare under the Hawke governChoice means the capacity to realistically choose one of a number of alternatiVes. If people cannot afford private health insurance, then they do not have a real choice in private health insurance. Indeed, my recollection is that, when the Hawke government came to power, some two million Australians were health insurance of any kind at all. They were uninsured. The choice was entirely so far as they were concerned. That is one of the reasons why Medicare to enjoys very widespread public support in It is something that political conservatives in Australia are not anxious to admit, it is beyond dispute. It took them a long time in opposition to recognise it. After their 1993 election loss-their most serious election loss-opposition leaders were coming out and saying, 'We have to recognise what people want. People do want Medicare, so we are no longer going to put up a policy of dismantling and whittling away insurance at the rate Medicare.' It would seem from the rate at which people are departing the private health insurance system that Medicare's popularity continues to grow. Across the country, people, in particular young people, are deciding that fix the benefits that private health insurance to companies deliver are simply not worth the repairing premiums being charged. It is absolutely wrong for the member to pretend that the previous policies were defective and failed. Government members should not try to rewrite the history of this now that are in government. You opposed these things when you were in opposition, but after 1993 you were forced to change your policies and say, 'No, we are going to support Medicare in government. We are not going to tinker with it; we understand that it has community support.' The ongoing feature of people leaving the private health insurance system has created a substantial problem for the government and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), who, by his comments last week, is starting to feel the political heat of what were opportunistic and ill-considered promises made prior to the last election. The government committed itself to bolstering private health insurance rates by offering a rebate. It is a fact of history that the value of that rebate has vaporised in the space of just a few months. What we have seen is $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money being hosed up against the wall, disappearing in a stampede of premium rises. What is fascinating about all this is the new language of the minister health. Until last week, the government was happy for the success of its health policy to be judged by its success in stopping the decline in private health membership. The minister for health told the Sydney Morning Herald at the start of last year that, if the coalition's private health insurance policies were a flop, the voters in Chisholm would vote him out-shades of Amanda Vanstone. It is time for the minister to start packing his bags because the Herald-Sun of last Monday reports the minister conceding that the government's actions might not halt the continuing exodus of fund members. In other words, the whole basis of the coalition's health policy is now in tatters. It is said in some quarters that the Labor Party is opposed to private health insurance. This is totally incorrect. Labor is absolutely comfortable with allowing Australians to choose their level and their type of health insurance. What the Labor Party wants is more affordable private health insurance premiums, and affordability is affected by two things. First, and most obviously, it is a function of price. We have seen prices rise dramatically over the past year. I have had many approaches from constituents concerned at the premium prices. For example, at the end of last year I was approached by a distressed constituent who was having great difficulty affording a premium rise of 18 per cent. These premiums are set to increase again. I suspect that that constituent has joined the increasing ranks of former private health insurance members. Affordability is not only a function of price, it is also a function of income. This is a point that I do not think has been sufficiently understood by the government. Recently, there was an article by Ted Waters, general manager of Mercantile Mutual Life Insurance, entitled 'Aging and health care costs: who pays the piper?' I would recommend that article to all members. Over the next 50 years, health costs in this country are likely to double-mainly as a consequence of our ageing population and also as a consequence of advances in medical technology-from under nine per cent of GDP today to 17 per for cent in the year 2041. Referring to the National Commission of Audit, Ted Waters contends: Based on current projections health expenditure will rise from the current levels of 15% of the federal government budget to 30% by 2041. There is an overwhelming probability that government thinking on health care will have to change dramatically before then because I do not think any member of this House would honestly believe that the federal budget could sustain 30 per cent outlays on health for any period of time. The increase in health services expenditure is closely related to the ageing of the Australian population. Waters wrote: The weighted health service consumption rate of males are doubled for an 85 year old compared with a 70 year old and in turn the 70 year old consumes twice the health services of a 50 year old. Currently, 13.5 per cent of health fund members are aged over 65 with a projected rise to 23 per cent by the year 2010. It goes without saying that older people, as the highest consumers of health services, are the group in Australia most interested in maintaining the coverage. At the same time, many in this group on fixed incomes are the least able to afford that cover. I indicated earlier that private health ance coverage is determined in part by affordability. Older people are encouraged, through a greater incidence of ill health, take it out but discouraged to take it out because of their fixed incomes. The challenge for government is to look at ways of ensuring that retirement incomes are adequate to permit older Australians that choice of health insurtially ance. So the issues of private and superannuation policy are inextricably linked. This parliament makes decisions that affect the retirement incomes of Australians well into the next century and no discussion on the future of health insurance can proceed without, at some point, having regard to the likely retirement incomes of Australians into the next century. The country's concerns about the private health insurance system are predicated on a notion of static retirement incomes, but we really need to do is boost retirement incomes. Private health insurance has to more affordable in future. How affordable depends in part on the efforts made by government to boost superannuation. In Australia today we have direct payments by individuals accounting for 17 per cent health services, which equates to $335 man, woman and child in Australia. Waters postulates that this burden is going to rise dramatically in today's dollars in the years ahead. Where is this additional income going to come from? Unfortunately, we see here not what the government can do, but what the government has chosen not to do. Last year, in a monumental backflip, the Howard government abandoned its election promise to match Labor's superannuation co-payment. Under Labor's scheme, employee contributions to superannuation are going to three per cent 1999, a valuable addition to the nine per cent employer contribution being phased in. The government was committed to moving tonot wards a 15 per cent superannuation payment rate by the year 2002. The Liberal Party, prior to the last election, endorsed Labor's plan for a government payment but, once in office, chose to scrap it and replace it with a mickey insurmouse rebate. Under the coalition plan, an employee who contributes $1,000 per annum to their own superannuation scheme receives to a $150 rebate which they mayor may not choose to put into the scheme. This means less being put aside for employees in their retirement. What we are going to have as a consequence is retirement incomes substanlower when they need to be higher. health insurance (Time expired)",25
27,Dr SOUTHCOTT,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Boothby) (1.35 p.m.)When Medicare was first established in 1984 will it was designed to complement a strong private health system. When Labor were first elected in 1983 levels of private health cover stood at about 66 per cent. When they left office in 1996 that had fallen to 34 per cent. The actions of the previous Labor government directly led to the explosions in pre1Jliums in the mid-1980s and to the decline in private health coverage. Policy decisions, such as the what abolition of the Commonwealth bed day subsidy for private hospital beds and the be removal of the Commonwealth's contribution to the private re-insurance pool led to an the explosion of premiums between 1996 and 1998 of over 40 per cent. As well as those two actions, changing the of Medicare rebate from 85 per cent to 75 per per cent for in-patient stays and the 1993 Medicare agreements which encourage public hospitals to increase their throughput of public patients at the expense of private patients-which push the private patients into the private hospitals-all led to rising premiums. Access Economics has estimated that those four policy decisions led to an increase in premiums of 39 per cent. Without those decisions, premiums today would be $30 a month lower. In private health insurance we have seen a vicious cycle whereby, with each explosion of by premiums, the young and fit and healthy have assessed their own risk and decided to drop out, decided that private health insurance was worth it. Many of the people who are affluent have decided to self-insure. They will save a bit of money on the assumption that they will not need it. As a consequence of the young and fit and healthy dropping out of private health insurance, there have been further premium rises as the elderly and the sick who remain members call upon their private health insurance. . The government, in recognition of that, mtroduced two sides to its private health - nsura?ce policy. It has a carrot by way of mcentIves-$450 for a family, $250 for a couple, $125 for a single person-to take out or continue to hold private health insurance. It is worth pointing out that those incentives are available as not only a tax rebate but also a cheaper premium. Those people who do not pay tax just have to sign a statutory declaration saying they have private health insurance a-d they will be able to get a cheaper premIUm. . We. have also offered a stick. People on hIgh mcomes who do not take out private health insurance will have to pay an increased Medicare levy. This idea was commended by Graham Richardson in the Bulletin last year. Access Economics also estimates that the annual two per cent drop in private health insurance membership over the last 13 years has cost this nation the equivalent of 325 000 hospital bed days or the equivalent of the 'cost of running two major teaching hospitals over one year. That drop in coverage has led to pressure on the public health system. Over five million Australians will be eligible for the private health insurance incentives. As I said before, these incentives are available as a tax rebate or a decreased premiu-. In addition, they will help the approxImately 700,000 Australians who are on incomes below $20,000 who maintain their private health insurance. Most of those people are self-funded retirees or pensioners, and for them the incentives are especially important. Speaking in the Bulletin of 27 August last year, Graham Richardson said: As health minister I sponsored a number of measures to stop the drift from private health insurance which was increasing sharply at the time. I steered a package through the cabinet but resigned before I could sell it to the caucus. Practically the package died when I left as the Labor Party had always been a bit biased against private health insurance, and without a sponsor any proposal to help the industry was doomed. One idea I had which had no chance of ever being accepted by my caucus or cabinet colleagues was to charge an increased Medicare levy for highincom- earners who refused to take out private health Insurance. I was never comfortable with the thought of wealthy people elbowing battlers out of queues in public hospitals. He went on to say: Everyone was to lose some battles but I wish I had won this one. Now the Liberal Party is putting f-rward the same idea. Even the thought that the LIberals are prepared to make the rich pay more when the Labor Party would not is enough to scare the hell out of me. (Time expired) Mr F1TZGmBON (Hunter) (l.40 p.m.}-It really is extraordinary that in the House today a member of the government has submitted a motion which, amongst other things, seeks to highlight the important role private health insurance plays in the nation's health system. !he member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) IS 'part of a government which was going to remvent the wheel, as was the case with so many other public policy issues, in relation to health insurance prior to the 1996 election. This is the party which at every opportunity has attempted to dismantle the very foundation of this country's health system: Medicare. The most recent example of these attacks is the government's decision to freeze the Medicare rebate-a decision which has caused no fewer than six GPs in my electorate to withdraw their bulk-billing services. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), after his party having been bitten at the 1993 election, went to the Australian people in March 1996 promising to leave Medicare alone. The Australian people accepted his word, but they now know how foolhardy that trust was. One could be forgiven for thinking that the motion introduced by the member for Stirling represents a king hit on his own Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). He has thrown in a few criticisms of the Labor Party to hide that fact. There is a bit of camouflage there, but to identify the real intention of the motion we need only tum to whole points (5), (6) and (7). All three of these points reflect the total failure of this Howard govern-ent to address the decline in private health msurance participation in this country. Despite all the pre-election chest thumping, what have we seen from this government? We have seen the introduction of the now absolutely discredited private health insurance rebate, a scheme which is taking $1.7 billion annually out of the pocket of Australian taxpayers and placing it straight into the hands of private health insurance-$1.7 billion that could have been going into the public hospital system in this country. The people in my electorate did not rejoice about the introduction of the rebate. Some weeks after its introduction they wandered out onto their front lawns and picked up the Newcastle Herald to read headlines such as 'Nm raises premiums by 17%'. That headline and others like it were only the beginning. For months thereafter-and this is still the case today-we saw a seemingly endless array of headlines advertising additional in private health insurance. The Prime Minister had also promised to intervene. We now know that he had them shaking in their boots! Again, we need to go to points (5), (6) and (7) of this motion by the member for Stirling to understand what it is really about. These points are an absolute and obvious recognition of the failure of this government to address the decline in private health insurance participation. I, too, welcome any further policies which encourage people to privately insure themselves, as is suggested in point (5)-and who would not? I support a reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, as is suggested in item (6)-and who would not? I would encourage the committee, if that reference were given to it-and it should be-to refer to Labor's proposed family health rebate which formed part of our election policy at the 1996 election. It was a sensible scheme which was means tested to target those most in need of assistance.",27

NA Compact Discs: Importation",29
29,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Batman)The federal government's plans to allow the importation of CDs is, I believe, firmly opposed by my local community. Why? Because they know the government's CD plans will not necessarily bring cheaper CDs but will definitely hurt local jobs. And if you do not have a job you cannot buy a CD. Here we have a government which, after 20 months in office, has shown that it has no ideas about creating jobs; it only has policies to destroy jobs. We live in an era when governments need to think strategically and creatively about how we maintain and grow new jobscosts preferably full-time jobs. Shock Records, Australia's largest independent record label, has its main offices just down the road from my electorate office in High Street, Northcote. The company employs more than 100 people, most of them locally, and they represent more than 200 Australian bands and recording artists, many of whom also live in the local area. With a turnover of $30 million, of which exports represent $10 million, this is not a local company to be sneezed at by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Local unemployment in my electorate is already shocking, but the latest figures show that there are 20,500 people in my area looking for work-almost the number on offer nationally from the government's work for the dole scheme. We have a local unemployment level of 9.8 per cent. In the first 20 months of this government, the number of young people in full-time jobs has dropped by 73,000. With more than 200,000 young people looking for work, the Howard government should not be adopting strategies to destroy jobs. (Time expired) Kernot, Mrs Cheryl",29
30,Mr EOIN CAMERON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It was Kim Beazley senior who once said that the Australian Labor Party used to be the cream of the working class. Now they are the dregs of the middle class. While I have great admiration and respect for his son, whom I consider a friend, the effusiveness in which he welcomed the leader of an opposing party to his own shows the absolute hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the Australian Labor Party and Cheryl Kernot. The goal of both Ms Kernot and the Leader of the Opposition is not the pursuit of policy goals, it is the hunger for power. This naked grab for power defies their intellect, their philosophy and their scruples. One's philosophy and ideology are subjects one is passionate about; they are in the blood and they develop over a lifetime. One's philosophy does not change over a cup of plunger coffee! That the Leader of the Opposition has sold his party's soul for cheap political gain would be anathema to the politics of real Labor people like Chifley, Curtin, Tonkin and Kim Beazley senior. The Labor Party seems to me to have recently suffered a reptilian infestation. I have no doubt the Leader of the Opposition will rue the day that he invited the bottle blonde boa from Brisbane into his chookyard. Greenhouse Gases",29
31,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In light of the government's position on greenhouse emissions, I want to highlight an option which appears to have been overlooked. Australia remains in the forefront of technological advances but often experiences a situation where the lack of local investment drives good ideas overseas, which are then reimported as manufactured products. The technology associated with the Orbital Engine Corporation may well soon be lost to us. Better known as a Sarich engine, this technology includes a revolutionary fuel injecDemocrats tion system and is applicable, at the very least, to power packs in cars, motor cycles and scooters and marine engines. The recent small production run of Ford Festiva vehicles fitted with the Orbital engine shows a reduction of 30 per cent in fuel consumption and a dramatic drop in greenhouse emissions to levels much lower than the toughest emission targets in the world. It is commendable that Dasfleet now has a few of these vehicles, but the domestic and export potential to the highly polluted cities in the south-east Asian region must be enormous. With government assistance, eco-based tax rebates, direct investment or purchasing and other encouragement, we have an opportunity to introduce this kind of technology into Australia and the region and dramatically ease our greenhouse emissions. It would promote Australian technology, manufacturing and employment and keep Australia at the forefront of leading edge technology. It is an opportunity this government should not miss. Kernot, Mrs Cheryl",30
32,Dr SOUTHCOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In South Australia we just had the state election on 11 October 1996. The Australian Democrats recorded 16 per cent of the vote, which was their highest ever. Four days later, Cheryl Kernot, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, left that party to join the Labor Partya decision that she apparently had reached two weeks earlier. Normally, the decisions of federal leaders and what happens in state elections are unrelated. Why they are important here is that the Australian Democrats made ample use of Cheryl Kernot in their television advertising and in their posters. Cheryl Kernot was actually given a speaking part in their television advertising when their local leader was not. Kim Beazley also visited South Australia in the last week of the campaign. He already knew that the person the Democrats were using in their advertising was going to join the Labor Party. What Cheryl Kernot and the Leader of the Opposition need to explain is why they deceived the people of South Australia when they knew that the leader of the Australian was going to be joining the Labor Party. As Richard Alston said yesterday, if it had been a federal election she would have contravened the Commonwealth Electoral Act. She may well have contravened the state electoral act, but it is unlikely that will be prosecuted because it would only damage the Australian Democrats. Commonwealth Bank: Customer Service",30
33,Mrs CROSIO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to bring to the notice of the House the number of complaints that are escalating within my electorate over the poor service being offered by two particular branches of the Commonwealth Bank-and I refer to the Fairfield branch and the Fairfield Heights branch. There is something like a wait of around 40 to 45 minutes being experienced by the aged in my community and mothers with young children. Never, as Winston Churchill said, have so many been served by so few. In investigating their areas of concern, I was also disturbed to find that there is no area where my constituents can register a complaint with the Commonwealth Bank itself. The people behind the counters are the ones copping the abuse. They are not at fault. The facilities are there for them to be able to assist and help so many more members of the public, but they just do not have the staff, nor do they have offices where the people who are now being denied a service can lodge an official complaint. I have taken this up on their behalf and written officially. But I believe that we should, as a nation, be very concerned-when we talk about private industry and where we are going-about the cutbacks in services being experienced by the people who have to then suffer because of what is happening. I believe that when banks and banking institutions are making the profits that they are, they should be employing more staff to provide a better service to the people. If the Commonwealth Bank cannot do that, how do we expect other banks to follow? I believe also that people should not be subjected to the closure of so many branches, which is occurring within our electorates, and then have so few members of staff servicing the public at large. It is a crying shameespecially when you have someone that is desperate, after. waiting in a queue for 40 minutes, come into my office to use the toilet because there were no facilities there-that we continue to have this type of abuse. (Time expired) Ballycara Retirement Village",30
34,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to take the opportunity to congratulate the Ballycara Retirement Village for reaching the final of the shoot'n'shuffle tournament, which concluded at Indooroopilly shopping town last week. It was an excltmg time for them. Shoot'n'shuffle is played on a shuffle board of similar length to a pool table with the look of an air hockey table. The rules are loosely based on that of bowls, with competitors sliding pucks down the table hoping they stop before falling into the gutter. Points are scored depending on how closely the pucks come to the edge and the games are played over a number of ends. I had the opportunity to participate in the game with Ballycara residents a few weeks ago. The residents were caught up in the excitement of the game and the friendly rivalry and the competition really shone out. Former Rugby League and Canterbury Bankstown half-back Steve Mortimer should be congratulated on the wonderful work he is doing in promoting this game to the retirement villages and nursing homes. He really put a great deal of enthusiasm into it, and he deserves to be congratulated for that. One of the great positive benefits I see from this is that when people visit retirement villages the family gets into the game as well. It is a wonderful thing that they can participate in and they look forward to the visits. I understand that Ballycara Retirement Village was one of the first to purchase a table for its residents in Queensland. I congratulate them on taking that decision and for having that foresight. Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre",31
35,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I am pleased to be able to comment briefly on matters of importance in the Greenway electorate over the past two weeks. The Migrant Resource Centre office in Blacktown has been moved to better and more spacious offices due to the ever increasing demands of its clients. I am very pleased with the new office and I know that all members of the management committee and their supporters warmly welcomed the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Phillip Ruddock, when he attended these premises and officially opened them. I note that he also took time to launch a first report, which he described as 'the first wave', on a major migrant survey which we all hope will enable us to make well-informed judgments about migration issues. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre, and in particular the centre's coordinator Maria Votano, for the wonderful work they are performing for the migrant community in the Greenway electorate. In Greenway there are over 120 different ethnic groups and over 25 per cent of the population was born overseas. Australia is built on the shoulders of people from every country. A majority of us have only been here for one or two generations. As members of parliament we possibly see more of the contribution that ethnic Australians are making to the Australian way of life than would many other Australians. We see the deep desire of these groups to fit into the Australian community. I am extremely proud to support these desires. I am a strong supporter of my local migrant resource centre to ensure that this really happens. Serrano, Mr Andres Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay)-I have to comment on the social implications of the failure of the courts to support the Catholic Church in removing a highly publicised photo by Andres Serrano called Piss Christ from an exhibition in the National Gallery of Victoria. In the end, teenagers took the law into their own hands to make a social statement that has been bubbling below the surface of mainstream Australia for a long time. We are tired of the beliefs of the biggest religion in Australia being lampooned. If that photo had been of refuse over a statue of Buddha or some other waste product over a Hindu god or the Dalai Lama or if art had blasphemed the prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, can you imagine the furore? I can see it nowmainstream Australia falling over their guilty white consciences to stop the gallery, Mr Serrano and the media from exercising their 'freedom of expression' when it is so offensive to our international good neighbours and minority groups in Australia and has such a high profile in the community. Lampooning Christ diminishes Christianity in the eyes of our young, who move away from Christianity as a social construct and it is not replaced by any other religion. When you examine the high suicide rate in Australia amongst our young, look at the role of religion in those statistics. When the chips are down and there is no-one else to tum to, I turn to Christ. By lampooning Christ, we are taking away a major social support structure for our young who, in the end, have no religion to get them through those turbulent years of growth and despair when they are looking for a meaning in their lives. Industrial Relations",31
36,Mr FITZGIBBON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Congratulations and thank you to Channel Nine's Sunday program team for their graphic depiction yesterday of the new face of industrial relations in this country. Producer Nick Farrow, reporter Paul Ransley and their team helped to highlight for all Australians how far this government and their multinational mates are prepared to go to break the back of the trade union movement in this country. The tactics of intimidation being employed by Arco at its central Queensland mine and by Rio Tinto at its Hunter Valley No.1 mine have no place in Australian society. These are companies being aided and abetted by this Howard government. When asked to comment on the Gordonstone situation yesterday the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) said he 'could not comment on a matter he knew nothing about' . Who believes that? He should come in here today and make an explanation as to his involvement in the Gordonstone matter and explain to us whether it is also Arco that has a hotline to his desk in addition to that hotline that already exists for Rio Tinto and those promUlgating those offences against miners at the Hunter Valley No.1 mine. Universal Power Track Pty Ltd",32
37,Mr LLOYD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise this afternoon to add my congratulations to yet another innovative Australian company situated in my electorate. Universal Power Track Pty Ltd were the winners of the Small Business of the Year Award, awarded by the Yellow Pages. From a field of 640 national entrants and six finalists they won that award. The Erina based company has been operating for only two years and now has two national accolades to its credit-the Yellow Pages Small Business of the Year Award and the best new product awarded at the Interbuild Exhibition for Architectural Products in June 1997. Currently Universal Power Track employs six staff, with an anticipated employment growth of more than 300 per cent over the next two years. They are typical of the small businesses in my electorate on the Central Coast of New South Wales, small businesses that are getting on with the job. They are employing people. The unemployment rate in Robertson has fallen over the last 12 months from 9.1 per cent to 6.8 per cent under this coalition government. They are doing the job. Small business is back in business. Consumer confidence is rising and the Central Coast of New South Wales is starting to expand again. The future for young people on the Central Coast of New South Wales has never looked brighter. Youth unemployment is falling and small business is now looking forward with optimism under this coalition government. I am proud to be part of what is happening with small business on the Central Coast of New South Wales.",32

I also inform the House that I will be absent from question time from tomorrow until my scheduled return to Australia on 30 October. I will be departing tomorrow for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland, followed by a one-day visit to President Suharto in Jakarta on the way home.

41,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, have you told the Prime Minister that to pay the equivalent of a $100,000 up-front entry fee, older Australians would have to get $450 a week in rent for their homes? Is the minister aware that houses in Wollstonecraft may well rent for $450 a week, but what about those in Launceston? When is the government going to back down on these nursing home entry and daily fee arrangements?",33
42,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a question that was not unexpected from the opposition, but it continues to confuse the issues for older Australians. Ms Macklin-Answer the question.",33
43,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to the issues that you have raised. What you are trying to do is scare elderly Australians unnecessarily. This question is driven by a political agenda. It is not driven by any consideration of what is required in the national interest-that is, as I have explained over the last several days, the tidal wave of the aged and the changing demographics in this country. I refer to the issue that you raised. Given the time, in due course I am sure I will have the opportunity to explain in much more detail how the policy will work. You know how it worked; you have been an adviser in this area for a considerable period of time. You know the need for the changes in this policy. Many examples have been provided. I advise all members that I am not going to canvass individual cases where I do not have the detailed facts on every particular matter. The basis of how this policy works has been sent to all honourable members over a long period of time.",33
44,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You should tell us. Don't worry about notes!,33
45,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Banks!,34
46,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There are examples provided. Why should I provide you with an answer to a question about Launceston that you ask hypothetically? This debate is about your incapacity to deal with the fundamental problem of the lack of capital. I have here the graph that tells the story.,34
47,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That's your popularity rating!,34
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Banks.,34
49,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This graph shows that there has been a 75 per cent reduction through the period that you, Mr Keating and Mr Hawke were involved in running this policy. The member for Brand was the finance minister involved in deciding the capital provided to nursing homes. That is the issue that has to be addressed. Where did the money go? It did not go to aged care people in Australia. You took it out. We have put down a policy, the full detail of which you know. To play little games and run around this nation and scare people, as you have done over the last week, is an abysmal performance on your behalf. You keep asking me questions and you will get the same answer. It is your fault that we have the problems we have in this country. It was Labor who neglected it. Ms Macklin-I will give you the answer. Do you want the answer?",34
50,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, tell us about the 1994 Gregory report. What did that show? You tell me. Let me ask you a question: why didn't you do anything about it? Why did you sit there? You were an adviser to the government of the day. You were an adviser to Mr Howe, the minister. What happened? You did not do anything. It was not until this government came to power that the seriousness of this issue was finally faced. It is the dramatic drop in the capital that you provided to the nursing home and hostel sector that has led to the crisis in this country. It does not behove you well to now run around this country and make the comments that you have. Nursing Homes",34
51,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Can the minister advise the House of the physical condition of nursing homes across Australia? What has led to the poor condition of many nursing homes and what is the government doing to address this problem?,34
52,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. It gives me the opportunity to add some more things to what I have just said. I just showed you the fundamental graph. I might take this opportunity to table it so you can have a look at your own figures and you can go away and come up with some answers. The member for North Sydney asked a reasonable and very sensible question. Let me make the point that the aged care legislation that tries to address this fundamental problem has passed the parliament with the support of the Democrats. Your newfound ally-she supported this legislation. What did the Democrats say? Let me quote Hansard. They said: And I must point out that there is general agreement throughout much of the aged care sector that the lack of capital care funding, in particular, for nursing homes, estimated to be approximately $800 million, identified by Professor Gregory constitutes nothing less than a crisis which must be urgently addressed. That is the Democrats. Why don't they go and ask Cheryl Kernot? Gareth, why don't you? You seem to be on good terms with her. This bill was passed to deal with a crisis. John Ireland of Aged Care Australia, only last week, on 15 October, said: Aged Care Australia supports and has always supported the general thrust of the reforms. If we are to meet the growing numbers and the increasing expectations at this point in time. I see no other option. There are other options in the longer term but we have a crisis in effect now. We do have a crisis. The former Minister for Finance knows that we have a crisis. The member for North Sydney knows we have a crisis. Until we can deal with these issues effectively, that crisis will get worse because of the tidal wave of change in the age demographic. Here are a couple of key points: 13 per cent of nursing homes have fire hazard problems; 11 per cent failed to meet health standards; 75 per cent failed to meet Australian design standards. That is why there has been a wholesale change in the approach to aged care in this country. That is why the former minister set up a committee-this is probably not well known-with all segments of the industry represented. Together they had a major impact on the development of this act. Furthermore, it passed through this place and it passed through the Senate, to the benefit of elderly Australians. What is important here is to recognise that, if we want to deal with the tidal wave of the change of demographic in this country, we have to have an upgrade in facilities. And this cannot be done by doing what you did: neglecting the issue. You cannot neglect this issue. You cannot neglect elderly Australians and hope just to run around as you have in the last couple of days and try to scare them. They deserve far better than that. This is why the aged care sector themselves recognise the problem. They recognise the crisis that is there and they know that we are the only ones that have the capacity to do something about it. And we will do it fairly. Mr Kerr interjecting",34
53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Denison!,35
54,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My colleagues know that we will do it fairly. I will listen. I will listen to what the aged care people will say to me. I will listen to what you will say if you will concentrate on the major issues, the national imperative to deal with these matters in a sensitive way. But there is nothing gained in the national interest, there is nothing gained for elderly Australians, by scaring them and misrepresenting this policy. It is a shame on you to walk away from your own advice, particularly for a shadow minister who has worked so extensively in this sector. You know the detail of the problems. I think that you do yourself no service whatsoever in misrepresenting what is being done here when it has had the full support of all in the Senate. The Senate has passed this. Finally, I say to my colleague the member for North Sydney: the people in your electorate and indeed in my electorate, and in any electorate in the rest of the country, know that if we do not deal with this issue the longer term needs of the aged in this country will sink below what they are now. Mr Kerr interjecting",35
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Denison.,35
56,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is simply not acceptable to any government that has the first priority to make sure that aged Australians are catered for-not just today but into the future. Nursing Homes,35
57,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, if you believe we should not neglect the elderly, if you believe-this is the first time. I have heard the expression-'There is a tidal wave of elderly descending upon us,' if you believe that the nursing homes are in the state of collapse that you so describe them to be, and if you believe that the funding has come down to unacceptably low levels, why did your government cut $500 million out of aged care in the last two budgets?",35
58,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, how ironic that we get a question from a former Minister for Finance. There is $3.7 billion being spent on aged care now. That is an increase. The changes in the budget context were nothing much to do with capital replacement. You know as well as I do that the means test application you looked at, I am sure, as Minister for Finance but did not take any action on-you squibbed it. Kim, is it any wonder that she wants to come over to your side? She can see the vacuum, the lack of leadership and lack of guts.",35
59,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I know we have a frantic fellow on our hands but he ought to use the proper forms of the House.",35
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the Opposition. The Minister is aware of the conventions of the House. Ms Macklin-It is $500 million you have cut.,35
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Jagajaga! I know you have an interest in this. Don't jeopardise it.,36
62,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I apologise to the member for-what is your seat? If that is the only thing that I have to apologise for, then I feel quite comfortable with putting forward the policies of this government. As I said to you just a moment ago, you fundamentally misunderstand what is being undertaken here. The outlays for aged care will continue to increase-that is the whole point. Unless we do something about seeking a fair contribution in a fair and decent way-the capital that you took out you failed to put back, according to that graph that I just showed you-those issues will never be addressed. And short, cheap questions like the one you have just asked do you no credit either, particularly when you were the finance minister with Mr Keating and Mr Hawke and you did nothing. You sat on your hands. No wonder Cheryl Kernot wants your job. Greenhouse Gases",36
63,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline the cost to Australian jobs and economic growth from basing Australia's greenhouse policy on noisy protest groups?,36
64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The policies adopted by my government in relation to the greenho-se gas issue are designed to promote one thmg and one thing alone, and that is the national interest of our country. I want to make it very clear that, no matter what noisy groups such as Greenpeace may do, no matter what demonstrations they may engage in, no matter what devices they may use, legal or illegal, to get their point of view across, that kind of noisy behaviour will have absolutely no impact at all on the direction of government policy. Let me outline again to the House the critical importance to Australia of the stance that my government is taking in relation to this issue. I repeat that there is a potential to up to 90,000 jobs in regional areas of Australia, that if the proposals of the European Union, which are absolutely unreasonable and are absolutely selfish and are absolutely indifferent to the interests of Australia, are adopted then there will be significant damage done to vast areas of regional Australia. What is interesting on this issue is the virtual silence, the deafening silence, of the Australian Labor Party on the issue of the national interest. Once again, when you have a choice between identifying with the mainstream Australian commitment to the national interest and siding with minority groups, the Australian Labor Party has chosen the latter. I would say to the critics of my government's policy both domestically and internationally that Australia has been in the past, is now and will be in the future willing to play her fair share in participating in achievable, realisable outcomes in relation to greenhouse gases. But one thing that Australia will not do under the leadership of this government is to accept an unfair share of the burden. That is what we are being asked to do, particularly by the Europeans, and that is what I am against, and that is what the vast majority of the mainstream of the Australian community is against. What the Australian community is against is any government selling out to the noise of a protesting minority. It is against any government surrendering to anything other than the national interest, and I can assure all members of the House that the policy that we will pursue in this area will c:mtinue to be exclusively dedicated to the national interest of Australia and not to the national interest of any other part of the world. Nursing Homes",36
65,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that if pensioners earn $450 a week in rent, the equivalent of paying $100,000 as a nursing home entry fee, they will, first, lose all of their pension; secondly, be forced to 'pay tax, which they do not pay now; and, thIrdly, be required to pay the government's extra n-rs­ ing home fee, a new 25 per cent tax?

81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is addressing the question and using examples to underscore the points that he is making.,38
82,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"--The likeness gets even more profound as you move into the second paragraph of what the member for Gellibrand had to say: A range of protections are in place to ensure that all residents retain a set amount of their assets level of disposable income. These measures are intended to ensure that individuals are protected from any form of financial exploitation. The abolition of the subsidy to those not financially disadvantaged will enable Commonwealth funds to be t-rgeted to financially disadvantaged persons needmg hostel care and on those needing a higher level of personal care. The simple truth is that our nursing homes policy was almost a direct steal of their hostels policy. The only difference between the circumstances is that in 1989 when their policy was introduced the then opposition not run a deliberate campaign of fear and loathing amongst the elderly of Australia. spokesperson at that particular time did not go to every nursing home telling lies about the policy. of the then government. Our spokestariffs man dId not go around the rest of Australia dishonestly representing what we were to do. Having introduced an accommodation bond and having introduced higher fees for residents of hostels, the Labor Party then proceeded over a four-year period to systematidone, cally and cold-bloodedly cut by 75 per cent the money going into nursing homes in Australia. That is why, when we came to revisit office, we faced what the minister quite correctly described as a crisis. Instead - unning away from the problem, we have t-c-d up to the need of imposing a policy simIlar to yours for hostels, which is designed t? get capital back into nursing homes, signed to address the fact that around 40 per cent of residents in nursing homes in Australdifficulty is share wards of four or more people and that 11 per cent of facilities do not meet standards-that is after 13 years of your administration-and 15 per cent do not meet health standards. If we had followed your neglectful cold-blooded policy that situation would be deteriorating. We have faced up to the problem honestly and openly. All you can do is run a cheap, dishonest fear campaign, and I predict now it will fail hopelessly. Citrus Industry",38
83,Mr HICKS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Enerand gy. Given the intense pressure on the Australian citrus industry, largely resulting from Brazilian frozen orange juice concentrate, will the m-nister outline what actions are being taken m support of the industry to ensure its survival?",38
84,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge that many of his constituents are facing real difficulties in this area. The government is well aware of competitive pressures affecting the profitability of growers supplying in particular the processing sector of the citrus did· industry. We are committed to working closely with the industry to secure its longOur term viability and the future of the people who work in it. It is the case that a lot of the debate centres on tariffs. I make the point that have fallen from 35 per cent in 1988 to five per cent in 1996 under the schedule put going in place by the previous government. I do note with some interest that in a recent - edia .release the spokesman for primary mdustrIes on the other side mentioned that there were several things that ought to be such as the strengthening of anti-dumping measures-I notice that they had 13 years to do that and now they want to go back and it; legislation and funding for stronger product labelling and a resourced Australianof made campaign-they had 13 years for that; and a review of taxation policy, but they are against taxation reform. It is significant that they do not propose the re-introduction of detariffs or protection for this industry. The key for an industry which is in real and where people are facing adjustment pressures is export. Export growth is the fire key because returns to growers can be 30 times more from exports than from fruit sent to domestic fruit processors. In 1996-97 exports made up just one-fifth or 20 per cent of total production but they earned the same income as the remaining 80 per cent of the domestic crop. The industry is now earning, as the member for Wakefield well knows, five times more from exports than it was in 1990. Another concern that is frequently heard is that imports are flooding into Australia. I think it is worth making the point that imports actually fell by 25 per cent in 1996-97 compared with last year and that the imports that are coming in are very much at the lower price end of the market. Many in the industry are responding by changing tree variety or production mix on farm and that is helping them capture export earnings. Some are moving into alternative crops-for example, grapes. I want to say too that the government is backing industry by enhancing market access for our fruit overseas, particularly into Asia and also into high-value American citrus markets. Exports are now earning $156 million a year, which is treble the value of imports at $47 million a year, and export income is growing at 25 per cent a year. It interesting to see that those particularly into Asia-in Hong Kong they· This have gone from 11 million a couple ago to 30 million now; Malaysia: 23 million per annum; Singapore: 22 million; Japan has doubled in two years to 21 million; Indonesia is up from 15 million to 18 million; Thailand and the Philippines are all opening have significant marketing opportunities. The government is providing under such things as the rural partnership program and the new kick-start Sunraysia agreement recently signed by federal and Victorian governments, which will see the Sunraysia community benefit by $10 million in assistance. We are also supporting developreduction ment of similar arrangements for Riverland and the MIA. This is in addition to the $8.4 million citrus market diversification program introduced in 1994 and carried forward by us. We are providing a range of assistanceby dollar-for-dollar assistance-for research and development: the tri-state fruit fly strategy, initiatives through supermarket to Asia the appointment of technical AQIS offices to key Asian posts. I know that this is a vexed and difficult issue for citrus growers in many parts of the country but we are committed to working with them. There are benefits from the rules based approach to trade that has been adopted for agriculture. The beef and dairy industries have recently been very forcefully making this very point to me: they want Australia to stay with the rules based system because we are winning out of it. But this is not a government that walks away from those who face adjustment pressures. We will continue to work with that very important industry, including the constituents of the honourable member who asked the question, to do what we can to secure their future. Nursing Homes",38

87,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I said in answer to your previous question still stands: if we are going to deal with the 75 per cent in the capital that has been provided to nursing homes in a long-term sustainable policy and seek people to make a fair contribution to that capital requirement then the policy that we have enunciated, as supported the Democrats, is a national necessity. The reductions in the budget, as I previously told you, in the vast majority related to changes in and the means test, which I am sure you as finance minister also looked at. So the basis to your question is again inappropriate. Corporate Law Reform",39
88,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Treasurer advise the House of recent initiatives in corporate law reform? Will these initiatives assist company directors in making innovative decisions which will help create jobs, promote sustainable economic activity and provide investor protection?",40
89,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. The government has just released the third in a series of papers under the corporate law economic reform program. The corporate law economic reform program is a program which this government has instituted to ensure that corporate requirements, whilst protecting shareholders, are state of the art and facilitate Australian business and employment and investment opportunities. Already the government has released papers in relation to accounting standards, fundraising and, today, directors' duties. They will be followed by papers on electronic commerce and the securities and futures market. The proposals which we released today for public discussion have been drawn in consultation with the government's business regulation advisory group. They are proposals which will enhance the opportunity for shareholders to be protected in relation to their company's activities and they will give directors of corporations the opportunity to have a safe harbour under a business judgment rule. This provides the opportunity for shareholders to increase their control over corporations whilst directors behaving with all due care and due diligence will still be protected in of their decision making duties. These proposals also have the opportunity to clarify the rights and obligations of directors and other company officers and to encourage continuous monitoring of stock exchanges by the Australian Stock Exchange, and relevant industry and professional bodies to promote best practice in corporation regulation in Australia. The corporate law economic reform program is a new program for Australia. It is a program which is designed to harness both the economic objectives of this governmentinvestment, growth and job creation-and the legal responsibility of those who manage our corporations to protect shareholders and evenhandedly provide duties for directors in a way where they can work harmoniously towards those great economic objectives. The proposal is out for public discussion and feedback. Those proposals which enjoy general support will form part of this government's rewrite and amendment of corporate law and responsibilities in this country. This is an exciting program. This is big structural change in relation to the way corporate Australia behaves and is expected to behave, and takes its place as part of the economic objectives of this government. It is an economic reform program going into the area of corporate law, making it possible to get our law and our economics harmonised and right. I commend this discussion paper to the directors, officers and shareholders in Australia. Nursing Homes",40
90,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and it follows the previous questions about the $500 million cut to aged care that will, 'essentially replace the existing ad hoc capital grants program'. Is the Prime Minister aware that, as a result that, elderly people who have helped their children with deposits on their homes in the last five years will be deemed to still have that money and their daily nursing home fees will be higher as a result? Prime Minister, is this not just another example of you introducing retrospective changes which punish Australian families? When will you back down on your nursing home regime, which is hurting thouthe exercise sands of elderly Australians?",40
91,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the question is no. The answer to the second part of the question is that this is a fair and necessary policy. It is based upon a fair test, and I think the Leader of the Opposition has to explain to the Australian public two things: firstly, he has got to explain how, as finance minister, he allowed a 75 per cent run down in the capital contribution to nursing homes. The second question he has got to explain to the Australian people is, in the name of consistency, how can he attack us for doing in nursing homes what he so vigorously did in relation to hostels? Work for the Dole Scheme",40
92,Mrs BAILEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, I refer to your historic announcement of Australia's first work for the dole projects. What has been the response to the concept of mutual obligation, what are the benefits to young people and communities of participating in these projects and how can young unemployed people in my electorate of MCEwen get involved in work for the dole?",41
93,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for MCEwen for her question and I thank her also for her very valuable contribution in the development of work for the dole. The government believes in providing long-term unemployed young people with effective assistance. It is also committed to the princisponsors ple of mutual obligation. A lot of people in this community are working very hard to provide support for unemployed people to assist them in gaining worthwhile work experience. Families are giving up money to do that and this government believes that the principle of mutual obligation is a very important principle which should underlie programs in this area. The Australian community believes in the principle of mutual obligation. The group in this country not believe in mutual obligation is the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Democrats also do not believe in the principle of mutual obligation and, indeed, Cheryl Kernot does not believe in the principle of mutual obligation. That just goes to show how out of touch the Labor Party is with the views of the vast majority of the Australian community.",41
94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order, and it goes to relevance. This is off the question and he knows full well that our policies were mutual obligation policies picked up by Tony Blair.",41
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,41
96,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are very sensitive as the Labor Party has moved up into the chardonnay circles and left its traditional supporters a long way behind. It is those traditional supporters of yours who support the principle of mutual obligation, and you ought to try to represent them, instead of representing the increasingly narrow circles that the Australian Labor Party now represents. These projects of work for the dole are spread right across regional Australia and metropolitan Australia. The government received an overwhelming response of 630 applications for work for the dole projects. I have announced 178 successful sponsors, particularly in areas of high youth unemployment in regional Australia. One of the very interesting features of the support that the government has got for work for the dole has been the strong support from many of the country's peak welfare and charitable organisations, who have declared their willingness to support young people. The successful include Mission Employment Australia, the Salvation Army, the Sydney City Mission, the ACT Cancer Society, the Council on the Ageing, Open Family Australia, the Queensland Baptist Community Service, Centacare Catholic family services-and, indeed, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Perth-and Anglicare. All these agencies have come forward to support the government's work for the dole projects because they believe that they will offer worthwhile support that does to young employed people. Young people wishing to partake in work for the dole projects should telephone Centrelink on 132 850. We very confidently expect, because of the great support we have had from young people, that there will be many, many thousands of volunteers coming forward to be part of th-se projects. What way work for the dole will do is to bring many young long-term unemployed people-still suffering from the legacy of the Labor Party's mismanagement in government-back into their communities to do something worthwhile. It will rebuild their self-esteem and self-confidence and give communities an opportunity to show that they support the young unemployed people in their midst. Taxation: Political Donations",41
97,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Treasurer familiar with recommendation 62 in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 1996 federal election? If so, does he agree that an inequity exists and 'that section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act be amended to provide that donations to an independent candidate at a Federal or State election are tax deductible, at the same level as donations to registered parties'? Mr Leo MCLeay-This is self-interest.",42
98,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And I declare an interest.,42
99,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is funny that the honourable member for Curtin should ask me about recommendation 62, because I am actually more familiar with recommendations 61 and 63. If I may say so, I thought recommendation 59 was even more interesting, when I read it just before bed the other night. Mr Speaker, I do have some familiarity with section 78. Where I come from section 78 is burned into the mind of every Treasurer. No Treasurer goes to sleep without thinking of the problems of section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Mr Bevis-What does your wife say about it?",42
100,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What does my wife say about it? I declare an interest, Mr Speaker. None of your business! But the honourable Independent member for Curtin does actually raise an interesting point and that is that there is tax deductibility in relation to political parties, but not in relation to Independents. I think the reason for that, as I judge public opinion represented by the two sides of this chamber, is that there seems to be more support for tax deductibility for political parties than Independents.",42
101,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about South Australia?,42
102,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I thought there was. Of course, the tax act was framed in the way it was before Independents were as prevalent in this House as they now are. Mr Speaker, the Independent member does have a conceptual point. I suppose you could say at a conceptual level that there should be an equivalence of treatment. I undertake on his behalf to check with my colleagues whether there is a widespread view in favour of that before announcing any particular position· in relation to it. Forest Industries",42
103,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I ask the minister: would he outline the government's approach to the timber plantation growing and processing industry and, furthermore, what is the potential benefit to employment, the environment and to export income from this government's balanced and constructive policies for the forestry industry?",42
104,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, the policy we are putting forward is an integrated and workable one which sees all sectors in the industry pulling together, in contrast to what we have seen in the past, and it is one which will have a very significant effect on rural and regional areas. On 2 October I launched 'Plantations for Australia; the 2020 vision' and it is a framework setting out what needs to be done to achieve an internationally competitive plantation growing and processing industry which is commercially focused, market driven and market orientated. Very importantly the target is to treble the effective area of the plantation estate in this country from 1 million hectares to 3 million hectares between 1996 and the year 2020, just 23 years away. The plantation rate when we came to power was about 20,000 hectares a year at a time when New Zealand-not a very big country by contrast with Australia-was managing about 100,000 hectares a year. We need to achieve an average annual planting rate of 80,000 hectares per year to achieve the target. Certainly in terms of what has been achieved in this country before, that is ambitious but it is achievable. The key to it is an appropriate vision and a partnership between the Commonwealth government, the state and territory governments and the plantation growing and processing sector, in other words the private sector. That is something the previous regime was utterly and totally unable to achieve. It seem to have been largely forgotten in the last 18 months of peace in the forest industries as we have taken them forward, but they had total gridlock up there. It was the commonwealth versus the states and territories, with industry meanwhile dispirited and walking away from the process to the great cost of the national economy, in particular to the economies and jobs of rural areas in Australia at the same time as we developed something like a $2 billion annual deficit in timber and paper products. Mr Speaker, the achievement of the 2020 vision will have many benefits indeed. Firstly, investment of somewhere in the order of $3 billion is expected in this process. It will be mainly private sector of course, but it is always been the private sector that has done the best job of these things. Secondly, it will revitalise rural economies. Farm, forestry industry and high rainfall zones could contribute over $650 million a year to farm incomes in this country. There will be a significant increase in jobs in rural areas-which are very much needed-in plantation, forestry and logging from an expansion in domestic processing of wood and from jobs in transport and other downstream industries. Also there will be major environmental benefits. Achieving this vision will make a real difference in terms of the net greenhouse gas emissions in this country and the sequestration rates will increase from some 4.7 megatons annually to well over 15 megatons a year which would be a very valuable contribution indeed. Governments, of course, can play their part by making sure that the policy settings really support plantations, for example, by removing regulatory impediments for plantation developments. At the commonwealth level in just 18 months we have succeeded in lifting controls on the export of unprocessed plantation wood-a significant impediment to investment in plantations. So far they have gone in Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, and they will shortly I am sure go in the remaining states as we deliver on what you were never able to deliver-a coherent, forward looking, visionary policy for plantations and forestry in this cauntry to the benefit of everyone, but particularly rural and regional Australia. Nursing Homes",42
105,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Is the Minister aware of reports that under the government's new nursing home changes some nursing homes are proposing to take the full value of an elderly person's home less $22,500. Are you aware that, if a pensioner living in Sydney with a home worth $400,000 seeks entry to a nursing home, under your new arrangements a nursing home proprietor could invest that $400,000 for their own financial gain at the expense of the elderly home owner? What is fair about a scam like that? When will you abandon your nursing home changes?",43
106,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a factual error in your question which is quite important to correct. That is, the fee area is not $22,000; it is $22,500. Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I said $22,500.",43
107,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I apologise. I thought you said $22,000. Ms Macklin-I said $22,500.",43
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has picked up the point.,43
109,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think it is important to make sure we get the facts. It only goes to illustrate the point that I was making at the opening of question time: if you were to stick to the facts, then the people in this country, particularly the elderly, would not be going through the absolute scare that you have created. The point of your question is whether I have heard reports relating to some scam to which you refer. No, I have not heard such reports. I am quite happy to receive information from you about this or any other matter. Let me make the point to you that the average level of bond received by the agency to date is about $22,000, with a range from about $12,000 to $70,000. I have already said-at the beginning, soon after my appointmentthat I would monitor these processes carefully throughout the implementation phase. I take the opportunity to indicate to you that, in the course of the debate on the legislation, we made undertakings that we would cover closely the implementation process. I will be announcing later in the day that, in respect of the resident classification scale, which is fundamental to the relevant needs of residents to make sure that they get the proper amount of funding to which they are entitled, a review will be undertaken by Dr Sandy Cuthbertson, who incidentally has had extensive experience and who undertook a review of the Australian government health services and the hearing services in 1996. As I said earlier, we will monitor these processes. If there are demonstrated moves by unscrupulous people within the nursing home and hostel sector to take from elderly people bonds that are well over the mark, in contradiction to the policy intent, then we will act. As you know, the act provides substantial capacity for the minister to act in that regard. Economy: Asian Financial Issues",43
110,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In light of the recent rhetoric by the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr Mahathir, and the weekend resignation of the Thai finance minister, following that government's scrapping of the fuel tax, induced largely in response to the IMF, I ask the Treasurer whether he will advise the House how countries in South East Asia have responded to recent financial instability, in those two countries and elsewhere, and what steps have been taken against this general background to protect the economy of Australia and our region?",44
111,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members of the House will be aware that recently the Indonesian government made an announcement that it would seek technical assistance and financial support from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to assist in managing its current economic situation. The Australian government welcomes the decision of the Indonesian government to do so. An IMF mission is currently in Indonesia assessing economic developments and undertaking negotiations with authorities on that program. Given the state of reserves in Indonesia, and given the proposed fund program, it is not expected that Australia will be asked for bilateral support. The Managing Director of the IMF, Mr Camdessus, has stated that Indonesia's economic fundamentals are generally sound and its international reserve position is quite strong. There are, however, a number of structural issues to be addressed as part of looking at the Indonesian financial sector. We are confident that, with the IMF's assistance, those matters can be effectively managed. As members of this House will also know, Australia is a contributor, as a member of the International Monetary Fund and on a bilateral basis, to a package which has been put forward in relation to Thailand. The Thai government announced an economic reform package on 14 October in response to the IMP-sponsored package. The government has committed itself to total spending cuts of 159 billion baht, or $US4.5 billion, over 1997-98. There have been reports recently that the Thai government has decided not to proceed with an increase in oil excise, announced as part of the package. We are concerned that the Thai authorities comply fully with the IMF package. The IMF package provides the basis for the support to which the countries involved have contributed. We are monitoring developments closely in Thailand, and we urge the Thai authorities to continue to cooperate with the IMF. Australia's contribution is firmly linked to the IMF program, and disbursements are conditional upon the Thai authorities meeting the IMF conditions. We expect that the IMP will consult with the Thai authorities on any changes in the announced policy program. Risks to Australia in swap arrangements are minimal given the strong IMF link and the fact that interest and exchange rates on the swap have been agreed in advance. As the government has said repeatedly: we believe that the IMF packages in Thailand and Indonesia have the capacity to improve economic developments in those countries. That is, by attending to fundamental changes, particularly in relation to the financial sectors in those countries, those countries will get long-term benefits and long-term gains, notwithstanding short-term downturns in growth and the instability which have resulted from currency and stock market movements. Australia, as a member of the IMP and as an important regional player, has an interest in seeing the economies of the South East Asian region strengthened and has an interest in seeing those countries engage in the kind of economic reform which has now been recommended to them. We welcome the developments and the cooperation which has occurred to date, and we encourage those countries to continue their cooperation with the IMP. Nursing Homes",44
112,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. I refer minister to his statement on ABC Radio last week that it is 'a myth that you have to sell your home to get a bed in a nursing home'. Minister, will you give an unequivocal guarantee that no elderly Australians will have to sell their homes to get into a nursing home?",45
113,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Of course not!,45
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,45
115,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Australians sell their homes all the time!,45
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for O'Connor.,45
117,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is an opportunistic line that you have run. Mr Lee-It is a myth?,45
118,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a myth. There is a choice for the elderly person whether they sell. What you have not been saying is that of the 135,000-odd people who are in nursing homes and hostels, over 50 per cent of them, I am told, always sell their home when they move into a nursing home. So 50 per cent are selling their homes now. You have conveniently ignored that. You are running around this country saying to these people that you have to sell your home. You don't have to sell your home. There are the provisions of periodic payments; there is six months before you have to enter into the bond; there are hardship provisions with regard to meeting the bond and 27 per cent of the beds available in nursing homes have to be reserved for people who do not have the means to meet that. You have ignored these issues and all you are trying to do is scare people. I state quite clearly: it is not a requirement of the aged care policy that you have to sell your home and I reject your allegations that you are continually making throughout the country. Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order on relevance. Will the minister give an unequivocal guarantee that people will not have to sell their homes?",45
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,45
120,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What an amazing thing to do, to raise a point of relevance the when I am giving the fundamental facts about this policy. Perhaps you should sit there and take notes about the fundamental facts of this policy and relate that on the radio programs, rather than going onto the radio programs and saying that people have to sell their houses, when you know categorically that over 50 per cent sell their homes now. Some 93 per cent of people who go into nursing homes and hostels are single people and over 50 per cent of them sell their homes now. This policy takes account of all the hardships that can possibly arise-and I have said that I will monitor it; I will watch the implementation and I will take action where there is any injustice visited upon anyone. And if you have got examples, like so many others in this place, then you come and let me know. Unfair Dismissal Laws: Small Business",45
121,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Could the minister outline to the House the employment impact of the government's planned legislative amendments to the Workplace Relations Act that would allow exemptions to the unfair dismissal laws for small business?,45
122,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not think there is any doubt that the impact of this proposal would be positive for employment prospects, particularly within small businesses. It is good to see that the changes that we have already made have been positive for the small business community but there is no doubt also that we need to go further. That has been the consistent position of this government all the way through. In factMr Beazley interjecting",45
123,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition says that, no, it was not. We have been consistent but I would have to say that not. everybody has been consistent on this issue. As I watched the papers last week and saw photos of the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I said to myself, 'I, too, have sat on that park bench with Mrs Kernot. I, too, have been there.' I have had the cartoons. After we successfully saw the passage of the legislation through the parliament my department had drinks for us. My wife was standing in a group just as they were about to make a presentation to me. My wife said, 'I hope it is not one of those cartoons with you and you kilow who, you know where? Mr Costello-Where?",46
124,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In bed. Anyway, it was very good of them to produce another one for me. When it comes to consistency we have been of the view for a long time that an exemption for small business would be a good idea in respect of the unfair dismissal laws. What people perhaps do not appreciate is that last year, after we signed the agreement with the Democrats which secured eventually the passage of the legislation, a few days later I got a phone call from then Senator Kernot who said that she had been approached as to the consequences of the agreement that we had entered into-and members might remember that it was a very detailed agreement which attached to it every amendment. We had dotted every 'i' and crossed every 't'. She rang and said that she had some concern about it. I went to see her about it and it turned out that, in fact, she wanted to change the agreement. I have said on the public record that as a part of those discussions she was in favour of the exemption for small business. She was reported in the Australian the other day as saying that was a fib. I have the extract from the Australian here. I was very careful in my negotiations with the Democrats to ensure that there was a proper record of all of the discussions that we had. I have here the minutes of a meeting, minutes which were taken as a result of discussions between then Senator Kernot, representatives of my department and me. It included the following words: The opportunity was also taken to discuss the substance of the regulations for unfair dismissal. It was agreed that the Democrats would support the $50 filing fee and a provision which exempted small business with less than 10 employees from the 170CG harsh, unjust or unreasonable section but not 170CK, which lists proscribed reasons. That is exactly the policy position we have now. It is true that she supported it. I actually made a written note at the time-careful, wasn't I-which, under the heading 11.45 p.m., states: It was left that Cheryl would tell the party meetingthat is, her meeting the next morningthat this is where we are up to. Any questionsShe would read out this document which was typed that night. My note continues: If there is a problem she will let me know after a party meeting at 9.30 a.m. The agreement is not in question or doubt; it holds. So not only did she support it, not only did we agree, she agreed to take that matter to her party room. For those who doubt what I am saying, it is true that the Democrats did not agree to that proposition but they did agree to the balance of the propositions. I also have here the document which she signed, which is proof positive of what happened. Mr Bevis-Well, what are you on about?",46
125,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I am on about is that a leading member of your team now is in fact supportive of the very proposition which you are opposing, which shows the incredible hypocrisy on Labor's side. And she is not alone. The member for Cunningham knows the sense of this proposition. She can join his faction if she wants to, as can anybody else who has the common sense to at least see that we ought to have a fair deal for the small business community. We have been consistent all along. Consistency is the hallmark of our position when it comes to small business. It is only this government that is prepared to act in accordance with that consistency and give them a good deal.",46
126,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and is about a lot of other Australians who have lost their jobs. I refer to yesterday's revelations that Arco have been using security guards to intimidate and harass former employees of their Gordonstone mine. Did you or anyone from your office or department talk to representatives of Arco prior to their decision to dismiss these 300 Australian workers or prior to their decision to adopt these un-Australian tactics? After learning of these tactics, did you contact Arco to demand that they stop their intimidation and harassment? If not, why not?",47
127,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On Friday I had an interview with Channel 9 that obviously had the piece prepared for Sunday, and they asked me about security people. Obviously I had not seen the Sunday program, but I did of course see it on Sunday. I did also hear I think a chief superintendent from the Queensland police force who had been to Emerald, and that was disclosed on the TV program. Today the company has put out a media release on these matters. There is also a news report. The member asked me about my involvement. I had not that involvement, but there is a statement from Garry Wright, Gordonstone mines spokesman-this is on the news running today-who was asked about this involvement. He says, 'I am unaware of that of any contact Mr Reith's office had in approaching us.' So that settles that. The reality is this goes to the operation of security personnel and obviously raises responsibilities of the police in Queensland, but as to our legislation, which is the issue behind your question, the fact is that Mrs Kernot has said something about this issue. I dare say she will be saying something different now but this is what she used to say in referring to our legislation: I don't think it is the big threat to workers that the Labor Party has made it out to be either. Then she said, also in relation to our legislation",47
128,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Arco Mr REITH-Very sensitive, aren't we.",47
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will resume his seat.,47
130,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was quite clear. The minister has answered point one: Point two in the question was very specific: After learning of these tactics, did you contact AReo to demand that they stop their intimidation and harassmentof 300 Australian workers and their families? The minister is talking about everything but the question.",47
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is well within the expectations that I have and he is answering the question.,47
132,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to table the media release from Arco. I am happy to table Media Monitors article of today's press. As to what Mrs Kernot was saying about industrial relations, she said: It continues the process of change in labour market practice which dates back five years",47
133,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. As I said, this is a fatuous performance and it is not fit for question time",47
134,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order?,47
135,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But the point here is that this is a very specific question with no embellishment. The minister has answered the first part of it; he has not answered the second, which is what his response is.",47
136,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. I said the minister is answering the question in response to my expectations.,47
137,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I, too, would raise a point of order if I were on the back foot. This is what Mrs Kernot says in referring to the Workplace Relations Act: It continues the process of change in labour market practice which dates back five years to the second tier and structural efficiency award negotiation processes begun under Labor. I think it is really important to be reminded that this is a process was begun under the Labor Party. More recently we have seen this demonstrated in the reforms.",47
138,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. You have put down, Mr Speaker, a set of very sensible rules for this place that we have been conforming to in the directness of the questions we have been asking. At least ensure that the other side of the argument that you put forward is honoured. This is way off this question.",48
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition. I will not uphold the Leader of the Opposition's point of order. I would recognise today that there have been a number of fascinating digressions and the ministers invariably came back to the thrust of the question. The fascination I have with digression at the moment is over, and I do ask the minister to quickly wind up his answer.",48
140,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am more than happy to finish if the interruptions desist. Mr Bevis-Answer the question.,48
141,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the question has already been given. Furthermore, I have tabled all the documents. You really ought to read them before you ask some more questions. Compact Discs: Importation",48
142,Mr ZAMMIT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House of the benefits which could flow to Australian music consumers from the government's recent decision regarding compact disc importation? Do alternative plans serve the interests of the mainstream of the Australian community?,48
143,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The way that question is drafted makes it hypothetical, and therefore under the standing orders it is out of order.",48
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,48
145,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I directly address the question asked by the member for Lowe, might I observe that the fascination of the Leader of the Opposition for Tony Blair never ceases to amaze me, seeing that he is really forelock tugging to the fact that Tony Blair is that continuing Margaret Thatcher's agenda. It really does fascinate me that the Leader of the Opposition should be doing that. We have a new version of forelock tugging to the British from the Leader of the Opposition. I say a number of things in answer to the member for Lowe. The first is that the government, in its decision, is emphatically delivering on the election promise that it made to make CDs cheaper for all Australians. Mr Crean-How much?",48
146,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"By contrast, the Australian Labor Party has chosen to support a system that allows foreign multinational record companies to make massive profits at the expense of the Australian consumer. In this issue, you have the Labor Party supporting the foreign multinational record companies making huge profits at the expense of the Australian consumer. The leader of the Labor Party ought to understand that the monopoly on imports enjoyed by foreign firms keep CD prices in Australia artificially high. I know that the member for Batman agrees with me because he argued very strongly against the policy position that was ultimately adopted by the opposition. This is not an issue involving copyright, as there is proper protection of copyright and there is increased protection against piracy. Indeed, the opposition has even suggested that the government should approach the multinational record companies to seek guarantees of investment. The Leader of the Opposition has failed to tell the Australian people that the Labor Party did exactly that, only to have the multinational record companies renege on the deal. The ACCC has indicated that the price differential between Australia and the US is about $7. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has also predicted significant price falls. This is another example of the Australian Labor Party listening to a very noisy minority that is indifferent to the interests of the Australian consumer. This is a classic test for the Labor Party. They are on the side of the sectional foreign multinationals; we are on the side of the Australian consumer; and I have little doubt that the mainstream of the consuming Australian public strongly supports the decision taken by my government.",48
147,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I was going to ask him one about CDs. But that answer was so terrible, we will let it stand.",49

149,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer to your rock solid guarantee, Prime Minister, that no Australian worker would be worse off.

152,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I am glad the member asked ""me that question because it gives me an opportunity, firstly, to remind the member for Canberra, and to remind all of those who sit opposite, that the rock solid guarantee that I gave before the last election was that anybody who entered into an Australian workplace agreement would not be worse off in take-home pay termsMr MCMullan-Answer the question.",49

155,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"as compared with the situation that would have obtained under the award if that person had remained in the award. It is plainly absurd of the member for Canberra to try to construe from that undertaking--quite dishonestly, as you know it is that that guarantee represented that absolutely no person, no matter what the circumstances, would lose his or her job over the next period of either one, four, five or 10 years. The rock solid guarantee related to pay-you know Arco that. For you to try to construe it as meaning something else is a deliberate piece of dishonesty and deceit. Bougainville",49
156,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, what is the outcome of the recent Burnham talks on Bougainville, which were held in New Zealand; and what role did Australia play in helping to achieve this positive step towards resolving the crisis in Bougainville?",49
157,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. It is particularly apposite that this question should come from the member for Aston who not only has a very great interest in the situation in Papua New Guinea but returned from there, I think I am right in saying, yesterday after having led a parliamentary delegation to Papua New Guinea where, I understand, he had the opportunity to inspect some of the drought affected areas and the very beneficial Australian programs in those areas. So I thank the honourable member for that. Since this government came to office, we have been very concerned about the situation in Bougainville and have been prepared to do all we possibly can to try to bring about peace in that troubled province. There is not any doubt that the Sandline crisis was a low point in the whole of what one could describe as the Bougainville saga, and the House knows only too well the strong opposition that came from the Australian government to the plans to hire the Sandline mercenaries. But at the end of the Sandline crisis, as I said at the time, there was an opportunity to strike out for peace on Bougainville. With the election of the Skate government, that government has taken the view that there is no military solution to the problem on Bougainville, that there can only be a negotiated and peaceful solution. And that is very much the view of the Australian government. So, as things have unfolded, that opportunity for peace brought about by the end of the Sandline crisis has, in tum, led to what we now call the Burnham process, where the Australian and New Zealand governments have been providing assistance with the getting together of the parties to the Bougainville conflict. As I have said before, the Australian government does not support a blueprint for a solution to this problem. But what we have said is that we are prepared to assist a peaceful solution. Recently we have been doing that in a couple of ways. First, we have been prepared to offer substantial development assistance for Bougainville somewhere in the vicinity of $130 million over the next few years; and, second, we undertook the transport of nearly 100 delegates to Burnham, which is just outside of Christchurch in New Zealand, and returned those delegates safely to their homes. Those talks in Burnham are part of what I would describe as an evolutionary process. I do not think it is wise to try to push the Bougainville peace process too fast. I do not think it is wise for countries like Australia be out there demanding that blueprint plans be followed. But I do think we should be encouraging this evolutionary process. Indeed, so far the Burnham talks have led to a truce between the parties to the Bougainville conflict-and that, I think, is a very important confidence building measure. There is a mood of both hope and dialogue in the Bougainville process and we will be continuing to encourage that. One policy change we made as a government which I think has been beneficial to this process-although I accept it might be a somewhat controversial change of policy-is that we have been prepared to make direct contact with the Bougainville Interim Government and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. I myself met Moses Havini in Sydney not very long ago and my department has had quite extensive contact with people from the BIG and BRA, including before, during and after the last round of talks in Burnham. So my message on Bougainville is that this is a dreadful and long standing conflict in our immediate vicinity. We want to see it resolved and we want to see it resolved in a peaceful way. The Australian government is acting very constructively, very patiently and very responsibly in trying to assist that process.",49
158,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper-and on Nursing Home Day I think it is Smith 6, Macklin nil. NA Wine: Parliamentary Dining Rooms",50
159,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, on 6 May last year, having discovered that imported wines were available in the parliamentary dining room, I asked you whether you would endeavour to ensure that in future only Australian wines would be available. Mr Speaker, have you now seen the Hyatt's brochure promoting New Zealand red and white wines, and has your office made any progress in ensuring that only Hunter, Yarra and other Australian wines are available in the parliamentary dining room?",50
160,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable to member for Hunter for his question. He would realise that we have subcontracted out the provision of services to all of the dining rooms within the parliament and, notwithstanding the very high quality New Zealand wine's that are on offer, I am sure honourable members will always take the best option and seek only the best. NA",50
161,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to address the House on a matter of privilege referred to you by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) on 2 October.",50
162,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Indulgence granted.,50
163,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"The so-called complaint which the member for Banks seeks to have referred to the Privileges Committee is without any substance. It is merely a political stunt and it should be treated as such. First, let me reiterate that I absolutely reject any suggestion that I directed or authorised anyone to direct the Australian Law Reform Commission not to appear before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title. I similarly reject outrightMr Leo MCLeay-On a point of order, Mr Speaker",50
164,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"It is on indulgence. Mr Leo MCLeay-My recollection is that you have not responded to the House as to whether you have found a prima facie case yet. If that is the fact, then this is quite out of order and this matter should not be dealt with until you report back to the House.",51
165,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the honourable member for Watson. The Attorney-General has requested my indulgence, which I have granted. There is no doubt that the question of the original point raised by the honourable member for Banks is still under consideration. If I find that I am disquieted by anything that is said by the Attorney-General then I will close the debate. But the item is still under reflection in my office. Mr Leo MCLeay-I take a further point of order, Mr Speaker. I have been a member of this House for about 18 years and I think this procedure-for the senior law Qfficer of the Commonwealth to use the House to maybe give you guidance-is wr.ong for him to do. It is a wrong precedent for you to allow the House to adopt. If at some stage in the future you come back and find that there is a prima facie case, then that is for the Attorney to canvass then. If indeed you come back and find that there is not a prima facie case, that might be for some other member to canvass. But I think that the Attorney does himself, yourself and the House an injustice in attempting to canvass this matter before you have given the House the benefit of your thoughts. Indeed, if you are going to allow him indulgence, the member for Banks might want some indulgence and many others of us may wish to have some indulgence. It might be better if this were terminated right now.",51
166,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the honourable member for Watson. He raises some items of considerable substance, which I am reflecting on at this moment. But at the moment, without having even a fundamental understanding of what the Attorney-General is going to cover in his indulgence, I will allow the Attorney-General some indulgence. As I said, I am happy to close his contribution at a moment's notice if I get disturbed by the substance of his deliberations. Mr Leo MCLeay-Could I raise a further point then, Mr Speaker? I am not meaning to be difficult here. Government members-Ha, hal Mr Leo MCLeay-You might think that is funny. The clown at the table might think that is funny, Mr Speaker.",51
167,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I am aware of the honourable member's considerable contribution to this place. Mr Leo MCLeay-If the Attorney-General does have a matter that he thinks he ought to put before you, maybe on this matter it might be more appropriate if he discussed that with you in your office and then it might suit you to give him indulgence. The Attorney thinks this is rather funny, too. I guess everyone in the government thinks these privilege matters are all frivolous and funny, but I can remember members on that side taking a lot of interest in these things in the past themselves. If the matter is something the Attorney is concerned about, maybe canvassing it with you in your office first might be a good idea. But to have a matter of privilege canvassed before your being willing to give the House the benefit of your judgment is a bit of a difficult position for all of us. We all might want to canvass something else. The member for Banks might wish to. Maybe the Attorney could talk to you in your office; I don't know.",51
168,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"The Clerk has just drawn my attention to House of Representatives Practice, page 461. It seems to cover the exigency that you have under discussion at the moment, where members can make comment on a privilege matter, under the heading, 'Other matters by indulgence of the Chair'. So I am happy to listen to the points that the Attorney-General is raising. Mr Reith-On the point of order, Mr Speaker: I put it to you that indulgence is a very wide discretion in the chair and it would be appropriate for the Attorney to further his remarks so that you can at least assess what he is putting to the House. It would not be common in the proceedings of the House to have situations where potentially the· actions of the Attorney would be going off to the Privileges Committee. I do not think it is appropriate, as suggested by the member for Watson, that there be a private conversation with you. There is no reason why all of these matters should not be transparent. The reason we have a process for indulgence is to cover a lot of, shall we say, abnormal circumstances for members to bring matters to the attention of the House and also, in the privileges proceedings, essentially the person who is concerned about privilege does have an opportunity to present a case. Here we have the rather peculiar circumstance of where the person against whom the case is being put, it seems to me, should have some opportunity not to argue the case necessarily but to present before the House the necessary and relevant material which can allow you to make that judgment so that you do not make a judgment entirely in a vacuum.",51
169,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the minister. At the moment I would uphold the minister's point of order because, as I said, I cannot canvass the Attorney-General's comments until I at least get the thrust of the direction that they are going in. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition also has a point of order.",52
170,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIVILEGE,"Yes, I have a point of order to the same matter, Mr Speaker. I have the reference that you referred to that gives you the authority for members sometimes being allowed to speak by leave or indulgence to a matter raised before the Speaker's opinion has been given. The footnote suggests a very long time since that has been done. The point I would submit is that, if you took it away and went back to the circumstances in which that had occurred, it would almost invariably be at the point of time it was raised that that indulgence was given and not some substantial period of time after the event at the time when you came to your conclusions. Might I suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that these points of privilege are actually important in procedural terms and these circumstances, I submit, would be unique in the way in which this has been raised-debate entered into a long time down the track from the original raising of it and before you came back. In those circumstances, before this proceeds any further, it would be wise for you to consider the question of your indulgence and make up your mind on it and then seek some clarification from the Attorney-General later in the day as to what he intends to raise.",52
171,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition. I must admit to having some preference to that particular course of action. Whilst I am not in any way incapable of setting precedents, as you are already well aware, I only intend to create precedence where the ultimate benefit to the House comes into play. I shall invite the honourable member for Banks to further this particular discussion.",52
172,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. It goes to the question of procedure as well as a further point of order. The first question is in relation to procedure. As is well known, Mr Speaker, I raised the matter with you. I apologise for not being in the House when the Attorney sought indulgence. That is a question of procedure I ask you, because it is my view that the Attorney, if he were to raise this matter of indulgence, as a matter of courtesy this side of the House should have been informed, particularly myself. Mr Reith-You're just playing games.",52
173,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,"No, I am asking in terms of procedure for the future because he is seeking indulgence. The second point I raise on a point of order is the appropriateness of granting indulgence. Mr Speaker, you ought to look at the question of a prima facie case. This is similar to what is happening in the Senate. The other point is this, Mr Speaker: I did not put one side of the case to you. I put to you in all the submissions I gave you all the comments of the Attorney-General that were on the record and I also referred to you at that time all the comments of the Attorney General that were made in parliament. If the Attorney-General has further material that he wants to comment on, my submission to you is that that occurs if you find a prima facie case. That is when the debate occurs-after the event. Now you are considering all the material in the public domain that was put before you. If there is no prima facie case, the Attorney-General does not have to explain anything or seek indulgence on anything. We g'o to this next stage if you find a prima facie case.",52
174,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the honourable member for Banks for his contribution. Before I sum up, I call the Attorney-General.",53
175,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: it seems to me that this is going off half-cocked. Can I just correct the record. The member for Banks did not advise me in advance that he was going to raise a matter of privilege relating to me on 2 October - I only heard of it when he stood up. If I had followed the course suggested by the member for Watson and had presented to you the material I seek to table today to present a complete picture, the member for Watson would have been the first to criticise me for going behind the back of the HouseMr Leo MCLeay-No, I wouldn't have.",53
176,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"Mr SPEAKER Mr Leo MCLeay-Point of order, Mr Speaker",53
177,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I am listening to a point of order. I shall rule on it first. Mr Leo MCLeay-He is making his speech.,53
178,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,He is making a point of order.,53
179,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, the proper procedure in this case involves what is the proper way of raising a question of whether there has been a prima facie case made out for a breach of privilege. If you look at the procedure, there may be a means of presenting a complete set of documents that have an unarguable case. That is not often going to be the case. On the other hand, there may be a situation in which a case can be put which can be completely answered if further material is provided. There is nothing in the procedures of this House to prevent that issue being considered at the prima facie stage. There is nothing in the rules of the House-the standing orders of the House-that prevents me seeking your indulgence to raise a complete response. Mr Lee-At the time.",53
180,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"The interjection is made that it should have been at the time. At the time there were documents tabled which were just listed. I did not know what they were. I have now seen them. Most of them seem to be from the media. They are not original records. There are letters relating to this that have not been tabled. They are matters that, in fairness to the House as well as to me, if you are going to consider whether there is a prima facie case, you should have a look at. It is appropriate that I tell the House that I am seeking you to have a look at it rather than go to you in your chambers. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: we have been able to locate one example, Mr Speaker. It is partly on point. The member for Bonython, Dr Blewett, sought indulgence to make a short statement. He then proceeded to make a statement and was followed by Mrs Sullivan, the member for Moncrieff.  Mr Reith-I have the Hansard here.  mittee. Mr Reith-Yes, I appreciate that. I am just saying that it is not directly on point but it is a case which supports the granting of indulgence, and that is that indulgence was granted prior to the matter being settled so as to provide further information to the House on that particular issue. Mr Lee-How big was the time gap? Mr Reith-This was a matter in the House on 23 November 1993, page 3401. The matter was, I gather, first raised a month earlier on 27 October. So it does support the granting of indulgence.",53
181,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the Minister. I will not rule on some of these points because they are reasonably complex.  order: I am really surprised because the Leader of the House was then Manager of Opposition Business. A matter of privilege was raised by Kathy Sullivan, the member for Moncrieff, about a report, It's time, of the Procedure Committee, which I was a member of, and indulgence was granted to the chairman of the committee, Neil Blewett, who subsequently became the high commissioner, but not as the minister for health, to speak about the issue of privilege. You would be aware, Mr Speaker, that before a breach of privilege can proceed a committee has to investigate the breach itself and report. So I strongly disagree that the reference in practice, and particularly the reference quoted by the Leader of the House, provides any precedence for this unique occurrence today. Mr Lieberman- Mr Speaker, I am tempted to come in on the point of order. I will be very brief. The issue that should be examined very carefully is that if, as a matter of precedent, you were to now rule that the Attorney in these circumstances should not, by leave, be allowed to put further material to the House and to you before you come back with your considered view as to whether a prima facie case exists or not, you will then have a precedent which would not be worthy of the House or yourself, sir, with respect, because it would mean that any person in theory could raise a point of alleged breach of privilege against a minister or a sitting member on either side of the House and the Speaker would then be precluded, it would follow, from examining any further material from the person who had been accused of being involved in alleged breach of privilege. That in itself is undesirable practice. As you know, I have been involved in another parliament where I served for a number of years on a privileges committee, and I served on the Privileges Committee in this House last term. Other parliaments have very careful procedures laid out to avoid this very situation. I will not go into those. This House for various reasons has never done that. It has left open the opportunity for someone to get up and say, 'What you have just heard, Mr Speaker' or 'What you heard last week is not exactly what the position is. Here is my view of it. Before you go back to your chambers to consider it I have the right, at least as a matter of common justice, to put it to you.' So the precedent that would come about, should you rule against this move by the Attorney, would be a very undesirable one for this House to adopt.",53
182,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, on that point of order and a further point on it: it is open to you, in considering whether or not you give precedence to a motion that a prima facie breach of privilege has been established or give precedence to a motion that it be examined, to consider matters in the public domain. In fact, it is almost invariable that you will consider matters in the public domain because that is usually where a breach of privilege has occurred. So it is obviously open to the Attorney-General to correspond with you on that matter, should he choose to do so. The problem for us is that there are processes by which this can be sensibly considered in the House. If a proposition were to become general-and if you create a precedent I suggest that it probably would-at some time down the track after a matter has been raised for your consideration then we are going to debate those things in the House, as would invariably be the case with the Attorney General presenting a debating case for his position. It invites the contrary case to be presented and you will therefore be subject, if you allow fairness to both sides of the House, to an extensive debate on matters that really should be questions for your private consideration. From what one can imagine the Attorney General saying in defence of himself, and from what he started to say at the outset, none of that would be closed to him to correspond with you. It would be a far more sensible course to pursue than doing it here.",54
183,Mr TUCKEY,PRIVILEGE,"Don't do it in the House, do it privately!",54
184,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIVILEGE,"If you do it here, Wilson, the point is that we then have a debate on it and we endlessly debate these dam things until we get a conclusion from the Speaker. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, on the point of order: one of the few positions of some power that the Speaker has left to him in this chamber is to deal with privilege matters. Members in the past have always preferred that the Speaker dealt with that rather than it become part of the cut and thrust. In that way they might have felt that they got a better shake. I do not think that anybody would think that there was anything wrong with the Attorney corresponding with you in the way that the Leader of the Opposition has spoken about, so that you could make yourself aware of the particulars in any matter, and then you could come back to the House and, on the authority that the House has given you, decide whether you will allow a motion to be moved or not. That is, I think, a better safeguatd for members in that, if you decide that there is nothing in the issue, that is it and the members have got to cop that. If you find a prima facie case and allow a member, in this case the member for Banks, to move a resolution, there will be a debate then and members can vote that decision up or vote it down. But I put it to you quite seriously, Mr Speaker, that it would not be helpful to the process as we have known it in this House if, some 2Y2 weeks after the member for Banks raised his matter of privilege",54
185,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"The next sitting day. Mr Leo MCLeay-Albeit that there has been a recess in the meantime, there have been 2V2 weeks go by and we are going to have this debate again. Then, after you decide whether there is a prima facie case or not, we will have another debate. Mr Reith-No. It's indulgence. That's the whole point of it. It's not a debate. Mr Leo MCLeay-And that precisely, for the Leader of the House, is the difficulty that he and the government are placing you and the House in. I do not believe you knew about this before today, Mr Speaker. You are being put irr a rather difficult position and House is. The Attorney should be willing to go and canvass this with you in private, you come back here later today or tomorrow and decide whether a prima facie case has been found and then we have the debate. To allow it to go on like this, I think, changes the rules as we have known them here for quite some time and indeed could be seen to detract from the authority the Speaker has in privilege matters. Members on both sides ought to be really careful in deciding whether we want to break those rules down. If we decide we want to break those rules down, the numbers can change and you can get served up pretty quickly if it goes wrong. I think the way we have done it in the past has been a sensible one. The Attorney could deal with you and you could give us the answer. If the answer is that you find no case, the member for Banks has got to cop it and sit down. If you find there is a case, the government can still vote down the motion of the member for Banks-but that is when we do it, not now. Mr Reith-On a further point of order, just to make it clear, I was not aware that the Attorney-General was going to raise this matterMr Leo MCLeay-I'm not saying that you were. Mr Reith-Well, there has been some suggestion that the government had embarked on this course. Mr Leo MCLeay-He should have spoken to you; that's your job. Mr Reith-I say that for your information, Mr Speaker. The second thing is that this is the next sitting day after the matter was first raised, so it is quite appropriate. Thirdly, it is constantly said that this provides for a debate. It does not provide for a debate; it is not a precedent about anything. It is simply the exercise of your discretion to handle the matter as you see fit. Under those circumstances, I have to say that I think the opposition are making a mountain out of a molehill. The matters are currently before the chair and it is not unreasonable for you to have these matters before you. I do not think it adds the anything to have a big debate about this particular matter. The Attorney should be allowed to complete his remarks.",55
186,Mr TUCKEY,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, just briefly, in reference to the contribution of the member for Watson, he keeps stressing what is the practice of this House. The practice of this House is recorded in this book, our bible. It says that parliamentary practice is that you can grant indulgence in these circumstances, and it is specific to a matter of privilege. That is the practice of this House, but we are into the business of not letting the facts get in the way of a good story. Quite clearly you can grant indulgence, and that is the beginning and the end of it. Having granted indulgence, it is then up to the Attorney-General, in this case, to put what I presume are the facts as he knows them, not the facts according to the member for Banks. They are both members of this House and both have the same rights within this House. They are the facts. But, in terms of the practice of this House, it is clearly shown in Parliamentary Practice that you can grant indulgence, and that is what members opposite are objecting to, and they cannot do it.",55
187,Mr HOLDING,PRIVILEGE,"Having been a member of the Privileges Committee of this parliament for some time, both in opposition and government, I believe it is very important for comments. the House that you maintain the prerogative which is essentially the prerogative of the Speaker",56
188,Mr TUCKEY,PRIVILEGE,That's what he has been trying to do.,56
189,Mr HOLDING,PRIVILEGE,"I can get by without your cackle. Mr Speaker, it is the duty of a ber when he first is apprised of what might a matter of privilege to draw it to your tion as the presiding officer. The discretion to whether or not it is a matter of yours and yours alone. If it is a difficult and complex matter, your predecessors have from time to time gone away, conferred with clerks and come back to announce whether there is in fact a matter of privilege. If you find that it is, you refer it to the Privileges Committee. It is then a matter for them to into the detail, and quite often they simply come up with the proposition that there is breach of privilege or they do not feel is a prima facie case even established. That is sionthe process. We do not want to get into a situation where that process becomes the prerogative of anybody but you as Speaker. That is the process, and I suggest it should followed. If you need more time to consider any of these arguments, I suggest that you want. take it. But to go on canvassing it in this way is unprecedented.",56
190,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I must admit that the essence of transparency is going to guide my decision in the multitudinous array of points of order that we have had taken today. The Attorney-General has not been in contact with me in any way, shape or form since the matter was originally raised two weeks ago and, as the member for Watson mentioned, we have had a recess in that time. The Attorney approached me during the concluding moments of question time and asked me whether he could seek my indulgence to make a statement, and I was happy to grant that. As everybody quite rightly reflects, the indulgence is mine. In the interests of transparency, and it is certainly not unusual for more than one member to speak on a privileges matter, it is my intention to in allow the Attorney-General to make some As I said, if I find at any stage of the game those comments move into debate, make me uncomfortable in any way or I feel in a position where my deliberations may be impaired for whatever reason, I shall draw the debate or the indulgence to a close. But at the moment, without knowing and not having any memunderstanding of what the Attorney-General be is about to say, my indulgence is in place, attenand I ask the Attorney-General to bear my as comments in mind as he uses the indulgence privilege is which I have granted him.",56
191,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"It is my intention to put the complete story and, in the process, to the table some documents that I find, rather surprisingly, were not tabled during the raising of the matter. It is ironic, I suggest, that when I am the one being accused of go suppressing material the opposition seeks to suppress my response in this House. I reject no any suggestion that I directed or authorised there anyone to direct the Law Reform Commis",56
192,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Order! As the Attorney General would appreciate, we are now beginbe ning to embark on a defence which really involves yourself in a debate which I do not",56
193,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"To counter an allegation, I have to identify which allegation is at issue; in saying that I reject it, I am making a statement of fact.",56
194,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Has the Attorney-General tabled those documents that he wished to table?,57
195,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"I have tabled them, but I cannot leave them there without some explanation. Mr Crean-You can't debate it.",57
196,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, the suggestion is that I am not allowed to debate.",57
197,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,This is indulgence:,57
198,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"I know; I appreciate that. If the member for Banks (Mr Melham) says 'black', I am entitled to say 'white'. If it is a factual assertion, it seems to me to be entirely appropriate that I should say it. Those opposite might not like it because it might sound to them like debate, but I am rejecting what they are asserting. Mr Robert Brown- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. In the capacity which you have to allow indulgence, it would quite clearly be a most unfortunate outcome if, in the exercise of that power, you, as Speaker of this House, finished up being embarrassed as a result of your having the responsibility now to deliberate on the question that was raised by the member for Banks and to report back to this House the outcome of your deliberations in the face of argument which may be presented-and quite clearly will be presented-if the Attorney-General has the opportunity to do so in this context. It is significant that Leader of the House has already conceded that this matter was not raised with him. Had it been raised with himMr Leo MCLeay-He would have sorted him out. Mr Robert Brown-Exactly. As the Chief Opposition Whip says, he would have sorted out the Attorney-General and counselled him to raise the matter in private with you so that any of the documents that he is now seeking to table could have been brought to your attention and assisted you in the deliberation which you have undertaken. This is most improper, and the Attorney-General should make the material available to you in private so that you can include that in your deliberations.",57
199,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I thank the honourable member for Charlton. Does the Attorney General intend to table any further information?,57
200,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,I intend to table some information. I also intend to make some statements that are assertions of fact that I would invite you to take into account as well.,57
201,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Let us address the ramifications of the tabling. Have you tabled all of the information which I will need?,57
202,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,I have not tabled anything yet. I have the documents ready for tabling.,57
203,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"No, you have tabled some documents.",57
204,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"They are the documents I intend to table. I intend to table them one by one and explain them as I go-with your indulgence. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, a simple point of order: I thought that in answer to a specific question from you earlier the Attorney-General said that he had tabled those documents. If so, he cannot take them back and claim he intends to table them one by one.",57
205,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the honourable member for Dobell. I must admit that my recollection is that the document embraced by the clip has been tabled, and my question the really focused on any other information that the Attorney-General wanted to table.",57
206,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,I would state the background and explain each of the documents that is being tabled and the reason.,57
207,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"If the information that you have tabled is germane to the privileges case, I shall remove them and, together with the information tabled by the honourable member for Banks, add to the store of information we have on this very complex question and rule subsequently. I do not see how your contribution can add to the information that you are tabling unless you want to prepare a covering letter for the documents as well, which I would happily take.",57
208,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"I am happy to adopt that route, but the route I had thought appropriate on indulgence was to make statements of fact, as the member for Banks asserted in exactly the same way. He was entitled, in raising the issue, to say, 'This is the story,' and hand up documents as he went. I simply claim the same entitlement.",58
209,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the Attorney General. Mr MCClelland-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the fundamental error in that proposition is that it puts you in the role of being an arbitrator or a decider of facts. Your role here is to determine whether the allegations made by the member for Banks, if sustained, could amount to a breach of privilege. The Attorney-General is asking you to perform an arbitral or judicial function, which is not your function at all. That is the role of the Standing Committee of Privileges, and that is why it is inappropriate.",58
210,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the honourable member for Barton. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I put it to you that it is only a matter of natural justice that the Attorney-General be able to put certain information before the House. As he puts that information, it will contain assertions by him as to the facts of the matter. We had the member for Banks doing exactly that on the last sitting day of this parliament. It does not in any sense compromise your position; in fact, it allows you to make a decision based on a reasonable array of information. It is incredible that these people have been baying for the head of the Attorney-General on the basis that we have not had full disclosure of certain arguments and legal opinions, yet when he comes before the House to do the right thing we have had nothing but interjections, interruptions and irrelevant points of order to prevent him from giving to the House an explanation and the supporting material. Mr Speaker, this has gone on far too long. You gave the Attorney-General indulgence. When you gave him indulgence he was entitled to proceed in accordance with the request, which he quite properly put to you in the normal way at the end of question time. It is incredible. These guys are claiming a cover-up and now, when the Attorney-General comes to present full information to the House, they are trying to prevent it. It is absolutely absurd. I have gone over the two precedents. One of the precedents does not help because in that case it was decided not to proceed with the privilege matter. That does not help you much. The other precedent-I was not the manager at the time, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was-gives you some semblance of support in what is otherwise a unique situation. In that particular case, the matter was raised a month later. The members of the committee, which was allegedly the source of the leak or the foundation of the leak, then got up on indulgence and provided further information to the House. On that basis you do have a precedent for this particular set of circumstances. It is not unreasonable, just as a matter of common sense, that there be a proper presentation to you of the relevant information. It does not require anything of you; it simply ensures full public disclosure of the relevant matters. These people reckon it is important. If they reckon it is important then it is time the matters were on the public record. That is what the Attorney-General proposes to do. He is not asking for any more than was given to the member for Banks in the usual coursenot a skerrick more. He simply wants an opportunity to present the facts, including his own assertions as to those facts. That is not debating the issue; that is presenting information to you upon which you can then make a balanced decision. When all is said and done, this is a pretty simple matter. The Attorney-General is asking for an opportunity so that the public can know-the public have a right to know these matters-and the information is on the public record. Given that these people have been claiming a cover-up, it should only reinforce the common sense of the decision that you have already made, which is to grant indulgence.",58
211,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, you have already ruled on this point of order. I am actually making life a little bit harder for you by pointing that fact out, but in that barrage of nonsense you got from the Leader of the House you might have forgotten it. The point of order is that you suggested to the Attorney General that the appropriate course of action, the document having been tabled, was to correspond with you if he wished to make any further points. If the Leader of the House had read the propositions put forward by the member for Banks he would know that the honourable member did not argue his case at all; he simply presented the fact that, in his belief, a breach of privilege had probably occurred because of A, Band C, and he then tabled documents. That was it. What you had lined up here was an explanation of document after document. There was no explanation by the member for Banks for the various documents he tabled-he simply tabled them. Mr Reith-Further to the point of order: this is so much garbage, with respect. The member for Banks got up and said: There is mounting evidence that there has been a determined effort by the government to frighten off the Australian Law Reform Commission in this matter. The Leader of the Opposition would have us believe that this was an impartial statement of the facts. This is absolutely absurd. All that the Attorney-General wants, in his quiet, productive and knowledgeable way, is to put before the House just a few basic facts. The Leader of the Opposition, who makes an opportunistic point, would be embarrassed by me quoting out the previous words of the member for Banks. I believe he should dismiss his further debating point and the debating point to be made by the former minister for justice, who just wants to string it out.",58
212,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIVILEGE,"Further to that point of order, since you make it, this is how the honourable member for Banks introduced his documents: Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the following documents so that you can consider this matter. There are three pages of correspondence and the first page of a submission from the Law Reform Commission dated 17 September to Mr Grundy, the secretary of the parliamentary committee; correspondence to Mr Rose dated ·17 September from Mr Grundy setting down a hearing date of 3 October; correspondence of 19 September to Mr Grundy, signed on behalf of Mr Rose . . . That does not sound to me like he is reading from document to document. He merely raises the point of a prima facie case in regard to this in one paragraph; the Attorney-General is lining up to give a detailed exposition document by document. He actually does have to say there has been a breach of privilege because of A, Band C. That is how you establish a prima facie case.",59
213,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,We have had a series of points of order taken on what is obviously a controversial and rather complex topic. The Attorney-General has tabled the documents that he feels are appropriate to table. If he wishes to tell us what those documents are without entering into debate then I am happy to take some advice from the Attorney-General and he still has my indulgence.,59
214,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"The first document I want to refer to is a letter of 28 August from me to the President of the Law Reform Commission. Prior to my writing that, the commission had sought a referenceMr Leo MCLeay-Come on! Mr Crean-Come on!",59
215,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Order!,59
216,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,These are facts. Mr Reith-This is just a campaign of interruption. It could have been over half an hour ago.,59
217,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Order! The Attorney has been invited to table documents and I am in the process of listening to the tabling statement.,59
218,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"The commission had sought a reference from me on the subject of native title and I declined to give it. Subsequently, the commission received a publicly directed circular, sent to hundreds of people, as a result of whichMr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, on a point of . order: the Attorney is now canvassing the Issue. ",59
219,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,He is not canvassing the issue. There is no point of order.,59
220,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"As a result of that, it made a submission to the Wik task force on the Native Title Amendment Bill. When I became aware of that-by a chance discussion with a member of the Wik task force-I wrote to the president on 28 August, and that document is the first document in the tabled group. The commission responded to my letter with a letter of 4 September, which is document No. 2 in the bundle. It transpired that, despite my letter of 28 AugustMrs Crosio-Come on! This is outrageous.",59
221,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Order! I need this information to make my ultimate judgment.,60
222,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"Despite my letter and without my knowledge, the commission then sought to be invited to make a submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. In support of that, I table two documents: a fax to an officer of the Law Reform Commission from the parliamentary joint committee and an account, from the secretary of the parliamentary joint committee, of the sequence of events, including a reference to a telephone call on 12 September from an officer of the commission seeking details of the committee inquiry. From those documents it is clear that the commission had ignored the views expressed in my letter and essentially invited themselves to make a submission to the parliamentary joint committee. I became aware later in September that the commission had made a submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its inquiry into copyright. I received a letter from the commission advising of that. The letter is dated 12 September. It was initialled by me on 26 September, but I certainly saw it before then. That is document No.4. In view of the commission's actions in relation to the views I expressed in my letter of 28 August, I had a meeting, and at that meeting the acting secretary to my department, Mr Reaburn, offered to discuss the issue with Mr Rose. They had a discussion on 23 September, and document No.5 is a note of the discussion. That can speak for itself. At this stage it is still the fact that the commission has had no reference on the subject of native title or on the native title bill. Subsequent to the issue being raised in the House, I sought advice on the powers of the Law Reform Commission from the Chief General Counsel. The Chief General Counsel provided two opinions, the first of which deals with that issue. It is dated 1 October and his view, expressed in paragraph 2, was that: . .. the Commission does not have the power to make a submission to the Committee, in the context of the Committee's consideration of the Bill, about the Commonwealth's constitutional power to enact the Bill or the effect which the Bill would have, if enacted. . That is the first of two documents under tab 6. I obtained a second opinion from the Chief General Counsel, which was dealing with the conclusion of my role, and that opinion is that, in the view of the Chief General Counsel, on the information available to him, which included the note from Mr Reaburn as· to his meeting on 23 September with Mr Rose, 'no action taken by the Attorney-General in relation to the Commission's proposal that it make a submission to the Committee constitutes' a breach of privilege. He dealt in that opinion with",60
223,Unknown,PRIVILEGE,Opposition members interjecting,60
224,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Order! It is not being debated. It merely reflects a comment contained in the annexure, by the sound of it. If we were all to listen, I will interject when I think it is appropriate. I do not see that it is appropriate at this moment.",60
225,Mr KERR,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I am asking you to reflect on the point that you have taken that you will watch and monitor this carefully.",60
226,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,And I am.,60
227,Mr KERR,PRIVILEGE,"The whole point of the constraints that you have placed on this discussion is that the minister will be entitled to put on the record factual materials which relate to the matters that will be before you. In this context, you have got to remember that the normal course in a matter of privilege is for the member who raises it to be ready to move a motion in relation to that matter, and it is only suspended if you, Mr Speaker, say that you have formed a view that there is no prima facie case. This is going to descend inevitably into a circumstance where members on the other side will seek to table legal documentation which is asserting cases that purport to support the Attorney's position. This is opening a debate which standing orders plainly put before you in a personal capacity. The whole reason the parliament does not operate normally in this way is so that we do not go through these kinds of processes that are now occurring but, rather, that when a matter is raised it is raised briefly veyed to the Speaker to make this preliminary assessment. This is in fact now opening up the whole character of this debate to the examination of the parliament, and it will be inevitable that others will seek to make comment, of course subject to whatever discretion you will allow, in response to the extensive discursions that the Attorney is making.",60
228,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the honourable member for Denison for his learned comments. I do not uphold the point of order, because at the moment the Attorney is staying very close to the guidelines I gave him in addressing those documents which he is tabling. They are more extensive than I expected, but at this stage of the game I see no debate and the Attorney retains my indulgence.",61
229,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Could he give the dates of the ments he has tabled, particularly the legal opinion as to whether or not he has breached privilege and those opinions? Do any of the documents postdate the matter being raised?",61
230,Unknown,PRIVILEGE,Honourable members interjecting,61
231,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Order! The Attorney has the call.,61
232,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, I was referring to a second opinion by the Chief General Counsel. Mr Leo MCLeay-What date?",61
233,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"On 1 October, as I understand it.",61
234,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"Also dated 1 October. They are both the same date. The last document I seek to table is a media statement made by me dated 1 October 1997 to which were appended the two legal opinions referred to, the note by Mr Reaburn and some assertions as to fact made by me. Mr Speaker, I invite you to take those into consideration in determining whether there is a prima facie case of breach of privilege. Mr Allan Morris- Mr Speaker, the Attorney-General in his comments referred to the commission seeking a reference and his refusing it. Did he table documents to confirm and conand detail that or not?",61
235,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"As far as I aware, the Attorney-General has concluded his remarks, but if he wishes to address that point I am happy.",61
236,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,"I am happy to be cross examined by any member sitting opposite on any issue, but it ought to be done in accordance with proper procedures.",61
237,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"That will not be necessary. Mr Allan Morris- Mr Speaker, my point of order was: did he in fact table details of the seeking of the reference and its refusal? It was very hard to follow what he did and did not table.",61
238,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVILEGE,Read the Hansard tomorrow.,61
239,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I am aware that all of the documents the Attorney intended to table docuhave been tabled. I have no dilemma with anything that the Attorney-General has raised at this moment, and I am happy to encourage all members to address the Hansard and I shall certainly be addressing the papers.",61
240,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, I have a further matter of privilege that I wish to raise with you and it arises from the documents tabled by the Attorney General (Mr Williams). In particular, I refer to document No.3, which is a fax dated 12 September 1997 from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund to the ALRC. The cover note says: ... responding to the ALRC's seeking of an invitation to appear before the PJC and a letter dated 1 October 1997 from the PJC secretary Peter Grundy to PJC Chairman Warren Entsch outlining the sequence of events which shows that the ALRC sought an invitation to appear. Mr Speaker, in relation to those two documents 3 and 4, I would ask that you investigate a breach of privilege. Those documents are documents of the committee. There has been no resolution of the committee to release those documents. Indeed, all the documents that I tabled from the committee were committee documents that were approved by the committee for public release to you. Mr Speaker, the Attorney-General is not a member of the parliamentary joint committee",61
241,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVILEGE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker",62
242,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I am hearing a point of order.,62
243,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,"And, on the face of it, documents 3 and 4",62
244,Mr KERR,PRIVILEGE,This is indulgence.,62
245,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"No, it is not indulgence.",62
246,Mr KERR,PRIVILEGE,This takes precedence over everything else.,62
247,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, this is a matter of privilege and I take a point of order. I would raise with you the precedent of a member who is not a chair of a committee raising a matter of privilege on behalf of a committee. The traditional practice of this parliament is that the only person within a committee who has right to raise a matter is the chairman unless the matter has been deliberated upon by the committee, in which case, there being a dissent, the chairman of the committee normally rises in his place, advises the parliament of that fact and then that other member can raise the matter. I would suggest to you that this issue should first be returned to the committee and it would be for the chair of that committee to initiate any response in this place.",62
248,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the right honourable member for New England. I will listen to any further points of order before I try to sum up this increasingly complex situation, but I am seeing this as a separate proposition.",62
249,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,"I appreciate that, Mr Speaker. There is a further separate matter of privilege in relation to the chairman of the parliamentary committee, Mr Entsch MP, because documents 3 and 4 at the top, on the face of them, have an imprint indicating that they have been faxed from 'Entsch MP'. I would ask you to consider whether the chairman of the parliamentary committee has breached parliamentary privilege by releasing documents to the Attorney-General without the authorisation of the committee. I do not want to breach the considerations of the committee-as a member of the parliamentary committee I have to be very careful-but I am referring to 'Entsch MP' on the top of documents 3 and 4. I can say to you, Mr Speaker, as a member of the parliamentary committee, that there has been no resolution agreed to by the parliamentary committee to release those two documents. On the face of it, there is a prime facie case, I would submit to you, that the chairman of the parliamentary committee has leaked documents of the committee without the approval of the committee to the Attorney General.",62
250,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I draw attention to the fact that the allegations with respect to the chair of the committee that he has leaked them will require a substantive motion. You cannot make that allegation in this place in the manner which has just been done. I ask the honourable gentleman to withdraw.",62
251,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the right honourable member for New England. There has been a considerable increase in the amount of the data that I now need to reflect on, and I am not proposing to take too many more tablings this afternoon. However, I shall reflect on this over the next few days. I will take your additional submission on notice, and as far as I am concerned the matter is just about closed.",62
252,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to respond to the matter raised by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) about the correspondence. This is a classic example of why there should be an opportunity for a response. The copies of those documents were made available publicly by a return to order motion passed in the Senate.",62
253,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,"No, they weren't.",63
254,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE,-That is the advice I have been given.,63
255,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I thank the Attorney.,63
256,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,Mr SPEAKER ,63
257,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Let's not get too excited about the header on documents.,63
258,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,"The two documents I referred to, Mr Speaker, were not part of the return· to order, which is one of the reasons that I could not table them on the earlier occasion.",63
259,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the honourable member for Banks. As I said, it is my aim to be as transparent in my considerations of this increasingly complex matter as best I can be. I shall take all of these points on notice and advise the House further later. NA Chamber Microphones",63
260,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, in previous parliaments, when a member rose to attempt to get the call, it was broadcast, and therefore you could hear it. Nowadays the microphones are turned on only when you give the call. While we stand and try to get your attention, you are occupied looking at somebody else, and the capacity to take a point of order is lost. Can I suggest that we return to the system where the people watching the whole room and who are not engaged in the debate turn the microphone on when we seek the call so we can actually get your attention? It is very difficult at times to get you to respond to us.",63
261,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Ne-castle for his question. We have discussed this frequently with the provider of the service. We have placed them in an impossible situation frequently-notwithstanding how adroit they are and how frequently they seem to have more hands than one can count-to provide the backup that I need to switch on and off microphones. They do the best job that they can possibly do. It is something that I constantly have under review. At the moment, I am more than happy with the situation. I am sure, given the historic nature of this place, that when somebody seeks my attention they can invariably find it. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS",63
262,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I present the following Auditor-General's audit reports for 1997-98: No.4-Performance audit-Service delivery in radio and telecommunications-Australian Telecommunications Authority and Spectrum Management Agency, and No.5-Performance audit-performance management of defence inventory-Defence Quality Assurance (preliminary study). Ordered that the reports be printed. NA",63
263,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain pensioners, superannuants and retirees points out to the House that Government funding for the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation's national secretariat will cease on 30 September 1997. The Federation provides advice to the Government on older people's needs and concerns, publishes independent information for older people and works to ensure that older people have a say in decisions that affect their lives. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to direct the Government to provide funding to ensure that the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation can continue its valuable work for and with older Australians. by Mr Albanese (from 26 citizens), Mr Andren (from 110 citizens), Mr Anthony (from 236 citizens), Mr Beddall (from 49 citizens), Mr Robert Brown (from 25 citizens), Mr Causley (from 41 citizens), Mr Martin Ferguson (from 87 citizens), Mr Hicks (from 52 citizens), Dr Lawrence (from 14 citizens), Mr MCLachlan (from 26 citizens), Mr Marek (from 43 citizens), Mr Martin (from 53 citizens), Mr Allan Morris (from 25 citizens), Mrs Moylan (from 25 citizens), Mr Nairn (from 24 citizens), Mr Sinclair (from four citizens), Mr Slipper (from 25 citizens), Mrs West (from 25 citizens) and Mr Williams (from 16 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament assembled: The petition of the citizens of Australia brings the attention of the House the Federal Government's plan to make major cuts to Legal Aid funds. The Federal Government plans to cut $40 million annually from Legal Aid funding. Last year, 250,000 people were assisted nationally. However, if these cuts go ahead, many Australians will be denied access to a wide range of services, and only the well-off will be able to access the justice system. The undersigned petitioners therefore ask the House of Representatives to calion the Federal Government to protect every Australian's right to equal access to the justice system by continuing to fund Legal Aid at its pre-election level. by Mr Albanese (from 250 citizens). Rental Assistance: Shared Accommodation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of the State of NSW points out to the House that the new maximum rate of Rent Assistance for some single people sharing accommodation (introduced from 1 July 1997) has adversely affected age pensioners and many other people who rely on Rent Assistance in order to survive. Many social security recipients and age pensioners cannot afford to continue to live in areas where they have spent all their lives due to the decreases in Rent Assistance. The legislation does not take into account the fact that rental costs in inner Sydney are vastly more expensive than in other parts of the country. This discriminates against social security recipients who live in inner Sydney. Furthermore, the legislation assumes that great financial advantage is received by those who 'share' accommodation. This is not the case. Many social security recipients are in shared accommodation due to financial necessity. They are forced to share a bathroom, kitchen facilities or bedroom. The Government is hurting the people who need help most. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House revokes the changes to Rent Assistance to Sharers as outlined in the August 1996 Budget and allow age pensioners and social security recipients to enjoy dignity and security. by Mr Albanese (from 64 citizens). Legal Aid Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Sydney calls to to the attention of the house that the proposal to allow nursing homes to charge an entry free or bond discriminates against the most vulnerable frail and sick members of our community. Your petitioners therefore request that the House forthwith abandon such proposals to permit the introduction of nursing home entry fees and to immediately restore full funding for capital assistance to nursing homes. by Mr Albanese (from 28 citizens). Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: 1. the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and in particular Hinchinbrook Island, Gould Island and the Hinchinbrook Channel are threatened by; the activities of Cardwell Properties (the developers of the Port Hinchinbrook tourist and marina complex) at Oyster Point near Cardwell, NQ; a proposed pearl farm and marina complex at Dungeness; and aqua farms on the Hinchinbrook Channel. 2. the Hinchinbrook area is a unique and irreplaceable wilderness judged as World Heritage by the global community. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: 1. (and in particular Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment) immediately take action pursuant to World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 to prevent any further activities which threaten the above World Heritage area. 2. urgently consider the purchase of the Oyster Point site and alternatives appropriate to the World Heritage area and issue a proclamation over the whole Hinchinbrook area to ensure its protection for all future generations of the global community. by Mr Anthony (from 127 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that approximately 8,000 bears are being kept in cages in China for the purpose of extracting bile for medical purposes and that the cages are so small the bears cannot move, which results in some of them going mad. It is further brought to the attention of the House that the Chinese plan to increase the number of bears, for these purposes, to 40,000. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to object most strongly to this horrendous and tragic practice and ask that steps be taken to stop it immediately. by Mr Eoin Cameron (from 1,476 citizens). Logging and Woodchipping . To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. For permanent protection of old-growth forests and all other areas of high conservation value, and for the implementation of tree plantation strategies. This petition from the undersigned respectfully points out that: there is an increasing and urgent demand from the people, to protect all remaining high conservation value forests which support flora and fauna unique to Australia, thus complying with the United Nations Biodiversity Convention to which Australia is a signatory. We have a responsibility to future and present generations, and the necessary reasons, knowledge and technology to act now on the following achievable solutions. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives legislate to: immediately stop all logging and woodchipping activities in high conservation value native forests; ensure intergenerational equity by planning for the rights of future generations, and protecting in perpetuity all biologically diverse old-growth forests, wilderness, rainforests and critical habitats of endangered species; facilitate rapid transition from harvesting high conservation value native forests, to establishing mixed-species farm forestry on existing cleared and degraded lands, using non-toxic methods to protect ecological sustainability; maximise use of readily-available plantation timber for industry needs, using appropriate forestry techniques and progressive minimalwaste processing methods, such as radial sawing, and wherever possible, reuse and recycle wood and paper products; Bears support incentives for nationwide employment in composting, soil remineralisation programs, and the planting programs of trees and annual fibre crops, inter-grown with appropriate fruit and nut trees and medicinal plants; encourage sensitively-managed, environmental education tourism in appropriate forest areas, with full respect for natural ecosystems, Aboriginal cultural heritage, sacred sites and other sites of significance; and progressively utilise technological expertise and resources transferred from the military sector, to help implement these tree planting solutions; and to motivate the international community to follow this example. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Dr Lawrence (from 628 citizens). Medicare Office: Rockdale To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of the electorate of Barton calls to the attention of the House that the proposed closure of Rockdale Medicare will cause hardship to many families and significantly affect local commerce. Your petitioners therefore request that the House abandon such proposals and allow Rockdale Medicare to remain open. by Mr MCClelland (from 68 citizens). Tasmania: Pulp and Paper To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the State of Tasmania draws to the attention of the House the importance of the forest industry and the production of forest products on the North West Coast of Tasmania. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: 1. Recognise the vital importance of the pulp and paper industry to the residents of the north-West of the timber industry Coast of Tasmania. 2. Be aware of the crisis facing the industry due to the dumping of paper from overseas countries. 3. Take any action possible to prevent the entry into Australia of dumped paper from overseas countries. 4. Note the importance of jobs in regional Australia, especially those areas with high prevailing levels of unemployment. by Mr Miles (from 346 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need to support the textile, clothing and footwear industries of Australia and protect the jobs of over 100,000 workers, their families, communities and associated industries. Your petitioners request that the House reject proposals by the Industry Commission to reduce tariffs and instead freeze tariffs and encourage the development of a viable Australian industry. by Mr Moore (from 215 citizens). ATSIC Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens to the attention of the House that with the massive reduction in funding to ATSIC in the 1996-97 Budget and the restrictions placed upon ATSIC in allocating funding, the process of 'reconciliation' has stalled. 'Reconciliation' can only be achieved when Indigenous Australians regain the fundamental human right of being able to control their own destiny. Your petitioners therefore request the House to return to ATSIC the funds that have been withdrawn and to abolish the restrictions that have been plac('d upon ATSIC. by Mr Allan Morris (from 18 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of the Newcastle region draws to the attention of the House a statement hereon, supported by Newcastle community and church leaders, in support of our diverse community. 1. Newcastle, is a community rich in diversity-a community which celebrates the contribution of men and women from diverse ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. As a city we affirm that such diversity has contributed to the vital and positive life-style which is enjoyed by everyone in our region. We are proud of the ""social mix"" which creates cohesion in our community. We welcome all peoples to our region, regardless of race, colour or creed. 2. We understand that some in the community are apprehensive about their employment prospects, others are anxious about crime and violence and many people are under considerable emotional stress. We believe that recognising and understanding these difficulties can help to unite us. Tariffs We call upon all our community to protect the democratic rights of freedom of speech and the need to treat each other with respect and accept our individual dignity. 3. We encourage all fellow Australians to recognise the place of Newcastle in the world scene. We call upon the citizens of Newcastle to be outward looking and responsive to the needs of those less fortunate than ourselves. As a Nation we have committed ourselves to develop a framework for relating to each other and that is marked by a strong sense of cohesion and mutual respect for our differences. All are offered equality of esteem and community services. All are offered a place of belonging. We believe this to be a social contract that must be defended and protected in the name of God's justice and a truly democratic society. Your petitioners therefore ask the house to actively promote all of the above principles to all of Australia draws Australians. by Mr Allan Morris (from 11 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Radio 2KPTR To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House changes to the programme which is heard on ABC Radio 2KPTR on the Mid North Coast on Saturday mornings between Sam and lOam. This was a very popular radio programme which included local pioneer interviews, local recording artists Newcastle and country music as well as 'adult contemporary' music. The country music segment was popular with many listeners tuning in only for that part of the programme between 9 and 10. Since the changes were made there have been many complaints to both ABC Radio in Sydney and the ABC office at Kempsey about the content of the new format. Replies given to these complaints have been highly unsatisfactory. We think it is unfair to have relayed interviews and very 'different' music content. We would expect that proper surveys would have been carried out on the Mid North Coast so people have some chance to express their interest. Your petitioners therefore request the house to have the ABC reverse its decision and reinstate this popular programme in its original format. by Mr Nehl (from 227 citizens). Medicare Office: Deer Park To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of the State of Victoria draws attention of the House the opposition in the Deer Park community and surrounding areas to the proposal by the Howard Government to close the Deer Park Medicare Office. The Deer Park Medicare Office carries out an essential service to a large area of the Western suburbs of Melbourne. It allows convenient and local access for Medicare users who are unable to travel to other more distant offices for immediate processing of their claims, or who require for budgeting purposes ready access to cash rebates. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House urge the Government to urgently review this decision, and allow the Deer Park Medicare Office to remain open. by Mr O'Keefe (from 225 citizens). Second Sydney Airport: Badgerys Creek To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain citizens of Western Sydney draws to the attention of the House proposals to allow an airport to be built in Badgery's Creek. This would have devastating effects on health, children's education, property values and the environment. Your petitioners therefore request the House to abandon plans to build an airport at Badgery's Creek.  Medicare Office: Mount Droitt To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Western Sydney calls to the attention of the House that proposed closure of Mt Druitt Medicare will cause hardship to many battling families. Your petitioners therefore request that the House forthwith abandon such proposals and allow Mt Druitt Medicare to remain open.  Medicare Office: Wynnum Central To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of Bowman draws to the attention of the House the need for a Medicare Branch in Wynnum Central. Petitioners are therefore asking the House to support the moves, the office be maintained in its present capacity. by Mrs West (from 1,705 citizens). Legal Aid To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned draws the attention of the House the great disadvantage to the people of Australia by the severe cuts to Legal Aid. Your petitioners therefore request: That the House call on the Federal Government to maintain a fair and just system of Legal Aid. by Mr Williams (from 16 citizens). Petitions received. NA Older Motor Vehicles",63
264,Mr MCCLELLAND,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Barton) (4.29 p.m.)I move: That this House: (1) acknowledges the increasing environmental and safety problems posed by old worn-out motor vehicles; (2) recognises that the removal of older motor vehicles from our roads would reduce pollution such as lead and other pollutants by increasing the proportion of vehicles using unleaded fuel and fitted with catalysts; (3) recognises that older vehicles are involved in proportionally more road accidents and that the removal of older vehicles from our roads would have substantial community benefits and health costs savings; and (4) recommends a reduction in wholesale sales tax on motor vehicles which would: (a) add between 150,000 to 200,000 new vehicles to the market per annum; (b) give a substantial boost to vehicle and component manufacturing with a substantial impact on employment in those industries; (c) give a substantial boost to employment in vehicle distribution retailing and wholesaling; (d) increase State revenues through stamp duty and registration increases; and (e) make better quality motor vehicles more affordable to average Australians due to the ""trickle down"" effect as new vehicles enter the top of the market. Put simply, older cars cause unnecessary death and injury and too much pollution. I was motivated to move this motion as a result of a reply to a question on notice which I received from the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) on 17 June 1997 advising me that the government did not have any policy or program directed towards removing older vehicles from the road. The average age of the 11 million motor vehicles on the Australian fleet is now 10.6 years, which is one of the highest in the developed world. Clearly, something needs to be done about the scrapping of old cars. In the late 1970s, around 25 per cent of cars on the road were more than 10 years old. Today, more than 55 per cent of cars are more than 10 years old. It is more than twice that of situation in Europe, and in Australia it is growing at two per cent a year. Carbon dioxide emissions, which are the single largest source of greenhouse gases from transport, rose from 51.7 million tonnes in 1980 to 68 million tonnes in 1993. World Bank figures show that one-fifth of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere arising from human activity arises from motor vehicles as do one-third of fluorocarbons and half of nitrogen oxides. Research by the University of Melbourne has shown that more than half the pollution arising from cars is caused by just 12 per cent of cars. British research suggests that a 10-year old car, even if it is well maintained, is four times greater tion than a newer car. Newer cars have been fitted with catalytic converters since 1986 as well as other fuel use restrictions. In my electorate of Barton I have a firm-one of the industry leaderscalled Johnson Matthey, which is at the forefront of developing this technology. The technology is the reason that newer cars are far less likely to pollute. The fact that older cars are on the road means that 1.7 billion litres of fuel is used each year above that which is necessary, worth about $1.2 billion every year. In addition to carbon dioxide, road traffic causes lead pollution together with nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons, all of which cause significant health problems, including asthma. There is evidence that they contribute to the development of cancers and, of course, lead pollution is a very significant issue among our children and our youth. In terms of lead per capita, Australia has the worse levels in the industrial world and has done the least about it. There are 400,000 children in Australia who have unacceptably high levels of lead in their blood. In New South Wales alone, more than 100,000 children state wide have lead contaminated blood levels above the national safety level. Some 40,000 children under the age of four in Sydney and up to 71,000 children state wide have lead contaminated blood levels above the national standard of 10 microns per decilitre. To repeat, just 12 per cent of mainly older the cars cause more than 50 per cent of motor vehicle exhaust pollution. That represents a major environmental and health problem which cannot be underestimated. In terms of safety, according to recent research, the chances of a fatality are twice as great in a car more than 13 years old than in a car which is less than six years old. A study by the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority has found that 17 per cent of road fatalities, equating to 250 lives and 3,000 injuries every year, could be prevented; that is, they would not have occurred, if older cars were as safe as newer cars. Those fatalities and injuries represent not only personal tragedies but a tremendous drain on the health in its polluresources of our nation. In the period from 1989 to 1995 significant gains in the crash worthiness of cars have occurred. Accordingly, there have been significant reductions in major injuries and deaths, by about 30 per cent since 1989. That represents an annual saving in pure health costs of $2 billion per year. All cars today must comply with numerous design rules which contribute to their safety. There is no question that unnecessary and preventable death and injury are occurring every week, indeed, every day, because of unsafe older cars on our roads. The cost burden, let alone the human tragedy, more than justifies taking action. In terms of incentives to remove cars from our roads, there have been numerous media commentaries of steps being taken in many European countries to provide cash for clunkers as a means of inducing people to tum over their older motor vehicles. It is a matter which a number of newspapers have taken up and it is pleasing to see that issue being raised in such an informative way. But I favour a reduction in sales tax rather than a cash return for clunkers primarily because it may well be that only those who have sufficient cash resources would be able to take advantage of the cash for clunkers return because it is only those with the surplus cash or savings who would be able to go out and purchase a new vehicle. The reduction in price which would flow from the overall reduction in sales tax would have a trickle down effect, whereby the lower price of newer cars would trickle down through the overall market, making better cars and newer cars more affordable for low income earners. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries is also arguing strongly for a reduction in sales tax, together with some other measures such as safety inspections and the like states other than New South Wales. They are strongly arguing for a reduction in level, which is 22 per cent. By inflating the price of vehicles, sales tax obviously reduces affordability. For instance, with respect to a Ford Falcon, I understand that the 22 per cent sales tax adds about $4,000 to the The Productivity Commission' recently estimated that sales tax, stamp duty and registration combined make up about 17 per cent, or $5,271, of the cost of an average new Ford Falcon. Rover Australia has provided me with information that suggests that a reduction in sales tax from just 22 per cent to 12 per cent would expand the demand for cars by about 120,000 to about 150,000 units per year-a very significant increase indeed. In 1992, the federal government, primarily as a result of the recession in manufacturing in that period, reduced sales tax from 20 per cent, as it was in 1992, to 15 per cent. That appeared to have a significant effect in increasing new motor vehicle sales despite the inflationary pressures. That sales tax figure was increased again in May 1995, as the economy started to pick up, back to 22 per cent. I am arguing that it should now be reduced not just for economic reasons but for significant environmental and safety reasons. By increasing the turnover of new vehicles, additional revenue would flow from increased volumes, and state governments would also receive additional funding through stamp duty and registration fees. Indeed, it may well be that the federal government should negotiate with the states to share that burden across the board. There is no doubt that increasing new vehicle sales would give a substantial boost to the vehicle and component manufacturing industry with a substantial impact on employment in those industries. Similarly, it would substantially induce employment in the vehicle distribution, retailing and wholesaling industries, which contribute significantly to the national economy. On balance, the increase in revenue due to the greater turnover of vehicles would substantially offset the revenue loss which would result from a reduction on sales tax on motor vehicles, and the measure would have obvious in and significant benefits to the environment, to public health and of course significantly to the present reducing road casualties.",67
265,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded? Mr O'Connor-I' second the motion and total price. reserve my right to speak.,69
266,Mr MCDOUGALL,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Griffith) (4.39 p.m.)Any actions by this House to improve road safety and the quality of the air we breathe has my support, but I question whether the call by the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) to simply remove older motor vehicles from our roads is the answer. Many people simply cannot afford new cars. In fact, I find it a sad commentary on Labor's link with people that the member for Barton could seriously propose such a coercive measure, a measure which would impact most heavily on the poor. Drivers cause accidents, not cars. And accidents are certainly not restricted to old cars. Department of Transport and Regional Development figures show that brand new cars have roughly the same fatality rates as others. There is no doubt that new vehicles come with higher safety standards, but a modem vehicle in a head-on collision at 65 kilometres an hour, even with air bags, will provide little hope for survival for the occupants. Car owners can also make a dramatic change to the levels of air pollution and emissions. The Federal Office of Road Safety has conducted a survey exactly on this subject. This report reveals we would reduce air pollution and emissions by up to 50 per cent simply by ensuring all vehicles are subjected to regular and simple engine tuning. By simple engine tuning, I refer to the regular service as laid down in every car manual. If every car owner maintained their vehicle to the required standard, the savings in fuel alone would be up to $200 million a year. This national study examined 650 vehicles and found that, indeed, cars between 10and 16-years-old made the greatest contribution total pollution. But-and there is a big butregime high polluting vehicles were found in cars all ages. Therefore, caring for our existing fleet would have better results in reducing pollution in the short term than so-called emission vehicles. The member for Barton will no doubt argue his party stands for social equity. I argue that this government has done more to facilitate entry of new vehicles into the market by providing a record low interest regime than Labor ever did. When interest rates rocketed to more than 17 per cent under Keating, upgrading the family car was put on the backburner by thousands of Australian famifor lies. The member for Barton calls for a reduction in wholesale sales tax on motor vehicles. This government has made it clear: we are not in the business of sticking even more patches on a tax system that needs to be totally rebuilt. The opposition acknowledged this nation needed total and complete tax reform but typically did nothing about it. This government is set on a course to establish a fair and equitable system for Australians. This includes programs to get young Australians off the dole queues and into work. As we have seen since we took currently government, 9,000 apprenticeships went begging last year and among the hardest vacancies to fill were as motor mechanics. is not drawing a long bow to say that we literally have to teach our young people read and write so they can take on the modem apprenticeships that are available. Therefore, in answer to the member for Barton's move to remove older vehicles from our roads, I say it is a typical Labor simplistic solution. I do not believe it would make a dramatic change to either safety or pollution levels. Improving the standard of living for Australians on low incomes is far more likely to achieve these goals, and this is what this government is all about.",69
267,Mr OCONNOR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I would like to take up some of the points that have been put to this House by the honourable member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall) into this debate. He cites the low interest rate at the moment as a potential stimulus of to the consumption of cars. I remind the car honourable member that that low interest rate regime could be achieved only because the zero previous Labor government broke the back of an inflation rate of 10 per cent which was left to us by his leader when he was Treasurer. The honourable member makes the suggestion that what the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) is proposing is a simplistic solution to the problem of the ageing car fleet in Australia and the safety and environmental issues that stem from that. Let me point out to the honourable member Griffith that, if he would take the opportunity to read the submissions by major car companies to the recent Industry Commission's inquiry into the motor vehicle industry in this country, he would know that almost all of those mentioned this particular proposal of lowering the age of the Australian car park as dismantled and a key proposal. I commend the member for Barton for bringing this matter to the attention of the House today. Matters relating to automobile use and the car industry are of particular all interest to me as the member for Corio. I have a major car manufacturer, Ford Australia, in my electorate with around 2,700 people employed in that facility and another 1,000 employed in car component production. In a highly competitive international and It domestic car market, there are many factors that contribute to the survival of automotive to manufacturing in not only my electorate but the nation as well. Factors include a continued investment in new technologies, investment in training and education to improve the skills the automotive work force, increased expenditure on research and development by the major car companies, and reductions in costs. These are all important to the competitiveness of individual firms. But there is one factor external to car manufacturing companies that has a direct bearing on their costs and their profitability, and that is simply demand for cars. One overall factor contributing to this demand is the decision of consumers as to when to trade in their older cars for new ones. Therefore, the age of the Australian car park is important to any consideration of the future of car manufacturing in Australia. The statistics tell us that Australians are holding on to their cars for longer. The average age of cars in 1971 was 6.1 years; in 1997 it is now 10.6. We are a nation in love with, and very dependent on, the car for our everyday economic and social needs. Australia ranks fifth in world car ownership: there are around 10.6 million vehicles on our roads and over 12 million drivers who collectively travel more than 164 million kilometres each year. The importance of the motor industry to the economy cannot be overstated either, with 215,000 people employed in 37,600 establishments with a turnover of $143.7 billion and an average annual wages bill of $3.6 billion. But our dependence on car transport, the level of car usage and the age of the car fleet bring with them considerable social and environmental problems, as outlined by the member for Barton. For example, road accidents remain one of the most common causes of preventable death in Australia, and older cars tend to be less safe than new ones. So the age of our car park is important to this broad issue of road safety and road trauma. The ageing of the car fleet is a matter of environfactor: mental significance as well. Older cars tend to be less efficient in their consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels and cause greater air pollution in congested urban environments. So the honourable member's motion is a timely one indeed. It echoes sentiments I expressed to this House in a recent speech on the Australian car industry in which I outlined of the industry's problem with the ageing of the car fleet and recommended, as has the honourable member for Barton, a lowering of the wholesale sales tax as a means of lowering the price of new cars and bringing them within the price range of ordinary consumers. Stronger overall demand for locally produced cars will also deliver cost benefits in the way of better economies of scale which, in turn, will translate into reduced prices for consumers. In conclusion, once again I express my support for the proposal put to this House by the honourable member for Barton to lower the age of the Australian car park. It will lower the price of vehicles to consumers and stimulate demand, address key elements of safety issues relating to cars and also go a long way towards addressing environmental issues.

268,Mr LLOYD,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am surprised that a member of the Labor Party sitting opposite would put forward a motion to remove older cars from Australian roads. A member who purports to support the views of the battlers and the people who are struggling has put forward a fairly simplistic view: just remove the older cars from the roads of Australia and let everyone buy new cars and reduce sales tax in order to make those new cars cheaper. But new cats are still very expensive and far beyond the reach of many of those battlers whom the Labor Party supposedly represents, and that is why many of those battlers have chosen to support us over the years. The government acknowledges the environmental problems that can arise from older, illmaintained motor vehicles. We also recognise that the states need to look at measures to ensure that owners of older vehicles maintain them correctly. I think that is a very important that older vehicles, if they are maintained correctly and serviced on a regular basis, certainly do not increase pollution to any great extent. Some of this monitoring could involve the state governments investigating a number of options, including requiring regular vehicle emISSIOn tests and extending the current registration checks, the pink slip checks, to include tests on emission levels for older motor vehicles. It is my understanding that such testing requirements are currently being considered by the governments of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. In addition, as with any vehicle, if older motor vehicles are tuned and maintained correctly, as I have said, to makers' specifications, the potential for environmental and safety problems is reduced. The government is also committed to the phasing out of leaded petrol. This will certainAustralia's ly be done in a gradual and constructive way, giving those people who are driving older vehicles that run on leaded petrol the opportunity of gradually being able to upgrade to a vehicle that runs on unleaded petrol, ·rather than just saying suddenly that all leaded vehicles have to be removed· from the road. The gradual removal of lead fuelled vehicles from our roads is a process which requires extensive community consultation, when you consider there are a number of factors that have to be considered. In Australia the average age of the car fleet is about 9.8 years, and about 52 per cent of all our vehicles are over 10 years of age. It would be very simplistic just to say, 'Well, we'll remove all those older cars from the road tomorrow.' Obviously the vast majority of the people in my electorate could not afford just to grab some money off the money tree and go and buy a new car. I do have to support the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall) that the high interest rates resulting from Labor's mismanagement in the 1980s certainly made the possibility of upgrading a car almost impossible for most of the battlers in my electorate and, I suspect, many other electorates. Running interest rates of 17 per cent, sometimes up to 22 or 23 per cent, on a hire-purchase agreement for a vehicle made it impossible to upgrade to a newer vehicle, and that certainly reflects on some of the vehicles still on the road today. In some areas it might be that only about 13 per cent of the vehicles are under 10 years of age, the majority of which are still running on leaded fuel. The battlers who are running these cars certainly cannot afford replacements, and in some cases other forms of transport such as public transport, the buses and trains, are not available or may not be practical. The honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) mentioned in his motion that a reduction in the sales tax would make new vehicles cheaper and would enable people to upgrade to new vehicles. The government does not deny that there would be environmental advantages in lowering the age of vehicle fleet. We would be very pleased to see that done and the subsequent reduction in the number of vehicles on leaded fuel. But a possible reduction in the wholesale sales tax must be considered in the light of the government's intention for tax reform. The opposition obviously does not recognise that the tax system we have now is outdated and unworkable. Only recently, speaking in parliament, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) highlighted the objectives of this government's tax reforms. Our taxation reform proposals will give the Australian community, the business community and the ordinary taxpayers of Australia a modem, fair, incentive driven system that will promote jobs, attract investment and free the exporters of Australia from the crippling burden of an old-fashioned, ramshackle tax system. (Time expired)",71
269,Mr MCCLELLAND,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Barton) (4.53 p.m.)by leave-I rise to address some of the matters raised. At no stage have I advocated in my motion a compulsory acquisition or authoritarian order directing people to tum their old cars in as if they were firearms. That is not the thrust of my motion at all. My in argument is to make vehicles cheaper by reducing the wholesale sales tax on those vehicles. That would not be an advantage only to people who have the funds available to purchase a new car; by reducing the cost of new cars, in particular for business fleets, those cars would be turned over in much the same way as DAS cars are turned over every two years, or at 40,000 kilometres, and they would be available on the market for people on. lower incomes to purchase at cheaper prIces. Sales tax of 22 per cent adds about $4,000 to the cost of a new Ford. If you roughly have that and you are taking $2,000 off the cost of a new Ford, it is going to have a similar effect on the cost of used vehicles, albeit newer used vehicles that have been made since 1986, at which time, I mentioned, catalytic converters became compulsory. But I should have added that at that time all new cars are required to run on unleaded fuel. So there is a very significant environmental reason for getting people in cars, certainly from pre-1986 to post 1986",72
270,Mr LLOYD,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,You would get a better result if you reform the. whole tax system.,73
271,Mr MCCLELLAND,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"If it is done in the context of reforms to the overall tax system on the government's agenda, of necessity that must wait for another 18 months. Within that 18-month period, according to research, 200 people will have been killed unnecessarily and 3,000 people will have been maimed in accidents that need not have occurred. I suppose those figures may well assume that automatically all the old cars are going to be taken off the road and that would not occur. Obviously it would be over a period of time. Further, we are pumping literally thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and people are unnecessarily being killed and injured because of older cars on the road. If we wait that, in all likelihood, at 12-month period, those health and safety consequences are going to flow. If I can put it in this context: there is a significant controversy, as indicated today in question time, as to how Australia is going to cope with the climate control treaty which is being negotiated in the international community between now and the end of the year. We should remember this: about 13 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions from human use in Australia come from motor vehicles, be they trucks or cars. About four per cent is due to the commercial fleet and about nine per cent come from cars. If just 12 per cent of cars are causing in excess of 50 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions and you have that percentage-that is, by taking the bulk of those 12 per cent of cars off the road-you are halving greenhouse gas emissions from nine per cent to 4.5 per cent. That is itself a significant contributor to Australia complying with its international obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is one very simple step that could be taken that would make an immediate and significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I am astounded that the government members opposed my motion. They can rest assured that I will be forwarding their comments to those involved in the industry.",73

273,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House recognises the adverse effects of gambling on society in general and on the small b-siness sector in particular and takes steps to discourage State governments from expanding gambling as a means of raising revenue. I move this motion because I feel very strongleast ly about the impact that gaming and gambling are having on our society. I was told only last week of a lady who lost $600,000 over a weekend. The effect that this had on her family can only be imagined by those of us who do not suffer from or have a member of our family who suffers from compulsive gambling problems. While living in Western Queensland I saw among rural workers men working incredibly hard for very large pay packets. People would say, 'They'll be wealthy men soon,' but so many of these men would work year after year and still have very little in the way of financial reserves. Some spent the money on alcohol but for others it was the races or some form of gambling. I remember one family which was in a managerial position on a property. No-one in the family used alcohol to excess. The income earning head of the family was a gambler. The stories of the big wins were told to everyone; they were spellbinding and they really inspired the young people. But, in spite of these incredible wins at the races, there was still poverty for that family and the grind of hard work all the way. Now, some 20 years later, I have met with some of the grandchildren. These people are still struggling against poverty and an unmanageable life. In Australia we have 14 casinos, gaming machines in hotels and clubs, TAB betting, 'instant scratch-it type lotteries, on-line Keno from local clubs and hotels to the casino, horse racing every day of the week and various raffles from any charities that are looking for our support. Increasingly, gaming and gambling in Australia are seducing John and Joan Aussie to forsake traditional values of mateship, fair go, neighbourliness, honesty, generosity, philanthropy and honest venture that have been the traditional and growing part of an ethic that shaped our society in great south land since 1788 until recently. Gambling combined with television has brought about more significant changes in our society than did the introduction of television itself. The introduction of television diminished the traditional role of the family in society. Following the introduction of television, time taken for viewing reduced the time for family interaction, social interaction, household tasks, church attendance, radio listening, reading and other entertainment. Gambling is bringing about a loss of many positive values related to the family and the neighbourly concern of the forgotten needy. A belief that individuals are powerless and helpless is being propagated among the masses as people spend more and more of their accumulated wealth and income on gambling, hoping to luck themselves into a more financially comfortable future. This vision and effort to plan, save and invest to shape a personal, family and national destiny is being left to mindless chance and fickle luck. Small business is suffering as individuals and families divert more and more funds to gaming and gambling. There is less money to be spent in the community on goods and services. There is less in these gambling families for necessities such as food, and sometimes people begin to commit crime. Therefore, insurance, security and bad debts become a cost. They fall most heavily on the small stand-alone businesses. The loss to these business people is disproportionately high, particularly if stock or cash is stolen. Another unseen factor is the effect on family businesses. They suffer more from gambling related crime because a high proportion of gambling related crime is intra-family crime. Small family businesses often face business failure because of the gaming and gambling of one family member, partner or trusted staff. Gambling related crime occurs under the categories of fraud, confidence trips, theft, shoplifting and intra-family crime. This, of course, is rarely reported. To help correct this situation, I believe that state governments should offer support to their gaming machine licence holders by making five per cent of gaming turnover this available to assist gambling problems. One per cent of this should be used for counselling and 1.5 per cent should be used for community education and advertising. This advertising would include warnings for people who have a problem with irresponsible gaming and gambling so that they would be able to identify themselves and make it easier for them and their families to find help. A free help line should be available for problem gamblers, and the community must be educated about responsible leisure and responsible gambling. (Time expired)",73
274,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Forrest)Is there a seconder for the motion? Miss Jackie Kelly-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,74
275,Dr LAWRENCE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Fremantle) (5.05 p.m.)I think it is important that we recognise that Australia has been for a long time a nation of heavy gamblers. This is not something that has just happened in the last few years. Indeed, Australia is the world leader-it is not something we can be proud of-in gambling expenditure per capita. At the tum of the century, a visitor to Australia described Australians as 'devoted to gambling and incapable of hard work'. I would have to say that I do not agree with the latter sentiment, but certainly devoted to gambling we are and have been. Gambling has always occupied a fairly equivocal position in our national life. It attracts massive public participation but there is also, I am pleased to say, continuous criticism on moral, social and economic grounds. Earlier, gambling taxes were used to finance essential social services and community infrastructure. That is still largely true in my own state of Western Australia. But recently there has been a change from that position. It has also been used as a method to control illegal gambling. In most cases in the past at least governments owned and operated most gambling outlets. As I have hinted, since the 1970s and particularly the early 1990s, we have seen a change. The paramount social concerns which guided Australian gambling policy in the past have been replaced by more 'pure' economic considerations. We have seen privatisation of existing and new forms of gambling, we have seen the incorporation of gambling into regional economic development strategies, we have seen the linking of casinos and tourism, we have seen a growing dependence of state governments, particularly on gambling revenues, and we have seen much more aggressive marketing and promotion of gambling in this country. We have also seen increasing competition between the states and regions for their market share of this new 'industry'. Gambling is still highly controversial economic activity, it is susceptible still to crime and corruption and, as we have heard, it really does confront core social values of thrift and reward for effort-and it always has. I am reminded of a quote from Paul Samuelson, the distinguished Nobel Prize winning economist. He said: There is a substantial economic case to be made against gambling. It involves simply sterile transfamilies fers of money or goods between individuals, creating no new money or goods. Although it creates no output, gambling does nevertheless absorb time and resources. When pursued beyond the limits of recreation . .. gambling subtracts from the national income. A sentiment that can be endorsed from the evidence. It is important for us to recognise that gambling taxes have risen from nine per cent of total states' own revenue in 1991-92 to 10.7 per cent in 1995-96. It is a significant and rising share of states' revenues. All states except Western Australia have had an increase in the ratio of gambling taxes to revenue since 1991-92. Victoria and the ACT have depended on gambling taxes for 20 per cent or more of the increase in revenue over that time. Victoria, as many have commented, has the highest dependence on gambling taxes at present. Rises in gambling taxes have far exceeded other tax increases in recent years. While I endorse the sentiment in this motion, I do see some hypocrisy in the government member trying to discourage state governments from expanding gambling as a means of raising revenue. One of the reasons they are put in this position is that they have had big cuts in financial assistance grants to the states-some $1.5 billion at the last tum-and big decreases in special purpose payments and programs have been cut back. So they have had to rely on gambling taxes to a greater extent, although some have done it with a great deal more enthusiasm than others, particularly in Victoria. The important thing to note is that expenditure on gambling as a proportion of household expenditure has been growing, with most of the growth attributable to gaming, particularly in casinos. 'Total gambling expenditure', as it is politely called-in other words, lossesby individuals and families reached $9.6 billion in 1995-96, of which $1.8 billion was in casinos. Most of this money comes from people in blue-collar occupations and on low incomes. It is a transfer of wealth from the poorest in our community to the richest. Many will be well aware of the social problems associated with gambling. They are many and varied. All of us have seen some very sad cases, ranging from the breakup of through to suicides. It is important to recognise that we have not yet properly assessed the cost of gambling in this community. If the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and others are really concerned, I urge the government to ask these questions: how much is the increased call on welfare services costing; how much are the crime related costs; what is the cost to family members whose breadwinners stop bringing home the essentials due to gambling problems; what is the cost of the increase in suicide rates? And so on. We need a decent social impact statement from this government. (Time expired) Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (5.10 p.m.)-It is important that this House recognises the adverse effects of gambling on society in general. Some US estimates claim that one to six per cent of people are addictive or problem gamblers, that these people provide some 20 per cent of casino revenue, and that it is usually these people and their families who suffer the economic and social consequences of such gambling. On the one hand, you could say gambling is going to occur anyway so government may as well gain some revenue from it. This has been the case in New South Wales where the clubs have been set up to legitimately operate poker machines and other forms of gaming. They are entitled to spend their revenue in one of three ways: to widen facilities, to put into reserves to be spent locally or to make donations to local sporting and community organisations. In that way what could be classed as the social evil of gaming is generating community value. A case in point is Panthers. For a long time Penrith has had no accommodation and no main areas of entertainment. Penrith Panthers and the community got together and provided for the community anything that Penrith wanted or lacked, well in advance of any commercial interests setting up that form of establishment or meeting social need in the area. The people of Penrith respect and support Panthers in a major way. They have built a fabulous establishment on 78 hectares next to the Nepean River. They have made immense donations over the past years to the Penrith Cricket Club, the Penrith Basketball Association, the Nepean Soccer and Football Association, the Penrith Panthers Soccer Club, the Penrith Panthers Cycling Club, the Penrith Touch Association and the Emu Plains Sporting Club. They have also made enormous contributions to local charities in the area. All of this is in danger from the New South Wales government grab for yet again more revenue from gaming. They seem to be supporting and promoting an interest in gaming from shareholders, where the profits from gaming can be returned overseas or, as the previous speaker-the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence)-stated, go back to the wealthier in society rather than be redistributed amongst the blue-collar worker who contributes mainly to gambling. A number of clubs in our area have been hit very badly by the Bob Carr poker taxnot just Panthers but the St Mary's Band Club, the Emu Plains Sporting Club, the Rooty Hill RSL, the Katoomba RSL, the Glenbrook Bowling Club and the Wentworthville Leagues Club have all been harshly cut. It is not 30 per cent of their general revenue that has been cut; it is 90 per cent of their profit. The Bob Carr government is demanding 90 of the community's profit from these gaming establishments. It was reported in the Age of 7 June 1997 that, on average, Australians are spending $708 per person per annum on gaming, an increase of $67 in the past year and a doubling in the past decade. In fact, a total of almost $10 billion was spent in 1996 on all forms of gambling-between three and four per cent of disposable household income. And we certainly have larger disposable incomes in Western Sydney because our rent is cheaper, and our lifestyle tends to include clubs, cigarettes and alcohol. We pay our fair amount of tax in that area, and for the Labor government in New South Wales to be demanding further tax in this instance seems to add insult to injury. I certainly support the Panthers in their endeavour to have this ridiculous tax revoked, which would allow them to go back to their primary goal of supporting their community and providing facilities in an area where government has failed to provide them in the last 13 years. It will allow them to be a ready sponsor of and contributor to the local community in supporting sporting efforts. It is something the clubs will be reminding the state government in New South Wales about at the coming state elections.",74
276,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"This private member's motion on gambling ought to be strongly supported by this House. It is particularly apt that it should be discussed in a Victorian context, because my state of Victoria under Premier Kennett has developed a gambling addiction. The state's finances are now heavily dependent on gambling revenues. Taxation revenue from electronic gaming machines, which has only commenced in the past five years, now amounts to $509 million, and is rising at such a rate that by the year 2000 gambling taxes will account for 15 per cent of the state's revenue base. There is scarcely a community in Victoria that has not felt the impact of Premier Kennett's gambling mania, and my electorate has seen some of the worse effects. The City of Moreland is deluged by machines, which grew in number from 690 last year to 800 this year, with more to come. For example, the Carlton Football Club, led by John Elliott, who does not live in the City of Moreland, is one of the culprits. Their avarice knows no bounds. They want to establish an 85 poker machine venue in Glenroy Road, Glenroy. That would have the effect, if successful, of putting the Glenroy RSL, which is situated directly opposite the road and has a few poker machines of its own, out of business. That would have a very adverse effect on the local community which the Glenroy RSL serves and has served very well for many years. Not content with the indirect threat, they are, I now learn, behind moves to have the Glenroy RSL's liquor licence revoked because the Glenroy RSL has had the temerity to challenge them in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and in other places, as I have done also. That is the kind of response we have had from Carlton to moves by Glenroy RSL to protect the local community. The net income per electronic gaming machine is currently in excess of $1,000 per week, which means that in the City of Moreland each year over $41 million is being run through these machines. It is not just Labor electorates that are suffering, although they get it worse. Liberal members in this place and in the Victorian parliament are feeling the rising heat of local discontent. At a recent Liberal Party state council meeting in Shepparton a number of backbenchers, backed by a substantial number of branch representatives, put forward two resolutions which rejected state Liberal government policies. Those resolutions concerned not only the independence of the Auditor-General but also the number of gaming machines in Victoria. The Premier has laughed off any suggestion he has been rebuked. Previously backbench revolt has been nipped in the bud by Jeff Kennett through sheer intimidation. I can recall the occasion when the state member for Tullamarine told his electorate he was going to stand up to the Premier on City Link tolls, but he left the party room a week later with his tail firmly between his legs. I am not so sure, however, that the Premier will be able to bluff and bully his way through this time. I have had it relayed to me that those within the Liberal Party who are appalled at Victoria's ever increasing gambling addiction under Premier Kennett are getting a better hearing from Deputy Liberal Leader Phil Gude, and that a certain amount of head counting is noW proceeding. Discontent within the Liberal Party has emerged because the Premier refuses to acknowledge the Victorian community's concerns about the impact his gaming policies are having on their lives. Only last Thursday more than 600 people attended a public meeting in Mount Waverley and, along with the mayor-a Liberal Party mayor-talked of how they will protest at the state's planning laws, which allow a lOS-machine gambling extravaganza to be established in a former supermarket, despite thousands of written objections. Imagine the disbelief of residents in that area, most of whom are lifelong Liberal supporters and voters, when they pick up their daily paper to read that the state government, not content to foist on them unwanted gambling developments, plans to introduce a procedure in which gaming licences will be granted even before a venue is selected. What have we got next for Victoria: poker machines in public toilets? In addition, in Victoria the probity checks and anti-corruption provisions simply do not work. The deputy chairman of the casino is Ron Walker, federal treasurer of the Liberal Party. US gaming officials are absolutely staggered to hear that Victoria has no restricfamily tion on casino operators being involved in political parties. What they say is that that would mean the casino would end up running your government. Tell us about it! Furthermore, major poker machine operators Lloyd Williams and Bruce Mathieson, of Guangdong shares fame-the man who mysteriously ended up with more poker machines than anyone else in Victoria-should not have passed the probity test. (Time expired) Mr mCKS (Riverina) (5.20 p.m.)-The mover of this private member's motion on gambling, the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), is extremely concerned about the social impact of gambling upon our society and spoke out on this issue in the House in February. On that occasion the member for MCPherson described gambling addiction as a family destroying affliction, and I believe many of us have seen evidence of this. He, along with many of his colleagues, including me, are convinced that gambling revenue, which is supposed to be raised for use to the benefit of the community, is a negative benefit when all the costs are added up. As gambling opportunities proliferate, more people gamble, people spend more on gambling and more people become addicted to it, some with disastrous results. I remember when I was a young apprentice I used to work with a number of men and one gentleman borrowed £5 off me. That is how old I am; it was £5. I gave it to him readily and then another friend came up and said, 'You shouldn't have done that because this man is a gambling addict. He gambles his money and then when he can't repay it he borrows off someone else. Then when he can't repay that he borrows off someone else. He is continually being belted up and he can't provide for his family,' et cetera. The sad thing about it is that, although I got my' £5 back, two months later this gentleman hanged himself. While suicide is a complex issue, everyone believed this gentleman's suicide was because of the terrible situation he was in. He could not stop gambling and there were all the terrible things he was doing to his family and to himself. In the end, apart from the personal or suffering, small business also suffers. Statistics reveal a huge increase in the money being spent on gambling. If the additional money that is being spent on gambling is not being spent on other goods and services, that has a negative impact on employment. The National Institute of Economic and Industry Research and Spiller Gibbins Swan Pty Ltd prepared a report for the Victorian Casino and Gaming Authority on the impact of increased gambling expenditure in Australia on the retail sector with particular emphasis on Victoria. The key finding is that increased gambling expenditure, along with expenditure on other retail goods and other services, contributed to a significant decline in national savings over the 1990s. If, as this report suggests, increased gambling expenditure contributed to the rundown in the savings ratio, the long term impacts on the retail sector and other sectors are much more severe than previously indicated. Total Australian expenditure on gambling increased from $4.5 billion in 1990 to $9.4 billion in 1996-in other words, in six years it doubled. Per capita gambling expenditure nearly doubled from $226 in 1990 to $517 in 1996--imagine that: $517 for every person in Australia spent on gambling. Gambling expenditure's share of total household expenditure in Australia increased by one per cent over the same period to 3.1 per cent in 1996. In Victoria, total gambling expenditure rose by $1.8 billion between 1990 and 1996 to reach $2.6 billion. Per capita expenditure on gambling in Victoria rose from $198 in 1990 to $581 in 1996 while the retail sector's share of total household outlays fell by 0.5 percentage points during the same period. You can see that someone is suffering in that equation. The report also revealed people are digging into their nest eggs to finance their gambling habits. The decline in household savings between 1990 and 1996 funded increased outlays on gambling, retail goods and other services in Australia and Victoria. National savings as a share of total household income declined from 6.7 per cent of income in 1990 to 2.5 per cent in 1996. The report shows that 18 per cent of gamblers used savings to gamble while almost 20 per cent had changed their spending patterns, especially on clothing, footwear, recreation and Tattslotto. An alarming fact is that exposure to gambling is occurring at very early ages. A survey conducted among young people in New South Wales by the Australian Council of Social Service revealed that 62 per cent of the samples under 10 years of age and more than 82 per cent of the samples under 13 years of age were exposed to some form of gambling. This exposure occurs within the family environment and within the context of family relationships with parents, grandparents, other relatives and sometimes family friends. The majority of youth in the sample from metropolitan and regional New South Wales are gambling with or without the compliance of adults on a range of different types of gambling and gaming services. However you look at it, gambling when unchecked can become an evil to which a solution has to be found, not only for the social welfare of those individually affected but also for the community and the nation.",77
277,Mr FILING,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The irony of all this is that the biggest addicts gambling are governments-state and federal. One of the problems that pushes state governments in particular into more and more gambling revenue is the vertical fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states, something which, in the past, drew the attention of members of the government who were critical of that when they were in opposition. For instance, I mentioned in a speech recently that I had listened with great interest to the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) talking about the problem of vertical fiscal imbalance faced by the states. She showed then that the past decade had witnessed a dramatic decline in payments by the Commonwealth to the state and territory governments. Commonwealth own purpose outlays rose by 11 per cent from 1983 to 1996 while total payments to the states and territories dropped 22 per cent as a proportion of government outlays, and this cut in revenue share was exacerbated by an increase in the proportion of tied grants. Under the circumstances back then, Labor had reduced the states' share of funding and simultaneously removed their flexibility in determining how their funds would be spent. The irony is that we have seen in that time an explosion in gambling, particularly in casino gambling, which is the largest form of gambling in Australia-and, of course, legal casinos are a relatively recent phenomenon. The interesting thing about casinos is that we have seen a conflict of interest between the states as the revenue beneficiaries, the people who are responsible for the supervision and also the licence granters for casino operators-virtually a licence to print money in some instances. I can recollect from the WA Inc. royal commission-and it was ironic listening to the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) because the government of which she was a minister in previous times had granted a casino licence to the Burswood Trust-that the subcommittee of cabinet that was given the responsibility of assessing the licence applicants was considered to have been heavily compromised. One of the people to actually making a submission to that subcommittee said that he felt it was a waste of time because they had already made their mind up and they were just going through the motions, and the then minister responsible for gaming, Peter Dowding, who later became the Premier of Western Australia and who had his feet under the table at the time, said, 'Compromise? You try being in this government!' He was in the then government of Brian Burke. The interesting thing is that that is not limited to Labor governments. We have seen instances in more recent times where that conflict of interest between the responsibility for supervision and the fact that the state government is a beneficiary of gambling revenue has led to situations where local police forces have made statements that they were handicapped in their attempts to identify some of the gamblers who were using the casino, in their view, to launder money. You do not have to be Albert Einstein to work out that, on any given day in any of the major casinos in Australia, people-particularly drug dealers-are circulating money that they have gained illicitly. The interesting thing is that, when I was a detective in the CIB in Western Australia, we arrested in a nightclub and charged with attempted rape a fellow who was carrying a nugget around his neck worth around $15,000 in those days-that would be worth a lot more now-and he had in his wallet about $6,000 or $7,000, which he proceeded to wave around to show off. That, in my view, was clearly revenue from drug dealing which had been down to the casino, circulated and brought back.",79
278,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Mr Forrest)Order! The time allotted for private members business has expired. The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. As the honourable member was interrupted, he will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Kalejs, Mr Konrad",80
279,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is a matter of public knowledge that in my electorate of Melbourne Ports there are many constituents who are Holocaust survivors. They carry with them, almost on a daily basis, the grieving and sense of loss of loved ones who were degraded and murdered on the basis of their race or religion. I ask the parliament to try to understand their feelings when a war criminal, after due legal processes, is excluded from the United States of America on the grounds of his involvement, participation and role in the mass executions of men, women and children of the Jewish faith in Latvia during the war. I speak, of course, of Konrad Kalejs, who is now back in Melbourne enjoying the rights of Australian citizenship. I seek leave to table the decision of the United States Court of Appeal of the seventh circuit, which dealt with the appeal Kalejs following a decision of the board of immigration. Leave granted.",80
280,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Let me just shortly state the attitude taken by the court. They said: ... Kalejs was ordered deported in 1988 to Australia, the country he designated. He is an Australian citizen. The order of deportation was based on KaJejs's assistance in Nazi persecution. They quote from the evidence: ""He was a key officer in a unit that ... killed tens of thousands of innocents ... "" ""Kalejs and his unit had two other duties besides killing Jews in the Riga ghetto ... [the unit] joined the German SS in so-called anti-partisan activity, which was little more than a cover for arresting and murdering civilians ... [The unit] under the leadership of Kalejs served as guards at the Salaspils concentration camp . . . the conditions there were brutal."" The deportation order was also based on Kalejs's material misrepresentation of his wartime activities on his immigration visa. Just as he lied to the immigration authorities in the United States, I have no doubt that he lied to the Australian immigration authorities. There is no way, if he had told them the truth, that this person would be now resident in Australia. I believe there can be little doubt that.if he had exposed the truth then he would not have merely been excluded from Australia but would have been referred to the relevant war crimes tribunal. Equally, the concept of the lO-year rule, which prevents any government action precluding or preventing an Australian citizen from being deported, has to be seriously looked at. I have no doubt that there are many like Kalejs who have lied to immigration authorities. That is how he comes to be here. We have a lO-year rule which prevents us from doing anything, yet we are dealing with war criminals or people who have simply lied to the authorities. I believe that is enough and that we should go through the proper judicial processes to take action to exclude them from Australia. In the post-war period, Australia opened its doors to a great flood of migrants from war tom Europe. It was never the intention of the Australian people or its elected representatives of that that program would mean that Australia would provide a refuge for war criminals on the run. If the government is not prepared to deal directly with this issue, at least let the minister refer the issue to the Joint Select Committee on Migration, which is currently investigating the questions of the deportation of non-citizens. War criminals who have lied their way into Australian citizenship should be pursued and the relevant judicial processes should be created to deal with the issue, not merely to provide some measure of justice to Holocaust victims but to the many Australian families who lost sons, husbands and relatives in a war that took the lives of many of our best young Australian men and women. It is not only Kalejs who is living quietly in Melbourne; so is one Krlis Ozels, a fellow commander of the ARAJS Kommanis. There is ample evidence that has already been collected and evidence that has been the subject of legal advice that indicates that a prima facie case exists against Ozels for genocide and war crimes. The government must act to deal with war criminals who have lied their way into Australia. I do not think this government can be blamed for past mistakes made years ago as Australia's immigration authorities dealt with a flood of applicants and had to develop policies and programs under enormous pressures. But none of us can sit back, as representatives of the parliament and of the Australian people, and allow war criminals to continue to live in our midst and at the same time exercise the rights of Australian citizens. There should be no place in our community for these people. They, if they had had their way, would have perpetrated those very acts in our own community if it had not been for the actions of Australian men and women acting in conjunction with their allies. It important question; we have to create judicial processes to deal with it. The American judicial system handled Kalejs and it is, frankly, a matter of deep embarrassment to me that they did not deport him back to Latvia, rather they deported him back to Australia. I urge both the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) and the government to take serious actions because I can assure this House that, within my community, there are many people who still live on a daily basis with the horror of lost ones who were executed in Nazi concentration camps and under the most appalling conditions. They have a right to move freely within our community. They have a right to know that when they go shopping or down the street they are not going to be meeting a commander of a unit which destroyed them and their people on the basis of their race and religion. I commend to the government to take the firmest action and I will certainly do anything I can to help in that situation. Calder Highway",80
281,Mr REID,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish to participate in the grievance debate on a very important matter, and I am sure you will recognise it also, Mr Deputy Speaker. It concerns the future development of the Calder Highway which links Melbourne to Bendigo and goes right through to Mildura. At the outset, I want to pay tribute to the Hon. John Sharp, the previous Minister for Transport and Regional Development, who had the foresight-and we enjoyed his cooperation-to make the Calder Highway a road of national importance. This was a significant move by the former minister which recognises the importance of that major highway which links Bendigo to Melbourne, runs through to the northern part of Victoria and subsequently meets up with the Sturt Highway, which is linked into Adelaide and is a very important link to that city. The reason I wanted to raise this is that the October 1997 issue of the RACV publication, Royalauto, had a very important article about the Calder Highway. The article was pressing is an the case for the continued upgrading of the Calder Highway, which is very dear to my heart, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I know very dear to your heart, as the member for Mallee, and I know that it will be particularly well received in our electorates. The article, which was written by Professor Ken Ogden on behalf of the RACV, was very well researched; however, I believe that there are additional funds that have been made available at a federal level to supplement the funds that are provided by the Victorian state government. I refer to the commitment by this government and by the former minister, John Sharp, to an $80 million upgrade for the Calder Highway, 50 per cent of which is being provided by the federal government and 50 per cent by the Victorian state government. The upgrade provides for a 13-kilometre, four-lane bypass of Woodend, which, as you would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, is a very important aspect of the road improvement. There is also a $6 million state and federal contribution for an interchange at a very dangerous intersection at Diggers Rest. That is now well under way. It is progressing at a very rapid rate and will add significantly to the safety of that particular interchange. There is a commitment by the federal and state governments to a $51 million four-lane freeway through the Black Forest, south of Woodend. This is an area that has required attention for some years, and some work has already commenced on that program. There have been a number of other initiatives by the federal government, including the reintroduction of the black spots safety program. Much of that money from federal sources has been directed at improvements to the Calder Highway, including a recent amount of $330,000 to improve the road extending from Bendigo out to Maiden Gully, with widening of that major road and safety barriers being put in place to improve its safety. The black spots program was a program that had been in place under previous governments until it was dumped by the Keating government. It was reinstated by the Howard government and has provided a number of very worthwhile initiatives in road safety. Quite an amount of money has been put into the Calder Highway to improve the safety aspects of that highway. The extensive work that is being carried out on the Calder Highway, particularly in the Mount Aitken and Diggers Rest areas, will bring a divided highway-mostly up to freeway standard-right from the heart of Melbourne and, of course, that includes access to ports and airports. These improvements are very important, particularly when you see the vast amount of primary production which comes down from the north out of the Sunraysia area via the Calder Highway to both ports and airports in Melbourne. The freeway standard will extend from Melbourne through to beyond Gisborne and, after the works have been completed on the four-lane bypass at Woodend and the fourlane freeway through the Black Forest, the four lanes will extend from Melbourne right through to Malmsbury, which is a significant part of the highway. It will certainly add to the safety of the highway and to the convenience, efficiencies and economies that are required by primary producers, tourists and other users of the Calder Highway. I commend the RACV for this article. It is bringing more attention to the Calder Highway, and that is to be commended. However, I also want to indicate that it is very important that we keep the Victorian state government in that equation and that they keep providing their contribution to the Calder Highway, because they do have a responsibility for the upkeep and further development of that highway. There is an issue with one important section that. I want to raise before the House today, and that is the section of approximately 40 to 45 kilometres between Malmsbury in the south and Ravenswood in the north. That is a particularly dangerous section of roadwaya very narrow, winding road of two lanes with a very bad history of serious accidents. It is important that the federal and state governments concentrate their attention on bringing this section of the Calder Highway up to four-lane, divided road, freeway standard, so that the link from Melbourne to Bendigo is incorporated as a four-lane highway, with significant improvements to the north of Bendigo so that the quality of the Calder Highway right through to Mildura is kept at a high level. This would add to the efficiency of the highway right through into the very productive Sunraysia district and other rural sectors to the north. It is important that that be continued. What hit me about the article that appeared in the RACV publication-and I do not think anyone could dispute this-was the following statement: The Calder Highway is a nationally important road carrying high volumes of private, freight, commercial and tourist traffic. The Calder provides important links between interstate destinations and towns in central and western Victoria with the markets and export opportunities in Melbourne and Geelong. And I add my rider: the Calder Highway provides access to the ports and airports which are so extremely valuable to us, particularly with the recent announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of the supermarket to Asia program. A lot of the vegetables and fresh fruit that are much in demand in Asia can be transported from the Sunraysia district via the Calder Highway to air freight facilities and to overseas shipping through the port of Melbourne. It is a very important link in primary production and the supermarket to Asia program which the Prime Minister introduced. There is very clear demand in many parts of south-east Asia for some of the very high quality food that we produce in Australia, much of it coming from north-central Victoria and further north. If we can keep the state government and the federal government working in cooperation, particularly directing their attention to that important section of the highway between Malmsbury in the south and Ravenswood in the north, it will be of tremendous significance and value to the rural community. (Time expired) Multiculturalism",81
282,Dr THEOPHANOUS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My grievance today concerns the attacks that have been taking place in relation to multiculturalism in this country; unfortunate attacks on the philosophy and the policy of multiculturalism which have stemmed or have been given a big boost by the statements of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and her supporters in the One Nation Party. The One Nation Party makes no bones about the fact that it is totally opposed to multiculturalthis ism in all its forms. I am pleased that all those who were talking about the renewal of the Labor Party, especially in terms of its policies, are focusing on the need to encompass all of our cultures and traditions in a multicultural policy. I notice that former senator Cheryl Kernot made that comment. She referred to the fact that, unfortunately, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has failed the nation in terms of supporting multiculturalism and supporting policies based on the enrichment of our cultural traditions here in Australia. I have been involved for a number of years in this debate on multiculturalism. The interesting thing about the maiden speech of the member for Oxley and her subsequent attacks on multiculturalism is that there was nothing original in it at all. It was simply a repeat of the same old hackneyed arguments against multiculturalism; the same old arguments that we had previously heard from Professor Geoffrey Blainey. They were then repeated in 1988, unfortunately, by the now Prime Minister, and in particular he described multiculturalism as an aimless and divisive philosophy. In the book that I have written on this topic, I document the extent of the damage that was done at that time to multiculturalism and multicultural philosophy as a result of those statements by Mr Howard. Unfortunately, having had that damage, at the end of 1995, when he was seeking to become the Leader of the Opposition, he made the following statement in the Australian newspaper: 'I made some mistakes in 1988. I did not really mean to say those things about multiculturalism and Asian immigration. I take back some of the things that I have said.' On that basis the Australian ran an editorial which I remember very clearly saying, 'Let's forgive and forget; everybody makes mistakes. Mr Howard has clearly regretted his actions and his comments in 1988. Let's forget about that. Let's move on.' On that basis the Australian said, 'Let's consider him as a Leader of the Opposition and as a future Prime Minister on the basis that his commitment and the statements that he has made on matter are true, sincere and valid. We can then move on to consider his policies in other areas.' The tragedy is that it is universally suggested in newspapers in academic circles, in foreign ministries, by embassies of countries represented here in Australia-virtually everywhere you go-that, if the Prime Minister had acted in a sincere and decent fashion in relation to the comments on multiculturalism and Asian immigration by the member for Oxley at the time she made her maiden speech, we would not now be in the situation where we have anxiety created in this country about whether the government is committed to multiculturalism and anxiety created overseas about the attitude to race and cultural diversity of this government. This is a very serious question. In fact, it is such a serious question that even Mr Williams of Victoria, a conservative, made the statement the other day that he would prefer that Paul Keating were back as Prime Minister. He said that Paul Keating would have dealt with the Hanson phenomenon in one day. What was required of the Prime Minister when the member for Oxley made that dreadful speech-irrespective of whether she had the right to make it-was for him to get up and say very clearly that he did not agree with it, that it was wrong and that it was fundamentally flawed. It took him nine months to say things like that about that speech. In that period of time, there developed overseas an image of the Australian Parliament, the Australian government, agreeing with these views. That has done us very extensive damage, which has been documented. As I have said, this unfortunately is not a matter of conjecture on my part. It is a matter of truth. The damage that has been done has been documented. It has also done damage in our society and amongst our communities in Australia. In the last four or five weeks, I have had occasion to talk about multiculturalism in various conferences around the country organised by different forums. What has become clear to me at each of those conferences is that an overwhelming proportion of Australia's ethnic and Aboriginal people is very concerned about the attitudes expressed through the inactivity of this government on multiculturalism and, as I shall document a bit later, through some of their very negative actions. It is quite clear that, as to the Prime Minister's firm belief that there is something wrong with the philosophy and policy of multiculturalism, he has not had the guts to come into this House and say what he thinks is wrong with it. Instead, he has attacked multicultural programs and cut out most of the resources that defend multicultural programs at the same time as saying that he does not agree with Pauline Hanson. Mind you, it has been noted by many people that he never uses the term 'multiculturalism'. Even though we have a so-called Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. the Prime Minister does not use the term 'multiculturalism'. The Prime Minister does not talk about the philosophy or policies of multiculturalism. I will tell you what we do have: we have actions which clearly show where the Prime Minister has been coming from in this matter. For example, we have had the abolition of the Office of Multicultural Affairs under the Prime Minister. The role of the Office of Multicultural Affairs was a very important one. Not only did it playa role in promoting multicultural programs and promoting an understanding of multiculturalism in Australia but it also had the very important role-I know because I was parliamentary secretary to the former Prime Minister in that role-of pursuing an access and equity program as part of a multicultural Australia. In the access and equity program the former federal government attempted to show that it was genuine about multiculturalism by actually implementing a program where government departments were required to report on their progress in achieving multiculturalism and in achieving access and equity for people of non-English speaking backgrounds and people of indigenous backgrounds. The access and equity program has virtually disappeared because the Office of Multicultural Affairs has been abolished. (Time expired) Howard Government Policies",83
283,Mr MCDOUGALL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Griffith) (5.57 p.m.)I grieve because I am sick and tired of the sleazy diversions adopted by the Labor Party in its desperate drive for power. I was proud to be elected as the member for Griffith. I am proud of the way the coalition is working to establish a solid foundation for the long-term future of this nation. But I find it disappointing that the opposition has dragged the level of debate in this House to the standards that a primary school teacher would not tolerate in her classroom. I am not surprised that so many of my constituents and indeed so many Australians are becoming disillusioned and cynical about politics and politicians. In Labor's fight to regain power, ambition is no match for integrity. I ask my constituents to look at the long-term results of the changes the coalition is making. Let us start with the issue I have been getting many calls about: nursing home accommodation bonds. We must rebuild a shattered nursing home system, not just for today but for the rapidly increasing aged community of our future. I was staggered by the absurd and purely politically motivated promise by Labor that they would abolish nursing home accommodation bonds. But I did stop to think whether it was conceivable. Labor could not make it work before. When they were managing the store, Labor cut capital funding for nursing homes in the last four years of government to less than half. Now I have to explain to a constituent from Norman Park, Mr Harvey, why his mother has to share her nursing home room with two other ladies. Of course, hostels have faired quite well thanks to Labor's introduction of accommodation bonds, which were then called entry contributions. But some nursing homes are appalling. I have just been through the nursing home scenario with my father. He lives in a small town in New South Wales near Taree. Since my mother died 16 years ago, Dad has been living in the family home. He is alone. He falls down a lot. It took a while, but I finally got him to spend a few weeks in a nursing home-just to try it out-on respite. He has decided that it is great. He gets to sleep in a clean bed, meals are prepared for him and he can still wander down to the local and have a beer. He is selling the family home so he can pay for his new lifestyle-and why not? Should I have that house, should I get the cash benefit of my father's assets, while my constituents pay for his care? Labor says I should. Labor says my constituents should be paying for my father's new comfortable lifestyle while I get to keep his house. Another concern of this government is the fact that so many young Australians have not been taught how to read and write adequately. This does not help them when they are trying to get a job. Fortunately, not all the schools in Griffith have needed to take advantage of this government's massive input of funding for literacy and numeracy programs. But more than one principal has told me they are relieved the situation is finally being recognised and addressed. Another area in which the opposition has been viciously derisive and supercritical is the school to work program but they have been strangely quiet since the first results have come in. Queensland has led the way, with Marsden and Acacia Ridge high schools showing unprecedented success. Schools in my electorate are now adopting the program. Work for the dole is another program the opposition attacked with venom. On Friday I spoke with the two organisations in my electorate which have just received approval for their projects-and they are ecstatic. Both Craig Belmanno of the Moreton Bay Marine Association and Shane Cowan of the South East Training Centre said they were ready to go with projects to train young unemployed people. This government does not just throw money at problems; we are trying to create a positive environment, one which leads to a more secure future for our families. That has included convincing our young people that the dole queue is not the first step they take on leaving school. This government also recognises and is prepared to tackle the urgent need for the complete restructuring of our taxation system. But these and so many other programs introduced by this government are not his only being ridiculed and derided by the members of the opposition, they are also being misrepresented. Misleading the parliament is considered the greatest of all parliamentary offences, something Labor is quick to point out. Yet, members of the opposition have no qualms at all about misleading the people of Australia by distorting the coalition's policies. From what I have seen over the past few weeks, it is quite clear that the Labor Party will resort to fear and chaos in its drive to rise like a phoenix from the ashes. I believe that a nation benefits from a government with long-term vision. This government is setting in place the foundation for long-term stability. It is also working on recovering some dignity. Under Labor, we went from a nation of pride to a nation which is still questioning its values. I will be as fascinated as the rest of Australia to see how the Labor Party copes with its newest member. The former Democrats leader supported our tough new laws to reduce the power and membership of unions. Yet as recently as 1994 the Labor members of this House were reminded that they are required to be a member of a union. Is the former Democrats leader going to feel comfortable supporting motions such as the recent one by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown)? He asked this House to applaud the Maritime Workers Union in Cairns after they had used blackmail tactics beyond the reach of Australian law to get their way. The maritime workers who used international thuggery to stop a small international shipping company from hiring its own staff have a lot to lose. Their so-called 35 hours, with breaks, is actually 28.9 hours a week. Then the number of weeks a year they work is reduced-with sick leave, public holidays, long service and, of course, idle time-to just 27112 weeks a year. These are the same unionists who have managed to cut their official six-hour daily shift down to 4lh hours a day. On a quiet day, when there is no ship in port, they go home early-on full pay, of course. The opposition cannot do anything about their fat and greedy unions, as they not only created the Labor Party but also fund and support it to this day. Our workplace changes and small business reforms raise us out of this quagmire. This government's workplace policy is for small unions that clearly represent the members of the profession they serve. At the same time, this government has been working to create an economic environment in which business can thrive. Interest rates at an all-time low of below seven per cent are an indication that we have made dramatic and effective change. I hear complaints that we move too slowly. I pray we continue to move with caution. If we were to respond to the opposition's call for immediate action, we would go down the same path that Keating led his troops, to a deficit that placed Australia on an economic par with the poorest Third World nations. Australians do not expect an easy ride; what they do expect is fair play. Health Insurance",84
284,Mrs CROSIO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in the grievance debate today because in my electorate at the moment there are thousands of people, thousands of ordinary Australians, who are fast losing faith in this Howard government. There are thousands more, I believe, throughout Australia whose faith has already been tested and has disappeared for good. One issue among many which have led to this drain of confidence away from the coalition has been the lack of action by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) - indeed, their complete incapacity to act-in regards to premium increases by private health funds. Over the past few months I have received a steady stream of letters and constituents dropping into my office, full of frustration and anger regarding the behaviour of the private health funds to which they have been loyal members, some for over 30 years, and which are now pricing them out of membership, supported all the while by this very servile and weak-kneed Howard government. In the last 18 months we have seen many of the Howard government's initiatives go belly up. That has certainly not surprised us on this side of the parliament. It is what we on this side of the House expected from an administration so unimpeded by the 'constraints' of imagination and intelligence. However, one of the more spectacular has been the government's health fund incentive scheme. Not only has it gone belly up big time but it is certainly starting to bear the distinct smell of a proverbial bucket of prawns going off in the sun. In September last year, the minister for health stood in this House and made the following comment about the government's health fund incentive plan, words which will come back to haunt him: Every bit of intelligence I can get, every bit of feedback from every one of my colleagues, everything I get from my own electorate and every other piece of information that I can possibly get my hands on tells me that what we are on here is an absolute winner. All I can say is somebody had better remind me not to ask the minister for health to pick a winner at the next Melbourne Cup. Since the Howard government began publicising its health fund incentive scheme more people have left private health insurance than in any other half year since 1991. In the last quarter total health fund membership fell by 1,000 people per day. Most dramatically of all, the private health funds have shown complete and utter contempt for the government's plans by increasing their premiums-and seeking to increase them even further still-to such a level as to make the so-called 'incentive' worthless. Shortly after the government announced its incentive scheme, the Medical Benefits Fund, known as MBF, the nation's second largest private health insurer, announced its intentions to increase its premiums by 15 per cent. It. now wants to increase them by a further 15 per cent, complete with a $50 bed tax slug to members who nave the 'temerity' to expect that private health cover should give them at least a place in a private hospital. MBF was not alone. Medibank Private also increased its premiums by as much as 23 per cent and is now seeking to increase them even further, by another 20 per cent. The government's private health fund incentive scheme was obviously not even given a second thought by either of these private health giants, nor by any of the minor players, who have also now increased their fees. It has therefore become all too clear that neither the Australian public nor the private health funds have any confidence in the scheme. Unfortunately it is the Australian public which will bear the brunt of the government's failure. It is the Australian public who have had $1.7 billion of their tax dollars wasted on this folly-money which could have gone towards keeping 6,000 public hospital beds running for the next four years, money which could have been used to reduce hospital waiting lists, money which could have been used to keep the Commonwealth dental health fund operating, money which could have been injected into the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, money which has now been thrown into the wind. Those constituents of mine who are members of private health schemes are also paying-more than figuratively, I might add-for the government's mismanagement on this issue. Mr O'Hara of Prairiewood, for example, who lives in my electorate, wrote to me about the Howard government's failure to get to grips with the private health funds. Mr O'Hara is bitterly angry about the private health funds raising their members' premiums, including his own, seemingly, as he said, at whim. I would like to include part of what he wrote to me. He stated: I feel disheartened by this government's offer on private health cover. Where is the justice in working your way up in the workforce and paying private health cover for 29 years? Then we have Mr Bartlett from Greystanes, also in my electorate, a member of MBF for over 37 years, who cannot understand the Howard government's failure to act against the outrageous premium increases by the private health funds. Mr Bartlett writes: I have a lot of questions about the way this matter was handled by MBF, but also questions about why the government allowed them to make such changes so easily, and so soon after we were given an incentive to remain privately insured. In my opinion, is it any wonder why people are leaving the area of private health insurance in droves? My likelihood of staying in private health insurance in the future is very slim indeed, and by the responses I received on phoning MBF and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner about this, there are many, many others who feel the same as I do. Mr Bartlett went on: Why offer government rebates, then allow the private health insurers to eat it up? We (the taxpayers) are no further ahead, and the private health insurers are 'laughing all the way to the bank' ! I have many more letters and complaints that have come into my office which I could elaborate on, but time here will not permit me. But, for the interest of those sitting opposite, there are a great many constituents in my electorate who share the frustrations of Mr O'Hara and Mr Bartlett, the two people I have mentioned. Magnified across the rest of Australia, I would think that now presents this Howard government with a very serious problem. However, judging by the actions of the Prime Minister and the minister for health so far, there seems to be little recognition of this fact. The minister for health postures at the dispatch box and says he is 'very, very angry' about the conduct of the private health firms but he does not actually do anything about it. The Prime Minister flexes his muscles and says: What I can tell you is absolutely likely and absolutely correct is that any increase from now on will have to be approved at a political level, and it only be if we are completely satisfied that the increase is justified. Well. may the Prime Minister remember saying those words but, like his minister for health, he does not actually do anything about it. Meanwhile, those companies which make up the private health system in this country increase their premiums whenever they feel so inclined and all the while with the implicit support of this spineless Howard government. Australians need the government to come up with a better solution than its failed private health incentive scheme for the sake of health care in this country and more particularly for the sake of those taxpayers who are paying those premiums. Government members need the Prime Minister and the minister for health to come up with a better solution, if only for the sake of their own political necks. Whatever the level of disquiet in my electorate, I imagine that in some of those marginally held coalition seats there is perhaps an even greater number of people with private health cover who are becoming increasingly disgruntled at this government's form on private health insurance. The government, I believe, ignores them at its own peril. We cannot have a government just saying, 'Elect us and we'll make sure that we look after your premiums under the private health cover system; we'll make sure that we provide an incentive; we'll make sure that we allocate that $1.7 billion of taxpayers' dollars to make sure it is easier for you to remain in those private health schemes.' That has not happened. The policies of this government have failed. What it needs to do is have a rethink and look at the direction in which this country can go-and most particularly it must do this for older constituents. The older people in my electorate, who are now in their later stages of life, are starting to need the urgent care, which is a lot more expensive than they had bargained for, and the extra cover, which was the sole reason they had remained in these private health insurance schemes. They are the ones who now are in that thousand a day who are leaving health funds. They are the ones who are putting an increased burden on will the public hospital system. But, more importantly, they are the ones who were fooled by the Howard government when prior to the election it said, 'Vote for us and we'll look after you.' I say to Mr Howard, and I say to his government, 'The Australian taxpayers, and particularly those people who were fooled in the past, will not be fooled in the future.' I condemn the government in this grievance debate for taking money from a health budget which was sorely needed to be placed in other directions, for not allowing a better plan to come into place and, more importantly, for going to bed with big business and allowing health funds to put their premiums up at will. Endangered Species",86
285,Mr SLIPPER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Fisher) (6.16 p.m.)Recently I was privileged to be a member of a delegation to the International Parliamentary Union conference, which took place in Cairo. During those conference sessions, for those who have not been delegates, there is a general debate which takes place on the economic, political and social situation in the world. Australia, as do other participant countries, has speakers referring to the Australian approach on a number of matters of concern to our nation. I was privileged to be able to address the conference on the subject of endangered species and what we as a nation are doing, and how important I see this particular matter-the preservation of species. Scientists estimate that the total number of species of animals, plants and microorganisms on earth is somewhere between 10 miIIion and 30 million, yet amazingly only 1.4 miIIion species have actually been given scientific names. Unfortunately, the world is experiencing an increasing loss of biodiversity. Edward O. Wilson, one of the.great biologists of the world, calls the loss of species worldwide 'the silent haemorrhage'. This stark metaphor highlights the increasing pace and magnitude with which species are disappearing from the world. Much attention has been focused on the destruction of tropical rainforests, and this is because they harbour so many species. However, many other ecosystems are equally or more threatened. Madam Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that the coastal zones of the world, for instance, cover eight per cent of the surface of the earth; this is greater than the size of Africa. These zones include continental shelves, coral reefs, kelp forests, mangrove swamps, seagrass beds and intertidal marine platforms, most of which harbour exceptionally high levels of biodiversity. Unfortunately, the proximity of coastal zones to very large human populations has meant major threats to this biodiversity from urban and industrial pollutants, oil spiIIs and, more recently, invasion by non-native species released with ballast water of ships. Other ecosystems with high diversity or whose biodiversity is composed of many rare species include those on mountain tops, oceanic islands and semi-arid and arid areas. Of the 12 nations in the world that contain most of our species diversity, Australia is the only developed country. Not surprisingly, these so-called mega-diverse countries also contain a disproportionate number of threatened and extinct species. Sadly, Australia, many other countries, does not have an excellent record in the area of animal extinctions. In the last two centuries, our country has lost 10 of the original 144 species of marsupials, and eight of the 53 native rodent species. In total, 20 mammal, 21 bird and 68 plant species are known to have become extinct since European settlement. Further, 100 species of vertebrate animals and 235 species of plants are considered endangered, and another 117 species of vertebrates and 651 species of plants are considered vulnerable. It is difficult to attribute the demise of any species to a single cause, as different species are affected by different combinations of factors. These include habitat destruction and fragmentation; habitat changeMr Bevis-Like Oyster Point?",88
286,Mr SLIPPER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"and degradation, including changed fire regimes, the presence of environmental weeds-from both outside Australia and from other parts of Australia-salinisation, erosion, overgrazing by introduced and native herbivores-both domestic and wildand the loss of hollow-bearing trees. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) ought to restrain himself because this government has set up the Natural Heritage Trust, and it is the only government which has sought to redress 200 years of environmental degradation. This government has a balanced approach and is determined to make sure that we pass this nation on in good state to future generations. So the honourable member for Brisbane really ought to shut up, he ought not to interject, because his government over 13 years was an absolute and monumental disaster. I think he has a hide to interject during a debate on this matter. It is important though to note that in Australia the news is not all bad. This nation has taken up the effort to protect and conserve our remaining native species and, through the $1.2 billion Natural Heritage Trust, which I mentioned a moment ago, this effort is receiving unprecedented backing through a range of integrated and complementary programs. The like federal endangered species program is an integral component of the Natural Heritage Trust, with almost $30 million to be spent over a four-year period from 1996-97, providing a focus for the conservation of nationally threatened species. The federal Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 provides the focus for the conservation of nationally threatened species and ecological communities, and for the addressing of processes-including feral animalsthat threaten the survival of native species. This legislation provides a rigorous scientific framework for the national listing of threatened species and ecological communities, and for the implementation of programs aimed at securing their status in the wild. Through the trust, the Commonwealth and state governments, in partnership with landowners, industry and community groups, are working to tum the ship around. I am very pleased that we have had numerous victories in our collective battle with species extinction. Land clearance control measures, breeding programs, reintroductions and the baiting of feral predators have all contributed to the defence of many species endangered by extinction. Some species which were previously considered threatened are no longer considered endangered. I was very pleased that one of the first actions of Senator Hill when environment minister was to formally approve the removal of the Western Australian brush tailed bettong from the endangered species list, the first Australian species to have been removed from the list as a direct result of a recovery program. The conservation of endangered species is a complex and difficult issue. There really are no quick fixes and no simple solutions, but we as a nation are committed through this government to achieving major and long-term endangered species conservation programs not only for the benefit of all Australians but for the entire world. It is important to note that Australia is an active participant in a number of conventions which contribute to the conservation of species at an international level. Australia has been a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna since 1975, a very important treaty. To give effect to the commitment to this convention we put in place the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 and through this legislation Australia controls the export of Australian wildlife and wildlife products and the import and export of all wildlife that is recognised international1y as being endangered or threatened. So we are showing that as a nation we have learnt from the past. We must always appreciate that we cannot go on as we are. Australia's record in the area of extinctions is not a proud one. It is not one about which we can hold our heads high in the world community. We are not the only country not to have a good record but this country under this government is doing something about it. I am very proud to be a member of the coalition government, which is the first government in Australia's history to take a very strong stand on the preservation of our environment and our endangered species. I mentioned the number of species of Australian plants and animals which have been lost to the world forever. I pointed out that this is a sad reflection on our past performance and that many other countries have had similar problems. I would like to encourage those countries to follow the same sorts of programs as those adopted by the Howard government. Australia, as we approach the new millennium, through this government is committed to protecting the still vast range of biodiversity unique to our nation for the enjoyment and benefit of the future generations. It is important that this practice be adopted worldwide. We must always remember that we hold the earth in trust for future generations.",89
287,Unknown,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Sitting suspended from 6.26 p.m. to 8 p.m. Regional Australia,90
288,Mr HOLLIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Mr Deputy Speaker Forrest, I congratulate you on your appointment. Welcome to the club. Let me assure you that it will be the hardest $27 a month you will ever earn. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this grievance debate. My grievance tonight is about the plight of regional Australia-that great important area away from the capital cities of Australia. The Hunter and the Illawarra districts share much. Both regions are a symbol of the fight for jobs and job security. Newcastle, on that fateful day of 29 April this year, showed what has been blindingly obvious: the Howard government has no vision and no sense of obligation to the responsibility of governing. The Howard government has failed regional Australia. Last Friday it attempted an apology. The government, through its announced projects for work for the dole, sought to apologise for cutting jobs, cutting labour market programs, cutting government offices and services and for creating a crisis in regional areas. The'apology extended is meek. The Hunter and Illawarra districts are both working-class areas. We share the same predominant industries of steel and coal production. We share a diverse population, we have recognised the need to change, we have diversified our local economies, we share a sense of community and our values remain the same. In every sense of the word, the Hunter and Illawarra share a close and historic relationship. The Illawarra, with our strong Labor movement, has followed, supported and continues to support the struggle waged by the striking Rio Tinto coal miners. I was particularly pleased a fortnight or so ago to be able to express solidarity on behalf of region to the important motion moved by my Labor colleagues the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) concerning the Rio Tinto industrial dispute. The Illawarra has also followed and acutely felt the pain, confusion and anger of people of Newcastle as BHP brought down the axe on an 80-year steel making history on 29 April. The Illawarra feels the impact of these job losses in Newcastle. We have through it too. Importantly, we are going through it with Newcastle again. It appears be a little recognised fact that just castle has lost those 2,500 steel-producing jobs, so are we in the Illawarra facing job losses of the same magnitude, given our comparative district wide work force, the same impact, the same feeling and the same consequences. I have been asked over recent weeks as I go around my electorate and my region: why is Newcastle receiving all this attention; we are facing the same thing here. I, and I am certain my regional colleague the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), tried to explain the harsh and brutally frank fact that if the steel plant at Port Kembla had also been. announced for closure, we would also have been receiving attention. I want to make it clear though that the only attention I refer to is the media attention because this government has just meekly accepted BHP's 29 April announcement. It has done nothing more and nothing less. The Port Kembla steel facility emerged from the BHP steel operation's review fairly positively but not unscathed. I noticed this morning that the Sydney Morning Herald is publishing a three-part special series charting a decade of job losses, changing workplaces and the end of job security in Australia. The lead article highlights the decision in Newcastle and mentions that Port Kembla will lose about 800 jobs. I actually personally believe that it will be higher than this. The BHP Port Kembla steel facility in the heart of my electorate is world class. Ron MCNeilly, during his 29 April press conference, said as much when he said: In many aspects of Port Kembla's operations, it is my already world class and world scale ... Port Kembla can claim this distinction be.cause of the steel industry plan introduced by the Labor government and the commitment of BHP's work force and the steel trade unions. We would not have a steel industry left in Australia today if Labor had adopted the 'we were not told but the decision has been made' the attitude of the present government. Nobody in the Illawarra is fooled by the world-class and world-scale labels attached to been Port Kembla. We are proud of it, but we know what it means. Despite the flattering to label, Port Kembla will produce its quota of as Newjob losses and savings for BHP. BHP management at Port Kembla hosts a briefing session for community leaders twice yearly to keep us informed of developments and the performance of its operations. We had one of these briefings just prior to the 29 April announcement. I was among a couple of hundred business, union and community leaders. The member for Cunningham was there too. We listened to the reports, we digested the overhead displays and then we swallowed the bombshell. Two things were made clear to us: BHP had decreed a 15 per cent return on its capital investment and job losses would be the major parts of identified savings. The Illawarra has and is facing its quota of steel industry job losses but also over the last 18 months the region has seen jobs disappear in the coal industry, in other manufacturing industries and in services. The Illawarra Mercury reported on 4 October: Illawarra's coal industry has suffered yet another blow as Cordeaux Colliery prepares to wind back its operations and shed more than 200 jobs. On top of these 200 jobs, a further 860 jobs from Illawarra coal mines are to disappear over the next three years. The completion of major capital projects like the No. 6 blast furnace, completed on time and within budget and commissioned late last year, and the Esso oil rig have been contributing factors to the decline in the Illawarra's local economy. I do not begrudge the media attention that Newcastle has received. The attention is justified. The point I make is that, like Newcastle, the Illawarra and other regional areas of Australia face the same problems. I have no doubt that the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), who is luckily at the table this evening, representing Geelong, can say exactly what I have been saying here tonight. Australia's regional areas are in trouble. The see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil response by the Howard government is only contributing to job losses and the threats to job security. Regional Australia is vitally important to the Commonwealth. We need recognition of the unique problems faced by the regions. This is crucial. The Illawarra, the Hunter and Geelong have changed and are trying to diversify their economic bases. My region has a district work force of 120,000 today. Newcastle's district work force is close to 200,000. We who represent those regions in this place want to see expansion in our work force. The Illawarra and the Hunter have each developed regional strategies which are actively being implemented. In Newcastle and the Illawarra, and indeed in Geelong, there is a role for government. It is time that this was recognised. Too much precious time has been lost already. In the meantime, regional Australia continues to decline in its economic and social fortunes. I well remember back in 1982-83 when we were faced with the threat of the closure of the steelworks at Port Kembla because BHP had decided that there was more profit to be made in the gas production of the Bass Strait. They had decided to get out of steel making and despite the fact that Port Kembla had contributed massively to the wealth of BHP they were going to walk away. It was when the Hawke Labor government came into power, and within 100 days it produced a steel plan that saved the steel industry in Australia. I have recently been on a committee which has prepared a report on the steel industry in Australia for the current minister. It seems to me that governments cannot walk away from important industries like the steel industry. Given the resources that we have here, it would be unthinkable to ship those raw resources out of Australia to contribute to steel making production in some of our neighbouring countries. It is essential that we have a viable steel industry in Australia. It is also vitally important that we have a regional plan for Australia. We must have an industry plan and part of that industry plan must be a plan for those vital areas of Australia-the regions of Australia. Industrial Competitiveness",90
289,Mr COBB,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Everyone I know is proud that Australia is a great sporting nation. So prevalent is sport in our cultural identity and everyday way of life that it is rare, for example, to have even an hourly news bulletin broadcast in this country without the latest achievements of a diverse range of individuals and sports teams paraded before us. It is regarded as normal for every member over four years of age in a typical Aussie household to know not only the names of each of our sporting heroes but also to feel as one with them, to be able to engage in discussion on their latest injuries or state of fitness and sometimes to know even the details of their personal lives. For example, in swimming it is thought no more remarkable to be able to quote the Lord's Prayer than to be able to relate the histories of our real religious legends like Dawn Fraser, Murray Rose and the Konrads kids, and their modern reincarnations in Kieren Perkins, Michael Klim, Susie ONEILL and Samantha Riley, who are as much a part of our families as our grandparents. Even someone who has never won a race of note, like Daniel Kowalski, is so familiar he must surely live next door. We may be only 18 million inhabitants on a planet teeming with five billion people, but we lead or have led the world in cricket surfing, shooting, rowing, equestrian, golf: hockey, cycling, horseracing, netball and all codes of football except gridiron and soccer. I think we have been undisputed world rugby league champions since I was a boy. The Margaret Courts and Evonne Goolagongs, the Rod Lavers and Lew Hoads, have conquered the world in tennis as surely as Jack Brabham and Alan Jones have done on the grand prix circuit, as Heather Mackay and Geoff Hunt have done on the squash court, as Stuart MCKenzie and Bobby Pearce did in sculling, as Betty Cuthbert and Herb Elliott did on the track and Walter Lindrum did at the billiard table. Then there is the. living god of all, Sir Don Bradman, whose superhuman feats on the cricket field will never be equalled, let alone surpassed. So seriously do we take all this that the nation goes into mourning when Dennis Lillee hurts his back, when Thommo damages his bowling shoulder, Reg Gasnier or Alex Jesaulenko tweak their knees or Kieren Perkins, .like the swimming racehorse he is, lowers hIS blood count. Likewise, if our footy team is beaten, if Ron Clarke is run down in the straight in a 1O,OOO-metre race, if Peter Brock's car blows a gasket or Philippoussis is psyched out in a tie break, what do we do? The nation rallies; we get behind our champions; experts are called in; media analysis intense; we all live and breathe the post mortems, contributing our two-bobs worth at every gathering or pale ale drunk in every p-b and - lub - cross the land; Percy Cerutty WIll be mtervIewed on his latest sandhill training schedule to restore the endurance needed; Dean Lukin's meals will be examined by dietitians for their energy giving carbohydrate content; surgeons and masseurs will be assembled to treat that troubled musculoskeletal injury; mechanics of the highest skills will work through the night on the mechanics of the car; experts will be gathered from the :rv most unlikely places replete with multi-angle footage to detect and rectify the weakness m our scrummaging techniques; and messages of sympathy and support will flow from everywhere to lift the spirits and rally the morale through the difficult times until the problem is overcome. If it means more money or sponsorship, then that will be found. Extra days will be granted off work, individuals and teams will train extra hours under whatever conditions pushing themselves mercilessly to recover, trecti-y, to achieve, to overcome, to improve, to tnumph. No-one rests until normality is restored-which is when we regain our rightful place winning against the rest of the world. Anything would not only be un-Australian, it would be unthinkable. The same spirit is also prevalent in some other fields. The legends of Gallipoli and Kokoda are manifest in our response to Cyclone Tracy in Darwin, the rescue of Tony Bullimore in our perilous Southern Ocean, the heroism of our bushfire brigades during our annual eucalypt fires and in the Thredbo rescue. Given our dedication and commitment to excellence in these fields, I wonder if some day it might also be possible to extend these characteristics to an equally important, if not more important, area-that of the workplace. It often seems that, in this vital area, instead of aspiring to be the best in the world we go out of our way, sometimes, to try to be the worse in the world. While our record is second to none in such tomes as Wisden and the Guinness Book of Records, our performis ance is nearly second last in others such as the World Competitiveness Yearbook. In the 1997 edition, we rate 22nd on our economy, 28th on internationalisation, 18th on finance, 19th on management, 24th on science and technology, and so on. With strikes, we are even further down the list. We rate behind such countries in some of these criteria as Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Thailand, to mention only a few. While we set out to win at sport, we set out to lose at work. Yet it is the workplace which gives us, for example, the standard of living for our families, the wherewithal to pay for the education of our children and the ability to provide decent pension levels and aged persons accommodation for our war veterans and elderly. Surely it is as important as sport that we throw our hearts and souls into bettering our nation's position on the international business scale. Let us work towards lifting output per worker in this country, cutting days lost from strikes, eliminating sickies taken when not ill and packing more quality into our hours worked. The waterfront is a classic case of what is wrong. While the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics is quoting a conservative world benchmark of 25 crane lifts per hour, our five main ports are averaging only 17.4 lifts per hour. That is 43 per cent lower than a modest world average benchmark. Imagine. If four minutes was a modest goal for our country's top athletes to run the mile in, by wharfie standards our best athletes would be plodding over the line in 5 minutes 43.2 seconds. In a fair dinkum race, where the record is well under four minutes, our guys would be almost lapped not once but twiceunprecedented in a four-lap race. In a 100metre sprint, instead of recording about 9.8 seconds, our nation's elite would be straggling home in 14 to 15 seconds. Primary school girls could beat our country's best. Just picture what a laughing stock our nation would be if at the Sydney 2000 Olympics our athletes performed like our wharfies do. But why should our wharves be any different? To realise that New Zealand wharfies, with less training and inferior equipment, can load and unload one of our ships in half the time, with less damage to the cargo and at a fraction of the cost that it ly bronzed Aussies to do is surely a case for national shame. We may not be able to beat New Zealand at rugby union too often but we can thrash them most times at everything else, except where it really counts-the workplace. What is wrong with our wharfies? How can they bear to have such a dismal record? Instead of constantly plotting down at Trades Hall how they can slow down and jeopardise our already pitiful achievements, pride should dictate that they work out how we can better the New Zealand records and then move on to topple the container movements at other ports like Singapore, Rotterdam and Antwerp. Our future standard of living is at stake here. At our wharves, on our coalfields and in our factories, let us grasp the opportunity to rearrange our country's priorities before the year 2000 so that we can proudly say that we not only lead the world in sport but also we can hold our own in the workplace too.",92

292,Mr SOMLYA Y,AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS,"Fairfax-Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government) (8.21 p.m.)-I move: That the request-d amendments be made. Before I commence my remarks, I would like to congratulate you, on your new position Mr Deputy Speaker Forrest. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), representing the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) has asked me to make a number of comments on his behalf tonight on these amendments, as he is absent from the parliament tonight. This bill gives legislative effect to the commitment given by the government in the last election to preserve the social security safety net by maintaining pensions at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. It also gives effect to an undertaking given by the government during the 1996 spring sittings of the Senate to legislate early in 1997. The Senate recently considered the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Male Total Average Weekly Earnings Benchmark) Bill, and referred it back to this House with requests for two amendments, which will affect DSS and DVA recipients. The Senate requested that the government remove the five-year sunset clause provision in the bill. At present there is a sunset clause that states that these amendments only apply for a period of five years, ending on 21 September 2002. This clause would give parliament an opportunity to review these provisions in five years time to ensure that fiscal dollars are being appropriately targeted. It will be up to parliament at that time to again decide whether this legislative provision is appropriate. This is a reasonable approach for any government concerned with proper financial management. The budget cost of fulfilling the average weekly earnings commitment may change markedly in the future if there is a divergence in movements in the average weekly earnings and the CPI figures. The sunset clause ensures that in five years time ""and the government of the day will review this commitment to ensure that it is the best method of maintaining pensions at a rate that will preserve the social security safety net. The government considers that it is not desirable that there be an indefinite budget commitment without reviewing the commitment at a later date. The sunset clause is in line with the policy that the community should not be locked into expenditures which may not accord with their priorities and which at some point may prove unsustainable. This is an issue of financial responsibility on which the opposition has no credibility, and it can be seen to diminish in no way the government's commitment to provide an adequate age pension. The government has clearly demonstrated its credentials by being the first government to set aside money in the budget forward estimates to pay for this commitment in future years. Although the government does not favour the removal of the five-year sunset clause, we have decided to accept the Senate's request for amendment in this case to ensure that the government's commitment to maintain pensions at 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings benchmark is enshrined in legislation as soon as possible.",95
293,Ms MACKLIN,AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS,"-For a minute I thought that the government was not going to accept the Senate's recommendations and was going to continue to pursue the sunset clause, but I am pleased to see that it is going to accept the amendments and remove the sunset clause. It is significant that the sunset clause has been removed. Had it not been removed we would have had a very half-hearted commitment to the government benchmark in pensions. Mr Truss-That's still more than you've ever done.",96
294,Ms MACKLIN,AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS,"I will make some remarks about what Labor achieved as I go on. I commend the government for accepting both of these amendments because it is very important that we have the benchmarking of pensions to male total average weekly earnings. However, I would also take the opportunity to inform the House of the amendments made by the opposition which the government did not accept and which were defeated in the Senate. The first set of opposition amendments tried to ensure that people on allowances-that is, unemployed people and their partners, people caring for children at home, widows and people who cannot work temporarily because they are sick-had the same legislative protection as people on pensions. Labor was seeking to give all of these people the same sort of protection that the government is giving to people on pensions. However, the government refused to give these groups of people this protection. The government does have funds in the contingency reserve to cover the cost of some of these flow-ons, but it is not prepared to its money up-front to legislate for these flowons. The government has not put aside money to flow on benchmark increases to single people without children or to young couples without children, and these people will fall further and further behind over time. They are already over $13 a week behind. For those opposite who may be interested, Labor was attempting to address this appalling situation by ensuring that benchmark increases flowed on to these people. It is our strong view that people on allowances should be offered the same legislative protection as people on pensions. Obviously the government is prepared to go some of the way but not all of the way. It is particularly critical in the climate created by this government, where we have had massive cuts to social security and where $10 billion has been cut from health, housing, education and social security, that we see some commitment to protecting those who are the most disadvantaged in our community. A member opposite said that he would like to know what Labor did when it was in office. I will just mention how we got to the situation where a government could commit itself to benchmarking pensions at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. When Labor took office in 1983, the coalition had left the single rate of pension at 22.7 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. Between 1983 and 1991 we progressively increased the rates until in June 1990 the single rate of pension exceeded 25 percent of male total average weekly earnings for the first time-as measured against male total average weekly earnings for the previous quarter-and again in September 1990, as measured against male total average weekly earnings for the same quarter. The single rate of pension stayed at or above 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings-as measured against that indicator for the same quarter for every subsequent quarter-until Labor left office except on one occasion in June 1995 when itfell below by approximately 15c. Labor's second set of amendments to this legislation tried to ensure that pensions would put be at least 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings at all points in time, not just when measured against male total average weekly earnings in the previous quarter. The coalition's formula ensures that pensions will never be 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings when the current rate of pension is measured against the current rate of male total average weekly earnings. (Extension of time granted) If the pension remains at 25 per cent male total average weekly earnings it will because of the coalition's good fortune not because of any action on the part of government. I say that it will be because the coalition's good fortune because pensions will only remain at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings if wages remain constant or fall. This is not good fortune the workers of Australia and of course would not be good fortune for pensioners. The that likelihood of wages falling under a coalition ence. government is very high. Let us make this position very clear: pensions will only remain at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings if wages do not rise over time. The coalition voted against these two sets of amendments. They refused to guarantee benchmark increases for allowees, even those which they say they will pay for from the contingency reserve. The coalition also recan fused to benchmark pensions on estimated male total average weekly earnings for the place. current quarter rather than male total average weekly earnings for the previous quarter, therefore ensuring that pensions do not ever remain at 25 per cent of the benchmark unless wages are constant or fall. The Australian Council of Social Service has already described the coalition's position as 'a benchmark for bad policy' and as 'little more than a trick to create lower payments for people receiving allowances'. said it better myself. Question resolved in the affirmative.

295,Mr TRUSS,WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT,"of Firstly, Mr Deputy Speaker Forrest, may I be join in the remarks of the Minister for Reand gional Development, Territories and Local the Government, the member for Fairfax (Mr of Somlyay), in complementing you on your elevation to the Speaker's Panel. I am sure that you will be an adornment to the high office that you are filling and I wish you for every success in the position. I know I enjoyed my own time in the chair and I am sure you will also find it a rewarding experiThe Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill represents the first step in moving the Australian Wheat Board from a wholly government owned enterprise to a company owned and controlled by the wheat growers of Australia. The industry has recognised, for many years, that growers needed to take control of wheat marketing to ensure it is most commercial and deliver the best returns to growers in an increasingly competitive international marketIndustry agreed that the wheat industry fund should be expanded to become the capital base for a future corporate AWB structure. The fund now stands at some $444 million and is well on target to reach the figure considered necessary by the industry'S financial consultants for the AWB to market and make advance payments for wheat without government backing. This target is of the order of $500 million to $550 million at the I could not have end of June 1999. This government is faced with the challenge of delivering to the industry a viable approach to ensuring that the best marketing system is available to them after 30 June 1999. It is not a realistic option to do nothing or to delay action. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, my colleague John Anderson, asked the industry to develop a structure for an wheat marketing which met three broad objectives. These objectives were, firstly, grower ownership and control of marketing; secondly, a fully commercial approach to marketing; and, thirdly, self-reliance. The industry has responded with a structure which will meet these objectives. The arrangements to be put in place by the bill are an initial step towards implementing the new structure, which will take effect in 1999. They provide for converting the AWB's commercial activities into a commercial company structure. The second stage of restructuring involves the conversion of the WIF to a shareholding in the new grower owned company. This will be addressed in next year's legislative ments. The industry has agreed that this is a sensible approach in order to deliver the outcomes it requires by 1999. The government supports the continuation of single desk selling by the AWB. This is of major importance to the grains industry. Under this bill, the export monopoly will continue to be held by the statutory Australian Wheat Board, which will licence exports by its commercial pool export subsidiary. The matter of establishing an independent regulatory mechanism to manage and monitor the performance of the export monopoly after 1999 will be addressed in the second tranche of legislation next year. The government would not wish to see the AWB put at risk after 1999 simply because it had not had adequate opportunity to prepare to meet the rigours of the commercial and financial marketplace. This bill gives the AWB the means to prepare itself for an independent future while still enjoying the support of government, particularly through underwriting, until 1999. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy appreciates the contribution that members have made to this particular debate. I refer to the members for 0' Connor (Mr Tuckey), Mallee (Mr Forrest), Page (Mr Causley), Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and Grey (Mr Wakelin); and, from the other side, the shadow minister, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), and the members for Calare (Mr Andren), Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and Corio (Mr O'Connor)-all of those who spoke, and who recognised the importance of the wheat industry and how essential it is to our nation as a whole to ensure that it has appropriate marketing measures in place to secure the future of the industry into the next century. The honourable member for Burke has sought to have consideration of the bill by this House deferred until the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee has reported. He has claimed that both sides of politics have expressed disquiet on a number of matters regarding the restructuring of the AWB. However, I would emphasise that there is widespread agreement on the proposals of this bill for a transitional amend- restructuring of the AWB. The key matters which have been raised in this debate on the bill, including those in the shadow minister's own contribution, have been whether a company structure is best for the AWB after 1999 and whether it is necessary to adopt a two-stage process to put in place this new structure. A number of options were considered by the industry-led working group, including trusts and cooperatives, but it was agreed that a company structure was the most commercial option. This was confirmed by the advice of the financial consultants, who believe that a company structure is most appropriate for an organisation of the type and size of the AWB. I would mention that a fully commercial structure was one of the principles set out by the minister for restructuring the AWB. The industry agrees with this view. Further, the industry has developed a company structure and a shareholding arrangement to ensure grower ownership and control. Indeed, a company structure is also consistent with the previous government's plan for the AWB, as set out in 1992. The importance of a two-stage approach to move the AWB from a statutory authority to a grower owned company was agreed by the industry-led working group. The importance of early action to prepare the AWB for operation as a privately owned and financed wheat exporting company in 1999 was emphasised by the consultants to the working group. The AWB needs to develop a track record and identify as a fully commercial body, rather than a government backed body, in order to achieve the credit rating required to finance wheat exporting and pool payments after government underwriting is withdrawn in 1999. At that time, the financial markets will still be dealing with the same entity but the source of financial support will change. Furthermore, providiI)g for the AWB to conduct its activities through corporations law companies will assist in developing commercial disciplines and practices which are typically found in commercial organisations. It will allow the AWB to formulate and implement appropriate controls and accountability arrangements between the various subsidiaries, which can be carried over once legislative controls are removed. It will also establish a strong base for the new company as a commercial wheat marketer for the review of the export monopoly under the national competition policy in 1999-2000. The matters raised by the shadow minister, such as access to WIF by growers after 1999 and settling a commercial rate of return for shareholders after 1999, are not germane to this bill. As the minister explained in his second reading speech, the government will specifically address matters such as transferring WIF into grower held shares in a second tranche of legislation next year. However, 30 June 1999 is now less than two years away. It is imperative to put action in train now to provide for the AWB to reorganise itself to become a fully commercial company in 1999. To do so would put at risk the continued provision of the best marketing services for the wheat growers of Australia. For this reason, the government does not support the amendment but commends the legislation to the House.

296,Mr TRUSS,NOES,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (8.53 p.m.}by leave-I move government amendments Nos 1 to 8: (1) Clause 20, page 13 (after line 12), after the definition of pool, insert: pool return wheat means wheat bought by the Board before the commencement of this section for sale as part of a pool and on terms requiring payment for the wheat to be made according to Division 3 of Part 4 of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989.

NOES (8) Schedule 1, item 131, page 59 (line 8), omit ""that section continues"", substitute ""those sections continue"". PAIRS The government amendments to the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997 make minor technical changes to two areas, in response to representations by the industry. The first area relates to the deemed agency arrangements in the bill, which allow the Australian Wheat Board to operate as an agent of the new holding and pooling companies---companies A and B-between 1 July 1997 and the commencement of operation of this legislation. The deemed agency arrangements are designed to avoid the need to have different pools, operated by the AWB and nominated company B, for wheat of the 1997-98 season. The original wording in the bill would have resulted in these deemed agency arrangements applying to the AWB' s cash trading operations as well as to pooling, which was not the intention. For example, futures contracts for cash-traded wheat would have become the responsibility of company B, the pooling company, rather than of companies A or C, which will be responsible for non-pool activities. The second matter relates to the AWB' s activities in connection with old seasons' wheat-that is, wheat of the 1996-97 and earlier seasons. The bill was intended to enable the statutory AWB to undertake all the activities necessary to finalise the pools for wheat of these seasons-for example, meeting export contracts and making further pool payments to growers. However, in the absence of this amendment to grandfather all of the current functions of the AWB for old seasons' wheat, the AWB would have been unable to continue to refinance borrowings associated with that wheat, to the obvious detriment of growers delivering to those pools. I commend these amendments to the House and present a supplementary explanatory memorandum.",100
297,Mr OKEEFE,NOES," Mr Deputy Speaker Forrest, I join other members in congratulating you on your appointment to the Speaker's Panel. The opposition is comfortable with these amendments, as we have indicated. I make the point that I found the government's position in the d.ivision that just took place very strange. The whole point of the amendment was to postpone the passage of the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill for a few more days so that we could consider the Senate committee's report, which is due to come down in a couple of days. I find it quite strange that you would go out as a government and ask Senator Crane, the chairman of the committee, for approval to go off and get this inquiry into this legislation going and then rush the bill through the House without waiting to see what the committee has to say. Who knowsthey may have some comments to make about these amendments. At this stage, we are in the dark about the deliberations of the committee. Given that, the more detailed discussion of those matters will have to take place in the Senate. I find the whole situation quite strange. But, as I said, we are comfortable supporting these amendments. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Truss)-by leaveread a third time. NA Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 October, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Gareth Evans moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that: (1) native title rights, including on pastoral leases, are fundamental legal property rights, acknowledged and upheld as such by the High Court, and entitled to the same respect and protection as the property rights of non-Indigenous Australians: any amendment of the Native Title Act in response to the Wik decision or for any other reason must fully reflect that reality; (2) it is in the national interest that the Act balance and reconcile to the maximum possible extent the interests and reasonable expectations of both Indigenous Australians and other major stakeholders-farmers, miners and Australian taxpayers generally; (3) it is both in the national interest, and in the interests of Indigenous Australians, farmers and miners, that there be the maximum possible predictability and certainty about the status of the Act and its practical operation; (4) there is a need, in particular, to guarantee the constitutional validity of the legislation, by ensuring that legislation operates for the net benefit of Indigenous Australians; (5) it is also in everyone's interest that the processes established by this legislation to deal with the registration and determination of claims, .and the reconciliation of competing interests, be as effective and expeditious as possible; (6) there are aspects of the Bill which may advance these objectives, in particular by encouraging and assisting the entering into of agreements, and by setting a stricter regime for the registration of claims; (7) nonetheless, the Bill is seriously deficient, and requires substantial amendment, in many respects, including: (i) the reach of the validation provisions beyond that which is necessary for the practical redress of post-Wik problems; (ii) the manifestly unacceptable over-reach of 1997 the provisions purporting to confirm the extinguishment of native title where exclusive tenure has previously been involved; (iii) the unnecessarily broad application, in relation to coexistence on pastoral leases, of the statutory authorisation of non-pastoral activities; (iv) the unnecessarily broad application of extinguishment in relation to the provision of government services and public works; (v) the indefensibly limited test for allowing statutory access rights for registered claimants; (vi) the dramatic limitation of the right to negotiate, and in particular its effective elimination in relation to mining on pastoral leases, which (along with the provisions amounting to direct or de facto extinguishment) significantly tilts the balance of the legislation against Indigenous Australians; (vii) the unacceptable limitation on the effective enjoyment of the right to negotiate which is involved in powers of early ministerial intervention; (viii) the absurd and counterproductive sunset clause, which will simply ensure a proliferation of ambit claims under the Act, and the pursuit of future claims through expensive and complex common law processes; (ix) the, inappropriately rigid and legalistic constraints on Registrars in the management of claims; and (x) the inappropriate introduction of formal rules of evidence, and limitations on the extent to which cultural and customary concerns can be taken into account, in the Federal Court claims process"".",100
298,Mrs STONE,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"As I was saying on 2 October, when I beg-n this speech on the Native Title Amendment Bill, the High Court rejection of Aboriginal property rights in 1972 meant that the Aboriginal land right activists and their supporters were most concerned. They responded by erecting the tent embassy on the lawns of Parliament House. Their placards proclaimed 'Land now; not lease tomorrow'. It was Australia Day 1972. The Whitlam government, elected in that year, responded by making a campaign commitment to introduce legislation for native land rights. Justice Edward Woodward was appointed a royal commissioner to advise this new government in relation to the granting of rights to land to indigenous people. Three years later, in 1975 and eight years after their initial walk-off, the Gurindji were given leasehold only access to some 3,000 square kilometres, a part of the land they had claimed. It was not until the Fraser government that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act was proclaimed and the Gurindji finally received freehold title to the area they had always called their home. An heroic figure, Mr Eddie Mabo, then, almost single handedly and over many years, pursued the issue of recognition of his title to his market garden on the island of Murray in the Torres Strait Islands. Eddie Mabo died before the final determination was made but in 1992 in the MerianlMabo decision of the Australian High Court it was found that indigenous Australian people had held and in some cases could continue to have a common law right to claim native title. The concept of terra nullius was no longer to be the foundation of our law regarding who once owned and who continues to have some rights to title to some land in Australia. Following Mabo No.2, the Labor government moved quickly to frame native title legislation to give effect to the outcomes of the Mabo High Court determination. By 1993 the act was in place. A native title tribunal was established with state governments allowed to set up alternative processes. The act, as I have said before, was well intentioned. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said: ... it aimed to provide an expeditious, cost effective and less legalistic alternative to resolving matters on a case by case basis in common law actions. The act validated potentially invalid past acts of government such as grants of interest in land since the commencement of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Following the successful Wik High Court challenge that focused on the question of extinguishment of native title over pastoral leases, some 78 per cent of the Australian land mass became potentially subject to native title claim. It is now 1997, 100 years since those Victorian Aboriginals first brought their claims for land to the parliament in Melbourne. And what has this Native Title Act 1993 achieved for indigenous Australians? How has it protected the rights of all Australians so they continue to have secure access to the land and water resources necessary to sustain a developed society? How has it fostered respect for Aboriginal and Islander culture or a recognition of their unique status as indigenes? The answer, of course, is that this act is deeply flawed and it has, in factbut inadvertently-contributed to a deterioration in inter-race relations throughout this country. This government is committed to the policy of self-determination first flagged for the Australian government by Sir William MCMahon in 1972. It hurts me deeply that our government's motives have been called into question, because we see the need to make this act work in a fair and practical way. As has been acknowledged by the opposition, Labor was in the process of amending the act when it lost office. It is a pity that it took so long to address the obvious problems. A great deal of goodwill has been lost on the side of both the claimants and those whose interests will be impacted by native title. In developing this bill our government has had four objectives: to reduce the current uncertainty in all things related to the act; to make the native title claim process work; to find a balance between the interests of all parties; and, most importantly, to foster and maintain a respect for Australian native title. These amendments will provide certainty by confirming that native title has already been extinguished throughout Australia on freehold, residential and commercial tenures. As well, it confirms extinguishment of native title where exclusive possession was either expressly confirmed or must have been intended when an agricultural lease was granted. It will not be possible to make native title claims over land where extinguishment of native title has been confirmed-and this country needed that sort of certainty. But no native title rights will be acquired or impaired without fair and just compensation, and this government sees that it is the responsibility of governments to pay that compensation. Of great concern to all Australians is the continued guaranteed access to the use of our air and water resources. Water has a special significance in my electorate where we all, the Kooris and the non-indigenous people, depend on and share a deep love for the mighty Murray River system. These amendments confirm the right of governments to manage and regulate water resources like the Murray river system for the good of all. Current Aboriginal access on pastoral leases should be and will be guaranteed where indigenous people can demonstrate that they had this access in December 1996 and can satisfy the revised registration test. Their continued access will be confirmed pending determination of their native title claim by the court. Revised registration tests for native title claimants will ensure that there is faster resolution of claims, a better balance between the interests of all native title holders and the need to ensure that Australia's economic development is not impeded. Australia was not a deserted continent when Captain Cook raised the Union Jack in 1770. At that time there were several hundred independent tribal entities who defended their borders and acknowledged each other's sovereignty in each home country. Captain Cook described the coastal tribes of what he called New Holland in detail in his journal. His entry for August 1770 read: They live in a tranquillity which is not disturbed by the inequality of condition. The earth and sea of their own accord furnishes them with all things necessary for life. They covet not Magnificent Houses, Household stuff, ... they live in a warm and fine Climate, and enjoy every Wholesome air . . . in short they seemed to set no value upon anything of their own nor anyone Article we - ould offer them. Well, looks are deceiving. The Aboriginal people, the indigenes, valued their land, as every human society does. We dispossessed these people in the process of forming this great Australian nation. In that dispossession process lives were lost in battle and through sickness, disease and despair. The legacy of the dispossession lives on. The ABS statistics of 1997 reveal: . Indigenous Australians suffer a higher burden of illness and die at a younger age than non-indigenous Australians and this is true of almost every type of disease or condition for which information is available. In the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia, Aboriginals have a life expectancy 15 to 20 years lower than for the rest of the population. Mr Michael Dodson, a dedicated Aboriginal leader, brings home the human consequences of this sickness, and disease, and its intergenerational impact. He says: The statistics of shortened life expectancy are our mothers and fathers, uncles, aunties and elders who live diminished lives and die before their gifts of knowledge and experience are passed on. We die silently under these statistics. Sir William Deane, the Governor General, speaking at the inaugural Lingiari lecture, said: the past is never fully gone. I agree with him when he says: that true reconciliation between the Australian nation and its indigenous peoples is not achievable in the absence of acknowledgment by the nation of the wrongfulness of the past dispossession, oppression and degradation of the Aboriginal peoples. That is not to say that individual Australians who had no part in what was done in the past should feel or acknowledge personal guilt. It is simply to assert our identity as a nation and the basic fact that national shame as well as national pride can and should exist in relation to past acts and sions at least when they have been done or made in the name of the community or with the authority of the government. Where there is no room for national pride or national shame about the past there can be no national soul. These amendments to the Native Title Act 1993 go to the heart of the reconciliation process that this nation so badly needs. Our government is committed to a better future for all Australians. We know the act in its present form is not working; it is harming all Australians. We know it takes very much more than fine intentions to make this Native Title Act work. I commend this bill to the House.",102
299,Mr LEO MCLEAY,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Watson) (9.08 p.m.)It is with a sad heart that I join in this debate here tonight. The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 has been discussed quite broadly in the community and is held to be in great odour by many sections of the community. The government is claiming that this bill will fix up a mess, that it will give all the parties a renewed opportunity to get on with the job and to build a more secure, certain and prosperous Australia for all Australians. They are great words, but the trouble is that this bill is not going to do this for all Australians. It is heavily biased towards specific groups of Australians, amongst whom are some of the most privileged and well-off members of our community. It is actually going to detract from the rights of another group within our community-un arguably a group that is less well off, and that is the Aboriginal community-by permitting the extinguishment of most native title rights and allowing pastoralists to upgrade their leases to full primary production. The High Court's decision in Mabo No. 2 left unanswered questions such as where native title exists, who holds native title and the nature of that title. It also opened up the possibility of extensive litigation in the courts. The Native Title Act 1993 was enacted in order to provide a statutory framework for deciding questions left unanswered by the Mabo decision. Members will recall that the Western Australian government challenged the validity of that act and its application in that state. The High Court, with one small OIniSexception, found unanimously that the act was a valid exercise of the Commonwealth's race powers. There have been other court cases that have had implications for the Native Title Act 1993. There has also been considerable discussion and lots of papers have been written and circulated on this matter. In particular, the Wik decision produced quite a reaction. In December 1996 the High Court held that pastoralists' rights and native title rights could coexist on the same land, although native title rights would have to yield to the rights of pastoralists to the extent of any inconsistencies. The government responded to this decision by releasing its iniquitous lO-point plan, with sweeping cutbacks to native title especially on pastoral leases. In effect, the government panicked. This legislation before the House tonight incorporates the government's lO-point plan and goes even further in its curtailment of native title. Native title will be extinguished forever on many types of land which is essentially public land-land dedicated for public works, land grants from one government to another or to a statutory authority and land subject to community purpose leases--even where there is minimal or no conflict between the public use and native title uses. Indeed, native title can be extinguished by the construction of a Telstra telephone tower, by a road that no longer exists or by an overland telegraph line. If anything that may have been granted for government or for community purposes in the past is part of an area that is claimed for native title, it can extinguish that native This is a con and a sham of the worse type. Native title rights which are inconsistent with pastoralists' rights will be extinguished on all land which has at any time since colonisation been pastoral leasehold. That is incredible. It is retrospectivity at its absolute worse. Pastoralists will be permitted to upgrade to full primary production. Native title rights which are inconsistent with new primary production activities-virtually all native title rights-will be extinguished forever. Pastoralists will be successful. Indigenous fishing rights will be extinguished in practice, since all future grants of other fishing rights will take precedence over indigenous fishing rights. Once again, the government is overriding the rights of people who have had those rights for centuries. The government not only will do this but will retrospectively validate hundreds of unlawful mining leases on pastoral land which have been issued by state governments that are often willing to quite happily flout the Native Title Act. Although extinguishment may be very rapid, Aboriginal people will still have to prove native title before they can be compensated, and various technicalities will make native title very difficult to prove. It will be an expensive and complicated process that I am sure the government accepts will be very off-putting for those involved, particularly indigenous peoples. The right to negotiate over proposed developments on native title land will be gutted, leaving traditional owners with negligible ability to protect their heritage. These are the people who cared for this country for 40,000 years before European settlement. Even where they are theoretically possible, there will be little incentive for negotiated agreements in rural areas and, for what remains of native title, the threshold test for lodging title claims will be set far too high and at too short a cut-off time of six years for claims to be introduced. This government is effectively saying to indigenous people,. 'You've got to have a very speedy way of dealing with this matter or it will be far too late.' This is a group of people in our society title. who probably have the least power of any group in Australia at present, and the government is saying to them that they must be able to mount these claims quickly and that they must be able to meet the threshold tests, which are very difficult, to say the least. Access to land before native title claims have been decided will be restricted to people with current physical access, making it impossible for those forced off their land in the past. It is no good saying that the government believes that people should have the right to fish or to camp or to use land for ceremonial purposes when it says that it is only for those who currently have access. There are many dispossessed indigenous groups in this country who just want those simple rights, but the government is willing to say that they cannot have them. The government's legislation is divisive and, indeed, I believe, racially discriminatory. It incorporates a distinction which is based on race in that it seeks to extinguish only those property rights held by indigenous people. However, what concerns me about this legislation is the hard line of the government. I cannot understand why there cannot be negotiations on these matters. You do not have to extinguish people's rights. The Aboriginal people are willing to negotiate, and so are others. We on this side of the House would be willing to work with the government to improve the current act, but our offer to do so was rejected. We believe that it is genuinely possible to find accommodation on all the key issues between the various crucial stakeholdersindigenous people, miners and farmers. With goodwill on all sides, including that of the government, such a sensible outcome should be possible. We have seen that occur already in some parts of Australia. We have seen people of goodwill being able to get together and overcome a lot of these barriers. But unfortunately the government has been driven by people who do not have any goodwill in their heart or any kindness in their soul. This legislation is not a sensible outcome. I am sure that most people do not want native rights to be determined in the way the government is proposing. I am sure that most decent, genuine Australians are happy to see Aboriginals and indigenous people in this country having these rights. We have seen the outpouring of concern from people right across Australia for such things as the stolen children report. We saw the amazing result of the referendum which was held many years ago to give the Commonwealth the power to legislate about Aboriginals. The Australian people in most instances, when one says to them that we really do have to find some way of coming to terms with the original inhabitants of this country, have a genuine desire to do so-but the government does not seem to think that. There are large numbers of Australians who are appalled by what the government is proposing, and they are determined. to do something about it. Around Australia groups of people from all walks of life are forming. They are concerned about the implications of this legislation, and they want everyone, including Aboriginal people, to get a fair go. Witness the 60,000 multicoloured hands that were planted recently in the lawns of this place as a display of support for Aboriginal reconciliation. The Aboriginal people themselves support coexistence and want everyone's rights to be respected. Coexistence can work. The important thing for us as Australians to understand is that, a country of migrants, we will always be a migratory people unless we can come to some terms and some reconciliation with the original inhabitants of this country. I do not think we as Australians will really know who and what we are unless we can come to terms with the original inhabitants of this land. Unless we do that, we will just be a group of neo-colonialists ourselves. I do not think Australians want that. I think Australians want ours. to feel a security in their country, this country. The only way we can come to terms with that is by coming to terms with the original inhabitants of this country. The Aboriginal people of this country support coexistence. They are not saying that we should leave or that they want to curtail our rights. They just think we should try to recognise some of their rights. Extinguishing native title will not work. This legislation, if passed, is certain to be contested by lawyers. In fact, it has been reported that the Australian Law Reform Commission, forbidden from putting its submission to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title, considers that the plan effectively will extinguish native title on pastoral leases and that that is unconstitutional. Members of the government might say, 'Well, that's just one voice.' But there are so many of these voices saying that this legislation is flawed. There are many, many voices saying this is a very, very flawed piece of legislation. There will be more, not less, litigation. There will be more, not less, uncertainty because of this piece of legislation. One final point we should consider is that this legislation will do Australia no good in international forums. Laws which are discriminatory against one group of society will bring Australia into disrepute. We will be subject to criticism that we can ill afford, particularly when we set ourselves up as supporters of human rights and advocates of the elimination of discrimination. This is a bad law. This is a law that will cause trouble in our country. This is a law that the government should never have brought into this place. I know there are many people in this Parliament, and there are people as around Australia, who think that Aboriginals should not have rights that coexist with those of pastoralists. But I think one of the problems we have seen in this country is that, unless we can find a way of reconciling those of us who have been here for a short while with those of us who have been here for a long while, we will not advance as a country. I think this legislation is an impediment to that advancement of this great country of I think it is a terrible shame that we have to debate this legislation here in this parliament tonight. It is not a good law. It is a law that will cause disharmony. It is a law that will bring our country into disrepute. It is a law that will be contested in the courts and public forums for a long, long while. It is a shame that the government has not rethought this issue.",104
300,Mr ENTSCH,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise tonight to support strongly the government's Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. Also, at this point I congratulate both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Senator Minchin for their ability in developing what I believe to be a fair and balanced solution to a very difficult problem. On hearing of the Wik decision in December 1996, my first response was the simplistic view that legislative extinguishment appeared to be the only option. But after taking time firstly to consider the judgment and secondly to evaluate the options, I am of the view that this legislation is the best way of fairly addressing this difficult issue. It is little wonder that there is so much confusion and division within our community. You bnly need to go back to the development of the Native Title Act 1993 and read some of the statements made by then Prime Minister Keating, Senator Gareth Evans, Senator Bob Collins, Robert Tickner and others to see where our current problems originated. The intention to extinguish native title on pastoral leases was clearly stated in an article in the Australian on 20 October 1993 by political correspondent Laura Tingle in which she said: The genesis of the deal that eventually clinched Paul Keating's Mabo package emerged Sunday night in a phone call between the Government's special adviser on Mabo, Phillip Toyne, and the Executive Director of the NFF, Rick Farley. Mr Toyne had a proposition to put to Mr Farley, based on some proposals from the Cape York Land Council's Noel Pearson. The proposal was the Aborigines would concede the extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases in return for giving them access to the right to convert their pastoral leases into inalienable freehold. The article went on to say: Mr Keating called Rick Farley at 11.10 p.m. and put forward the proposition that the validation of pastoral leases would extinguish native title. The other side of the deal was that where Aborigines owned or commercially purchased pastoral leases, they should be able to convert the title to a fonn similar to native title. Mr Farley asked how much time he had to think about it. None, Mr Keating replied. Mr Farley said he accepted the deal. Mr Keating rang back later at 11.50 p.m. to confinn the deal had gone through Cabinet. So much for broad public consultation. Soon after that report, in response to a question in the National Press Club on 10 November 1993 Noel Pearson, a key player in the development of the 1993 legislation, made the following statement: Well, I rule out the possibility in Queensland of people pursuing any rights in relation to pastoral leases owned by non-Aboriginal people. I rule that out categorically because there is a facility now available for us to purchase under the land fund and to convert into native title pastoral leases. And it is not in our interest to pursue . . . pastoral leases. There is absolutely no doubt of the deal that was struck and it is little wonder people feel both confused andbetrayed. Mabo and Wik have turned the Australian land title system as we know it on its ear. We as a nation need to look at land tenure through a totally different set of eyes. While there are those who would argue that the whole issue should be left to the courts, I passionately believe that it is the responsibility of the parliament to provide a fair, certain and workable legal regime for the operation of native title. It would be totally irresponsible of any government to abrogate its responsibility by leaving this issue to the courts. I am not a lawyer, so I will leave the legal argument to those more qualified. What I do have, however, unlike the previous speaker, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), is a real life experience of the effect within the community, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians, with the current act. Its effects are: anxiety, uncertainty, division and unrealistic expectations from a deal some sections of our community. I submit an overview of three very different examples highlighting the effects of the current uncertainty. The first is an extract from a constituent's letter: I am the unfortunate victim of native title. My business, Coconut Slipway, is situated along the waterfront of Trinity Inlet in Cairns. A claim has been placed over the esplanade and surrounding waters by three separate tribes. We have been here since 1978 and maps date back to 1897 when it was originally pegged. We are not a pastoral leases or a mining lease, as is most commonly discussed by the media when they discuss native title matters. We are in the port of Cairns. Now we cannot expand or even comply with the Environmental Protection Act until the Native Title Act is sorted out. This is ridiculous. This nation crying out for small businesses to work harder and employ more people and here we are being stopped by a native title claim ... [We] cannot effect any structural improvements. Neither can we spend any more money improving our business. We have been informed by the Department of Natural Resources that this could take anywhere up to 10 years to resolve. The second example is of a young family who are the lessees of an occupational licence that was originally granted in 1887. It has been used continuously since for grazing. In 1993 the family submitted a three-year development plan for the property and in doing so applied for a tenure upgrade. In short they were unable to identify any traditional owners but when the licence was advertised for claim in newspapers by the Native Title Tribunal a claim was lodged in May 1995. Unperturbed, the family had face-to-face contact with the claimants, a deal was quickly struck and a mutually acceptable access agreement was reached. Unfortunately, through the intervention of local land councils the deal was rescinded. The family was prevented from having any further contact with the actual claimants and the last proposal put by the land council was for the family to surrender their lease to the claimant group, then lease back the property they had worked so hard to develop on terms and conditions set by the claimant bodyhardly coexistence. This process has now been going on for over three years and the financial impact on the family has been devastating. I should say that at this point in time there is absolutely no resolution in sight. There has been an estimation with regard to the cost of running that claim by the native title group representative body of some $2Y2 million. The family involved have spent, I think, $13,OOO-odd at this stage, of which they have been able to access $4,000 in sl,lpport from the government. They are in dire straits. They certainty do not have any resources to be able to defend their rights. My third example is rather interesting too. An Aboriginal pastoral lease holder and his Aboriginal wife have a native title claim lodged over their property, with one of their is claimants being his own mother. I do not need to tell the House the anguish and division this type of action has wrought on this family. I am amazed at the misinformation from some quarters about the content and intent of this legislation. We have Aboriginal activists on six-figure salaries talking about poverty. We have lawyers engaged by Aboriginal interests arguing for ongoing uncertainty, secure in the knowledge that they, more than any other interest group, have benefited from the current legislation. The same lawyers to date have shared with some land councils close to $90 million of taxpayers' money over the last five years on native title issues. It would not be difficult to adopt a cynical view that these groups are more focused on their own self-interest than on looking after the interests of grassroots Aboriginal communities. We also have church groups who clearly have little or no understanding of the legislation and base their arguments solely on those of the activists and their lawyers and who take a philosophical and high moral ground with little or no consideration for reality. Given their contribution to the destruction of indigenous cultures in the past, I find it somewhat hypocritical. I would urge the church leaders to actually get into the communities and talk to all parties affected and therefore be more constructive and supportive in finding a solution for all Australians rather than being judgmental. Given the extent of the legislation, it is impossible to speak on all aspects, but I will focus on a few. Suggestions that this legislation is blanket extinguishment is nonsense. The effect of Wik was to more than double the extent to which native title may-the operative word here is 'may' - exist, in effect increasing from over 30 per cent of Australia that which is vacant Crown land and Aboriginal land to include a further 42 per cent of Australia that is pastoral lease land and where coexisting native title may now exist. These amendments now make available to Aboriginal Australians 85 per cent of the land mass for claims. The higher threshold certainly protects the interests of legitimate native title claimants by preventing an ongoing avalanche of frivolous and vexatious claims. This will certainly allow legitimate claims to be finalised more quickly while at the same time not bogging down other land-holders with multiple and overlapping claims. Much has been said with regard to access to pastoral leases. As somebody who knows, let me assure the House, particularly those on the other side, that in the greatest majority of cases access for legitimate reasons by Aboriginal people is welcomed by pastoral leaseholders, lifelong friendships have been nurtured and cultural differences have been respected. This is encouraged in our legislation. It saddens me when I hear assertions from those of the chardonnay set in metropolitan Australia with no concept of the reality of bush living that the Aboriginals and pastoralists in rural Australia are in continual conflict. There has been a lot of criticism with respect to the effect of schedule 4 in the amendment bill and that it will represent bucketloads of extinguishment. Again, I suggest that this sort of emotive hysteria is clearly unfounded. The reality is that schedule 4 represents less than 7.7 per cent of the Australian land mass and only contains those titles other than freehold-and I might point out that freehold in this country represents only 14 per cent-which clearly grants the land-holder exclusive possession. That is in line with the Mabo decision which, in part, states: The personal rights confirmed by common law native title do not constitute an estate or interest the land itself. They are extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in the land by the Crown such as a grant in fee or a lease conferring the right to exclusive possession. It is absolutely crucial to ensure that these titles are clearly defined. In order to bring some clarity to the issue, it should also be noted that all states in the development of schedule 4 have confirmed that we as a government have taken a very conservative approach to this matter and any titles in doubt have been rejected. I believe that no clearer example could be given than that of the New South Wales western grazing leases. I really do not think it is appropriate for us to be able to open up other opportunities for those few lawyers who tend to prey on the uncertainly here in an attempt to be able to pay for their own superannuation. In this day of litigation I think we need to be able to clearly define those areas where there is no doubt so that we can at least provide some certainty to the holders of those titles and also to not raise the expectations of Aboriginal people to a point where they believe that they may have some entitlement to that land. Another nonsense being peddled by interest groups opposing the bill suggests a windfall benefit for a few foreigners and wealthy pastoral families. There is no provision to allow for wholesale freeholding of leasehold land. In fact, there is a mechanism specifically to prevent this from happening. There has always been a provision for upgrading for special purposes, and this will continue. The cost to the leaseholder for these upgrades has been such that it is done on a needs basis. When I listen to the arguments here there has always been a suggestion that this cost will be imposed at a cost to the taxpayer and for the benefit of a few. I can assure you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that any cost of upgrading is borne by the leaseholder and what they intend to do with what land determines whether or not they intend to upgrade that small section of their pastoral lease to give them a greater income. Not only is there a cost in the actual upgrading but also there is a very significant increase in fees or rentals for that upgrade in tenure. It is something that in is not taken lightly and it is only done if they can justify an increase in revenue from the area which they intend to upgrade. Land matters have been and of course will continue to be dealt with at state and territory level. They are not done at a federal level; they have been and will continue to be done at a state level. The provision which broadens the nature of the activities that can be carried out on a pastoral lease is in line with primary production as defined in the tax act and is only acknowledging what currently exists. I think it would be most inappropriate for us as a government to lock in pastoral leases in a snapshot in time. The intende,d use of the original pastoral leases back in the early 1880s has certainly changed in the last 100 years. We have no idea what is likely to happen in the next 100 years. To lock them into a snapshot in time is most inappropriate and certainly would guarantee that the holders of these leases are doomed for failure. Those people who argue that we lock them into this particular concept of the original intention of the pastoral leases are the same people who will argue very strongly that, now we are talking in the 20th and 21st century, Aboriginal traditional hunting will include aluminium boats, outboard motors, firearms and four-wheel drive vehicles. I have no problem with that. It is part of developing society. But why should acknowledgment be given to one group of Australians to be able to move their culture with technology while another group of Australians are compelled to be held in a concept that was developed in the early 19th century? It is extremely unreasonable and most inappropriate. Another thing is that they are always arguing about these foreign interests having massive windfalls. Foreign interest on pastoral lease land in this country totals about 3.8 per cent' of the pastoral lease area. Australian companies and established 'wealthy' - I use the word very loosely-pastoral family holdings have a similar amount. It may shock some on the other side and some of those that are opposing this legislation to know that the single largest pastoral lease holders are Aboriginal people themselves. Along with their own land holding interests, they currently own in excess of 15.3 per cent of Australia's mass. The balance of pastoral leases is held by average Australian families-bush battlers. On 1997 statistics each of these families possess an average debt of $132,000 per family and generate an average income of $47,100 per family. What we might be really surprised about, given the current difficulties with drought and stock prices, et cetera, is average profit is presently a negative $1,400 per annum. You could hardly suggest that they are the privileged silver spoon set. We need to consider these things when we are looking at this legislation and, while we are the first to accept that Aboriginal people have been disadvantaged, we must make sure also that we do not continue that disadvantage by perpetuating our sins onto another group of Australians. I am running out of time, but in wrapping up let me say that there are numerous other aspects of the bill that will need to be covered and I look forward to speaking on them at a later time. I do believe that the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 is a balanced and responsible legislative means of reflecting the outcomes of Mabo and Wik in such a way as to protect the legitimate native title rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians while at the same time giving security and certainty to all other land title holders of this nation. I commend the bill to the House.",107
301,Mr CAMPBELL,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 is a monument to indecisive and gutless government. The truth is that even with all the time the government has had at its disposal it has come forward with a bill that does not go as far as Paul Keating thought his own legislation went. Paul Keating was adamant that' pastoral leases extinguish native title. Paul Keating believed that in his bill there was a prima facie case. It is in the prologue to the act; it is not in the body of the act. When it was first established the Native Title Tribunal rejected many claims as being vexatious and without merit. The legal service took the matter to the court and the court held that it was not in the act. In my view a responsible court would have acknowledged that it was a terribly badly drafted' bill but that the intention of the government was clear and advised the government to amend its legislation; instead, it opened it up so that any Aboriginal anywhere in Australia could claim any land. As our ex-Governor General Bill Hayden said, this has turned into no more than the right to extortion. The right to negotiate is no more than the right to extortion and that the that is the way it has been used. What is native title? The High Court has had ample opportunity and so far has refused to define it. Yet you hear people in this House, lawyers, amnesty groups and churches equating native title with property rights-one of the speakers on the Labor side today was doing just this. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that that need necessarily be the case. Native title might be no more than the right to hunt and gather. If that is the case, compensation is minimal. I went to see John Howard when he became Prime Minister because I had goodwill towards him. I said to him that I thought he ought to move quickly to extinguish native title, to bring in legislation to put it beyond doubt so that Australia would know how the government felt. His response to me was, 'Oh, that would be far too controversial. I am going to leave it to the court.' I told him the court was not to be trusted, to which he said in rather aggrieved tones, 'Well, Paul Keating thinks it is.' I acknowledged that that was the case and also that Keating was wrong. It is matter of history now that I was right on that occasion. He said, 'Anyway, you wouldn't get it through the Senate.' I reminded him that, as Prime Minister, his responsibility was to put forward the legislation and the views of his party, to put it to the parliaern ment and, if it was rejected, be prepared to take it to a double dissolution, which I felt absolutely sure he would have won. He was not prepared to do that, so I went off to see Senator Nick Minchin, who was the senator with special responsibilities in this area. He said to me, 'The real problem is that we have as many bleeding hea.rts on our side as there are in the Labor Party.' And that is the real reason you have seen this gutless legislation brought forward: I represent more Aboriginals than any other politician in this parliament, and I know what they are saying to me. From the north to the south of Australia, they are saying to me that native title means nothing to them; there is nothing in it for them. It was described to me by a leading Aboriginal as 'white fella humbug for white lawyers' and he is absolutely right. They know that there is nothing there for them except the backlash, and that backlash is inevitable. The sad thing that all people who generated it will move on-many of them will become white again-and leave the Aboriginal, who has not been fuelling this, who has not been making these demands, who simply wants to get on with life and participate, to carry this burden. We hear this glib talk of coexistence from members of parliament who never deal with Aboriginal people. It is not coexistence that is being sought; it is apartheid. That is what is being put forward, and many Aboriginal people in my electorate understand this fully and they hate it. They reject it in its entirety. They say to me, 'We are all Australians and we must go forward together.' And that is what I want. I want for the Aboriginal people, for the Aboriginal kids of this world, what I want for my kids. I want progress. I do not that want to leave them in some little isolated cocoon. I do not want to leave them victims to some self-appointed Aboriginal leaders. You find the Uniting Church synod, an entity totally out of touch with its constituency, with its own congregation, actually putting forward the idea of a black state in Australia-not in New South Wales or Victoria, of course, but in Western Australia or the NorthTerritory. This idea is known to my Aboriginal constituency and they are frightened of it. They know that this black princedom will be run by white princes and they want no part of it. But who is listening to them? We see everywhere the self-appointed spokesmen. Up until the time Keating became Prime Minister, he did not give a damn about Aboriginal people. Then it was, 'Quick, quick, get me some Aboriginals.' He said to Mr Balderstone, the only man to survive from the Keating cabinet, 'Get me Aboriginals.' So Mr Balderstone traipsed off to the Northern Land Council and put together a list of some 36 Aboriginals from across Australia. I do not know much about the eastern state ones but I know this: of the six appointed from Western Australia, I said at the time that I would be prepared to stand in an election where only Aboriginal people voted against anyone of them and I could guarantee I would win, because those people had no respect, no those acknowledgment, from the great mass of Aboriginal people, who were never consulted and still are not consulted. The real issue facing Aboriginals is not access to land. The statistics show this. Where Aboriginals have been alienated from land longest, their per capita income, their health and their welfare is generally much better. The issues facing Aboriginal people generally are housing, hygiene, health, education, and training and employment, probably in that order, but everyone is essential. Leave one off and the whole cart falls over. What do we do? We rush around attacking one or the other. There is never a concerted, combined attack on that whole issue of what needs to be done to drag Aboriginal people along with us. I believe it is about time we had some real compassion, some real thought and some real effort put into this business. Let's face it, it is not an insurmountable problem. You are talking about less than two per cent of our population. Certainly we could deal with it if there was any consistent will there. It is not lack of money, because we are putting something like $2.5 billion a year into the Aboriginal industry. That is including a billion dollars combined from the states. That is enough to buy every Aboriginal family in Australia a brand new house every two years. If it wasn't for the price of land in Sydney you could do it even quicker. Just imagine that: every two years we are spending enough to buy every Aboriginal family a brand new house. But it is not happening. The money is not getting down to the ground, and Aboriginal people know it is not. They know that the community at large is starting to say, 'Where are our taxes going?' But they know the money is not going to them. It is being absorbed by the Aboriginal industry, which believes that its survival depends on keeping this demand for Aboriginal improvement alive; in other words, they cannot allow any real improvement. The Indigenous Lands Council, which has come up as an offshoot of this legislation, is now proposing to buy 10 stations in Western Australia, the Green stations. These are good stations in the main part, but they are difficult stations to manage. It is calling for expressions of interest, and the state government is joining with it in this venture, yet there is not enough money to properly fund the Aboriginal stations that already exist. So you have got Aboriginal stations out there which are just churning round and round, with people sniggering up their sleeves saying, 'These black fell as are hopeless,' when the money is never there to make sure that the stations can develop. Typical of what happens is that, instead of providing funds on 1 July, the money is not put in until very late in the season, often just before the wet season. The Aboriginals, knowing that if they cannot get it started before the wet they will have to return the money to the government, get in a white contractor. So what do we say? We say, 'Look at those Aboriginals, getting the gubba into do the work.' It is not their fault; it is the only way they can get it done. If they don't, the money chums around. It is given back the next year at the same time and the same thing happens. We see statements then made about the money these stations get. We do not see the money that is returned. We see that over and over again. What do we do? We propose to go out and buy more stations so that we can have more of this abject poverty out there and not develop the stations we have. Some of the people in this House have talked about the importance of our reputation in Asia. Let me tell you that Asia does not give a damn. If you look throughout Asia, their record of· treating their indigenous people has almost inevitably been extinguishment-not of titles but of a person. That has been the case throughout Asia. There is no regard for indigenous people. When people understand how much money per capita is expended on indigenous people in Australia, they get an idea of just what an effort the taxpayer of this country has made. It is, I agree, an effort in the main part wasted, but that is not the fault of the taxpayer or of the Aboriginal; it is the fault of the lack of government will. You see so much emotional nonsense talked on these issues. I was on a committee when we had a visit from an eminent health group-the chairman of the medical association and some other people-and they came to us with the biggest load of hogwash you ever heard in your life. They said to us, 'It is disgraceful that spending on diabetes in Aboriginals is much less than it is on the white population,' but they knew when questioned that Aboriginal diabetes was almost all type 2, or adult onset, whereas in the white population it was type 1, or juvenile onset, which you treat with drugs. Type 1 is more expensive; you treat type 1 with drugs which the patients have to take for the whole of their life. The other is treated with diet and tablets. Of course there is no comparison on the cost. When this was pointed out, they agreed. Even one of the speakers on the government side was lamenting that reports showed that the lifespan of indigenous people in this country is 20 years less than the white population's and well below that of indigenous populations elsewhere. Had they taken the lifespan of indigenous people in southern New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, they would have found it is actually fairly comparable. In the Northern Territory, for instance, the greatest cause of death among young females is murder. How can we be blamed for that? The problem is that, in a sense, we can because we never demanded any accountability and nobody in the industry has ever offered it. I blanch when I think of statements in this House at the presentation of the report on so-called stolen generation and of the despic-' able part played by the churches, for it the churches that were urging government: 'It is your Christian duty,' they were saying the government, 'to take these children for their sake.' Yet they are now trying to put the blame on the taxpayer. Hypocrisy is alive these people. and well in the churches of this nation, and I do not think they deserve any consideration whatsoever. In the few minutes that are left to want to say this: I support very strongly measures to improve the lot of Aboriginal people. I am happy to see increased funding for this purpose if the moriey is used properly. I believe that most Australians feel that I feel most Australians would concur with notion that to treat unequals equally is discriminatory as to treat equals unequally, but that is not happening and the Native Title Amendment Bill will do nothing to make it happen, nor will any of the proposals of the Labor Party. The government will go on funding the present disgrace. They will be funding the extortion, they will be funding the lawyers and they will be funding those people in the industry whose very money is made out of squeezing the lifeblood out of Aboriginal people. So much is talked of Aboriginal culture. We now have a growth industry in this country in inventing Aboriginal culture. I was on a committee that went around Australia looking at Aboriginal education. Not once did we get asked by an Aboriginal community for Aboriginal language to be taught in schools. They said to us, 'That's our business. If we don't talk our language, it will die out and that is our decision. What we need from you is literacy. Teach us English.' That was said everywhere. We did not get a demand for Aboriginal languages until we got to universities where it was white academics pushing this case, not Aboriginal people. They knew that they had to speak English. As one who was explaining this to me said, 'I like my Warabi but what can I say in it? If I go to Alice Springs, I have got to talk to them Pits in English because they won't learn Warabi and I'm not going to learn Pitjantjatthe jara.' They knew that they had to have English, and that is what they wanted. Wherever was we went we were told by Aboriginal communities, 'Definitely no pidgin and definitely to none of our own languages-just teach us English.' Of course, we know so much better! all We have gone ahead and forced language on At Mount Barnett in my electorate, BiIIy King, a great man and a great Australian who ,was the head stockman for King ranches me I when most of the staff would have been white, now runs a community which has been starved of funds, but he has battled on regardless. It is a community where the people actually work just for the dole without any way. on-costs. That community agonised about a the school. They decided they needed a school. as They decided they did not want an independent Aboriginal school, so it boiled down to a state or a Catholic school, and they got an unconditional guarantee from the state that no Aboriginal culture would be taught. Billy King said that lasted as long as the first headmaster; with the next headmaster in came the Aboriginal culture. He said it was mainly eastern states based Koori culture. He said it had nothing to do with them at all and they had to spend all their time undoing the nonsense that was poked in their kids' heads by the primary school teaching of this mishmash, ersatz Aboriginal culture. The truth is that we do not care what the Aboriginal people care about or want. All this is designed to placate the affluent urban middle-class guilt of our cities. That is the problem, and you hear it repeatedly in this place from members who do not know an Aboriginal. Look at my own electorate. I will give you another example. A woman came to me and said, ' Mr Campbell, I feel so ashamed of myself. I used to love our Aboriginal people, but since I have been in Kalgoorlie I have hated them.' I said, 'Where do you come from?' She said, 'Applecross.' Applecross is a trendy suburb of Perth and you never see an Aboriginal there. I said, 'When you come to Kalgoorlie and you see fringe dwellers behaving antisocially, you adopt a different attitude when you seem them urinating in the street, when you get hassled in the supermarket for money, and if you don't give them any they abuse you. You are not being racist. Their behaviour is simply antisocial.' She went away quite relieved. I come across so many city based people who are unaware of the facts; they are unaware of what is really happening and do not want to know. All they want to do is placate that affluent urban middle-class guilt. The Aboriginal fellow who told me that it was 'White fella humbug' is a national hero. He has fought tenaciously against the bureaucracy. He was the fellow who came to me and said, when the government passed legislation to recognise the Aboriginal flag, 'We have had a discussion amongst our people. We don't fly flags in our culture, but if we are going to fly flags we are going to fly an Australian flag,' and I have supplied quite a lot of Australian flags to Aboriginal communities since that silly decision of the previous government. I get sickened by all the hyperbole in this place. I do not believe that there is any real concern for Aboriginal advancement. This bill is not going to do it. As I say, it does not go as far as Keating thought his own bill went. This is a monument to an indecisive and gutless government. My view is that the people of Australia have had enough. I think it is about time we put the whole thing to a constitutional referendum and let the people have a vote on it, and I can guarantee you there will be a lot of Aboriginal people voting to do away with it.",110
302,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. There are few bills that will come before this House that are going to have such a profound effect on all Australians. I would like very briefly to give a background to why we now have this bill before us. In the Mabo decision the High Court found there was a common law right to native title. As a response, the parliament brought in the Native Title Act 1993, which was introduced by the Keating government. I would like to share with you a statement by the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating. On 16 November 1993, he said: Only validated freehold grants, residential, commercial and pastoral or agricultural leases, and validated Crown actions basically involving permanent public works, will extinguish native title. While there was a recognition of native title it was plain that the Prime Minister of the day intended pastoral leases to extinguish native title. I would also like to read from a statement of the then Attorney-General, former Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans, on 18 December: . .. the High Court decision will confirm that properly granted pastoral leases, for example, do in fact extinguish native title. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said as much. That is our legal judgment, that is our belief, that although the High Court did leave a sliver of doubt-'That is where the quotation finishes. It is quite plain that the then Attorney-General intended that pastoral leases extinguish native title. I would like to read from the Hansard of 20 December 1993. The then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator the Hon. Bob Collins, had this to say: Queensland pastoral titles do not contain reservations like the reservations in the Northern Territory or Western Australian pastoral titles. If those are valid, they extinguish native title. Rick Farley, the then Executive Director of the National Farmers Federation, put on the public record the following statement: The NFF had firm undertakings from Mr Keating and the senior cabinet ministers that the government would ensure pastoral leases extinguish native title. On 10 February 1997, on an ABC Four Corners interview, Rick Farley had this response to a question: It was a very significant factor in the decision that NFF's council took to support the legislation and, of course, the Commonwealth view that a pastoral lease without reservations extinguishes native title was even included in the preamble to the act. It was quite plain to the government of the day, the National Farmers Federal believed, that native title was extinguished by pastoral lease. Noel Pearson was asked the following question by Ian Paterson of the ABC on 10 November 1993: Regarding valid pastoral leases, did you rule out the possibility of any legal action by Aboriginal groups? Noel Pearson's reply was as follows: Well, I rule out the possibility in Queensland of people pursuing any rights in relation to pastoral leases owned by non-Aboriginal people. I rule that out categorically, because there is a facility now available for us to purchase under the land fund, and to convert into native title, pastoral lease. So the deal was done and compensation was paid. What is the existing situation that we are now left with? As the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) has said, we now have 15.3 per cent of land provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. That is 117 million hectares for two per cent of the population352,970 people. How much land do you suppose the average man, woman and child in Australia owns? I can assure you it is a great deal less than 331 hectares per man, woman and child. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders of this country own an area greater than the size of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. That is an area greater than the titles United Kingdom, Germany and France combined. This does not include private land tenures because Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have the rights appropriately that all other Australians do to privately own land.  tioned? What of the facility now available for us to purchase under the land fund? I would like to share with the parliament details of those funds. From 1980 to 1989 the Aboriginal Development Commission bought 145 properties for Aboriginal communities at a cost of $32.2 million. From 1990 to 1996 ATSIC spent $89 million on the purchase of 196 properties. From 1993 to the year 2004 the indigenous land fund, mentioned by Mr Pearson, has a target balance of $1.289 billion, with an annual draw-down of $45 million in perpetuity. There has been an initial allocation of $200 million to this. From 1976 to the current day, Aboriginal groups in the Northern Territory have received $350 million in mining royalties. By the year 2004, which is only seven years away, there will have been provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in this country $5,000 per man, woman and child to buy land. That is over and above health and education, all of which are very necessary. It is aside from claims under the Native Title Act. So that is the current situation with land ownership and the Native Title Act 1993. In December of last year, in a breathtaking display of judicial piracy, the High Court overturned the will of the people expressed by the parliament in both houses and agreed to, as we have seen, by the former Labor Prime Minister Mr Keating, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the pastoral industry expressed through the farmers and the National Farmers Federation, Noel Pearson and the Aboriginal Land Council and also the Democrats. We now have the Wik decision, which has said that all of those who agreed to the Native Title Act 1993 and the propositions and preamble in that were wrong. Our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is now faced with a response to the Wik decision. It is his role to assert the supremacy of parliament and to keep faith with those who believe a deal is a deal, particularly the deal of 1993. I would now like to share with the House very briefly the National Party response to the Wik decision: ... accept that the National Party, as the Party whose special expertise has been the representation of Australians who live outside the larger cities, has a particular responsibility to contribute to the resolution of the problems created by that decision; On 1 March this year, we adopted the following as a resolution to respond to the Wik decision: (i) The assurances given in 1993 by the then Prime Minister and Attorney-General to the Parliament, and contained in the preamble to the Native Title Act, in relation to the effect of the grant of a pastoral lease on any previous existing native title should be given statutory effect; (ii) The rights accorded to holders of pastoral tenures by court decisions and statute as understood before the Wik decision should be confirmed by statute; (iii) Commonwealth laws which deny owners of pastoral tenures the right to convert that tenure to freehold should be repealed; And I want to add, for those who have said that there is a land grab here, that I happen to have been a fourth generation owner of land in Queensland, and in Queensland leasehold land is the same price as freehold. That is absolutely so. And when you convert from leasehold to freehold, there is a betterment charge-for everybody. So anybody in this House who has said that there is a land grab should remember that 96 per cent of landholders in our areas are families and that we always pay a betterment charge in Queensland. I want that on the record because I am tired of the lies that are being spread about pastoralists in Queensland. I want to go on now to talk about some of the other things that we proposed: (iv) Where, but for the implementation of paragraph (i), native title would exist, the exercise of the right to convert to freehold should be conditional upon the grant of an easement in favour of the person or persons who would hold native title to continue to exercise such rights of access as have been exercised in relation to that land on a continuing basis up to the time of conversion; In other words, you have got access. (v) Commonwealth lawsthis is the one; if we wanted private property rights for pastoralists in Queensland, we were fair enough to offer it to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanderswhich prevent vacant Crown land over which native title exists being transferred as freehold to the native title holders should be repealed; In other words, we wanted private property rights for Aborigines. This is a very small map but it does show unallocated Crown land in Queensland, which is extensive and in some cases extremely valuable. We were willing to see that given as freehold to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who made a successful native title claim. I go on: . (vi) Commonwealth laws which prevent existing tenures held by indigenous Australians from the Crown from being converted to freehold should be repealed; You cannot do it without the Commonwealth. The resolution continues: (vii) The right to negotiate in relation to proposed mining activity and compulsory acquisition should be enjoyed only by persons who have established that they are native title holders and should be identical to the rights enjoyed by the owners of a freehold estate in the land to which the title exists; (viii) Native title claims should be adjudicated in the ordinary Courts rather than a special tribunal, be subject to the same laws of evidence as apply to all other litigants, be lodged prior to a specified date to be fixed as some reasonable time in the future ... and, if any government provides legal aid to any of the non-government parties, it must provide legal aid on the same basis to all of them; I think it is significant that it was our proposal and we are the first party to propose freehold property rights for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. That is the situation that was left with the decision by the High Court on Wik. The Prime Minister, to his credit, has improved greatly on the uncertainty left after the Wik decision, and I would now like to share with you some of the very sound measures in this legislation, not only for farmers but for all Australians. These include the confinnation of exclusive possession on some tenures, especially freehold, as well as residential, commercial and public works. In other words, the cities and towns can go on with their affairs as they always have, and that is appropriate. Can I say, though, that it does not extend beyond the cities and towns. We now have situations where, for instance, fire brigades are looking at building new sheds, but they cannot. They cannot find any land around their town or small city to put a shed for a bush fire brigade. Because of the changes in gun laws, gun clubs, with the enormous rise in membership, are looking at ranges. There is no land available for gun ranges. So not all situations are taken into account, and I think it is very unjust to make one law for the cities and towns and another for the bush. Fortunately, we have confirmation of primary production and incidental activities under lease conditions. Defined primary production activities outside lease conditions will be able to be carried on, subject to pennits, without the need for negotiation with claimants. The threshold test for native title claims has been tightened up. There is a single treatment for multiple overlapping claims; the Crown's capacity to manage water is confirmed. There is legal assistance for pastoralists, but not in all conditions. Claims are going to be determined by the Federal Court. The Native Title Tribunal will have a reduced role and there is a six-year sunset clause for claims under the act. But there are difficulties in this legislation. Because compensation is to be incurred by the states, it is very likely that they are going to be slow in issuing permits to extend the activities of fanners beyond the tenns of their leases. I will tell you what that means in real terms. If we are going to have primary production restrained to a 20th century version of production under the tax act, these are the things that will not happen. I would like to hark back to some decades ago when a pastoralist was in a great deal of difficulty. He was facing drought and other problems on his property. He decided that hwould start a little freight run. He had a little plane and he was going to run a few passengers and freight around northern Australia, and he did. He became quite successful. He called his little service the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services, Qantas. But you will not find Qantas under this legislation or the ideas put forward by the Labor Party. There will never be another Qantas, not under the Labor Party. They want to fossilise primary production in the 20th century. I will tell you something else we will not have: we will not have wind fanns, because primary production is defined as tilling the land, as building a fence, as putting in a dam. What pastoralists have now found in New South Wales is that they are farming the wind. They put in windmills, they collect the wind energy and they sell it back into the grid. What a great idea. But you will not be able to do that. There is something else that we will not be able to do. I am indebted to Dr Des Albert, an old university colleague of mine who is an Australian expert on plasmaphysics. He has done some calculations for me on solar energy; the fuel of the future. I will use the state of South Australia as an example because it is the right size. The projected total annual world energy consumption in the year 2015, which is not very far away, is roughly 500 quad. The source of that projection is the US Department of Energy-Outlook 1997. A quad is 10 15 British thermal units. South Australia, which has an area of 984,377 square kilometres, receives 3,400 quad of solar energy annually. That is an average solar radiation density of 400 watts per square meter for seven hours of sunlight per day. If we assume an energy conversion efficiency of only 15 per cent, which is pretty low, and if we put solar collectors over the whole of South Australia or an area the size of South Australia we can fuel the world in 2015. But you will not be able to do that under this bill or the ideas put forward by the Labor Party. They want to fossilise our production in this country in the 20th century. We will not be able to fuel the world. There are a number of matters within this bill that need to be taken into account. We need to be looking at a tightening of the threshold test. There needs to be a time limit on claims under common law. There are a number of other issues that need to be addressed. There needs to be a schedule of leases for those pastoralists who have missed out. I want to make one final point: I think there can be a win-win from this. I congratulate my colleagues the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who have so rightly made the point that Aboriginal Australians have been missing out. Much of the money that is allocated to them is not put towards their betterment. I think there can be a win-win out of this, not a system of dual ownership that lashes people together, that takes us back to the pre-medieval days in England. I recall Brennan speaking of the Canadian system in the Wik judgment. He said that dual ownership was an absurdity, and how right he was. We do not want a system of dual ownership. We want private property rights for all Australians-freehold rights for Aboriginals over the unalienated, unallocated crown land and freehold rights with a betterment charge for pastoralists. I believe we can have a win-win out of this for all Australians, most particularly for our children and grandchildren.",114
303,Dr LAWRENCE,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"In addressing the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 today, I want to do a number of things. Firstly, I want to outline some of the attitudes that I think are revealed in this legislative package; secondly, I want to look at some of the key provisions of the bill and their shortcomings; thirdly, I want to look at some precedents from my own state-there is a real sense of deja vu about this legislationand, fourthly, I want to look at some of the solutions that are available to the government. In reading this legislation and the development of it through the lO-point plan, it is very clear to me that the government, particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), has no real interest in Aboriginal rights or interests. The Prime Minister sees them as an annoying, noisy minority. It is as if Mabo, it would appear, had never happened. What sometimes comes through in the statements made by members opposite is an unashamed and sometimes an unveiled hostility toward Aboriginal peorle and their interests. A measure of the Prime Minister's own views is given by his censure of the member for Calare (Mr Andren) about parliamentary entitlements compared with his lack of censure of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). There is clearly in the Prime Minister's statements a failure to concede, let alone to understand, the importance of land and culture to Aboriginal people. He and members of his government have been falling over themselves to provide for pastoralists, saying that he would not let them down under any circumstances, swearing before them that he would look after their interests. But at no time has such an assurance been given to our indigenous people. It is quite the reverse. Clearly, he and other members who have spoken regard their rights in land, if they are acknowledged at all, as second-class rights to be surrendered whenever anyone else lays claim to the same land. We just heard that in the speech of the previous speaker, the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly). What the Prime Minister and the government have revealed is a decided antipathy to negotiated settlement and coexistence, despite the generous proffering of hands of those representing Aboriginal communities around Australia. To their credit, they are still trying to reach negotiated agreements. I think it is important that members understand that the central feature of this legislation is the de facto extinguishment of native title and the removal of the right to negotiate. That is what it is all about. That is what the 10point plan is; that is what this legislation represents. We can see that if we look at the key provisions of the bill. We see, first of all, effective legislative extinguishment of native title. The government has refused to incorporate the coexistence of native title on pastoral leases into this legislation. Indeed, it can be seen to have buckled under pressure from minority interestssomething the government always accused the Labor Party of when in government. It has refused even to concede the existing interests of Aboriginal people in the pastoral industry, which in my own state of Western Australia is very considerable. If we were to listen to the advice of the Australian Law Reform Commission-something the government apparently does not want to do- 'there will be substantial grounds upon which it could, and likely will, be challenged before the courts' because of this extinguishment of native title. The bill also represents a full-frontal assault on the right to negotiate. This, as members opposite appear not to realise, is clearly a core right, not a special right. It is needed-it is essential-for the protection of native title. Its removal in some instances and its dilution in others will almost certainly be challenged, so God knows why they are doing this. We also see an upgrading of pastoral leases. Whatever some of those with interests in the pastoral industry might say, this is special treatment. In particular, by applying the primary production definition to pastoral activities, we have de facto extension. There is a significant extension of activities on pastoral leases. I must say that I was amused by some of the comments of the previous speaker, who suggested that the whole of South Australia should be turned into a solar farm. I am not sure that they would want that. As a matter of interest, the member for Bonython (Mr Martin Evans), who is at the table, would certainly be able to say so. Ahoriginal people are willing and prepared to cooperate with sensible suggestions. The Australian Law Reform Commission and others have also warned that in this case the upgrading of pastoral leases will likely contravene the Racial Discrimination Act because of its 'discriminatory effect on a particular racial group within society'. That is very clear and unequivocal advice. The bill also fails to provide the just terms compensation which inevitably arises from questions surrounding the validation of leases, particularly the so-called intermediate period acts and the proposed sunset clauses. Again, the government has been warned that this is likely to trigger challenge. How many times it needs to be told that I do not know, but it seems determined to ignore it. This legislation also contains changes in access to pastoral leases for traditional purposes. The high registration test is clearly unreasonable and harsh. If the government had been prepared to respond to the stolen generation report, it would begin to understand why. When I saw this legislation and the justification for it, I had a considerable sense of deja vu. In Western Australia, the Liberal's colleague and now Premier Mr Court failed in a similar attempt to extinguish native title in Western Australia. I was Leader of the Opposition at the time and had to oppose that legislation, too. It had many of the same characteristics, both in attitude and legislation. We are half a dozen years down the track and the government is attempting to do it again-a conservative government with no interest in Aboriginal people. We have been able to determine that, as a result of that folly by Premier Court, the taxpayers of Western Australia had to fork out at least $8 million. If the Prime Minister's folly were to pass this parliament, that would be made to look like a trifle. Not only will taxpayers be forced to compensate massively, but also taxpayers in effect will be compelled to provide windfall gains to pastoralists. Court and his fellow conspirators clearly ignored sound advice, as this government is doing, and clear warnings about the unconstitutionality of their bill. We are seeing similar perversity being exhibited by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams). This bill will founder upon challenge. There is nothing more certain. The Prime Minister hailed Hanson's first speech by saying that it meant that 'in a sense, the pall of censorship on certain issues has been lifted'. Apart from the moral bankruptcy of this position, the Prime Minister clearly feels no qualms about censoring the Australian Law Reform Commission's informed criticism of his inadequate legislation. He simply does not want to hear their warning that it is a recipe for uncertainty and for financial, legal and international embarrassment for Australia. But I think the people of Australia should hear that warning. Similarly in Western Australia, Premier Court attempted to cultivate fear and loathing amongst the people of Western Australia. He, too, talked about threats to our backyards. The Prime Minister has done the same and resorted to hauling misleading maps around TV studios to alarm the community. He is employing precisely the same dishonest tactics. In fact, he probably took advice from them. He is extremely alarmist too about economic development, as Premier Court was. It was claimed in Western Australia that mining and exploration would come to a halt, that it would be the end of it. The Prime Minister and his team have peddled the same arrant nonsense. In fact, mining and exploration have continued to expand apace in Western Australia, and there have been negotiated agreements and settlements with our indigenous people. They are the obvious solution. I want to have a look at some of the warnings that I gave in Western Australia because they are germane. In the second reading debate against the Court legislation that attempted to extinguish native title, I said: Instead of celebrating as one, we are here to consider provisions which will uncertainty and prolonged economic risk. It will be the same for 1997 as for 1993. I said that, if the simplistic view enunciated by the Premier-substitute 'Prime Minister' - and carried into this legislation prevails, Mabofor which read 'Wik' - would almost certainly lead to very divisive and expensive litigation. The outcome would be a recipe for a loss of investor confidence, which is quite the converse of what the Prime Minister is saying. I went on further to say that the Premier of this state-for which read 'the Prime Minister'-is 'hawking around at media conferences with a list of suburbs and maps purporting to show the specific backyards that would be threatened'. Interestingly, when the Premier was actually challenged to provide those lists and maps to the members of parliament in a question on notice, they had suddenly disappeared altogether. They could not be challenged, because they had disappeared. At the same time, the Premier-for which read 'the Prime Minister' - was sitting in front of television cameras with the big background of Western Australia-for which read 'Australia'-covered in red-for which read 'brown'-stating that 80 per cent of Western Australia-Australia-is claimable under native title. It is almost exactly the same words, the same strategy and the same techniques. It will have the same outcome-it will be challenged. I said at the time that everyone knows that this position, put together and publicised at great expense, which is being used as the basis of a smear campaign in the Western Australian community, will fail. Again, I warn this government with my warning of that time: nothing is more certain than that this legislation will be knocked out at the earliest possible opportunity by a challenge in the High Court, brought either by the Commonwealth government, as in that case, or by interested Aboriginal people. Debate interrupted. NA",118
304,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the lead to litigation, question: That the House do now adjourn. Commonwealth Buildings: Sale",120
305,Ms ELLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Namadgi) (10.30 p.m.)Tonight on the adjournment I want to talk about something that affects my community here in Canberra and which is a result of a decision taken by this government in their last federal budget. In that budget we had an announcement that the federal government had decided to sell off a number of Commonwealth owned buildings around the country, a sort of fire sale. In the national capital that translated to mean 11 buildings were to be sold. I was very critical of the decision at the time, pointing out the detrimental effect this would have on local confidence, on the local commercial building market, on the local community and on the confidence of the community at large. Of the 11 buildings, all of which appeared in the very nicely produced glossy prospectus, some of them in the ACT were actually listed as partially or, in one or two cases, completely empty at the time of the plan to sell. I queried at that time the signals that this would send out, the difficulty there would be, in reality, in selling these buildings. The Canberra Times last week ran a very interesting article expressing very strong concern over the situation as it now stands; some months, of course, have passed since that budget. What has happened in the marketplace in the ACT since that decision was taken? Let me tell you. More than 10 per cent 9f all office buildings in Canberra are empty, a rate predicted to reach 22 per cent in the Civic and Woden areas-amongst the highest levels in Australia. Braddon-an area not far from this House-has a 30 per cent vacancy rate at the moment in commercial buildings; Belconnen, 18 per cent; Civic, 13 per cent; Woden, 10 per cent; and Turner, 20 per cent. Property analysts say office rents have fallen 35 per cent in less than two years. They predict that in Civic and Woden, where the vacancy levels are currently 13 per cent and 10 per cent respectively, they could reach 22 per cent in those areas after 1998 unless drastic action is taken by this government to take its buildings off the market. Rising vacancy trends, falling rents and the major tenants-in most cases government-refusing to negotiate with private sector landlords, have created a crisis of confidence. The Churchill Trust, not exactly what you would imagine to be the most volatile or vehement a property owner, owns Churchill House in Northbourne Avenue. They lost their tenant a month ago. In order to attract tenants they have lowered their rent from $295 a square metre to $140 a square metre. Property industry leaders are alarmed at the growing impact of the vacant buildings on property values, rental prices and investor confidence. They have urged the government to demolish or mothball the 11 buildings listed for sale until the market recovers. The Property Council of Australia said Canberra's office vacancy rate reached a record 10.3 per cent in July. It was 5.9 per cent at the beginning of 1996. The president of the council's ACT division is quoted as saying he hopes the fate of the Commonwealth's properties would take into account the difficult market conditions. The Mirvac Group is rated as one of the biggest private property owners in the area-and what is their view? Its ACT property general manager is reported as saying that institutionalised property owners were badly affected by the vacancies and this was a concern for investors from outside Canberra. 'It is seen as a risk in Canberra,' he says. How things have changed, Mr Speaker. Less than two years ago we had the prospect of Commonwealth building development in the ACT; now we are looking at the demolition of the existing ones. No wonder confidence is low, cynicism high and patience almost fully expended. A government is supposed to govern the community, not just an economy. The effect on my community of this government's policies has been nothing short of devastating. There must be an urgent reconsideration of the sale of those 11 commercial buildings and there must be some signs of confidence from this government to this community. They deserve no more and they deserve no less. Newcastle, in its tragic future, at least had notice from BHP; this government gave no notice to this community. It walked in with its scythe, and it cut. Domestic Violence Orders",120
306,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Senator Crowley thinks I need counselling for daring to suggest that the misnamed domestic violence orders were issued like confetti in Queensland. I stand by those comments. Indeed, I go further. They are more often than not obtained in circumstances amounting to an abuse of process. They can have a devastating effect on the lives and reputations of those unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end. Those orders can last for 2Y2 years. The whole system is in desperate need of reform. If a person assaults his or her spouse, he or she is subject to the criminal law as much as anyone else. They can be arrested, they are placed on bail conditions and can be found guilty and punished if the court considers that a charge has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. All that is out the window in a domestic violence 'law'. As solicitor Tim Mazzoletti recently wrote: Domestic violence orders are notoriously easy to obtain and are often granted in the absence of the respondent and on evidence that would not be admissible in any other type of application or court proceeding. The allegations used to support some applications are based on old and often trivial incidents sensationalised to the point of absurdity. So where all that is required is harassment to be branded as a person subject to a domestic violence order, with all the stigmatisation and consequences that follow, you would ordinarily expect a particularised charge, proper admissible evidence and an onus of proof more than just more probable than not. In my own case, an order was made not for violence but for saying that life was not worth living if I could not have access to my two sons. But, if my views are such that I am in need of counselling, apart from the solicitor I have just mentioned, what about some counselling for Mr Justice Moss of the Family Court and Dr Pat O'Shane, a prominent New South Wales magistrate? His honour said that 'examples abounded' of the misuse of these orders in New South Wales. He said that couples were using them as weapons in divorce courts with spurned wives taking them out as vengeance against their husbands. The orders originally meant to protect victims of domestic violence had been expanded to cover so many areas that they were open to abuse and the laws needed to be changed. Dr 0' Shane said: Without a doubt, in some instances the resort to AVOs is wholly justified, but in an increasing number of cases, women in particular have taken out AVOs against their former spouse or de facto in order to prevent his getting access to children the relationship, very often in vengeance at having left, especially to form another relationship. Justice Moss said that in divorce proceedings one or both sides obtained them against each other as a way to further their case in the Family Court. In other cases one side would agree to an order with no evidence simply because it was cheaper than fighting it because they were already facing substantial legal bills for their divorce proceedings. As I said, the consequences can be horrendous. Take the case of Tim Garvey, a senior constable of police, a person who works in my electorate in a police station at Ferny Grove. His wife walked out on him with their nine-week-old baby after 12 months of marriage in April 1996. In October 1996 he was served with an interim order at his place of work. The application contains the flimsiest allegations-no physical violence, mind you-and some of the evidence demonstrates untruthfulness, sensationalism and hyperbole on the wife's part. Garvey appeared for himself; his wife was represented by legal aid. There was a particularly ordinary decision by the magistrate. The magistrate failed to particularise an act of domestic violence in his judgment or anything to suggest that such acts of domestic violence would occur in the future. What were the consequences? He had to notify his superior and surrender his firearm, regardless of whether the court made an order allowing him to retain a weapon at work and detail all of the circumstances. He is confined to a desk as a clerk in uniform until March 1999, 2Y2 years later. He cannot work overtime, he is stigmatised by his peers, people wonder if he is corrupt or a psycho and he cannot be promoted. If he had had the fortune to be charged with the criminal offence of assault or even assault occasioning bodily harm, he would have had the following rights: particulars of the precise charge he was facing; strict adherence to the rules of evidence, no hearsay; the onus of proof on the prosecution; the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt; and competent legal representation through his union. If of found guilty of a criminal act, he would in all probability not receive a conviction; he might be discharged absolutely and he could even carry on in the police force as if nothing happened. Even if there was bodily harm, there have been cases where police officers have been convicted, not dismissed and go on as if nothing happened. This is a real injustice and, in the words of Pat O'Shane, Justice Moss and many others, the system needs to be reformed. Nursing Homes: Fees  p.m.)-Last Monday I saw something I have never seen in my life before: a protest against the government's actions enforcing the introduction of nursing home entry fees. It was a protest organised by the residents of a hostel in my electorate, Legacy Hostel at Norah Head, in which the main road in Toukley was closed off by the police at their request. Some 150 people, including many of the residents, pushing walking frames, tripods and pushers, made their way down the main road of Toukley-one block, around the corner-=with faltering, unsteady steps, carrying banners, words on which they had devised themselves, protesting at the government's action enforcing people to sell their homes to gain entry to nursing homes. The government can try to cover this in every way they wish. They can try to pretend to themselves that it is not true. This is something that was organised and conducted by the people themselves. It was a spectacle I have never seen in my life before. I have seen many protests about many measures, but I have never seen an act as disgraceful as the one I saw caused by this government. Those opposite should visualise the people of those age groups pushing their walking frames down the main road of the town, carrying their banners. Miss Jackie Kelly-Oh!  member can laugh. You scorn those people. You boohoo them. I am just relating what I witnessed last Monday: a protest organised by these people. This is about the action of a heartless, ruthless government which is trying to cover the fact that they have stripped some $500 million from capital funding for aged care. A total of $245 million of that money had been allocated by us in government for nursing homes and hostels. Honourable members opposite can pretend to themselves, they can try to shut their eyes and say that it is not happening or they can accept the Treasury argument about why it is all justified and say that they think it is fair. I hear you say you think it is fair. I just want you to know that I think it is the most heartless, ruthless, despicable action I have ever seen by any government. That is what the public thinks of it too.",121
307,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT,"Government members interjecting are Australians who have lived through the Great Depression, lived through the Second World War, lived through other wars and been through difficulty and hardship only to come to this situation. When people of that age group take to the streets, banners in their hands, devised by themselves, pushing their walkers and tripods in front of them, just maybe some of those opposite who are now the interjecting so strongly in opposition to what I am saying will glean some little measure of the public's absolute abhorrence of what this government is doing. These people see this government for what it is: a government that promised to all of the aged people to maintain everything they had and give them more. You promised them security; you have given them heartache. You promised them accommodation; you have given them homelessness. You promised them that they could keep their assets; now you are forcing them to sell their homes. These are your acts, nobody else's. Stand proud and proclaim them.",123

I have not seen people from that age group and of that kind of health walking down a main street carrying on their protest. What this government wants is for people to get the kind of nursing home care according to the condition of their pocket, not according to the condition of their health. We will throw this legislation out when the government is changed and we will give the people their dignity and independence back and that which is rightfully theirs as Australians at that time of their life. Commonwealth Buildings: Sale",123
312,Mr JULL,ADJOURNMENT,"I listened previously to the presentation by the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis), who spoke about the Commonwealth property principles in this city of Canberra. Quite frankly, I was not going to let her get away with that, and I will bring the House up to date with exactly what has happened in the Canberra property market. When this government came to power in March last year, one of the first things brought to our attention was the absolutely dreadful state of the Commonwealth property portfolio. In actual fact, one of the first bits of advice that came through from departmental officers was that, in trying to bring that property portfolio up to date; we had a real problem. From memory, I think I am right in saying that, if we were to bring it up to date in the city of Canberra, the investment would have to be in the vicinity of $180 million. Why? Because previous governments, the previous Labor government, had completely ignored the state of Commonwealth property, and it was a mess. Notwithstanding all the bleating by the member for Namadgi about what is happening in this city in terms of the private property market, the first thing this government did was to bring in the private sector to undertake a full review of Commonwealth propertyand we took that advice. That advice was that there had to be some very great rationalisation of Commonwealth property around Australia, but particularly in Canberra because no review of Commonwealth property had been done in this city, I believe, since Federation. What we found was a dreadful mess. One of the first things that the government did was to make sure that the Commonwealth Public Service was tied to commercial leases, because there were no leases on any the office space taken up by the Commonwealth Public Service; in other words, they were day-today arrangements. If there happens to be vacant office space in this city, one of the reasons for it is the blithering incompetence of the administration of the previous Labor government. We put that together, and we did find that there was a great deal of vacant space. Once again we went back to the private sector to seek its advice on how this property should be disposed of to make sure that we did not affect the Canberra market. That review was undertaken and, yes, there have been some recommendations that some of those properties-some of those dilapidated properties-that were ignored by the previous Labor government may have to be taken out of the market; maybe they will be demolished. But the reality is that the acceptance by the private sector of the government property principles has been absolutely tremendous; and the private sector, through the property council and other organisations in this city, is urging us along all the way. If the member for Namadgi were to do her homework, she would find that some of that property has already been sold; in fact, the Melbourne building on Northbourne Avenue was one of the first. I think it is fair to say that the price the Commonwealth received for that property from a private family here in Canberra was vastly in excess of what we ever thought we would get for it. There is confidence in this city. You will see development of some of these Commonwealth assets. Also, you will see a much greater utilisation of Commonwealth property. No longer is the Commonwealth going to be a property manager. No longer will the Commonwealth be a developer, because we are no good at that; we could not manage a building if we tried. In actual fact, the government has contracted out all management of all Commonwealth buildings around Australia, and the savings are absolutely phenomenaland, as well, we are not getting too many complaints about the standard of that office management. Around Australia coming up in this financial year will be the commencement of the sale of 57 Commonwealth properties, major properties, including those in Canberra. The results of those sales-and they will be in the vicinity of $1 billion all up-are going straight to the bottom line to retire debt. The Commonwealth is a great consumer of property. The clout that we will have in the private property market will ensure that the taxpayers of Australia get some very real value for money in terms of our property leasing. No longer will the Commonwealth waste money in building buildings which, quite frankly, were never needed. No longer will we allow our buildings to go to rack and ruin. The Commonwealth is out of that. This government is all about efficiency in Commonwealth administration. The savings in the property portfolio and the investment opportunities in Canberra are absolutely enormous. Mount Druitt Senior High School  Tonight I am very pleased to speak again about the issue of a senior high school for Mount Druitt.",124
313,Mr CADMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"The Teachers Federation won't wear it.  same fight they did 10 years ago. Honourable members will recall that earlier this year the Daily Telegraph published a photograph of year 12 students at Mount Druitt. Mr Speaker, as a result of this issue, I must say that I was at the time very critical of the Minister for Education and Training, John Aquilina, for his failure to consult with the community; you may recall that he had requested Alan Laughlin to prepare a report on the Mount Druitt result. That report has been tabled and circulated. But he has now done a second report, and he has outlined a number of options. He has appointed the Vice Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, Derek Schroeder, to spearhead the community consultation. Basically, four options are being canvassed. One is a senior high school with junior high schools; that is, junior high schools finishing at year 10, and a senior high school with years 11 and 12. That clearly is the option that is favoured in the report, and the one that I clearly favour. The second option is having junior high schools but farming out students to existing senior high schools-St Marys and the proposed Narimba senior high schools. Thirdly, there is the closing of one of the schools. And, fourthly, there is the consideration of any suggestions put forward by members of the community. Senior high schools are something that I have been talking about in this parliament for a good 10 years. It is a matter of record that some 10 years ago both Richard Amery and I strongly advocated a senior high school for Mount Druitt. In 1988 the then Liberal government established the St Marys senior high school. That, of course, has proved to be an outstanding success. But St Marys operates without any feeder junior high schools. It operates really as very much a selective high school, although it is not called that. It has something like 800 people competing for 400 places in year 11. We need a senior high school in Mount Druitt because the comprehensive model in Mount Druitt is collapsing; there are just not sufficient students. I believe that the 'super high school', as the Telegraph has called it, will be a real boost for Mount Druitt. I want to relate to the House the current retention rates for 1995-97 for years 10 and 12 at the five high schools serving the area. Bidwill High School has a retention rate of 50.4 per cent, Dunheved 30.3 per cent, Mount Druitt 37.6 per cent, Shalvey 38.9 per cent, and Whalan 45.3 per cent. None of the high schools meet the state average of some 66 per cent. A senior high school like St Marys High School will be able to offer 146 subjects, so you have real choices. It will be able to offer real choices in vocational education. But, most importantly, it will increase the retention rate of students and it will increase their chances of getting a job at the end of their period at high school. So I strongly commend the state Minister for Education John Aquilina for undertaking this community consultation. I again place on record my strong support for a senior high school in Mount Druitt, a 'super high school' as the Telegraph calls it. I believe we have exciting opportunities in terms of the vocational education that we can provide. TAFE based courses would be my particular choice. This is what we need to do for the students of Mount Druitt, for their parents and for the community. As the Parliamentary Secretary has suggested, if it is over and above the opposition of the teachers federation-so be it. Residential Aged Care",125
314,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Bradfield) (to.55 p.m.)What makes me and, I think, a significant number of other Australians despairing about the political process is that it appears that no matter what is put up by one side of politics it is immediately the subject of denigration and manipulation by the other, irrespective of the merits of the policy that is being proposed. Nowhere is that more evident than in the current debate, if you could call it that, the community about the government's reforms in residential aged care. At the moment in Australia we have 5.3 Australians between the ages of 15 and 64 for every person under the age of 15 or over the age of 64. It is called an age dependency ratio. In 40 years time that ratio will be 2.6 to one. If you read the National Commission of Audit report last year you will find that over the next 40 years we will need to spend 10 per cent more of our gross domestic product above and beyond real growth on the health and welfare costs of ageing. Halfway through next century a third of Australia will be over the age of 65. In the absence of a cure, something like 8 per cent of us over the age of 75 will suffer from dementia. Approximately at the moment about 5 per cent of us will eventually need residential aged careand this in a country that is sustaining growth rates of between 3Y2 to 4 per cent when we peak. So as a nation what we as Australians have to accept is that, no matter how noble the proposition may be, our country simply cannot afford to provide residential aged care for all Australians entirely financed by the government irrespective of the means of those people who are going to derive benefit from the care that is provided to them. Of the three comprehensive inquiries conducted into residential aged care, the most comprehensive was that by Professor Bob Gregory, which was delivered to the previous government in 1994. Gregory documented amongst other things the need to spend $1 billion bringing our residential nursing home capital stock up to fire, design, health and outcome standards. Thirteen per cent of nursing homes in Australia do not currently meet fire standards. Approximately 39 per cent of people living in nursing homes live in a room with at least three other people. Many nursing homes are places in which you would not wish your mother, or indeed yourself, to be living. So what the government has done is something that if Labor had won the federal election it would have done, as it had done for the hostel sector in 1988. Of the 2to words in in the Labor Party's aged care policy presented to the electorate for the 1996 election, you will find amongst them a language that is code for introducing into the aged care system what this government has done. And what the government has done is look at a 30-year vision of where aged care needs to be. In terms of residential accommodation bonds, it is important that people understand: that the bond is something that is negotiated between the proprietor and the prospective resident, his or her family and their lawyer or their accountant or whoever they wish to have involved; that if an accommodation bond is negotiated for $20,000, $40,000, $50,000 or $100,000, that bond cannot be demanded by a proprietor as an up-front payment; that the resident, having negotiated the bond, then has the option of paying that over the course of a year as the $2,600 draw-down and approximately a four per cent interest stream on that accommodation bond. So, for example, if a bond was $100,000 you could opt to pay $6,600, that is a $2,600 draw-down plus a $4,000 interest stream, and pay it as $550 a month. Alternatively, you have the option available to you to have that bond taken out as a debt against your estate. It is important that Australians appreciate also that 37.7 per cent of people who go into a nursing home do not, unfortunately, live longer than six months and 50.5 per cent of people will not live longer than one year. It is also important in relation to the income testing that the maximum amount that will be paid by the 9 per cent of nursing home residents eligible to pay a fee will be no more than 25c in the dollar above the first $49 a week. In the end, the money that is raised from the accommodation bonds, which will be $1.5 billion over the next 10 years, and the money raised through income testing and fees can only be spent on one thing and one thing only, and that is the care that that person receives in a nursing home and the accommodation and facilities that are provided to them. It cannot be taken as profit and it cannot be siphoned away to be spent on anything else. It is as necessary as it is defensible. It is important that the opposition, who are manipulating elderly people in the community, started to realise that this serves the national interest and not the political opportunism of political parties.",126
315,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 11 p.m., the debate is interrupted and the House stands adjourned until 2 p.m. tomorrow. House adjourned at 11 p.m. NA NA House of Representatives: Members' Travel Claims Mr Campbell asked the Speaker, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: (1) Is KPMG Management Consulting reviewing Members' travel claims; if so, what sum is it being paid? (2) Will· he table a cost benefit analysis of the expenditure on an annual basis?",127
316,Mr SPEAKER,DETAILED INFORMATION,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) The Department of the House of Representatives (DHR) has commissioned its internal auditor, KPMG, to undertake a data-matching audit of Members' travelling allowance claims for financial years 1995-96 and 1996-97. The Department of the Senate is undertaking a similar audit in respect of Senators. The audit involves a computerised matching of travelling allowance details held by the DHR with travel details held by the Department of Finance and Administration. Phase one of the audit, for 1995/96, is nearing completion. Where travel information was not available or travelling allowance claims were otherwise not able to be reconciled, KPMG approached Members seeking further information to assist in the reconciliation process. It is anticipated that 1996/97 travelling allowance claims will be matched in October/ November. DHR payments to KPMG to date (for services to 5 September) total $42 152.50. This amount includes DHR's share (approximately $9600) of the costs of developing and establishing the datamatching model and process (a cost shared with. the Department of the Senate). The development and establishment costs will not be required for the 1996/97 datamatching. (2) I will advise the House of the results of the audit, including benefits and payments to KPMG, once the audit is finalised. NA The following notices were given: Mr Andrew to move: That the following Bills be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration: Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) 1997; Family Trust Distribution Tax (Primary Liability) 1997; Family Trust Distribution Tax (Secondary Liability) 1997; Medicare Levy Consequential Amendment (Trust Loss) 1997; Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment 1997; Snowy Hydro Corporatisation 1997; and Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) 1997. Mr Lindsay to move: That this House: (1) expresses its concern that the current lengthy and uncertain process of securing necessary development approvals acts as a significant disincentive to attracting and securing new capital investment in Australia; (2) acknowledges that the approval process differs between States and Territories and is cumbersome and confusing for potential investors; . (3) agrees that the time taken to negotiate and complete the approval process is well behind that achieved elsewhere in other countries and demands improvement; (4) supports a uniform national approval process to be agreed between the Commonwealth and ,. the States, and to be administered by the : States and Territories; and (5) calls for concerted action to achieve a streamlined appeal process recognising the need to seek changes to relevant legislation. Mr Hockey to move: That this House: (1) condemns the persecution of all religious minorities around the world; (2) deplores the long lasting plight of the Christian minorities in Turkey involving discrimination against those minorities to freely practice their religion and culture; and (3) requests the Government of Turkey, in the interests of secularism and respect for minorities to: (a) make it easier for all Christian denominations to be recognised as official churches and to have clear legal rights with regard to property ownership; (b) allow the opening of the Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic seminaries which were forcibly closed in 1971 and permit other Christian denominations such as the Syrian Orthodox to have seminaries as well; (c) abolish the special tax imposed on Christian institutions; (d) preserve Christian monuments and cease the destruction or desecration of Christian churches, monasteries and other religious monuments; (e) provide more protection for the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the Orthodox church in Istanbul and Armenian and Greek Christian churches in Turkey, against possible further attacks by Islamic extremists; (f) return to the Armenian Protestant Church all property that was taken from it including money that the Armenians were forced to pay; and (g) not interfere in the selection of church leaders or in the affairs of the Christian communities, in particular the operations of schools.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination: Reporting (Question No. 1249) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 5 February 1997: (1) Has Australia reported to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination regarding High Court judgments concerning discrimination against Aborigines; if so, (a) when, (b) in what form and (c) were the reports tabled; if so when. (2) Is Australia required to report to UN bodies on the Wik case; if so, (a) when, (b) to which bodies and (c) will the reports be tabled in Parliament. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia's 9th report under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), which covered the. period January 1991 to June 1992, was tabled in September 1992 and reviewed by the Committee in August 1994. This report discussed the decision of 3 June 1992 of the High Court of Australia in the case of Mabo and Others v Queensland. Other issues affecting Indigenous Australians, including the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the process of Reconciliation, were also outlined in this report. The report was not tabled in Parliament. (2) A combined 10th and 11th CERD report, which will cover the period July 1992-December 1996, is currently being prepared. Reference will be made to the Wik decision, handed down in December 1996. All future UN treaty body reports, including reports to the CERD, will be tabled in Parliament. Community Based Child Care: Electoral Division of Rankin (Question No. 1341) Mr Beddall asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 24 February 1997: .(1) How many community based child care centres are there in the electoral division of Rankin. (2) Who is the managing authority for these centres. NA (3) What is the name and address of each of these centres. (4) Has the number of children enrolled in each of the centres increased since 1991; if so, by how many. (5) What sum of Commonwealth funding (a) did each of these centres receive in 1995-96 and (b) will each of these centres receive in (i) 1996-97, (ii) 1997-98 and (iii) 1998-99.

Managing Authority: The Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (Qld). (vii) YMCA Acacia Ridge Child Care Centre, Cnr Mannington and Chifley Street, ACACIA RIDGE QLD 4110. Managing Authority: The Young Men's Christian Association of Brisbane. (4) There has been no increase in the number of Commonwealth approved places since 1991. (5) Amounts of Operational Subsidy and Childcare Assistance funding for each centre for 1995-96 are provided, however, amounts are not available for 1996-97, 1997-98, or 1998-99, as these depend on utilisation rates that occur in each centre over those periods. Centre Aspen Community Centre Forest Lake Child Care Centre Logan City Child Care Centre New Life Lutheran Child Care Centre Swallow Street Child Care Centre Woodridge Uniting Church Creche YMCA Acacia Ridge Child Care centre Nursing Homes: Australian Capital (Question No. 1397) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 3 March 1997: (1) How many (a) nursing homes and (b) aged persons hostels are there within the postcode areas of (i) 2606, (ii) 2607 and 2900-2906. (2) What is the name and address of each (a) nursing home and (b) aged persons hostel referred to in part (1). (3) How many beds are there in each (a) nursing home and (b) aged persons hostel referred to in part (1). (4) For each nursing home and aged persons hostel referred to in part (1) what sum of Commonwealth funding (a) did each receive in 1995-96 and (b) will each receive in (i) 1996-97, (ii) 1997-98 and (iii) 1998-99. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Nursing Homes-There are no nursing homes located within the postcode areas, 2606, 2607, 2900 to 2906. Hostels-There is one hostel in postcode 2607. (2), (3) and (4) Name/Address: Goodwin Farrer, George Sautelle House, Marshall Street, Farrer ACT 2607. Beds: 70 approved places Funding 1995/96: $308,053 Recurrent Commonwealth benefit is calculated and paid ""per resident"" in accordance with residents' assessed care needs. This means that it is not possible to calculate in advance the level of funding payable to individual facilities, including for 199617, 1997/8 and 1998/9.

(2) Will hostel accommodation fees be reduced; if so, (a) how and (b) by what sum. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) From 1 October 1997, Residential Care Allowance (RCA-formerly rent assistance) payments to pensioners in nursing homes and hostels will be abolished. They will be replaced by a direct subsidy for providers, called ""pensioner supplement"". The abolition of RCA is a technical change to the payment process and will not significandy affect disposable incomes for residents or total funding for aged care providers. (2) Under the new aligned fee structure that will apply to hostels and nursing homes, the basic daily fee for pensioners will be $5.30 a day (in March 1997 prices) lower than for non-pensioners, to compensate for the abolition of RCA. They will pay $21.10 a day, while non-pensioners will pay $26.40 a day. There are, however, other changes that will happen at the same time and which will also affect hostel fees. These changes include grandparenting of variable fees, the introduction of income tested charges and the alignment of hostel and nursing home basic daily fees. The effect of these changes on individual residents' fees and disposable income will depend on the level of fees they are currently paying. Privacy Commissioner (Question No. 1699) Mrs Crosio asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) What sum was allocated to the Privacy Commission in the (a) 1993-1994 (b) 1994-1995 (c) 1995-1996 and (d) 19961997 Budgets. (2) Has the number of the Privacy Commission staff been reduced since 2 March 1996; if so, how many staff are (a) employed at the Commission at 13 May 1997 and (b) were employed at the commission prior to 2 March 1996. (3) Has the Government taken steps towards conducting a comprehensive parliamentary inquiry into the state of Australia's privacy laws since coming to office; if so, what steps if not, why not. (4) Has his attention been drawn to a statement by the Privacy Commissioner earlier in 1997 that industries would be subjected to publicised audits of their compliance with the Privacy Act once the Act was extended to the corporate sector, and that such a regime could be introduced without creating any extra red tape for business; if so, will the Government extend the Privacy Act to cover the corporate sector; if not why not. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is no separate entity known as the Privacy Commission. While all functions under the Privacy Act reside in the office of Privacy Commissioner, financial and staff resources to support those functions are provided through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC). HREOC decides each year the amount that is allocated to the privacy program. It has established a separate Privacy Branch, with a separate privacy program budget, but also provides support through a range of shared common services such as personnel, finance, IT and public affairs. The amount allocated by HREOC to the Privacy Commissioner covers the direct staffing and administrative expenditure associated with carrying out the Privacy Commissioner's functions under the Privacy Act. The best estimates of the funds used to support the work of the Privacy Commissioner in the four years in question is around $3 million per year, with some $2.2 million of that being allocated to the separate privacy program budget. These figures exclude a share of property operating expenses, but include income from fees and charges. On 23 September 1997 the Government announced that, following a reorganisation of HREOC, a new Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission is to be established and the role of the Privacy Commissioner established as a separate statutory Office of the Privacy Commissioner. This will result in the financial separation of the two bodies. (2) The number of staff employed by HREOC within the Privacy Branch and dedicated to the support of the Privacy Commissioner as at 13 May 1997 was 35, this figure having remained constant from 1995 to May 1997. Since May 1997 HREOC has reduced the staff within the Privacy Branch to 28. (3) A. number of inquiries by Parliamentary Committees on privacy or privacy related subjects are currently underway. In addition, the Government is considering a number of reports from Parliamentary Committee inquiries that impact on have been taken; privacy laws. The relevant reports and inquiries include: (a) the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs Report on its inquiry into the protection of confidential personal and commercial information held by the Commonwealth. The Government response to this Report is currently under consideration. (b) the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into the rights and obligations of the media. The Committee has still to report on a number of outstanding terms of reference. (c) the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into access to medical records. The Committee has recently reported and the Government response to this report is currently under consideration. (d) the House of Representatives Standing Committee (Family and Community Affairs) inquiry into health information management and telemedicine. The Committee has still to report. (e) the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee inquiry into contracting out of government services. The Committee has still to report. (4) On 21st March 1997 the Prime Minister announced that the Commonwealth would not be implementing privacy legislation for the private sector. In making this decision, the Prime Minister made clear that the Government was concerned not to increase compliance costs for Australian businesses, both large and small. Complying with current regulatory requirements already imposes a significant burden on Australian business. The Government is committed to reducing regulatory burden on all business and it is believed that the introduction of a new compulsory regime would be counterproductive in meeting that commitment. Audits of compliance are one possible cost associated with privacy legislation. The Government decision endeavoured to address concerns about broader compliance costs above and beyond the cost of carrying out an audit. The Government has opted for an approach that involves encouraging business to develop codes of conduct to enhance privacy protection in the private sector. The Prime Minister announced that the services of the federal Privacy Commissioner would be made available to assist business in the development of voluntary codes of conduct and to meet privacy standards. On 18 August 1997 the Privacy Commissioner released a consultation paper, Information Privacy in Australia: A National Scheme for Fair Information Practices in the Private Sector, which presents a proposal for a self-regulatory information privacy scheme and invited public debate on the issues raised and feedback by IS_September 1997. In October 1997 the Privacy Commissioner proposes to hold a series of forums around Australia for the full range of stakeholders to discuss the issues and to gauge the level of interest in, and commitment to, the proposed national scheme. Youth Suicide (Question No. 1784) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 3 June 1997: (1) Was $31m allocated to the Youth Suicide Prevention Initiatives and the National Youth Suicide Strategies; if so, were funds allocated to Suicide Prevention Australia (SPA); if not, why not. (2) Is it a fact that without substantial government assistance SPA may have to close its doors or reduce its services; if so, what to prevent this happening. (3) Is the SPA the sole national provider of many suicide prevention programs and national education programs; if so, will he guarantee that these programs will not be affected by funding changes. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A total of $31 million over four years has been allocated for the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy (comprising the Youth Suicide Prevention Initiative and the National Youth Suicide Strategy). Suicide Prevention Australia is currently contracted for $30,000 in conjunction with the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention, to develop a resource kit for the media regarding responsible reporting and depiction of youth suicide. Suicide Prevention Australia has been otherwise unsuccessful in competitive tender processes. (2) I am not privy to the internal funding arrangements of Suicide Prevention Australia. $315,000 over two years was provided to Suicide Prevention Australia to deliver suicide prevention training to rural communities through the Rural Health Services Education and Training Scheme. Interim funding for a further 18 months until June 1996 was provided to enable Suicide Prevention Australia to compete for tenders available under the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy. Suicide Prevention Australia was advised to use this time to move to a more business-like footing and was aware that if it was not successful in competing for tenders no further support would be forthcoming from the Commonwealth. (3) Suicide Prevention Australia is one of a number of providers of suicide prevention education and training programs. Under the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy a total of over $3.7 million has been allocated to support youth suicide prevention education and training activities. Carss Park Out of School Hours Care Service: Funding (Question No. 1829) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 17 June 1997: (1) Was the Carss Park Out of School Hours Care Service promised funding; if so, for what period. (2) What sum has the service received. (3) Will the service receive the balance of the steps has he taken promised funding. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Carss Park Outside School Hours Care Service was approved for funding on 30 September 1996. This approval is ongoing. (2) To 30 June 1997 the service has received $32,547 in Operational Subsidy, Childcare Assistance, Establishment, Equipment and Set-up grants. (3) The service will continue to receive funding under the present arrangements until the new School Age Care funding arrangements announced in the 1997 Budget are implemented. Overseas Aid (Question No. 1835) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 June 1997: (1) What funds have been allocated for overseas aid in the (a) 1993-94, (b) 1994-95, (c) 1995-96, (d) 1996-97 and (e) 1997-98 Budgets. (2) Has his attention been drawn to comments made by Mr L. Amold, Chief Executive of World Vision Australia, that because of the Commonwealth's cuts to overseas aid in its 1996-97 and 1997-98 Budgets, the charity organisation has had to abandon the (a) Likimsi and Abella project in Ethiopia to improve the health of 41 000 people through clean water and improved sanitation, (b) Nankumba project in Malawi to provide HIV/AIDS education and home-based care support to 62 000 people, (c) Zomba District project in Malawi to improve seed supply and increase farmer yields and food security for 30 000 people, (d) Bunyole development project in Uganda to help 10 000 people affected by HIV/AIDS and (e) Maciene and Derre projects in Mozambique to improve the health of 20 000 and 37 000 people, respectively, by improving water supplies and sanitation facilities; if so, what is his response to the comments; if not, will he acquaint himself with Mr Arnold's comments and provide a response. (3) Has he (a) received correspondence or (b) been approached by charitable organisations, including World Vision Australia, and their representatives, pointing out the consequences of the Commonwealth's cuts to its overseas aid program in its past two Budgets; if so, what (i) organisations have made official representations to him regarding the cuts and (ii) has been his response to the concerns. (4) If he is not able to divulge which organisations have approached him, is he able to say how many have contacted him to voice their concerns; if not, why not. Mr Downer-An amended answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The amendment is in part 3 (ii) where the reference to 0.25 per cent is for 1996, not 1998 as tabled on 24 September 1997. (1) The following funds have been allocated to overseas aid: 1993-94 $1410.80 million, 1994-95 $1483.70 million, 1995-96 $1567.30 million, 199697 $1445.80 and 1997-98 $1429.90 million. (2) I am aware of the claim by the Chief Executive of World Vision Australia, Mr Lynn Arnold, that a number of the agency's projects will not proceed because of cuts to the official aid program in 1997-98. I understand that Mr Amold's concerns are directed in particular at the decision not ceed with the proposed Africa NGO Program (ANGOP). Mr Arnold's claim in respect of the World Vision projects is misleading. Total funds sought by non-government organisations (NGOs) under ANGOP was over $34 million. This was almost four times the amount of money notionally available. In such a competitive environment there was no guarantee that any of the World Vision projects would have been funded. Funding available for the AusAIDINGO Cooperation Program (ANCP), the central NGO funding mechanism, was increased by $3 million in the 1997/98 budget. World Vision will receive a significant proportion of these additional funds. It can allocate these funds to projects in Africa if it so chooses. My Parliamentary Secretary, the Hon Andrew Thomson MP, and I responded to Mr Arnold's concerns, on 20 June 1997 and 22 July 1997 respectively. Mr Arnold wrote to me on 28 July regretting the capacity for misunderstanding in the World Vision commentary on the ANGOP decision. (3) (i) I have received correspondence and representations from charitable organisations, including World Vision with regard to cuts to the overseas aid program in the past two budgets. 1996-97 Budget: (a) AusAID's records indicate that 44 charitable organisations wrote to me regarding cuts to the overseas aid program. These organisations were; Amnesty International, Anglican Board of Mission, Anglican Church Office (Synod), Archbishop of Melbourne's International Relief and Development Fund, Appropriate Technology for Community and Environment (APACE), AUSTCARE, Australian Baptist World Aid Inc, Australian Catholic Relief, Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA), Australian Executive Service Overseas Program (AESOP), Australian Lutheran World Service, Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad (APHEDA), Canberra PLANNERS, Christian Children's Fund, Community Aid Abroad, Family Planning Tasmania, Family Planning WA, Family Planning Australia, Global Education Centre, Global Learning Centre, Institute of Sisters of Mercy, Interplast Australia, Interserve Australia, International Planned Parenthood Federation (lPPF), Institute of Sisters of Mercy, International Women's Development Agency, Marist Mission Centre, National Council of Churches (Australia), Overseas Service Bureau, One World Learning Centre, Parramatta Diocesan Commission for Justice and Peace, Paulian Centre, PLAN International Australia, Quaker Service (NSW), to proSudan Interior Mission (SIMAID), Tasmanian Council of Churches, TEAR Australia, Save the Children, World Vision Australia, National Council of Women of Australia, the Population Council, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, World Wide Fund for Nature (Australia), and Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). (b) I also had meetings with the Executive Director and Executive Committee of ACFOA, the Overseas Service Bureau and the South Australian Council of Churches during which representations were made to me regarding the 1996-97 aid budget. 1997-98 Budget: (a) AusAID's records indicate that 12 charitable organisations wrote to me regarding cuts to the overseas aid program. These organisations were: Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA), Australian Expert Service Overseas Program (AESOP), African Enterprise, Australian Baptist World Service, Australian Lutheran World Service, Canberra PLANNERS, Community Aid Abroad (CAA), International Women's Development Agency, OZ Child, Quaker Service, World Vision Australia, and World Wide Fund for Nature. (b) I met with ACFOA and World Vision during which representations were made to me regarding the 1997-98 aid budget. (ii) My response has been to note that Australia's aid budget, $1430 million in 1997-98, is a very good outcome in the prevailing budgetary circumstances. Australia's Official Development Assistance (ODA) as a percentage of gross national product (GNP) is expected to be 0.27 per cent in 1997-98, which is above the latest average for all Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donor countries (0.25 per cent in 1996). This is a considerable commitment to the reduction of poverty in developing countries. The 1996-97 aid budget strengthened the overriding humanitarian focus of our aid program and the 1997-98 budget builds on those changes. Assistance to NGQs through the AusAID-NGO Cooperation Program (ANCP) will be increased in 1997-98 by $3 million or nearly 20 per cent. This increase to the central NGO program in a reduced aid budget is a firm indication of the Government's commitment to a genuine partnership with NGOs. The Government indirectly supports NGOs by offering tax deductibility for financial contributions from members of the public to eligible agencies. This concession is estimated to cost up to $50 million annually in revenue forgone, and represents further recognition by the Government of the valuable role played by NGOs. (4) According to AusAID records, allorganisations that have contacted me have been noted above. Child Care: Funding (Question No. 1874) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: (1) Further to her answer to question No. 626 (Hansard, 4 February 1997, page 98), what are the 5 community based child care centres in .the electoral division of Barton which will have their operational subsidies withdrawn on 1 July 1997. (2) What sum will be withdrawn in each case referred to in part (1). (3) Will extra funding for supplementary services and additional hands on care for children with high needs, including those with a disability, be provided to each of the child care centres referred to in her answer; if so, what. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Operational Subsidy was withdrawn on 1 July 1997 from: Kogarah Uniting Church Long Day Care Centre, 16, 18-18A Gray Street, KOGARAH NSW 2217. Macedonian Orthodox Community Child Care Centre, 7-10 Firth Street, ARNCLIFFE NSW 2205. Roslyn Hall Childrens Centre, 85-87 Cameron Street, ROCKDALE NSW 2216. Turrella Childrens Centre, 49 Walker Street, TURRELLA NSW 2205. The offer of additional Direct Partnership places with operational subsidy to the otherwise unfunded Ocean Street Child Care Centre, 62 Ocean Street, Kogarah, 2217 was rejected by the Centre thereby leaving four rather than five centres receiving operational subsidy in the electoral division of Barton. (2) In 1996-97 centres received the following funding: Kogarah Uniting Church Long Day Care Centre-$39,443 Macedonian Orthodox Community Child Care Centre-$34,748 Roslyn Hall Childrens Centre-$43,408 Turrella Childrens Centre-$57,185. (3) Supplementary Services (SUPS) and assiStance provided under the new Special Needs Subsidy Scheme (SNSS) is available to all approved services. The actual level of support provided depends on the needs of the service and the additional needs of the children in care.

Australia Victoria Postcode: 3074 3075 3076 3082 3083 3087 3088 3089 3090 (II) Because of the acquittal arrangements that amount paid for the period 1 January to 26 June 1997 Nursing Homes and Hostel Residents: Electoral Division of Parkes (Question No. 2020) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (1) How many residents are there in (a) hostels and (b) nursing homes in (i) Australia, (ii) each State and (iii) the electoral division of Parkes. (2) What sum of government subsidy is paid to hostels and nursing homes in (a) Australia, (b) each State and (c) the electoral division of Parkes. Child-care Assistance Payments (Question No. 2008) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: What sum in child care assistance per child per annum was allocated to (a) community long day care, (b) family day care and (c) private long day care services in (i) Australia, (ii) Victoria and (iii) within the postcode areas of (A) 3074, (B) 3075, (C) 3076, (D) 3082, (E) 3083, (F) 3087, (G) 3088, (H) 3089 and (I) 3090 in (I) 1996 and (II) the period 1 January to 26 June 1997. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The amount of Childcare Assistance paid per child in 1996 for each service type and area requested is shown on the attached table. Childcare Assistance paid per chi1d-1996 Community Long Day Family Day Care Ser- Private Long Day Care Care Centres vices Services $2,003.72 $1,526.39 $2,178.66 $2,207.47 $1,410.09 $2,641.73 $2,479.97 Nil $3,862.07 $3,905.22 Nil $3,099.67 $2,661.56 $1,834.16 $2,801.20 $2,544.77 Nil $2,545.72 $2,331.64 Nil $1,818.53 Nil Nil Nil $1,403.04 $1,364.37 $2,266.07 Nil Nil $1,416.15 Nil Nil Nil currently apply to Childcare Assistance payments, the will not be available until the end of October 1997. (3) How many, and what percentage, of nursing home residents previously were accommodated in hostels. (4) How many hostel residents could be classified as nursing home patients. (5) When were entry fees or accommodation bonds for admission into hostels first introduced and who was the responsible Minister. (6) Under what criteria were entry fees to hostels to be charged. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable (1)ACT NSW NT QLD SA TAS VIC WA NA Parkes (2)Expenditure in $m for ACT NSW NT QLD SA TAS VIC WA NA Parkes (3) In the course of a year, around 9,000 residents (23 per cent of those entering) enter nursing homes from hostels. (4) It is difficult to provide a precise answer here, as there is not a clearly defined demarcation. A significant proportion of hostel residents are claimed to have Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) approval to enter a nursing home. The development of the new Resident Classification Scale showed a 10 per cent overlap between the nursing home and hostel populations in terms of dependency, and this will continue to increase as the balance of care changes. (5) The existing entry contribution arrangements in hostels came into force on 11 January 1989. Mr Peter Staples was the responsible Minister. (6) The criteria for charging entry contributions were determined by the Minister in General Condimember's question is as follows: Hostel and Nursing Home residents, as at 6 June 1997 Hostel Nursing homes 728 514 18882 28426 133 204 12087 11927 6104 6885 1502 2116 14908 16792 5437 5659 59781 72523 481 437 Hostels and Nursing Homes for 1996-1997.

The General Conditions set out requirements which approved hostel operators must comply with including: - not charging an entry contribution which would leave a resident with assets less than 2.5 times the annual maximum basic single rate of pension, or double that amount in the case of a couple who jointly pay an entry contribution; - using entry contributions, including any amounts derived from them, only to meet the capital and/or recurrent costs of an approved hostel; - refunding entry contributions within specific time periods, depending on whether a resident enters the hostel and for how long the resident lives in the hostel. The maximum period within which a refund must be made was 6 months; and - maximum amounts of an entry contribution which may be retained by a hostel operator. For residents who lived in a hostel for a minimum period of 6 months up to a maximum period of 5 years, the retention amount was $1,300 for each 6 month period of residence, calculated from the date of entry. No further retention amounts were permitted after 5 years residence.

Clontarf Boys Home (Question No. 2072) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: 4127 8846 6844 151 3 7054 3 (1) Has his attention been drawn to a plea by Detective P. O'Reilly of the Western Australian Police Child Abuse Unit that appeared on page 11 of Medicus Vol. 36 No.8 September 1996 for information from Western Australian doctors about an electric-shock anti-bedwetting device that was apparently attached to the penises of boys in Clontarf Boys' Home in the 1950s. (2) Is he able to say whether the Provincial Superior of the Holy Spirit Provincialate of the Christian Brothers of Western Australia and South Australia on page 7 of the Western Australian Roman Catholic newspaper The Record, dated 19 staff September 1996, said that an electric device was used at Clontarf Boys' Home in the 1950s, the device having been recommended by the Child Welfare Department, who sent a doctor to Clontarf to explain its use. (3) Is he able to say whether the device is the same as that described by N.D. Crosby, working with a grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council, on page 537 of The Medical Journal of Australia Vol. 11, No 15, Saturday, October 7 1950. (4) Is he also able to say whether the device was attached to the person of an inmate of Clontarf Boys' Home who was a child migrant as described by the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act.",127
317,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,AUST,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(2) I am unable to provide an answer as the responsibility for such matters lie primarily with the State Governments of South and Western Australia. (3) As my Department has no knowledge of the device described in part (1), I am unable to state definitively whether that device is the same as that described by N.D. Crosby in The Medical Journal days stress per staff of Australia. (4) see answer to parts (1)-(2). Narcotics: Production and Distribution (Question No. 2082) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice on 25 August 97: (1) Has Australia participated in the international community's attempts to control the production and distribution of narcotics; if so, how. (2) What treaties or conventions has Australia signed or ratified with respect to the production and distribution of narcotics. (3) To what extent have the treaties and conventions referred to in part (2) been successful in combating the production and distribution of narcotics. (4) Do Australia's treaty obligations prevent or restrict the Federal Parliament, or State Parliaments, from introducing trials to address the drug problem which may involve a position which is less than complete prohibition; if so, will the Government attempt to redress the situation in future negotiations. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia is an active participant in international efforts to control the production, distribution and consumption of illicit narcotics and has been an active member of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs since 1973. Australia's National Drug Strategy, which advocates a balance between Demand Reduction and Supply Control to combat the illicit drug problem, is regarded by the United Nations International Drug Control Program as a comprehensive model strategy to restrict the supply of illicit drugs and their corresponding use. Australia contributes annually approximately $A720,000 in funding to the United Nations International Drug Control Program which has the mandate to address the production, manufacture, distribution and consumption of illicit narcotics. Australia maintains a Close relationship with like minded countries to exchange information on illicit narcotics issues both bilaterally and through such institutions as the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the United Nations International Drug Control Program. Through participation in the O.E.C.D's Financial Action Task Force, Australia has also assisted a number of countries in the Asia Pacific region to strengthen their banking legislation with a view to reducing the possibility of laundered money, gained from illicit drug sales, reaching the people who profit from this type of enterprise. (2) Australia is a party to the following agreements with respect to the production and distribution of narcotics:The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961as amended by the 1972 protocol, The Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, and The United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988. (3) The agreements referred to in (2) have contributed to the control of the production, manufacture and distribution oUllicit drugs in a global sense and helped reduce the opportunities for the manufacturers and distributors of these substances from readily accessing their profits. They have also enhanced cooperation and information sharing between parties. (4) Medical and scientific research use of narcotic drugs, including clinical trials, are envisaged in a limited way under Articles 2 and 4 of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, as or Territory amended by the 1972 protocol: Article 2, paragraph 5(b) states that ""A party shall, if in its opinion the prevailing conditions in its country render it the most appropriate means of protecting the public health and welfare, prohibit the production, manufacture, export and import of, trade in, possession or use of any such drug except for amounts which may be necessary for medical and scientific research only, including clinical trials therewith to be conducted under or subject to the direct supervision and control of the Party"". Article 4, paragraph (c) states ""Subject to the provisions of this Convention, to limit exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of drugs"". I am not aware of any proposal to amend these provisions. Dyslexia and Attention Deficit Disorder (Quefotion No. 2094) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the motion moved by the Member for Cowan on 20 May 1996 relating to the problems associated with the disabling conditions of the Dyslexia and Attention Deficit Disorders. (2) Has the Government taken steps to initiate further investigation of those disabling conditions and will the Government reimburse parents of children suffering those disabilities the full cost of necessary medical and pharmaceutical treatment.",153
318,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,AUST,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of the motion moved by the Member for Cowan on 20 May 1996, as seconded by the honourable member for Dunkley, relating to the problems associated with the disabling conditions of the Dyslexia and Attention Deficit Disorder. I subsequently wrote to the Member for Cowan, enclosing a copy of a draft National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) report on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This report has now been finalised and is being prepared for printing and distribution. The document presents a series of recommendations concerning the optimal assessment, diagnosis and management of ADHD. (2) The Government has taken further steps to investigate Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Dyslexia. In 1995, the NHMRC provided approximately $58,000 for ADHD research, with this funding increasing to approximately $110,000 for ADHD and Dyslexia research in 1996. In 1997 the NHMRC will be providing $201,000 for research into ADHD and Dyslexia. In funding research in these areas, it is hoped that we might better understand the disorders and their optimal management. In addition, as previously stated, the NHMRC has already moved to prepare evidence-based advice on the assessment, diagnosis and management of ADHD.2. In relation to reimbursement of treatment costs to parents, while there are no specific items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule for the treatment of Dyslexia and ADHD, Medicare benefits would be payable for services listed in the Schedule when rendered by qualified medical practitioners in conjunction with such treatment (e.g. professional attendances), provided the services were ""clinically relevant"", i.e. generally accepted by the medical profession as being necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient's medical condition. Medicare benefits are payable at 85 per cent of the Schedule fee for out-of-hospital services, with a maximum payment by the patient of $50.00 for each service where the Schedule fee is charged. For services rendered to private patients in hospital, benefits are paid at 75 per cent of the Schedule with the funds required to cover the ""gap"" between the Medicare rebate and the Schedule fee for insured patients. The question of Medicare benefits for diagnosis of attention deficit disorder (ADD) was last considered in 1995 when, following the advice of the medical profession, benefits were precluded for electroencephalographic (BEG) services where the service involved quantitative topographic mapping using ""neurometrics"" or similar devices. The Australian Association of Neurologists and the Australian College of Paediatrics advised that the 'neurometrics' test used in the diagnosis of ADD is not yet proven, and should be regarded as a research tool rather than an essential part of the clinical assessment of children with ADD. Medical services do not attract Medicare benefits unless they are beyond the experimental stage and have had their clinical effectiveness and efficacy established. Pharmaceutical benefits for the prescribed drug dexamphetamine sulfate, are available on a restricted basis for the treatment of ADHD in accordance with State and Territory law. Hearing Aids (Question No. 2095) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: Has the Government removed the entitlement of senior citizens in receipt of the old age pension to be reimbursed for the cost of hearing aids; if so, will the Government reverse its decision in view of the extreme hardship caused to those senior citizens who are hearing impaired.",154
319,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,AUST,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: Composition (Question No. 2103) Mr MCClelland asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Will the Government change the composition of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. (2) Will the Government abolish any of the Commission's positions; if so, (a) what positions and (b) what areas of responsibility are attached to the positions. (3) Did the Commission's case load increase fee, between 1987 and 1996; if so, to what extent. (4) Has funding for the Commission been reduced by the Government; if so by what sum. (5) Are proposed changes to the Commission the result of a reduction in funding; if so, to what extent. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. On 23 September 1997 I announced changes to the structure and composition of the renamed Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission. Details of these changes are provided in the answer to the following question. Australians can be assured that these changes will not diminish the capacity of the Commission to uphold the principles of the legislation it administers. (2) The structure of the new Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission will consist of a president and three deputy presidents. The president, deputy presidents and the commission as a whole will have the responsibility of protecting and promoting human rights. In order to achieve a balance between the need to maintain areas of expertise and the unsustainable structure of portfolio specific commissioners, deputy president will also have responsibility for particular areas. One deputy president will be assigned general responsibility for sex discrimination and equal opportunity; one will be assigned human rights and disability discrimination and one Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice and race discrimination. The deputy president responsible for human rights and disability will also be able to develop expertise in other areas such as children and the aged. Removing the top-heavy structure of six specific commissioners while maintaining areas of expertise will allow for the development of a more collegiate organisation protecting everyone's rights and promoting awareness of our responsibilities to each other. (3) Yes. The Commission' s annual reports indicate the case load has increased from 1382 complaints in the 1986/87 financial year to 2840 complaints in the 1995/96 financial year. (4) The reduction to HREOC base funding in this financial year (1997/98) is $0.792 million. This comprises the standard 1% efficiency dividend and the 4% efficiency saving applicable to agencies within the Attorney-General's portfolio. The reduction to HREOC base funding in the following financial year (1998/99) amounts to $4.473 million. This comprises the standard 1% efficiency dividend and an additional running cost saving. This reduction should be considered in light of the fourfold increase in HREOC funding over the past nine years. These figures do not take into account reductions associated with the completion of short term projects or transfers of function. (5) No, the changes are being implemented to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Commission. Stolen Children Report: Government (Question No. 2104) Mr MCClelland asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: What steps is the Government taking to respond to the 'Stolen Children' report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and; when will the Government make a response. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The recommendations in the 'Bringing them each Home' Report are wide-ranging. They traverse not only the vast field of Commonwealth responsibility, but also that of the State and Territory governments and of many non-government organisations. An inter-departmental committee (IDC), chaired by the Department of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, has been established to coordinate issues across the Commonwealth, and to consider possible action in response to those recommendations falling within our areas of responsibility. The following agencies are represented on the IDC: Attorney General's; Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Communications and the Arts; Health and Family Services; Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs; Finance; and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I am advised that my colleague, Senator Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, has written to his State and Territory counterparts urging them to give careful consideration to the Report and its recommendations. In its response to the Report, the Government will be focussing on practical measures such as family reunion and counselling to assist people affected by previous child removal policies and practices. The Report itself concluded that ""assisting family reunions is the most significant and urgent need of separated families"" (page 347). This approach was endorsed by Ministers at the meeting of the Ministerial Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (MCATSIA) on 15 August 1997. Ministers also agreed that each of their governments would respond individually to the recommendations addressed to them, and that they would cooperate on any particular matters requiring inter-governmental coordination. (2) The Government is fully committed to giving the recommendations in the Report the close and careful consideration that they deserve, and has indicated that it will respond to the Report by the end of the calendar year. Response War Service Home Loans: Interest (Question No. 2107) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 25 August 1997. (1) What is the interest rate charged on war service home loans. (2) Is there a sliding scale for the interest rate charged on war service home loans: if so, what are the details. (3) Will the interest rate be reduced in line with interest rate reductions which have occurred elsewhere over the past year. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) War Service Home loans, now known as Defence Service Home loans, are administered under the legislative authority of the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. There are a number of different types of loans funded under the Act and the rates of interest for each type are specified in the Act. The details are: Initial Advances-The interest rate charged on initial wear/defence service home loans (known as Initial Advances) is currently 6.85% pa. Further Advances-The interest rate for Further Advances varies according to the rate applicable to the last preceding advance. Generally, this varies from 3.75% pa to tively around 6.85% pa in the majority of circumstances. WidowlWidower Advances-The interest rate charged on WidowlWidower Advances is 3.75% pa. Advances for Essential Repairs-The interest rate on Advances for Essential Repairs is 10% pa. Additional Advances-The interest rate on Additional Advances varies, but could be either 6.85% pa, 10% pa, 7.25% pa or 3.75% pa, or a combination of those rates, depending upon the interest rate and structure of the current loan. (2) Initial and Further Advances granted by the former Defence Service Homes Corporation before 19 December 1988 were graduated in tiers as follows: First Tier-$0--$12,000 @ 3.75% pa Second Tier-$12,001-$15,000 @ 7.25% pa Third Tier-$15,001-$25,000 @ 10% pa The rules applicable at the time resulted in some Further Advances having various combinations in those tiers, often with larger proportionate amounts in the 10% pa tiers. Initial Advances and most Further Advances granted since 19 December 1988 have been at 6.85% pa, which is the approximate effective rate over the life of the standard three tiered loans. However, some Further Advances granted since 1 July 1995 have also been granted in tiers, the basic rule now being that Further Advances mirror the terms of the immediately preceding advance. If the preceding advance is a tiered loan, then the Further Advance reflects the same tiers. (3) On 3 September 1997, I announced a reduction in the DSH interest rates following five consecutive cuts to official rates which have occurred since the Government took office. Under the proposed new arrangements, loans with tiers at 10% pa and 7.25% pa will be restructured into single blended rates. This means that tiered loans will be at either 3.75% pa, 4.5% pa, or 6.85% pa, depending upon the type and structure of the tiers of the current loans. In addition, the rates for Advances for Essential Repairs and Additional Advances will be reduced to 6.85% pa for both new and existing loans where the current rates exceed that rate and where separate loan accounts are maintained. Furthermore, the Government is introducing a guaranteed minimum rate of subsidy of 1.5% below the calculated Benchmark Rate. Under present market conditions this will mean that the 6.85% pa loans will be reduced to 5.63% pa, i.e. 1.5% below effec- the current Benchmark Rate of 7.13% pa. The Benchmark Rate is calculated by reference to the average of the unregulated standard annual rates of interest for owner-occupied housing loans provided by the five largest banking group providers of housing finance in Australia. It is calculated monthly. The necessary changes to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 will be introduced into Parliament during the Spring 1997 Sittings. The measures are planned to commence on 5 January 1998 subject to the passage of that legislation. Post-traumatic Stress Disorder: Applications (Question No. 2109) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) What proportion of successful Post Traumatic Stress Disorder applicants were assessed at (a) 40% or greater, (b) 50% or greater and (c) 60% or greater in each State in (i) 1995 and (ii) 1996. (2) What was the rejection rate for each State in each year in part (1). Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The percentages provided below relate to the pension assessment for all the accepted disabilities in each case at the time that the veteran's Post Traumatic Stress Disorder was accepted. Individual disabilities are not assessed in terms of a pension rate. The pension rate is assessed on the combined effect on medical impairment and lifestyle of all the accepted disabilities. Each category includes pension assessments made above the 100% General Rate, that is Inter 1995 NSW 40%+ 95 50%+ 89 60%+ 79 1996 NSW 40%+ 96 50%+ 88 60%+ 79 (2) The rejection rates for each State are: Year NSW Vic 1995 1.3 2.2 1996 1.7 1.8 Some of these rejection rates are based on small rejection rates may not be significant. Media Laws: Lobbying (Question No. 2122) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) When did the Minister first become aware of the engagement of Mr M. Kroger's firm by companies associated with Mr K. Packer and Mr 1. Packer for the purpose of lobbying the Government on media law changes.

Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Minister first became aware of Mr Kroger's appointment through media speculation. (2 and 3) In considering the matter of cross media reform the Minister had discussions with a range of interested parties on numerous occasions. (4) The Government has put cross media reform on the back burner in order to concentrate on the critical issues facing all Australians such as employment generation, taxation reform and improvements to the Native Title Legislation. Hunian Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: Budget Reduction (Question No. 2129) Mr Mossfield asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Did the Government recently announce a 43% budget reduction to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity commission (HREOC) over 3 years. (2) If so, will there be a loss of more than 60 positions. . (3) Will the loss of staff cause the abandonment of current projects. (4) Will the departmental rationalisation and transfer of hearing functions still1eave an effective overall cut to HREOC of 30%. (5) Will the cuts have a detrimental effect on areas of concern handled with HREOC assistance by groups such as the Australian Association of the Deaf (Inc). (6) Will the staff cuts and project abandonment have a detrimental effect on remedies to assist the issues of abuse, discrimination and intolerance towards persons with disabilities and other minority groups. (7) Will the cuts have an effect on how the complaints will be handled and the length of time to handle and respond to complaints from disabled persons such as the hearing impaired. (8) Will the cuts prolong existing discriminatory practices and negative attitudes toward persons with disabilities. (9) Is he taking steps to ensure attitudes dis; played by individuals toward persons with disabilities and other minority groups are protected and that unsatisfactory practices cease; if so, what. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The recently announced reductions to HREOC's budget amount in real terms to a cut of approximately 27%. However this reduction must be seen in light of the fourfold increase in HREOC funding over the past nine years. (2) There will be a reduction of staff numbers by 56 in the current financial year to address future budgetary constraints. HREOC is currently undergoing a major restructure. Under the proposed restructure the role of the current Privacy Commissioner will be separated from HREOC and will be established in a new statutory Office of Privacy Commissioner. Until this is done it will not be possible to comment on the overall reduction of staff over a period of 3 years. (3) HREOC advises that the precise impact of the cuts on the various projects is not known at present. HREOC is currently undergoing a major restructure and, until that is in place, decisions on work programs and priorities cannot be finalised. (4) No. See answer to Question 1. (5) See answer to Question 3. (6) See answer to Question 3. (7) In managing the reduction to its budget, HREOC is giving particular priority to complaint handling, to ensure that as far as possible the complaint response and handling times now being achieved are maintained. (8) See answer to Question 3 . (9) The Government is committed to effective and equitable protection and promotion of human rights of people with disabilities and other minority . groups in Australia. To achieve this the Government fully supports a strong and independent human rights organisation which has a role to play in assisting all Australians to take action to protect their human rights. The changes proposed in the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 will consolidate the divergent complaint handling regimes in various Acts into one simplified scheme to make it easier for people with disabilities and other minority groups to seek a remedy when there is a breach of their human rights. Regional Forest Agreements: Economic Impa-t Analysis (Question No. 2142) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an advertisement in the Weekend Australian, dated 16-17 August 1997, at page 32, requesting a tender for the economic impact analysis of regional forest agreements for the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. (2) If so, who determined that an economic impact analysis should be conducted. (3) Was he involved in m<iking the decision. (4) What is the objective of the analysis. (5) Who is paying for the analysis and is it the subject of external funding. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The economic impact analysis referred to forms part of the assessments of forest values agreed by each of the Commonwealth and States governments undertaking regional forest agreements. (3) No. (4) The objective of the analysis is to provide advice to the Commonwealth's Forest Task Force on the economic characteristics of the regions concerned and on the likely economic implications of future resource use options. (5) ABARE is paying for the analysis from funds appropriated to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy for regional forest agreements. Landmines (Question No. 2144) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 26 August 1997: (1) Is he able to say which states have ratified the (a) Inhumane Weapons Convention (Geneva, 10 October 1980) and (b) Protocols to the Convention and on what dates did they ratify them. (2) What is the text of the declaration adopted the International Conference for a Global Ban on Landmines in Brussels in June 1997.

They are convinced that this solution must include the early conclusion of a comprehensive ban on anti-personne1.landmines. They recall that United Nations General Assembly resolution 51145 S, supported by 156 States, urged the vigorous pursuit of ""an effective, legally binding international agreement to ban the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnellandmines"". In that spirit they affirm that the essential elements of such an agreement should include: Protocols Ratification, acceptance (A), approval (AA), accession (a), succession (d) I II (old) II (new) III IV 12 August 1997 X X X 12 August 1997 (a) 8 June 1982 X X X NA 18 Oct 1993 X X X 10 Nov 1992 (a) X X X 7 June 1983 X X X I April 1985 X X X 26 March 1997 X X X X 26 March 1997 (a) 3 July 1997 (a) X X 3 July 1997 X X 3 July 1997 IS July 1996 X X X 12 June 1997 X X 12 June 1997 2 June 1983 X X X 4 April 1997 X X X 26 July 1995 X X X 10 June 1982 X X X 28 May 1993 (d) X X X 6 July 1992 (d) X X X 13 Sept 1995 (a) X X X 29 Dec 1993 X X X 7 July 1982 X X X 16 July X X IS Jan 1997 20 Aug 1982 X X X NA 15 May 1987 (a) X X X 14 Nov 1995 (a) X X X 23 June 1982 X X X 13 Feb 1995 X X X 24 Mar 1995 X X 6 Oct 1994 (a) X X X 24 May 1983 X X X 70 70 67 10 66 13 - a comprehensive ban on the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines, - the destruction of stockpiled and removed antipersonnel landmines, - international co-operation and assistance in the field of mine clearance in affected countries. The following States: encouraged by the work of the Brussels Conference; encouraged further by numerous national and regional initiatives and measures taken to eliminate anti-personnel landmines; encouraged by the attention given to this subject by the United Nations and by other fora; encouraged, finally, by the active support of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and numerous other Non-governmental Organisations; welcome the convening of a Diplomatic Conference by the Government of Norway in Oslo on 1 September 1997 to negotiate such an agreement; also welcome the important work done by the Government of Austria on the text of a draft agreement which contains the essential elements identified above and decide to forward it to the Oslo Diplomatic Conference in order to be considered together with other relevant proposals which may be put forward there; affirm their objective of concluding the negotiation and signing of such an agreement banning antipersonnel landmines before the end of 1997 in Ottawa; invite all other States to join them in their efforts towards such an agreement. Comcar: Drivers (Question No. 2156) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 27 August 1997: State ACT NSW VIC QLD SA WA TAS Total Total Drivers (b) 25 August 1997: State ACT NSW VIC QLD SA WA TAS Total Total Drivers (1) How many Comcar drivers were employed in each capital city on (a) 1 March 1996 and (b) 25 August 1997. (2) With the increased use of private hire cars to provide transport for Members, Senators and senior officials, what steps have been, or will be, taken to ensure that drivers are able to make speedy and effective contact with their passengers at airports and other places of meeting. (3) Will systems be instituted to ensure (a) passengers are able to recognise their drivers, including holding up notices with names on them or using colour coding and (b) drivers are able to recognise their passengers, including providing drivers with booklets containing photographs of Members of Parliament. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am advised of the following details: (a) 1 March 1996 Full Time Casual Drivers 41.5 76 35 13 24 18 12 6 10 5 10 5 2 5 134.5 128 262.5 Full Time Casual Drivers 38 70 25 8 24 17 12 6 10 4 7 5 2 4 118 114 232 (2) and (3) I am advised that, under the COMCAR Use Agreement (Buyers Guide 20)Hire Car (Chauffeur Driven) and Executive Taxi Services, hire car drivers are required to meet Senators and Members at the designated Comcar meeting points at all airports. To help identify and locate customers, hire car drivers can display notices with the word ""COMCAR"" to assist passengers. They are instructed that they are not to use the customer's name on those display boards. Native Title (Question No. 2157) Mr Campbell asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 27 August 1997: Does Native Title exist on conditional purchase and perpetual lease land; if so, is prime farming and forestry land affected in a similar manner to pastoral land; if not, why not.",155
320,Mr HOWARD,X X X,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is not possible to advise generally whether native title exists on conditional purchase and perpetual lease land. To determine whether native title does exist on such tenures it would be necessary to consider the legislation under which the particular lease was granted and possibly the terms and conditions of the lease itself. The Government has released Schedule 4 to the Native Title Amendment Bill. The Schedule, which will add a Schedule to the Native Title Act, contains leases which the relevant State or Territory, and the Commonwealth, consider, on the basis of the common law, have conferred exclusive possession and therefore extinguished native title. The Bill provides that the relevant State or Territory is able to confirm that the grant of a lease on the Schedule has extinguished native title. A ARMY INFANTRY BATTALIONS-POSTED Unit NA The Pilbara Regiment 51 FNQR 3 RAR 517 RAR 1 RAR 2RAR 6RAR 25/49 RQR 9RQR 31 RQR number of conditional purchase and perpetual leases are on the Schedule. These are found in Part 4 of the Schedule, and include in relation to Western Australia, a conditional purchase lease under clause 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52 or 53 of the Land Regulations 1887 (WA), Part V or VI of the Land Act 1898 (WA) or Part 5 of the Land Act 1933 (WA) and a perpetual lease under the War Service Land Settlement Scheme Act 1954 (WA). Whether prime farming and forestry land can be subject to native title in a similar manner to pastoral land is dependent on the tenure under which the farming and forestry land is held. Australian Army: Battalion Staff (Question No. 2169) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 28 August 1997: (1) How many staff are in each battalion in the Australian Army. (2) How many staff are in each vessel of the (a) DDG, (b) FFG, (c) FFH, (d) DE, (e) Patrol Boat, (f) Submarine, (g) Afloat Support, (h) Mine Countermeasures, (i) Amphibious and (j) Marine Science RAN Combat Force Element Groups. (3) How many staff are in each RAAF squadron. (4) What is the peacetime establishment and number of staff of7 Task Force at 27 August 1997. (5) Is 7 Task Force fully resourced; if not, what resources are still to be provided. (6) Will 7 Task Force reach its peacetime establishment and be fully resourced; if so, when. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The current manning level of each Regular and Reserve infantry battalion is as follows: STRENGTH AS AT 31 AUGUST 1997 Officers Other Ranks Total ARA ARA ARA GRes Civilians Total 14 39 53 303 2 358 8 24 32 167 3 202 11 30 41 370 5 416 39 562 601 6 607 37 484 521 4 525 40 648 688 688 40 610 650 650 30 347 377 277 5 659 19 266 285 429 4 718 6 86 92 381 5 478 2 17 19 219 1 239 Unit 42 RQR 5/6 RVR 8/7 RVR 1119 RNSWR 4/3 RNSWR 2117 RNSWR 41 RNSWR 10/27 RSAR 12/40 RTR 11/28 RWAR 16 RWAR Totals (2) The number of staff per Class of Ship DDG FFG FFH (ANZAC) DE NA SUBMARINE (OBERON) SUBMARINE (COLLINS) AFLOAT SUPPORT (SUCCESS) AFLOAT SUPPORT (WESTRALIA) AFLOAT SUPPORT (PROTECTOR) AMPHIBIOUS (TOBRUK) AMPHIBIOUS (MANOORA) AMPHIBIOUS (LCH) MARINE SCIENCE (MORESBY) MARINE SCIENCE (FLINDERS) MARINE SCIENCE (SML) MARINE SCIENCE (NEW HYDRO) (3) Air Force Headquarters have advised that there is no definitive establishment or strength for RAAF squadrons. The establishment for each squadron is dependent upon the squadron's role, the type of aircraft flown, administrative arrangements within the force element group and the maintenance responsibility for the aircraft. For example, No 11 Squadron, which operates P3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, has an establishment of 103 which consists entirely of aircrew. That number provides up to eight P3C Orion crews, navigators, flight engineers, air electronics officers and airborne electronic analysts.

As a contrast, No 77 Squadron, which operates Hornet fighter aircraft, has an establishment of 157, the majority of whom are technical personnel. The Hornet aircraft requires only one pilot, but its dayto-day maintenance is carried out at the Squadron. (4) The peacetime establishment and the current manning level of 7th Task Force as at 22 September 1997 is as follows: Unit HQ7TF 2114 LHR (QMI) (Recon) 1 Fd Regt 2CER 7 CSU (-) 6RAR 25/49 RQR 7 CSS Bn 9RQR Sub-Total Surplus Staff (W/out Estab Cover) Total (5) 6th Brigade and 7th Brigade amalgamated on 1 July 97 to form 7th Task Force (7 TF). The TF has been resourced to a level to allow it to undertake trials in support of Restructuring the Army (RTA). The TF is specifically involved in the integration trial of part-time and full-time personnel and the 6th Battalion. The Royal Australian Regiment is involved with the development of the motorisation and embedding trials. The TF retains the personnel, equipment and other resources illlocated to it as a Ready Reserve Brigade. Under RT A, the ARA component of the TF has increased from 1,163 to 1,446 personnel. (6) The TF has an establishment of 4,281 personnel with 4,187 positions actually filled. There are, however, approximately 980 personnel who are not suitable from a rank/trade perspective to fill these positions. It is Army's aim to retrain and/or repost these individuals over the next two years to significantly reduce the rank/trade imbalance. Department of Defence: Information (Question No. 2171) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 28 August 1997: (1) Will the tender evaluation and decision in ,relation to the information technology facilities (CRISP) in the Russell redevelopment be undertaken by (a) his Department or (b) the prime contractor, Civil and Civic.

(3) What processes were followed to produce the original RFT document. (4) Did the original RFT fail to indicate details of evaluation criteria; if so, why. (5) What are the evaluation criteria to be used for tender evaluation. (6) When were potential suppliers provided with the evaluation criteria. (7) What measures have been adopted to ensure the involvement of the small and medium size enterprises. (8) Have existing purchasing arrangements, including the Defence Preferred Systems Integrators and PD50 contracts, been ignored; if so why. (9) What procedures have been established to ensure that value for money rather than initial price will be applied in tender evaluation. Technology (10) Did the RFT omit direction as to which requirements are mandatory, highly desirable or desirable; if so, why. (11) Is Civil and Civic required to provide his Department with the details of information technology systems for the redevelopment as a separate and distinct item. (12) Is Civil and Civic required to provide his Department with details of the anticipated ongoing costs associated with the CRISP acquisition. (l3) Is Civil and Civic required to meet any ongoing costs associated with the CRISP environment; if so, for what period. (14) Will the new CRISP IT environment replace existing older systems. (15) Will it be necessary for some staff to have access to both the existing older systems and the new CRISP environment. (16) What implication for office space and other relevant matters have been identified should it be necessary for both the older system and the CRISP system to be available for staff. (17) Will tenders be considered by an acquisition council; if so, when (a) was the decision taken and (b) will the council make its recommendations. (18) Is he able to say (a) which consultants engaged by Civil and Civic to assist in writing the RFT.and (b) whether the consultants have commercial links with the firms likely to tender for the project. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Parallel but separate tender evaluations will be undertaken by the Department of Defence as the client, and by Civil & Civic as the managing contractor. The outcomes of this process will be considered by an Acquisition Councilor like process with the Department of Defence making the final selection decision. (2) The original tender did not specify preferred solutions, but sought proposals from industry which would position Defence to take advantage of future developments in information technology. Annex B to the original 415 page tender did contain a reference to a particular product. This error was rectified through an advice issued four days after the release of the tender. (3) A Statement of Requirement was produced by Defence, and provided to the Managing Contractor, Civil & Civic as the Defence requirement for CRISP. Civil & Civic used this Statement of Requirement to develop a draft RFT which integrated CRISP with the overall Russell project. The draft RFf was then returned to Defence for agreement and clearance to Civil & Civic to release the RFf. (4) Civil & Civic issued the with its contractual requirements to provide Defence with fully functional and integrated new and refurbished buildings at Russell Offices. As the Managing Contractor, it was a matter for Civil & Civic to determine the form of the tender documentation. It is not a Civil & Civic practice to issue evaluation criteria. (5) Evaluation plans were established by Defence and Civil & Civic to assess technical merits of the bids against four criteria relating to the provision of a homogeneous network for the Russell buildings, migration of and ongoing support for legacy business applications, reduced ongoing support for the new environment and proven project management experience in the field of information techn01ogy integration. At the conclusion of the technical assessment, the financial aspects of the tenders will be considered, leading to a value for money assessment. (6) The information contained in the answer to Question 5 was conveyed to potential suppliers at an industry briefing in mid-July 1997. (7) The RFT requires each tenderer to identify the ANZ content of their proposals. The provisions of the Defence Preferred Systems Integrator panel were contract maximises the involvement of Australian industry through teaming and/or partnership arrangements and will be utilised in the finalisation of the CRISP tender process. (8) The tenders were issued by, and will be managed as sub-contracts to the prime contract by Civil & Civic. All of the companies on the Defence Preferred Systems Integrator and PD50 panels were invited to tender for the respective systems integration contract and the supply of desktop hardware. (9) Standard Defence evaluation procedures lead to a decision based on value for money. Initial price is only one element of the evaluation. (10) This tender did not use the concept. of varying degrees of compliance. The tenderers were requested to provide a fully compliant solution .. (11) Yes. Each group of work packages associated with information systems, ie cabling, systems integration/migration and desktop products will be let as separate and distinct sub-contracts. (12) Yes. Both the Civil & Civic and Defence evaluations will produce a selection which represents best value for money, taking into account ongoing costs during the contract period. (l3) The Statement of Requirement requires the system to be warranted, and software updating to be provided until 2001. (14) CRISP will replace existing network systems and some desktop hardware and servers. CRISP will not replace existing Defence business application systems which will be migrated to the new tender in accordance environment. (15) Once staff are established in the new buildings, CRISP will provide a new network system which will enable them to access existing migrated business applications. (16) The older network systems being replaced by CRISP will not be available in the new buildings. These older systems will be retained in their existing location until migration to CRISP has been complete. (17) Yes, Defence will form a panel comprising internal and external representatives, similar in nature to an acquisition council required under previous rules for high cost information technology acquisitions. Although the panel is only now being formed, the intention to do so had been under consideration prior to the release of tenders, as part of agreeing the tender evaluation methodology. The decision to adopt an acquisition council process was confIrmed in mid-August. Its recommendations are expected in late September/early October. (18) Civil & Civic employed Gus Koller and Associates to assist in writing the RFr. To the best of Defence's knowledge, Gus Koller and Associates has no commercial links with any of the fIrms invited to tender for the project. A commercial contract between Gus Koller and Associates and IBM, one of the prospective tenders, was terminated before work began on writing the RFf.

Special Needs Subsidy Scheme: Supplementary Services Program (Question No. 2192) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 2 September 1997: (1) What role do Supplementary Services Program (SSP) workers play in the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme (SNSS). (2) Do the SNSS guidelines state that the services provided under SSP are integral to the provision of SNSS support. (3) Has Fairfield City Council had its SSP funding reduced by approximately $60,000 by the Federal Government; if so why. (4) Is she able to say whether the decision to reduce Fairfield City Council's SSP funding has resulted in Council having to cut its entire detail of five SSP workers from its employment; if so, how will SSP workers play an integral part in the SNSS in the greater Fairfield area when there are no longer SSP workers available in the community to participate. (5) What steps has the Government taken to inform child care centre operators, local government councils and agencies representing disabled children of the operations and guidelines of the SNSS. (6) Has the Government published an information kit on the SNSS; if so, (a) when was it published and (b) (i) when and (ii) how was it distributed. (7) How do the agencies access funding under the SNSS. (8) How many child care centres, local government councils or disabled children agencies have made use of the SNSS at 2 September 1997. (9) Is it a fact that under the SNSS a casual wage of $13 an hour can be paid for an extra childcare worker for every disabled child placed in community based child care; if so, is she able to say whether in NSW an unskilled child-care worker's casual award rate is $14 and that a TAFE accredited child-care worker's casual award rate is over $17 an hour; if so, what means exist for community based child care centres to make up the difference in wages for every new child care worker employed under the SNSS. (10) How is the Government monitoring the efficiency of the SNSS.2. (11) Has her office been informed of failures of the scheme; if so, will she reform the SNSS to enable it to better integrate disabled children into mainstream community based child care centres. (12) Will she restore Fairfield City Council's SSP funding to enable the SNSS to function properly in that particular local government area. Mrs Moylan-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) Supplementary Services (SUPS) workers' role in the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme (SNSS) support is to participate in the preparation and reviews of the inclusion support plan for individual children; to support services receiving SNSS grants with training, resources, referral and specialist advice; and to provide information to parents and the wider community on issues related to child care and the Government's inclusion programs. (2) Yes. (3) No. However, SUPS funding has been moved onto a regional basis with allocations based on needs. While 1998 SUPS funding for the Fairfield City Council will reduce by around $36,000 other areas in Western Sydney will increase. (4) No, employment of SUPS workers is the responsibility of sponsoring bodies. Funding of $160,562 has been allocated to Fairfield City Council for 1998. This should enable the support of SNSS and other SUPS functions in the area. (5) The implementation of the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme included national training and communication strategies designed to ensure that SUPS workers, the child care industry, parents of children with high support needs and disability support groups have access to the information that they need to participate effectively in the scheme. This involved extensive media coverage and an advertising campaign in suburban press and women's magazines, industry publications and newsletters. In addition, a 1800-number telephone information line has been set up to provide information for parents and industry. Specific SNSS information sessions for the industry and interested parties were held in all States and Territories. In NSW, this included two day training sessions for SUPS workers across the State and an additional information session at the NSW SUPS conference for those workers unable to attend the training. Tailored information sessions were also presented for SUPS sponsors.· This was followed by information sessions for resource and advisory agencies, peak child care organisations and disability groups. The Department of Health and Family Services will shortly be mailing copies of SNSS information brochures to all child care services including 3,000 in NSW.3. (6) (a) Yes, published in July 1997. (b) (i) July 1997. (ii) By direct mail to services, SUPS workers, resource and advisory agencies and through the information line and on request by Departmental Staterrerritory Offices. (7) Any child care service approved for Childcare Assistance can make application for SNSS assistance in respect of a child in their care. Applications are made to the State and Territory Offices of the Department. (8) 248 applications had been received by 2 September. (9) The subsidy is a contribution to the costs of employing an additional child care worker to boost the staff:child ratio in the service. (10) The Special Needs Subsidy Scheme includes regular review periods for individual children. The Department monitors the Scheme through ongoing reporting by State and Territory Offices and regular liaison with relevant groups. An evaluation is planned for late 1998. (11) The Special Needs Subsidy Scheme fills a gap in service delivery for children with ongoing high support needs that was ignored by the previous Government. It is a new innovative approach based on the collaboration among parents, service providers and support workers. Its development involved extensive consultation with the industry, interested individuals and families. Feedback on the Scheme is welcome and will be taken into account in the planned evaluation of the Scheme. (12) SUPS regional allocation will be subject to on-going review. Future revisions will be on a relative needs basis. Drug Task Force (Question No. 2197) Mrs Crosio asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 3 September 1997: (1) Did he recently announce a departmental Drug Task Force; if so, (a) how many persons have been appointed and (b) what (i) are their names, (ii) positions do they hold and (iii) Commonwealth Department does each person represent. (2) What are the terms of reference of the Task Force and has it been set a definite date for completion of its work; if not, why not. (3) Will public submissions be considered part of the task force's studies; if not, why not. (4) Will he make the task force's findings public upon completion of its report; if not, why not.",164
321,Mr HOWARD,FCPB,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (a) Nine. (b) (i) (ii) (iii): Mr Max Moore-Wilton, Secretary, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Chairman  Foreign Affairs and Trade Mr Andrew Podger, Secretary, Department of Health and Family Services Mr Stephen Skehill, Secretary, Attorney General's Department Mr Norman Reabum, Acting Secretary, AttomeyGeneral's Department (who replaced Mr Skehill upon his resignation from the APS) Mr John Broome, Chairman, National Crime Authority Mr Mick Palmer, Commissioner, Australian Federal Police Mr Lionel Woodward, Chief Executive Officer, Australian Customs Service Vice Admiral CA Barrie, Vice Chief of the Defence Force Mr Len Early, Deputy Secretary, Department of Finance (2) As I said in the Parliament on 25 August 1997, the Task Force has been asked to prepare an urgent report on the national approach to illicit drugs and to recommend an agenda for national action. It will look at current efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs, including domestic law enforcement and border control; current efforts to reduce the demand for such drugs, including community education and community organisation support programs; and harm minimisation approaches for users. The work is being given high priority to enable the Government to formulate a broad strategy to put before the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy at its November meeting. (3) The purpose of this particular Task Force is to enable relevant Commonwealth Government agencies to collate and assess the range of Commonwealth activities relating to illicit drugs. The Task Force will not therefore canvass external views on issues raised for consideration. The Government will consider whether it wishes to seek external views following consideration of the Task Force's Report. (4) Whether a public statement on the Task Force's findings is made is a matter for Cabinet when it considers the Task Force's report. Australian Made Campaigns (Question No. 2211) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 22 September 1997: (1) Did he issue a press release on 24 July 1997 concerning the Australian made campaign, which stated that all current users had been advised in 1996 of the Government's decision to allow them to continue to use the new logo until new arrangements had been announced. (2) Is he able to say whether Mr M. Paterson, Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), in a letter dated 1 September 1997, stated that the Government has advised all licensees that it had extended use of the logo until 30 June 1997; if so, is this correct. (3) When will new administrative arrangements for the campaign be announced. (4) What financial and other resources (a) have been and (b) will be contributed towards the Australian made campaign. (5) What criteria were used by his Department to select the ACel to run the Australian made campaign. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that: (1) A press release was issued by the former Minister for Administrative Services on 24 July 1997. (2) I am not aware of the contents of any letter  aware, however, that in a letter dated 7 July 1997,  extended the use of the licences until June 30 1997. This was not correct-the Government has allowed licensees to continue to use the logo until new arrangements are in place. (3) New arrangements for the logo will be announced when wider country of origin labelling issues are resolved. (4) (a) Since 1986 the Commonwealth has contributed approximately $19 million to fund advertising and promotional campaigns to raise consumer awareness of the logo. (4) (b) It is not known at this stage what level Commonwealth funding, if any, will be allocated to any future promotional campaign for the Australian made logo. (5) No decision has been made on who will administer any new arrangements for the logo. Australian Institute of Criminology (Question No. 2213) Mr Campbell asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 22 September 1997: (1) Who are the members of the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC). (2) Who. appoints the members. (3) Upon what criteria are members appointed. (4) Who funds members of the Institute and to what extent. (5) Does the Institute have a relationship with the UN; if so, what. (6) Does the Institute report directly to the UN or through the Australian Government. (7) Does the Institute sign agreements with the UN; if so, do they take effect as Australian law. (8) What checks and balances are in place to ensure that the Institute is subject to public scrutiny. (9) Has the Institute entered into negotiations with respect to gun ownership in Australia; if so, will he make available the full text of agreements and minutes. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Membership of the Board of Management of the Australian InstitUte of Criminology (AIC) is specified in Section 9(1) of the Criminology Research Act 1971. The Act states that: The Board shall consist of: (a) the Director (b) 3 members appointed by the Attorney General; and (c) 4 members appointed by the Criminology Research Council. As at 22 September 1997 the members were: Dr Adam Graycar, Director of the AIC; Mr John Johnson AO, APM, QPM and Mr Norman Reabum, Acting Secretary, Commonwealth Attorney General's Department (appointed by the Attorney General); Mr John van Groningen, Commissioner, Office of the Correctional Services Commissioner, Department of Justice, Victoria; Dr Ken Levy, Deputy Director-General, Department of Justice,  of tion & Policy, Justice Department, Tasmania; and Mr John Gardner, Commissioner, Northern Territory Correctional Services, Northern. Territory (appointed by the Criminology Research Council (CRC)). (2) See answer to Question (1) above. (3) The legislation does not specify criteria on which members are appointed. (4) Those members appointed by the CRC are funded by their respective State Governments. Those appointed by the Attorney-General are funded by the AIC which receives its funding by appropriation. The extent of funding is for travel to attend meetings (3 meetings per year) and travel allowance in accordance with Commonwealth Guidelines. There is no other funding. (5) The AIC has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the collaborative arrangements betwee:;n the AIC and the:; Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch, (;:entre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs, United Nations (UN). The MOU establishes a regime for sharing statistical information relating to the Australian criminal justice system; providing assistance in the collection of criminal justice data in the region; providing, as far as practicable, facilities for visiting criminal justice experts and administrators; and maintaining collaboration with the UN regional and interregional Institutes for the prevention of crime and treatment of offenders. Any commitment to UN projects is subject to the availability of appropriate resources and Board of Management approval. (6) The AIC is a statutory authority created under a Commonwealth Statute. It reports to the Australian Parliament through the Attorney-General. From time to time, the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division (as it is now called) seeks data from the AlC in its compilation of international crime statistics. The AIC provides this information directly to the Division. (7) On 7 July 1988, the then Director and the then Chairman of the AIC Board of Management signed the MOU (referred to above). The MOU does not take effect as Australian law. It addresses only issues relating to the sharing of criminal justice information. (8) The Annual Report of the AIC is tabled by the Attorney-General in Parliament. It contains a full audit by the Australian National Audit Office. The AIC's budget is subject to scrutiny by the Senate Estimates Committee. (9) No. Maritime Union of Australia (Question No. 2214) Mr Tanner asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 22 September 1997: Further to his answer to a question without notice (Hansard, 3 September 1997, page 7379) concerning claims that farmers' produce has been left rotting on the wharves as a result of industrial action by the Maritime Union of Australia, will he provide specific examples of (a) when, (b) where and (c) which consignments of produce have been affected since 1992.",174
322,Mr HOWARD,FCPB,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government is aware of a number of cases where farmers' produce has either spoiled or rotted as a result of practices and industrial action by the Maritime Union of Australia. The agricultural companies involved are fearful that public attention to difficulties activities of the Maritime Union of Australia will lead to retribution by that trade union. As the Government does not have the permission of these companies to publicly outline such cases, I am unable to provide specific examples. World Expositions: Australia's Participation (Question No. 2231) Mr MCClelland asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: (1) Did he state in a message supporting the nomination of the Gold Coast for the right to hold an Expo in 2002 that Australia has been an enthusiastic contributor to the modem exposition movement, participating in every major exposition since Montreal's Expo 67, and hosting World Expo 1988 with great success. (2) Has he noted the answer by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism to question No. 1367 (Hansard, 26 March 1997, page 3333) in which the Minister stated that Australia has not been represented at world expositions on five occasions since 1967. (3) Has he also noted answers by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism to questions Nos. 618 (Hansard, 18 November 1996, page 7037) and 1366 (Hansard, 26 March, 1997, page 3333) in which the Minister stated that Australia will not participate at the next world exposition at Lisbon, Portugal, in 1998 nor at Hanover, Germany, on econ.omic grounds in the light of fiscal targets. (4) What sum has the Commonwealth saved by not participating in Portugal and Germany. (5) Is he able to say whether (a) 138 countries and international organisations have confirmed their participation in Expo 1998 in Lisbon and (b) German officials have confirmed the attendance of 129 countries and four international organisations at Expo 2000 in Hanover. (6) Will Australia's non participation in Lisbon in 1998 and Hanover in 2000 be detrimental in the eyes of those participating countries at Lisbon· and Hanover to seeking the world exposition On the Gold Coast in 2002; if so, will he review the Government's decision not to participate.",176
323,Mr HOWARD,FCPB,"The answer· to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. In his answer to question No. 1367 (Hansard, 26 March 1997, page 3333), the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism referred to the fact that Australia did not participate in five expositions. I would note that my message in support of Expo 2002 referred to Australia's participation in connected to the major expositions. (3) Yes. (4) A proposal was brought forward in the Budget context and, consistent with long standing practice, I am not prepared to disclose the details of meetings of Cabinet or its Committees. (5) (a) and (b) Yes. (6) I am not able to make a judgement about the views held in other countries. The Government supports the nomination of the Gold Coast for Expo 2002. Consultants: Accreditation (Question No. 2240) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: (1) Did his Department apply an accreditation process to those persons or firms who registered as consultants in regard to the cuts to the operational subsidy for out of school hours services; if so, (2) Have there been instances where a consultant interviewed by, or engaged by, an out of school hours care service has indicated that the $3,000 consultancy fee allocated by the Government was not sufficient. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Services were provided with a list of persons or firms who listed as consultants and were advised that ""the Commonwealth does not make any representations as to the quality or standard of the services provided by the advisers whose details appear in the register"". (2) Yes. The Department is aware that a small number of consultants have claimed the fee allocated was not sufficient for the task. Aged Care Assessment Teams (Question No. 2244) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: (1) Will Federal Aged Care Assessment teams begin to determine categories on 1 October 1997; if so, when will necessary forms be available. (2) Will the appropriate forms be available before January 1998; if not, will (a) there be a for a dual system to operate and (b) financial assistance be provided to cope with the additional administrative burden. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(2) Aged Care Assessment Teams (ACATs) are responsible for conducting a holistic assessment of clients to determine their appropriate care requirements. ACATs also have responsibility for determining whether a potential residential care recipient requires low or high level care. Low level care is broadly equivalent to hostel care and high level care is broadly equivalent to nursing home care. However, ACATs are not responsible for determining Resident Classification Scale (RCS) categories within these two levels of care. Residential aged care providers will determine the category of care required by each resident by using the RCS. The RCS categories range from 8 to 1, with 1 being the highest category. ACATs will approve care recipients at either high level care (RCS 4-1) or low level care (RCS 8-5). There is no need for a dual system to operate. A new ""Application and Approval"" form has been developed for use by ACATs in their role of assessing and approving people as care recipients under the new Aged Care Act 1997. The new form replaces the previous Nursing Home, Hostel and how. Community Aged Care Packages forms and is now the sole care recipient approval form. All Teams were provided with supplies of the new form prior to implementation from 1 October 1997. Essentially the role of ACATs has not changed and additional financial assistance has not been· provided. Elderly People: Protection (Question No. 2260) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: What protection will the Government provide elderly persons who are being cared for by home carers and in need of full-time professional care, and who agree to be placed in high care facilities. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Aged Care Act 1997 and the Principles 1997 provide a wide range of protections for residents of residential aged care facilities, including their individual and legal rights as provided for through the Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities, the permissible charges, their security of tenure, the level and extent of information to which they are entitled and the security of accommodation need bond funds provided for through the prudential arrangements. In addition to these protections, the legislation also provides for a number of user rights initiatives which are intended to empower residents and their relatives, to ensure that they are able to access high quality appropriate care by appropriately trained staff. These initiatives include the requirement to offer a resident agreement, ensure access by advocates and community visitors, and access to both a complaints mechanism provided by the facility and an alternative independent complaints resolution mechanism. Finally, failure to demonstrate a commitment to these user rights initiatives would prevent a facility from achieving accreditation and any failure to fulfil the legislative requirements protecting consumers could lead to sanctions being imposed by the Government. State Nursing Home Bed Legislation (Question No. 2261) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: Are steps being taken to protect low care facilities from prosecution under State nursing home bed legislation; if so, what. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am not aware of any aged care facilities that are subject to prosecution under State nursing home legislation as a consequence of the aged care reforms. Under the new aged care funding arrangements, residents are funded according to their care needs irrespective of their location in a low level care facility (hostel) or high level care facility (nursing home). Providers may choose to provide care across the full range of dependency or, alternatively, to specialise in low or high levels of dependency. Providers who wish to provide a full range of services are required to identify and comply with all relevant State and Territory legislation, regulations, professional standards and guidelines (Quality of Care Principles 1997, Schedule 2). My predecessor, the Hon 1. Moylan MP, wrote to State and Territory Health and Community Services Ministers on 24 September 1997 concerning the implications of State and Territory health and related regulations for Commonwealth funded facilities. Mrs Moylan sought agreement to a protocol for the regulation of hostels, to operate for a two year period, to enable a review of existing Commonwealth and State health regulations applying to aged care hostels. The proposed protocol reflects an approach agreed by Commonwealth and State officials to clarify similar issues in relation to building requireOne ments under the Building Code of Australia. The approach allows for variation in the use of buildings, with a low level care (hostel) building only needing to be licensed as a high level care (nursing home) facility where more than 10% of the floor area is occupied by high care residents for whom nursing care is provided. The Australian Building Codes Board, in conjunction with State building authorities, has also commenced a review of the classification of residential aged care buildings. The objective is to ensure that the Code licensing requirements. can accommodate the development of integrated aged care facilities. I am confident that the States and Territories will, as they have done to date on other aspects of the :'reforms, cooperate in arriving at a sensible approach that will give certainty to providers and maximise the potential of the aged care reforms to achieve improvements without compromising the quality of care. Governments, consumers and providers have a shared interest in minimising duplication, in maximising efficiencies and preventing unnecessary costs and barriers to flexibility and choice. Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation: Building Acquisition (Question No. 2265) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: (1) Has the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) acquired a new building in North Sydney for approximately $lOm. (21 If so, have the leases of existing tenants in the building been terminated. (3) Does the AMLC still occupy expensive rental accommodation in the Sydney central business district; if so, why. (4) Was growers' money involved in the acquisition of the North Sydney building; if so, what sum. (5) In whose name is the title for the building held. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The AMLC purchased a building at 165 Walker Street, North Sydney for $10.5 million in August 1994 as a long term option to manage its head office accommodation needs. (2) No leases have been terminated. As leases have expired in the lower half of the building,. the floorspace has been set aside for AMLC occupancy. The remaining part of the building is tenanted. exception to the above was a long term tenant who asked to be released from their lease as part of a parent company consolidation, and paid out their lease in a lump sum. . (3) The AMLC currently occupies rental accommodation at 227 Elizabeth Street, Sydney. The rental paid is consistent with the locality in which the building is situated. The AMLC will relocate to North Sydney in mid December 1997 as its current lease expires on 31 December 1997. (4) The Corporation purchased the building for $10.5 million from its cash reserves. These reserves have been accumulated from levies received from livestock producers, livestock exporters, meat processors, meat exporters, and returns from investments. (5) The title for the building is held in the iame of the Australian Meat an- Live-stock Corporation. New History (Question No. 2272) Mr Barry Jones asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the controversy in Japan in which advocates of New History have deplored the black arm band view of history which draws attention to events which many Japanese would prefer to ignore. (2) Has his attention also been drawn to the proposed formal repentance by Catholic bishops in France who express regret for collaboration with the German occupation and implicit anti-Semitism. (3) If so, are there relevant lessons for Australia to be drawn from the actions referred to in parts (1) and (2).",176
324,Mr HOWARD,FCPB,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) I see no relevance. I reject any suggestion of equivalence between Australia's honourable record and the events the honourable member is referring to in the previous parts of his question. Superannuation: Public Sector (Question No. 2274) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 25 September 1997: (1) Have changes been announced to public service superannuation schemes; if so, will the Government be taking steps to compensate employees resident in the electoral division of Greenway who are affected. (2) Will the Government be providing advice to public service employees resident in the electoral division of Greenway to enable them to make financial decisions about their superannuation options; if so, what. (3) Will the Government give a core undertaking to public service employees resident in the electoral division of Greenway that they will not be disadvantaged by the Government's decision. (4) Will the Government be offering alternatives to superannuation to prospective public service employees to ensure that it is competitive when hiring staff; if so, what. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On 23 September 1997 I announced changes to superannuation arrangements which will allow greater choice and flexibility for Commonwealth public servants. These changes mean that: from 1 July 1998 new Commonwealth employees can choose the available complying superannuation fund or Retirement Savings Account (RSA) to which their employer superannuation is paid. This will not include the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS) which will be closed to new members from that date; and from 1 July 2000 all Commonwealth Superanc nuation Scheme (CSS) and PSS members will have the choice of remaining in their existing scheme or choosing to have their employer superannuation paid to another available complying superannuation fund or RSA. Agencies will continue to be funded at the existing cost levels of the current schemes and so the remuneration packages available to current or future employees would not be affected by these changes. Therefore there is no reason or need to compensate any public service employees. (2) Yes. The Government will ensure that Commonwealth employers provide advice to its public service employees on the superannuation choices available to them and the features of the schemes available. (3) See the answer to question l. (4) Like all other employers the Government will be required to provide prospective employees (and continuing employees who choose to leave the CSS or PSS) with alternative superannuation arrangements. The mix of salary and superannuation available to these employees will be a matter for negotiation between employees and employers. However, to comply with Superannuation Guarantee (SG) requirements employer superannuation contributions cannot be less than the prescribed SG rates (7% from 1998/99 rising to 9% from 2002/03). Superannuation: Public Sector (Question No. 2314) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 1 October 1997: (1) Did he guarantee prior to the 1996 election that his Government would not cut and destroy public sector superannuation schemes. (2) Is the Commonwealth Public Service Superannuation Scheme to be abolished from 1 July 1998; if so, how does this reconcile with his election guarantee.",179
325,Mr HOWARD,FCPB,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The arrangements announced by the Minister for Finance on 23 September are consistent with my pre-election guarantee. The government will close the existing Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS) to new members from 1 July 1998. However, remuneration packages available to new and existing employees will not be adversely affected. New employees will be able to choose the fund to which their employer contributions are paid, other than the PSS or the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS). preFrom 1 July 2000 members of the PSS and the CSS will be able to choose to have contributions paid to another fund if they request it. Funding provided to Commonwealth employers will be maintained at the existing cost levels of the current schemes.",180
