1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA COMMISSION SALE BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Sharp, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
2,Mr SHARP,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Australian National's operations, in common with many other government owned railways, are characterised by a large and increasing debt and a declining market share. The performance of rail stands in stark contrast to the road transport sector, which has been very successful in addressing customer needs and therefore increasing its market share. To a large extent this situation reflects the fundamental problems arising from government owning and operating businesses that are more efficiently conducted by the private sector. In particular, government rail authorities have in many cases over the years largely operated as monopolies, have often been subject to political interference and have not been placed on a fully commercial footing. Under these circumstances, pricing, operating and investment practices tend to be unresponsive and inflexible. If real reform is to be achieved in the rail sector, it is vitally ant that the inherent deficiencies associated with government ownership be replaced by a dynamic market driven approach. The problems confronting AN, however, have been substantially magnified by the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. In particular, AN has been left with very large debts while the large bulk of its profitable operations have been transferred to NR. Furthermore, AN has been required to provide NR with significant services at well below cost. The government became aware of the extent of AN's problems shortly after taking office. I commissioned the independent Brew review, which revealed a situation requiring urgent remedy. Increasing debt, a loss of business and escalating taxpayer subsidies were aspects of AN which the former government both ignored and failed to address. I want to make it clear that the financial mess at AN was not the result of AN staff or management, but the result of decisions made by the former government which left AN in an impossible position. As a result, I announced on 24 November last year a $2 biIIion reform package to rejuvenate the rail sector. The reforms will impact through the separation of the management of the interstate rail track network from above track operations. The major benefit of structural separation lies in replacing the incentives for anticompetitive and uncommercial behaviour with an incentive to maximise the number of operators on the network. The Commonwealth's role will concentrate on controlling and managing economically efficient and nondiscriminatory access to the interstate rail network. This will allow the interstate rail network to operate largely as the roads do now: government owned, but open, upon payment of an access fee, to anyone licensed to operate a vehicle over the network. Such a change can only be of benefit to the users of rail transport and indeed to the economy as a whole. This bill is the first legislative step in achieving this important component of microimporteconomic reform. The injection of private sector expertise into rail operations will reduce costs, improve service responsiveness and increase rail market share. The proposed bill The Australian National Railways Commission Sale BiII 1997 gives effect to the government's decision to sell the non-interstate mainline track rail assets of Australian National in whole or in part. It provides a flexible framework to facilitate: authority and mechanisms for the sale, including authority to repeal, replace or amend rail agreements with South Australia and Tasmania following their agreement to sale arrangements; and reduction of AN to an entity charged with dealing with any residual functions and the balance of assets and liabilities not included above, or not able to be disposed of in the short term, and resolving outstanding litigation and disputes prior to abolition. A viable rail industry AN has been offered for sale as a single unit or by component parts such as interstate passenger operations, vertically integrated rail freight operations in South Australia and Tasmania or railway workshops. AN's rail operations have been restricted in their operation by corporate overheads and the burden of debt. Recognising that this arrangement is not sustainable, the government has decided to offer AN for sale free of debts and liabilities. It is proposed that companies be established under the Corporation Law to be the vehicles through which the sales occur. The assets of AN necessary for the operation of each component of the AN business will be transferred into a company by ministerial direction listing the assets, or classes of assets. The shares in the company will be sold to a new rail operator. The liabilities of AN would be retained and paid out by AN or transferred to the Commonwealth. Thus, the bill proposes flexible arrangements for the transfer of assets, liabilities contracts between AN, the Commonwealth and a new rail operator. To provide maximum flexibility to a purchaser, it is not proposed that any staff transfer to private sector purchasers. Instead, it is proposed that staff be made redundant on sale or closure of the part of AN in which they work. There will be no requirements or arrangements in the sales process for the transfer or re-employment of employees and general industrial relations legislation will determine award provisions. The new operator will not be burdened by existing liabilities or inappropriate staffing structures and can develop arrangements consistent with a viable transport company. Incentives to improve infrastructure The states have interests in a large proportion of AN owned land under the 1975 agreements, which transferred railway assets to the Commonwealth. It is proposed that the land revert to the states for them to lease to a new rail operator. It is important that the sale arrangement create an incentive for an injection of funds to improve and maintain the rail infrastructure. Ownership of infrastructure is considered a key part of providing this incentive. To achieve an infrastructure ownership arrangement under land lease, the bill proposes that railway land fixtures such as track, signalling equipment, culverts, buildings, et cetera be severed from the land by the sales legislation for sale to the new operator with above track assets. Agreements with the States The Commonwealth has legislated a range of agreements with the states over the years. Some of these need to be amended or repealed to allow the sale to proceed. The government is negotiating with South Australia and Tasmania on these issues and is confident of reaching agreement. The shares in each new company established to operate a business previously within AN will become part of a sales agreement between the Commonwealth and a private sector purchaser. The bill proposes that the Minister for Finance be authorised to sign an and agreement with the purchasers of these new companies. It is envisaged that these sales agreements will be a key mechanism by which Commonwealth commitments under the agreements with the states will be honoured. Sales negotiations with prospective purchasers cannot be finalised until the parliament agrees to the sale and new agreements have been reached with South Australia and Tasmania. The bill thus proposes that: I be empowered to enter into new agreements with the states; those agreements be given legislative force through regulation able to be disallowed by either house of parliament; the various acts authorising current agreements with the states be repealed on the day on which new agreements take effect; and any agreement executed in this way be approved and its performance and observance by the Commonwealth be authorised. AN financial obligations The bill proposes a range of provisions which are intended to both protect the Commonwealth from default by AN as a result of the loss of assets and revenue generating capacity and guarantee the debts of AN in order to protect companies which have contracted or loaned funds to AN in good faith. These proposed provisions include the expansion of Commonwealth guarantee powers and provisions to enable the Commonwealth to discharge AN obligations from funds appropriated for this purpose. Amendments to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 AN is established and operated under the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983. The bill proposes a range of amendments to the act to enable the commission to assist the Commonwealth in implementing its rail reform objectives in relation to the commission. It also provides a power of direction which enables the Minister for Finance to direct AN in the disposal of its assets and liabilities. Through the sale process, AN will shed all its rail operations other than the ownership and management of interstate track. The bill proposes transitional arrangements, including allowing flexibility to reduce the structure and size of the commission as the business contracts and providing the means to transfer residual assets, liabilities and contracts to Commonwealth and to abolish the commission when it has wound down sufficiently. The bill also proposes the amendment of a range of existing legislation to facilitate the sale and in consequence of the abolition of AN. Conclusion The future of rail in Australia lies with using our current system much more efficiently and effectively, through encouraging the participation of the private sector, introducing competition and providing a greater customer focus. It is possible for the rail industry to operate profitably, and this will require substantial programs of cost reduction and capital investment by the private sector, accompanied by improvements in service quality. It is these initiatives that will give us a viable long-term rail industry in Australia. The legislation underpins the government's rail reform package and is essential to its implementation. The reform package has a number of elements but, in particular, seeks to revitalise rail transport by separating the provision of access to essential infrastructure-the interstate track-from the provision of rail transport services, which is more appropriately the role of the private sector. Passage of the legislation is crucial to the attainment of the government's timetable for the sale as it will enable the government to sell AN assets and services, clearly signalling the government's commitment to reform. It will also directly increase participation of the private sector in the rail industry. AN is losing money and is in an unsustainable and declining financial position which is unlikely to be improved in the current environment of uncertainty. The extensive restructure required to generate an efficient and profitable rail system is best able to be achieved through government divestment and the injection of private sector transport expertise. This is also the best long-term guarantee of employment in the rail industry. Prompt passage of the bill will mean that elements of AN can rapidly be divested and will thereby reduce uncertainty for AN, its staff, other participants in the rail industry and the community. Delays in sale will unnecesthe sarily increase taxpayer liabilities and adversely effect the government's budget strategy. I commend the bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum of the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA (INTERCEPTION) AND LISTENING DEVICE AMENDMENTS BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
3,Mr WILLIAMS,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill has two primary purposes. The first is to introduce new arrangements by which agencies are able to obtain warrants authorising the interception of telecommunications for the investigation of serious criminal offences. The bill's second principal object is to strengthen arrangements for dealing with police corruption. The interception of telecommunications by law enforcement agencies and subsequent dealing with intercepted information are regulated by the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. That act provides a detailed scheme of control, designed to protect the privacy and confidentiality of communications passing over the Australian telecommunications system. A general rule of our society is that a communication of this kind is private to the participants. Intrusion into communication, even by the government's law enforcement agencies, is subject to strict control. Interceptions can only be carried out by declared Commonwealth and state law enforcement agencies and only under the authority of a warrant. At present, interception warrants may be issued by an eligible judge of a court created by this parliament. An eligible judge is one who has been nominated by the responsible minister, after having consented to perform the function. The statutory requirement for individual consent underlines that issuing a warrant is an administrative power conferred on a judge as a designated person. The bill proposes to provide for categories of persons, in addition to judges, who may be authorised to issue warrants. These amendments are necessary because the eligible judges of the Federal Court have decided that they should no longer perform this function. I understand the judges have expressed a quite proper concern that the workload involved should not interfere with the performance of their judicial duties. In addition, there is a more fundamental issue involved. The High Court has recently indicated that the use of judges as designated officials to perform certain administrative functions may be incompatible with the judicial function, as it can undermine public confidence in the independence and integrity of the judiciary. The High Court has also specifically advised some judges against agreeing to issue interception warrants, because of the risk that the judge may subsequently be involved in a related proceeding. The amendments will confer the authority to issue interception warrants on certain members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal who are nominated for this purpose by the responsible minister. The potential pool of nominees would be the deputy presidents and full-time senior members, as well as those part-time senior members and members-all of whom are part-time-who have legal qualifications. This new arrangement takes into account the special character of the authority to issue an interception warrant. The purpose of the issuing process is to provide an a opportunity, before the event, for the conflicting interests of the state and an individual to be assessed, so that the individual's right to privacy will be affected only where the appropriate statutory standard has been met and the needs of law enforcement are demonstrably superior. For such a process to be meaningful, the person making the assessment must be capable of doing so in a neutral and impartial manner. The government believes that the specified members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal have both the independence and experience necessary for this role. However, an individual will only be given the authority to issue warrants after he or she is nominated by the minister. There will be an opportunity, before an eligible person is nominated, for consultation with the president of the tribunal concerning their experience and background. The government believes that the new arrangement set out in the bill will maintain the integrity of the warrant issuing arrangements. I should also point out that the amendments do not in any way alter the provisions which permit judges to issue warrants should their views change at some time in the future. The bill introduces similar new arrangements for issuing listening device warrants to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies, under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Customs Act 1901. These warrants are also issued at present by federal judges. I now tum to the provisions in the bill that are directed against the serious problem of police corruption. Most significantly, the bill contains a number of provisions relating to the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission. The commission has recently been established as a permanent authority to continue the work of the Wood Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service. Members will be aware that the Wood Royal Commission uncovered disturbing instances of corruption and other serious police misconduct. The Commonwealth supports the government of New South Wales in its efforts to excise the cancer of corruption from within its police service and is ready assist in providing the new commission with appropriate and effective powers. Experience has shown that covert surveilAFP. lance is one of the most powerful investigadecision tive tools for uncovering and prosecuting police misconduct. The bill will amend the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 to permit the Commission to receive and intercepted information originally obtained by other law enforcement agencies, where the information relates to a matter the commission may investigate. The amendments also the way for a declaration to be made which will permit the commission to apply for warrants on its own behalf, once the services. Attorney-General, as the responsible minister, is satisfied that the statutory preconditions of a declaration have been fulfilled. These amendments do not involve any effective widening of interception powers. The responsibilities of the Police Integrity Commission for investigating police misconduct have generally been transferred to it from the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the New South Wales Police Service. Both these latter agencies are already able to apply for interception warrants for this purpose. The bill further supports the Police Integrity Commission in other ways. Amendments to the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 will give the commission, as well as the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, access to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre's database of reportable transactions. In addition, amendments to the Customs Act will permit the Australian Police and the National Crime Authority to communicate information those agencies obtain by means of a listening device directly to the commission, where the information relates to the commission's functions. Without this amendment, the Commonwealth agencies would only be able to pass listening device information about police corruption to the commission via the New South Wales Police Service. Several of the amendments deal with more general aspects of police misconduct. The bill will permit the Commissioner of the Australto Ian Federal Police to use intercepted information in deciding whether to appoint, re-appoint or dismiss a member or staff member of the This amendment is a response to a in the Federal Court to the effect that the Commissioner was not permitted to rely on intercepted information relating to corruption by an AFP officer in a decision not to reuse appoint that officer. The government considers that position to be inconsistent with the Commissioner's responsibilities to keep the AFP free of corruption and the power given open to the Commissioner over appointments within the AFP. The bill also contains an equivalent provision in relation to other police I now tum to other amendments. The bill will permit intercepted information to be given in evidence in three categories of proceedings that relate to the commission of prescribed offences. One category provides for an application for bail that relates to a prosecution for a prescribed offence. This amendment is a response to a decision by the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in the case of Director of Public Prosecutions v Serratore which held that a bail application is not part of a related prosecution. The bill will also permit intercepted information to be given in evidence in applications for restraining orders made under Commonwealth and state proceeds of crime legislation. The effectiveness of this legislation, particularly in relation to drug offences, depends on the ability of prosecuting authorities to obtain orders preventing assets from being dealt with pending the outcome of related criminal proceedings. This amendment is to clarify the legislative position following the Serratore decision. The third category of proceedings is a coroner's inquest, if the coroner considers the subject of the inquiry-for example, a suspicious death-may have been caused by the commission of a prescribed offence. The purpose is to avoid a situation where a coroner is prevented from receiving evidence that may be vital to the coroner's determination. Finally, the bill contains a number of other amendments related to the use of intercepted information and record keeping obligations. The amendments have no significant financial impact. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA (ELECTION) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 May, on motion by Mr Howard: That the bill be now read a second time.",16
4,Mr MCMULLAN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Canberra) (9.54 a.m.)In this debate on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill I rise essentially to support the remarks made by my colleagues, in particular my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham), who led for the opposition on this matter. It is appropriate that this bill introduced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) because the bill has features which characterise our current incumbent, Mr Howard, as Prime Minister. It is a bill that shows absolutely no leadership. It is a bill that shows absolutely no vision. It is a bill that is consistent with the increasing tendency of the Prime Minister to sully everything he touches. Here he is trying to rort the ballot for this constitutional convention. My colleague the member for Banks went into great detail about the flaws in the electoral arrangements in this legislation, and I will seek to do so in the time available. But what I really want to comment on first is why are we finding these incredibly convoluted arrangements which have, for the first time, the people of Australia confronting a bizarre, unorthodox set of voting arrangements. Essentially it is because the government is trying to hide its real intention from the people and trying to hide from the real intentions of the people. It does not want to face up to the fact that the opinion of the Australian people has changed and that the majority of Australians want a change in our constitutional arrangements. The Prime Minister knows that he cannot present a unified position on the fundamental question of the nature of our constitutional arrangements on behalf of the coalition parties. So he has to hide, obfuscate and confuse and seek to debase the fundamental debate about the nature of our constitutional arrangements when in fact the issues can be stated very simply. In the United States you have to be a citizen of that country, you have to have been born in that country, to be eligible to be head of state. In Australia you are debarred from being the head of state if you were born in Australia. That is the stark position that Australians no longer accept. We do not actually need a constitutional convention to deal with the consequences of that conclusion that Australians have come to in clear majority. We should just give them a vote, a proper, decent, Australian ballot. Our great democratic contribution to the world is the Australian ballot. Let us use it to say to the Australian people in a plebiscite: confirm what the was opinion polls say, that you believe an Australian should be eligible to be the head of state of his or her own country. Do not hide. Let us have the debate. Come out from wherever you are hiding, Prime Minister, and say what you think. Let us all express our various views, let the people decide and then we will have a constitutional referendum to determine and formalise the process and make the proper constitutional decisions. But no, what we have is this thoroughly unsatisfactory, thoroughly unreasonable bill setting up this unnecessary convention in this improper way. It would not be so bad if the implications for some of our long standing and proud democratic traditions were not quite so serious. There is nowhere to hide from the determination of the Australian people to achieve a republican constitution-and they will achieve it. As someone who has spent a long time associated with our electoral system and with our democratic processes, I am particularly worried about some of the implications of the changes that are in the legislation. Let me start first with the issue of voluntary voting. The idea has been put around by influential people in the Liberal Party for some time, particularly by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin. To his credit, Senator Minchin has at least been open about it. He has advocated his position in public. I do not agree with his position but I respect the fact that he has come out openly and has said, 'This is what I believe and this is why.' That has facilitated a decent debate. I know it has facilitated a decent debate within the coalition parties and between the parties in the parliament. I strongly disagree with Senator Minchin's position, but he has been up-front about it, unlike the Prime Minister, who has introduced a bill for voluntary voting but has never once actually said he agrees with it. He has never once said, 'I think voluntary voting is a good idea,' but he has come in here and introduced a bill to start us down this slippery slope. I worry that it is the first step on the path to taking the concerns of the disadvantaged off the agenda, to removing from the democratic agenda of Australia the concerns of those Australians least likely to vote. Everybody knows-the evidence is overwhelming-that, when you take away compulsory voting, those least inclined to vote are those who need the assistance of government most. Those to whom the attention of government should most be directed, the most disadvantaged, are those least likely to vote and, therefore, from whom the political focus will shift towards those most advantaged in our society who are most likely to vote becaus'they have interests they wish to protect. To be debasing that great Australian tradition of the compulsory secret ballot on this occasion is something of profound implications. We then move to the idea of having a voluntary postal ballot. If we put those two things together, what are we saying? We are saying that the vote about whether Australia should be a republic is less important than the vote about what our national song should be. In 1977, we had a ballot in Australia about our national song. I voted in that ballot. I have to say I did not regard it as one of the great exercises of my democratic prerogative. Mr Kelvin Thomson-That's just because you can't sing.",18
5,Mr MCMULLAN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I certainly cannot sing. I actually know the words of Advance Australia Fair. I have this secret pact with my electors: if they continue to support me, I promise not to sing it out loud because I am totally out of tune. So far the deal is working. Unlike some, I am keeping that election promise. More than eight million Australians turned up to the polling booths around the country and voted in 1977 about what the national song should be, but I do not think any of them would have thought that it was a vote of profundity equal to what should be the fundamental nature of our constitutional arrangements in this country . Yet then that conservative government was prepared, quite correctly, to use the normal voting arrangements for Australians and we all trooped down to the ballot box and voted. This government gives less weight to the ballot for this convention than to that ballot. If they do not take the convention seriously, there is a simple solution: do not have it. The better solution is we do not have the convention at all. But, if we are going to have it, take it seriously, elect it democratically, do not set out as a matter of conscious public policy to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Australians. Everybody knows that this will disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Australians. There is a debate about how many, but not a debate about the fact that there must be hundreds of thousands. At anyone time, there are 200,000 Australians overseas. None of them will get an effective chance to vote in this ballot. The biggest polling booth in any Australian election is in London. More people vote in London than in any polling booth in Australia, and the second biggest is in Hong Kong. The ballot paper will not be posted to them overseas; it will be posted to their home address, their registered electoral address. The prospect that they will get it forwarded to where they might be away on holidays, get it in time, get it back and have their vote recorded is very remote. So there are a few hundred thousand Australians. But what about our electoral laws that cover ordinary elections and that applied in the ballot for the national song so that for those many thousands of Australians who need assistance to vote have a right to come along to the polling booth and receive assistance from the Electoral Commission-the visually impaired, others who need assistance? There is no Electoral Commission assistance for them here. It is true they can probably invite a neighbour in, probably get their son or daughter. What happened to the secret ballot? 'I'm not sure what this means. I'd better get Tom down the street to come and vote for me.' Not only now have we lost our compulsory vote, not only have we lost the capacity to turn up down at the local polling booth and have a secret ballot, the Australian ballot, but now we have even lost the secret ballot for all those who normally need some assistance because of the nature of their English language skills, their visual impairment or other infirmity. This is a conscious, deliberate attempt to disenfranchise those people not because I think they are worried that all those people are republicans, although I suspect the majority of them are too, but because they really do not want people to take the outcome of this too seriously. They do not want a majority vote in the republican direction to have too much weight. If everybody voted in the normal way and the majority of them voted for a republic, it would have awesome weight and we do not wish to have that democratic imperative inserted into this debate. But the outcome of this ballot does matter. If you are worried about the cost and think this is too expensive a way to do it, I come back to my previous solution. There is an easy way to save the money. Do not have the ballot; do not have the convention; go straight to a plebiscite-that is, if you think democracy is not worth the money. But if you are going to have this convention, if you are going to have this ballot, do it properly. We know that the anti-republican people consider the numbers important. We had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) saying, with the capacity of the government to make a lot of appointments, with the way the government's proposals rort the appointment proposal for members of parliament so it is overwhelmingly in favour of the conservative parties for the first time ever in a convention like this, that it is not even, it is gerrymandered, it is stacked in favour of the conservative parties. The bad news is that a few of those people are republicans, too. Nevertheless, this is the first time anybody ever tried to stack a constitutional convention. But even after that the parliamentary secretary says that the vote might only be about 88-64 in favour of a republic and hardly an overwhelming mandate for change. These conservatives are very strange people. They say that, on those figures, 57 per cent is not much of a vote for change. The corollary is that 43 per cent is a great vote for the status quo. That is the thinking that has dominated the manipulation of electoral laws by conservatives for centuries. I come from Western Australia. They have rigged the electoral laws in that state since we have had voting. For 106 years, the conservatives controlled the upper house of that state. They have lost election after election in the lower house, even though those ballots have been rigged too-but in 106 years they had never lost an upper house election, until last year, and they were shocked. They said, 'For 106 years we have controlled the upper house. It belongs to us. The people made a mistake.' So what do they do? For the first time in 106 years they take advantage of the fixed term nature of the upper house to rip through the most unfair industrial relations laws in this country ever so they can get them through before 22 May, before the vote of the people would prevent it being passed. One hundred and six years of domination is not enough. They have to rort the constitutional arrangements against the workers one last time. So a 43 per cent vote for the status quo is pretty good. A 57 per cent vote for change would not be much of a mandate. This is fundamental testimony to the unfairness of the arrangements we are confronting. Why have such peculiar arrangements? Why, once we go through all these machinations, can't we at least have ordinary Senate voting arrangements, not this complex set of arrangements? Everything is being done to make it harder, not easier, for people to express their views. The principle is not complicated. If you are going to have an election, the outcome of the election should reflect the intention of those eligible to vote. It should be a collective expression of the intent of those 10 million Australians eligible to vote. That is what it should be, and it will not be. It has been deliberately designed to make sure that that does not happen. The most basic democratic principle is that the outcome of the election should represent the intention of the voter. They are trying to make it hard for them to vote, make it hard for them to get there to express their vote and easy for it to be rorted and they have stacked the convention and then changed the voting rules so it is complicated. The principle is not the one I articulated-that the outcome of a ballot should be the collective intention of the Australian voters. The principle is: how can we hide from the people's will; how can we avoid the political damage inside the coalition of a debate about the republic? The message in this debate to the Prime Minister, who introduced this bill, is simple: show some leadership, not just in this matter but on jobs and on the fundamental moral debates going on in our society about race. On this matter, have the courage to outline what you believe, put it before the people and let them choose. Do not be too frightened. Do not be there hiding away because you cannot decide, because you will not lead. The future of Australia does not lie in that direction. The proper determination of our constitutional arrangements for the 21 st century will not be decided that way. This convention is not necessary. It is not even a good idea. But if we must have it, let us be honest about it. Let us be honest about how it is established. Let us be honest about how it operates, about what it discusses and how it will be dealt with. This is a bill that needs very substantial amendment. I welcome the fact that the opposition, through the member for Banks, and us, through our shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus, have outlined that comprehensive range of amendments. If those amendments are to be passed, we might be able to get a process worthy of the high ideals that Australians seek to have reflected in the debate about their constitution. But this bill as it stands debases those high ideals.",19
6,Mr MCDOUGALL,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Once again we have heard here today from the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) the same that we heard from the two previous speakers, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) and the member for Banks (Mr Melham)-doom and gloom, doom and gloom, knock, knock, knock, 'This is such a terrible bill.' But if the Labor Party had had their way during their term in government, I am sure they would have just rammed through what the previous Prime Minister wanted. Mr MCMullan-It would have given Australians a vote-shocking!",21
7,Mr MCDOUGALL,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I will answer the interjection from the member for Canberra through you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is a democratic right to vote. The member for Banks very positively put that point. I also put the point that it is a democratic right not to vote if you choose not to. This bill will give the people of Australia the right to make that choice. The member for Canberra said a moment ago that one of my colleagues had the fortitude to stand up and say it; I have the fortitude to stand up and say it as well. Mr MCMullan-Why doesn't the Prime Minister?",21
8,Mr MCDOUGALL,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I am sure the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) can speak for himself; he does not need me to speak for him. I certainly uphold the point that the people of Australia will be given that democratic right to vote. They will also be given the democratic right not to vote if they choose not to vote through the postal ballot system for this constitutional convention and for the members to be elected by the people of Australia to that convention. The amendments that the member for Banks said during his second reading speech he will be introducing are basically saying that they do not want the people to have their say. The most important thing in this question is that this parliament is not the decision maker on whether we should have a change in the constitution. The people who have the right are the people of Australia, and they will have that right as they will have the right to make the decision on who should represent them at the convention to discuss the matter and make the decision. We heard also from the member for Prospect and the member for Canberra about the call for a plebiscite. We have heard that one before. We heard that from the previous Prime Minister for 12 months to two years. But the Labor Party always refuse to acknowledge-as the member for Canberra did today-when they discuss the right for people to make the decision through a plebiscite to nominate whether we should have an Australian head of state, how that person should be elected or appointed. Maybe they are in a dilemma; maybe they do not have an answer to that. I put it to this House that we are having this constitutional convention so that people from all walks of life in Australia-half of them nominated by the Australian parliament and half of them elected by the Australian people-shall discuss the best way to put that question to the Australian people. We do not believe that it is the position of this parliament or this government to make that decision. It is the position of the convention to put that point of view forward. We heard from the member for Prospect and from the member for Canberra again that we have never had an Australian as a head of state, albeit that the Governor General is the head of state on behalf of the Queen. But in the 1930s we had Sir Isaac Isaacs, who was an Australian. There was a bit of a quiet lull until the early 1960s. Then we had Viscount De L' Isle from 1961 to 1965. I believe he was Australian born. From 1965 on we have governors-general of Australia who have all been Australian born. Did we need to have that written into law or written in the constitution to ensure that? No, we had coalition governments and we had Labor governments during that period of time from 1965. We had several from both sides, but both governments upheld the convention that they believed was right and from that day we have had an Australian born head of state. So I think it is a bit hypocritical for the Labor Party to infer for some reason that we do not have an Australian born head of state in this country. Mr MCMullan-It's just true.",22
9,Mr MCDOUGALL,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Okay, so our current Governor General is not Australian born? Mr MCMullan-No, he's not the head of state, you fool. Read the constitution.",22
10,Mr MCDOUGALL,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,I have read the constitution. Mr MCMullan-You don't understand it.,22
11,Mr MCDOUGALL,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,I am not going to debate that across the chamber with you here now. Mr MCMullan-1 bet you can't.,22
12,Mr MCDOUGALL,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I bet I can. Let me now refer to a few of the points that I want to make with regard to the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill. In addressing this bill, I believe that it is important to point out that a constitution is only as good as the government in power. There is no doubt that the citizens of some countries have suffered loss of freedom and abuse, despite a fine sounding constitution. There are constitutions which have been constructed to allow the government in power to continue to make changes without having to go back to the people, something I certainly do not agree with. Other countries have made changes to confirm and strengthen their constitutions. Indonesia, Malaysia and South Africa are just three countries which have made changes to their constitutions in recent years. In the late 1800s Australians put a great deal of thought into our current constitution. In the lead-up to Federation there was much debate and discussion in the colonies. In fact, it is considered by some historians that the people of Australia were more involved in creating our constitution than the people of any other democracy. As a result, our constitution has held firm for just under 100 years. Personally, I belong to a group of people who believe that, if it isn't broken, don't fix it. But quite obviously many of my constituents are considering the need for a change. It is my job and that of my fellow members in this House to ensure all our constituents are kept fully informed to ensure they understand the nature of any proposed changes and the results of these changes for their lives. It is also our duty to ensure that all opinions are heard, not just those of some individuals. I was dismayed at the manner in which the Keating government launched its campaign for an Australian republic led by an Australian president. The previous government beat the republican horse around the track in this country until it looked as though the RSPCA would have to be called in. There was evidence to suggest the issue was whipped up by the previous government purely for political expediency. I am still far from convinced it was an issue high on the public's list of political priorities. This was totally borne out when the then Prime Minister dropped the issue. Suddenly it was no longer a major media story, and the voices which had been so strident in the public arena suddenly went silent. But I believe enough debate was engendered to indicate there was public interest in the subject-enough for this government to acknowledge the need to address the matter. But this government has not whipped this matter up into an urgent priority; rather, it is to be considered at a respectable pace. We are creating a constitutional convention to address the question of whether or not Australia should be a republic. In a calm and rational manner we are attempting to do that. It is important everyone in Australia has their say. But first it has to be decided whether or not our present constitution should be changed. I would just like to come back to something the member for Canberra mentioned in regard to people being disenfranchised, and he particularly talked about people overseas. A few hundred thousand, I think he said, might have some postal problems and might not be able to receive and send back their ballot papers in time. When I spent some time overseas, I put in place arrangements for my mail to be adequately dealt with. I am sure that the people who are overseas have also done the same to look after their interests in this country. Mr MCMullan-Not living there; travelling there. You don't understand.",22
13,Mr MCDOUGALL,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,Might I add for the benefit of the member for Canberra that he should know only too well from his past history that a person who is overseas is entitled to vote in Australia for only three years until or unless they extend their right to vote. The member for Canberra might like to check how many of those few hundred thousand have extended their right to vote. Possibly not too many. Mr MCMullan-Most of them are just travelling for a few weeks; that's the problem.,23
14,Mr MCDOUGALL,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"The member for Canberra speaks so highly of the numbers that would be in the UK and in Hong Kong, and I would add to that New Guinea. I would agree with him on that note-they are not weekly travellers. It is important, as I said, that everyone in Australia has their say. This will require public debate. The public will be represented by 152 delegates. Half of those will be elected by the people and half appointed by the government. My state of Queensland will be entitled to 13 public delegates. I believe there are community representatives in my electorate of Griffith who would be most appropriate to take part in this important national debate. This is a time we need representatives from all comers of the community-young and old, male and female and of the many diverse ethnic groups which make up this wonderful nation. Just as our constitution was widely discussed and debated at the tum of the century, so it will be thoroughly debated again. The Prime Minister has put in place a program of education and information. This includes the immediate implementation of a comprehensive and effective nationwide program to ensure as many Australians as possible understand our democratic process. Both federal and state governments will work to ensure all school students have an understanding of the constitution. It is intended this program will include active participation by way of debates around constitutional reform, taking into account the linguistic and cultural diversity within Australia. The convention also includes a program of public involvement and cooperation with the members of parliament. This constitutional convention will come at considerable expense and therefore must be conducted properly to ensure a fair outcome. The Keating government's campaign was not one of education and information but a political brief to divert attention from the alarming state of our economy at the timeand, might I say, I believe that was adequately addressed last evening. Therefore, it is with confidence I support this bill, which creates a forum for learned and constructive debatea debate in which all the people of Australia will be represented. I support the bill.",23
15,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"This is of course not the first time that this nation has had this kind of debate about its national identity. For example, back in 1948 the Australian parliament debated and legislated for the Nationality and Citizenship Bill. I am proud that it was a Labor government, the great Chifley Labor government, which initiated and carried that legislation. But I think that, with the passage of time, we can all be proud of the decision taken to legislate to create that category of Australian citizenship, which up until that time did not exist. Until that time, we were all regarded as British citizens. At that time, there were people who argued that we should not create Australian citizenship-that that would impair our allegiance to the British motherland. That view should not be dismissed as ignorant or frivolous but ought to be seen as a product of its time. At that time, Australia had made unprecedented sacrifices during the Second World War. We had taken the historic decision to welcome a great many new migrants to build up this country after the Second World War. We realised then, and we have realised with increasing force ever since, that Australia had a new and more independent role to play in the world. So we created Australian citizenship. Does anyone seriously now think that that was the wrong step to take? But we are once again at one of these turning points and we have a similar situation now: Australians have recognised and are recognising with increasing force that it is quite inappropriate that we do not have an Australian head of state, that we do not have our own head of state. I think it was brought home to many of us in this place last year when we had the visit from President Clinton and the toast at the lunch where the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) toasted President Clinton and President Clinton, by way of response, toasted the Queen. I cringed at that time and I think many other people in the room cringed at that time. If I recall correctly, one of the Liberal members of parliament indicated that that event on its own was enough to convince them that it was time for Australia to take that next step towards becoming a republic. We have had some excellent contributions in this debate so far and a number of important points made. For example, we have had pointed out that the succession to the British monarchy and therefore to the Australian monarchy is limited to Protestants. We have had pointed out the fact that males are preferred to females in the line of succession. We have had pointed out the fact that this seems entirely inconsistent with our own constitution-section II6--which says that no religious test should be applied for public office holders. We have also had in the debate the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) make a splendid Freudian slip where he said, 'Why not the Queen of England-the Queen of Australia, I should say?' What a Freudian slip that was because, when all is said and done, she is the Queen of England. We had ample demonstration of that in the last year or two with the controversy over French nuclear testing in the Pacific. I think most of us would see the role of a head of state as being an essentially non-political role and would not want to see our head of state involved in anything which looked like partisan political controversy. But occasionally there are issues which are such matters of national importance that we regard it as important that our head of state has something to say. The issue of French nuclear testing in the Pacific was one of those issues which people in Australia felt so strongly about that it would not have been out of order for the head of state to have been making observations about that issue. Yet the Queen of Englandbeing advised, as she was, by a British government which was reluctant to say anything which might offend France-was certainly not going to say anything on that issue. I am pleased to say that, with a Blair Labour government, if we have a similar circumstance arise again we might well have a government in Britain which is prepared to take more note of Australian concerns and priorities. But this sort of example also brings home to us the inappropriateness of having a monarch of a foreign country as head of our own nation. I have to say that I have some sympathy and a great deal of respect and admiration for the role which has been carried out in a very distinguished way over many years by the Queen of England. But it also has to be said that the royal family in recent times has found itself in difficult circumstances. I also have some sympathy for the fact that in large measure they have been done over by the Murdoch press, and I think any of us can feel some sympathy for people who find themselves in those circumstances. But however strong the case may be for having Australia retain its present constitutional arrangements while the Queen remains the monarch, it seems to me that the personal lives of the members of her family are in some disarray and that the baton should not pass to the next generation. The previous speaker, the member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall), said-and I have heard many Liberals say this in this debate'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' In the same speech, that member said compulsory voting ought to be abandoned. Compulsory voting, which has served this nation so well and has helped make us one of the finest democracies in the world, is something that he is prepared to abandon, notwithstanding the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' test. The Liberal government opposite does not apply that test to the sale of Telstra. The Liberal government in Victoria does not apply that test to the carve-up and sale of the SCC in Victoria or to the sacking of democratically elected councillors in Victoria. What about the workplace relations bill? We had industrial disputation in this country down to record low levels. What about the contracting out of services and the compulsory competitive tendering, all of which have played havoc with notions of public service? What about Working Nation, which was bringing down unemployment in this country to five per cent by the year 2000? All of these things have been working well, yet the Liberal Party is prepared to flog them off, to destroy them. So they should be the last people to come into this House and say, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' As I said before, we have had a high quality, thoughtful debate on this bill. We have had very good contributions from the member for Banks (Mr Melham) and the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) on the other side in support of a republic, and the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan). Frankly, I think they were much more thoughtful contributions than this bill deserves, because it is a really shabby, mealy-mouthed bill from a government which has been dragged kicking and screaming to do this. It is a matter of common knowledge that the Prime Minister is a monarchist. But he was frightened, prior to the last election, of losing that election due to growing republican momentum and sympathies within this country, and he was afraid of internal strife within his own party. Indeed, what a fractious lot they are! They are back at it again with Wik and so on. He was afraid of the voters, so what he proposed was this convention, which turns out-as this bill makes clear-to be a very dodgy exercise indeed. What Labor says is: let us have a vote. Let us put this issue to the people. Let's have an indicative plebiscite and, if people indicate that they want a republic, that they want an Australian head of state, let us move to draft the constitutional changes which would be necessary to put that into effect. But, instead, they are giving us this Dodgy Brothers exercise which will not have any real legitimacy or credibility, and indeed they do not want it to. They do not want to see this constitutional change. The first problem with this exercise is that it is limited to a solitary issue: the issue of head of state. We have always seen some merit in this, but then why do we need this convention? If that is the sole issue to be determined, why shouldn't it be determined by the nation right now through a direct election? Secondly, half the convention is to be appointed in a blatant stacking exercise. If this government is genuinely democratic, genuinely wants a people's convention to sort the issues out, then why not elect the whole lot of them-the 100 per cent? It is a blatant stacking exercise. The third problem that we have with it is voluntary voting. As the member for Canberra and other speakers pointed out, voluntary voting carries within it a great many flaws which will deprive a great many Australians of the opportunity to vote and, in doing so, will reduce the credibility of the whole exercise. Fourthly, we have a postal vote. There are opportunities for fraud and there are security issues which have not been adequately addressed. We have contained within that the loss of the secret ballot. The secret ballot is a peculiarly Australian contribution to the world and it is part of our great democratic heritage. If we abandon things like the secret ballot, then we are not on the way to becoming a republic but on the way to becoming a banana republic. I have to say that any trade union which had its elections conducted the same way that is proposed here would have the result knocked out in a flash. It would simply not be accepted. The position that the government puts before us is a voluntary postal ballot. The Australian Electoral Commission has admitted that up to two million Australians may not receive their postal ballot simply because they have changed their address since the time of the last election. The material on the ballot will be available only in writing and in English. That will tend to disenfranchise Australians who are blind, older people, frail people, people who are illiterate or people who lack English language skills. Presently, many of those people receive a great deal of assistance when they attend at polling booths. We have a situation through the postal the ballot where they will not have that assistance available to them. The postal ballot also will not be distributed to Australians who happen to be overseas at the time of the ballot. As I understand it, the Australian Electoral Commission is not going to conduct a habitation review to get its rolls in order prior to this election being carried out, so we will have a lot of people missing out on a vote. It has been estimated that up to a million people will miss out on a vote due to this process alone. I note that Chris Puplick has observed that the whole thing could be in breach of New South Wales anti-discrimination legislation. On the issue of security of the ballot, Australia Post, as I understand it, is taking no special measures to ensure that people cannot have their postal votes tampered with. As I understand it, people will be required to put their date of birth on the outside of the envelope so that the whole thing can be verified. It is of course a matter of common knowledge that people like landlords, nursing home proprietors, even credit data agencies, student colleges and so on are aware of the dates of birth of various people. Lots of people are aware of my date of birth, I have to say. We do not have privacy legislation and we do not have guarantees of the security of this ballot. Furthermore, we have an extraordinarily complex voting system being adopted. The ballot paper will have above and below the line voting, as the Senate system does. But, in a number of respect."" it will be different from that which is used at the Senate elections. For example, group candidates will be represented on the ballot paper by only the name of the first candidate in the group and a short name requested by the group. The names of the remainder of the candidates within that group will not appear on the ballot paper. Instead, voters will have to refer to an accompanying booklet and will have to write the names of the candidates on the ballot paper in order to vote below the line. It was suggested that this process was okay, because it was something that many thousands of Australian punters do every week when they bet with the TAB, the way they transcribe numbers onto betting slips. As the member for Banks indicated, a lot of Australians take their betting very seriously, including one or two of my staff members and my campaign director. But the suggestion that an election for a convention to discuss such weighty constitutional issues should be likened to a bet on the Dapto dogs is quite insulting. It is not the system we should be using. We should be using the Senate style voting system. There is no legitimate reason why we should not have the Senate style voting system. To come to the appointed delegates, we have the government announcing that there will be 76 appointed delegates, 40 of those to be drawn from parliamentary representatives and the remaining 36 from the general community. Extraordinarily, what is being proposed is that in the federal parliament 12 delegates will come from the coalition, six from the Labor Party, one from the Australian Democrats and one will be drawn at random from the Independents and minor parties. In the state parliaments, the government will appoint the relevant state Premier, the Leader of the Opposition and one additional person nominated by the relevant Premier. That position advantages government parties and will deliver 25 coalition delegates, 13 Labor Party delegates and two members of minor parties or Independents. But it breaches the precedents established by the constitutional conventions held from 1973 to 1985, under both Labor and coalition governments, which saw equal representation within all parliaments of government and opposition members. As indicated before, that is clearly a stacking exercise and gives the lie to any idea that the government is serious or genuine in its commitment to a democratic outcome so far as constitutional change is concerned. Accordingly, Labor is proposing a number of strong amendments to this legislation which would make it a much fairer and more democratic bill and much more suited to the purposes for which it is allegedly designed. It would be a much more genuine piece of legislation. We would require the holding of a compulsory attendance ballot. Voting would be compulsory. All voters would come to the polls, just as they do for ordinary national and state elections. We would regularise the voting system to bring it into line with the method of voting used for the Senate. We would increase the number of elected delegates to 80, to be chosen from the states and territories: 22 from New South Wales, 17 from Victoria, 14 from Queensland, nine from Western Australia, eight from South Australia, six from Tasmania, and two from each of the territories. We would provide for parliamentary delegates being appointed from the federal parliament to have eight members or senators appointed by the Prime Minister, six by the Leader of the Opposition, one by the Australian Democrats and one from the remaining minor party or Independent members or senators. With the states we would have four parliamentary delegates appointed from each state, with two delegates from the respective Premiers and two appointed by leaders of the opposition. In relation to the community delegates, where we are also concerned about the potential for abuse, we would establish a joint parliamentary committee who would choose those delegates by a two-thirds majority. We would further provide for an independent, non-voting chair to be appointed by a two-thirds majority of that joint parliamentary committee. We have further suggested that Sir Anthony Mason would be an appropriate choice to head such a convention. Labor has many concerns about this bill. It is entirely inadequate. It comes from a government which has been dragged kicking and screaming in the direction of a republic and constitutional change. But we will particithis pate in this because we have the conviction that it is time that Australians moved on to capture our own unique Australian identity and to do so through our own head of state, not because we have not seen through this bill for the sham that it is. It comes from a weak, leaderless government. The Howard government has been pulled this way by republicans, that way by monarchists-(Time expired)",24
16,Mr CHARLES,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"La Trobe) (10.50 a.m.)By birth, heritage and inheritance I am a republican. Something like seven generations ago an ancestor of mine is reported to have signed the Declaration of Independence. He was a member of the Continental Congress of the United States. He was also one of the wealthiest men in the United States of America. I am told, or history reports to me, that Irish Catholics in what was then to become the United States paid at that time twice the income tax rates of other members of the community. There was, in effect, great discrimination. He was indeed a great man. He also lived the longest of all his compatriots. He was interviewed by de Tocqueville when in the early 1800s he visited the then United States from France to see what effect this new kind of democracy was going to have on the world. So as I said, by birth, heritage and inheritance I am a republican. But I have never been convinced totally of the need for us in Australia to change our form of parliamentary democracy. I would remind honourable members and those members of the public who are listening that Australia has the sixth longest serving democratic political system surviving in the world uninterrupted by military takeover or dictatorship. Our history of parliamentary democracy is exceeded only by Great Britain, the United States, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland. I would also remind honourable members that, of those six, four are monarchical forms of parliamentary democracy, that is to say, a monarch in four out of those six remains as head of state. We are about to have a convention to let the Australian people decide if we really should consider whether we need to change system of parliamentary democracy which has, indeed, served Australia so very ably and so well. I have grave questions about the need for change and I have great questions about the mechanisms for change, if indeed we do decide to go down that path. I accept that there is, in the Australian community, a feeling that we are somehow not our own masters because our constitution is still, in effect, an act of British law and our head of state, while being Queen of Australia, is also Queen of Great Britain. I accept that many Australians genuinely believe that we need to set up our own head of state based on some formula, some system, incorporated into our particular form of democratic institution. Let us talk briefly about that institution. We took from Great Britain, if you will, the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy so that the head of government is selected in the house of the people-the House of Representatives-by those individuals who can form a majority. In practice, it has meant that political parties form to provide an organisational base in order to make this system work. Individuals in those political parties may have varying and vast differences in philosophical view, in practical view, in how they would go about government, in how they would go about change in society and in how they would go about administering this democratic system in our country. But the political parties exist and our system then allows the political party which wins the most votes at an election to select a Prime Minister. In effect, the Prime Minister and his senior cabinet advisers then advise the Queen of an Australian individual of great stature and great standing in the community to assume the post of head of state and the Queen simply confirms the Prime Minister's advice. Along with that goes the convention that the Governor General has wide powers, but powers which are not specified, not codified in print. Some of the proposals to create a new head of state called 'President', or perhaps still called 'Governor General', would have us codify those responsibilities and those rights of the Governor General. I have great concerns about trying to codify rights because I have seen what happened in the country where I was born in terms of the Bill of Rights. Codifying those rights has meant that their Supreme Court has, from time to time, come down with such disparate decisions on the same issue some years apart as to give little meaning to the codification itself. I put to honourable members that the words used when you legitimately try to codify those rights leaves open for great interpretation later individuals, later groups and later courts to decide that the structure itself has some other meaning than what it had when it was written down in the first place. Our Governor General is our head of state, our Governor General is an Australian, our Governor General is an Australian of great stature and of great standing in the community. We did not take from Great Britain their upper house. We took from the United States a senate based on equal representation from each of the states and minor representation from our two territories. We took from the United States our High Court based exactly on the model of the Supreme Court of the United States. Then, just to make things confusing, we took from Switzerland a referendum system which allows us the mechanism to change the constitution, but based on only allowing it to be so changed if the people agree. A majority of the Australian voting population must agree to a change and a majority of the states must also by a majority agree to the change. That has given great stability in our system. It has meant that our constitution has been amended only a very few times, and I think it is an excellent system. Altogether, we have in place a series of checks and balances on executive action of government. The first of the checks is, in fact, the Senate. We all know how the Senate acts as a check. We have seen some of the Senate's obstruction both when Labor was in power and now while the coalition is in power. Many Australians think that is good; some think it is not so good. Some think it would be better if government could set an agenda, get on with that agenda and report back to the people at the next election-three years after the first one. But others believe, legitimately, that our system now works well. So the Senate provides a check on executive government running away with itself. The states, themselves, actually provide an effective check on executive government because they run their own agendas and budgets and they can create immense pressure on the Commonwealth government to follow a lead of the states. The office of Governor General, itself, is a check on abuse of executive power, as is, of course, the High Court, which is liable to review, on request, any law that we make in this place, regardless of the majority that voted for it in approving that law or that statute. Altogether, we have a series of checks and balances that acts to reduce the power of the executive government and to help make it accountable to the Australian people. That is one of the very good things about our system. It is one of the things that has helped us to have such a stable democracy. I am concerned that, if we were to go to change our constitution, to remove from the constitution the Queen of Australia as titular head of statenot as practical head of state but as titular head of state-we may in fact create some unknown, unforeseen instability that could act to the detriment of the checks and balances or act to the detriment of our democracy. I am reminded that some proposals for a so called Australian head of state would have that individual elected by direct election by the Australian people voting in a ballot and a maJority selecting the president. There are several aspects of that that concern me. The first is that some eminently qualified Australians undoubtedly would not wish to put themselves and their families through the trauma that sometimes attends hard fought election campaigns. It is a legitimate concern. The office of head of state in Australia is a very high office and we look to it not to run the government but for stability, for leadership and for a vision that Australia is represented by an eminent person who represents all of us in the community and indeed on the world stage. The convention which this bill will enable will allow eminent Australians, some of whom have been selected and some of whom have been elected by the Australian people, to discuss the weighty issues around whether we should actually change the wording of our constitution and whether we should change the mechanism for the head of state, what powers the head of state should have, for how long they should remain in office and under what mechanisms they might, if ever, be removed from office other than voluntarily. The convention idea was born a number of years ago and it was in fact in direct response to Paul Keating's absolute dominance of the debate about the republican issue and his insistence that we had to move down that path: we needed to get rid of the Queen, we needed to get rid of the flag and we had to have a new Australia based on Paul Keating's model and Paul Keating's vision. The coalition rightly several years ago decided that was not a function for executive government, that was not function for a Prime Minister to decide, but that it was so important that it a function for the people of Australia to decide. The convention grew out of that idea, in a sense replicating the conventions which led up to the constitution and the founding of our Commonwealth in 1901. So the convention not only is a laudable idea but in fact keeps our faith with the Australian people in that we promised in the last election campaign to bring forth such a convention and to listen to the convention and its advice and, if deemed desirable, to put that advice to the test of the Australian people. I notice that the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) in his contribution said that voluntary voting would deprive very many Australians of their voting rights. I am sorry, but I fail to understand how that could be true, that voluntary voting is undemocratic and that voluntary voting deprives one of rights. I thought that we were a country that believed in free speech, in freedom of the press, in freedom of religion, in freedom of assembly and in freedom of association. In all these basic freedoms we are essentially free, within the bounds of restrictions imposed by society through laws, to pretty well do what we like, go where we like, say what we like and meet with whom we like. Yet we are told by the member for Wills that it is undemocratic that this voting mechanism for the convention be voluntary, that is, if you want to vote for the elected members of the convention you have the opportunity to do so but it is not required that you do so; if you have no interest in the issue and no interest in who will be participating in the convention then you are not forced to participate. I fail to see how that is undemocratic or how it deprives one single Australian of any voting rights. Much of the debate surrounding the idea of a change of head of state is based on a perception that we will feel better if we finally sever our ties with Great Britain, our founding fathers and mothers. I have to say I have been unconvinced by that symbolism-excepting that, when President Clinton came to visit us here and we had a state luncheon in the Great Hall and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was stood and toasted the United States of America and President Clinton stood and toasted the Queen, I must admit that I felt for the first time some disappointment in that symbolism. I guess for the first time. I can understand why many Australians would seek to change the system. I do understand that the royal family is no longer as in favour with the general public, is no longer as in favour even in Britain, as once it was. I understand that it is an old institution. But I also understand that it has weathered the time well. It has produced one of the world's greatest systems of democracy. It can trace its roots back centuries, and that is important. When we enter this debate, when a convention is held and when the delegates examine these issues, one of the things they will have to consider seriously is that all of the tradition, the history and the conventions built up through the years which act on the Governor General are very important. When we change the system, we may lose those. I point out to this House that Bill Hayden, as Governor General, changed. When Bill Hayden was proposed as Governor General I must admit that I was somewhat less than enthusiastic. But Bill Hayden, as a Governor General, had not only my full support but also my admiration. The office itself changed him because he became subject to that heritage and subject to those conventions. He acted, throughout his term of office, in a manner that would have made his predecessors proud. He was a fine Governor General. Yet his background, his speeches and his inclinations as a real republican prior to that time were well known by all of us who are interested in politics and who follow political matters. The office changed the individual. That is one of the most important considerations. If the convention decides and if the Australian people decide that we need a different mechanism for selecting a head of state, then we need to do so taking into account the need to, as much as possible, preserve those conventions and that heritage. The important issue surrounding this bill that we are debating here today is not the mickey mouse, finite detail that the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) went through. It is a fair system to select a group of Australians to sit in the Old Parliament House and to debate these weighty issues and to decide, in their minds, what the Australian people might decide on. It is a fair system and it will produce a fair outcome. It will be representative, in so far as that is ever possible, of the views of all Australians. They will examine in detail the issues that need to be examined surrounding any possible change in Australia's head of state. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)",28
17,Mr MCCLELLAND,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) delivered an interesting speech, in particular with some very worthwhile content, regarding the inheritance of our system from Great Britain, the United States and Switzerland. I think he hit the nail right on the head: that speech by President Clinton in the Great Hall was a defining moment in Australian history. The member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) indicated how he felt a cringe and indeed I can relate a similar feeling when President Clinton stood up and proposed a toast to the Queen, not to the Australian people. That is regrettable. It is much more than symbolism: it is a question of our identity. That is why there is such momentum in the community for Australia to have its own elected head of state. However, it is wrong and quite misleading to say that we are proposing a change to our system of democracy; we are not. Indeed, while the United States system is a republic, it is a system based very heavily on those fundamental principles and freedoms that we have inherited, right back to the times of the Magna Carta. That document set out what are described as being 'inalienable rights'. Those treaties which followed in the years as a result of civil wars and, finally, the bills of rights which give rise to our parliamentary system are all the basis of the principles contained in the United States system. We are not proposing changing our system of democracy in terms of the rights that each citizen of Australia has, nor are we talking about codifying any rights. We are talking about Australia having its own head of state. Indeed, I recall the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in his second reading speech on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill, was at pains to confine the task of the constitutional convention at the end of the year to that issue. There is no doubt that the great majority of Australians are in favour of having their own head of state. It is curious that last night in the budget we heard an announcement of a federation centenary project whereby funds could be allocated, presumably, to various electorates which may be selected by ministers. But they are missing a real opportunity to make a mark on Australia's history by seizing this issue and seizing the momentum that is out there in the community and giving Australia a modem identity that will have respect in the world.",31
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,Mr Nehl)Order! I would like to draw standing order 57 to the attention of the honourable member for Batman. I would be grateful if he would observe the courtesy of respecting his colleague.,32
19,Mr MCCLELLAND,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"The bill does not focus on the system of appointment but, nonetheless, it is an issue to which I would like to refer. The Prime Minister, in his second reading speech, said: We in the government parties have always advocated that matters of national identity should not party political issues. In that context, it is quite disturbing that the government has proposed a system whereby the Labor opposition will have precisely half the number of appointed delegates the coalition will have. That is certainly not bipartisan, and it is certainly contrary to convention. In the September 1973 convention, for instance-at the Commonwealth level-the government and the opposition each appointed eight delegates. That was in the period of the Whitlam government. It is regrettable that this government has not seen fit to act in such a similar partisan way. There is no doubt that our constitution is out of date, and the member for Wills touched on many of those issues. For instance, when the constitution was drafted, there was no such creature as an Australian citizen. That occurred in 1948-49 with the Australian Citizenship Act. Hence, we find in section 44 of the constitution a preclusion on anyone standing for parliament if they bear allegiance to a foreign power. On one view, it may well be that none of us here in this House are entitled to sit as members, because we have all sworn allegiance-in the oath which is the schedule to the constitution-to Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors. That demonstrates the fact that the constitution itself is anachronistic. Queen Elizabeth is the head of state of a foreign power, and it is naive in the extreme to assume that Great Britain's interests are going to travel side by side with Australia's. It is not a question of Australia wanting to cut the umbilical cord. Grcat Britain has done that for us. They have well and truly cast us adrift. I am not being judgmental about that. They have seen their destiny in Europe and have cut away the favoured status we had as a colony and when the British Commonwealth was effectively a trading group. So it is not a question of us leaving them; they have pushed us away. To suggest that a person can wear two hats, as head of state of two countries, each with inevitably competing interests is, with respect, a very great fallacy. There is no doubt that this constitutional convention arises from political motives. It be was evidently the case during the last election, as opinion polls showed, that the majority of Australians most certainly favoured a republic. There was a fear on the part of the Liberal Party that the push towards republicanism would be reflected in a negative vote for the Liberal Party. So their strategists said, 'We had better neutralise that.' In their policy document regarding the constitution, they made this statement: No matter who wins the next election, the Australian people will vote about the Republic. Therefore, no person who wants a Republic should feel that it should in any way influence his or her vote. It is that neutralisation of the pro-republican vote in the last election which has given rise to the constitutional convention that we are facing at the end of the year. However, the Australian people will not be voting for whether or not they want a republic. They will be voting for 50 per cent of delegates at a talkfest. It is not a genuine convention that has any formal status under the constitution in making recommendations or decisions which will be binding in any way. Regrettably, the whole process is going to tarnish the image of the convention and remove any credibility it will have. In a speech earlier this year the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) referred to a Pryor cartoon which appeared in the Canberra Times as epitomising the whole process. I was also amused by the cartoon, which hit the nail right on the head. It was a picture of a citizen standing by a letterbox, posting their ballot paper for the convention delegates. The Prime Minister, dressed in his wet weather garb, with the rain teeming down, is saying to this citizen of Australia, 'Okay, next you have to cross the Sydney Harbour Bridge on roller blades, wearing a G-string and with this egg balanced on the tip of your nose.' Obviously, those complications would prove a significant disincentive to all but the most exhibitionist of us, including perhaps those on the front benches of the House. Disincentives are well and truly in the proposals contained in this bill. The voting system, which has been described by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), is so complicated that you would need a three-year university degree on voting procedure simply to have a chance of casting a valid vote. Even after you have cast a vote, you have to complete personal details, including your name and address. The return ballot paper is going to be bar coded so that it can be computer tracked and, quite clearly, there is going to be a disincentive for people wanting to reveal that information and having that information retained about them. Moreover, the complications are going to affect illiterate citizens, citizens who do not speak English, the blind and the disabled. The voting system itself is fundamentally flawed. I do not believe it constitutes "" St-cret ballot, for the reasons I have mentioned, as a result of the ability to identify precisely who voted. Indeed, there have been a number of cases involving in particular trade unions but also Aboriginal land councils and other elections conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Office where the fact that it was possible to identify a voter resulted in those ballots being set aside. In several cases that I am aware of, evidence was taken from witnesses indicating that the lack of secrecy was a specific disincentive for them casting a vote. I believe that inevitably there will be that sort of challenge to the ballot later this year. As a result of challenge, there is, in my view, doubt that the convention will even take place. If there is a court case, it may well delay for quite some time the occurrence of the constitutional convention. A second very serious concern is the fact that the roll of voters is significantly out of date. Any member in this House can tell you that when they do a mail-out to their electorate, which is sourced from the electoral roll, they receive hundreds, often thousands, of returned letters as a result of people changing addresses. Indeed, I understand that about two million Australians a year change address. Given that it has been 18 months since the last electoral roll was prepared, we are looking at a potential three million people not receiving ballot papers. That is, quite frankly, an outrage. Again, there are numerous cases where ballots have been set aside because the returning officer failed to take all reasonable steps to locate people. What does the returning officer do in this case when, as will inevitably occur, at least one million-possibly two million-ballot papers are returned to him? Does he then try to track down those people? The dilemma he has is that, if he does not do that, the process again risks being challenged, as I believe will occur. Further, there is no plan to post voting papers to people overseas. One would think that members of our armed forces would have a very specific interest in the outcome of this ballot. Those who are serving this country overseas will be deprived of the right to vote for delegates because there is no procedure in place whereby those serving our country overseas can receive ballot papers. That is a real indictment of this government and the lack of respect that they pay to our service men and women who are serving this country so proudly. The reality is that those flaws are going to affect the bill. Unfortunately, it is not a secret ballot. I think it is fair to say that over the centuries countless service men and women have given their lives to protect our system of democracy, and this bill does not do them proud. It is a butchering of a true democratic that process and an indictment of the government. As I have said earlier, the bill is not a decision as to whether we will be moving towards a republic. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said in his response to the second reading speech, it is a pity that it is not a bill for a direct vote by the Australian people on the question of whether or not Australia should have an Australian head of state. It is no secret that what we in the Labor Party have proposed-and we believe should still occur-a process whereby, first, there is an indicative plebiscite to ascertain whether the people of Australia wish to move towards a republic. Secondly, if there is a yes votewe believe there will be-then we favour the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee. Following extensive community consultation, that committee would report to parliament on questions to be referred to the Australian public by way of a referendum. The third and final process would be the referendum, which would occur in 1999 at the latest. If those procedures were followed, Australia would be entering the next century with a head of steam, with momentum, with optimism and with pride. Unfortunately, we will not be doing that; we will be looking back over a flawed voting process, giving rise to an extremely confused and convoluted constitutional convention process. The fact of the matter is that the procedures are so flawed that any view that comes out of this convention will be able to be chaIlenged and disregarded. It is going to be meaningless. As a result of the complications, it will probably be years and years before Australia, regrettably, has its own identity through having an Australian elected as head of state. Be that as it may, the Labor Party acknowledges that at least this constitutional convention is a move towards the republic debate occurring in the community. In that sense, we will not be opposing the process occurring. However, we are proposing several amendments which would make the process more legitimate. They include, first, a compulsory attendance baIlot and, second, a regularisation of this complicated voting procedure to bring it into line with the method of voting for the Senate. We propose increasing the number of elected delegates to 80, and they would be selected on the basis of the proportion of population in the states and territories. We propose reducing the parliamentary delegates from 20 to 16 and sacrificing four to community delegates. Those parliamentary delegates would be selected on a bipartisan basisthat is, eight government, six Labor opposition, one Democrat and one Independent. We propose four bipartisan parliamentary delegates from each state, two parliamentary delegates from the Australian territories and 36 community delegates to be selected by a two-thirds majority of a joint parliamentary committee. We also propose an independent non-voting chair, and we propose provision for preliminary rules and procedures for the convention. If these things are foIlowed, we believe the convention will have some viability. As it presently stands, it will have none. Regrettably for this country, the Prime Minister is going to be discredited from this whole procedure. He is going to be seen as fostering a system which is going to be flawed and, unfortunately, rorted. We call upon the government to seriously consider and take on board our amendments which will give this procedure at least some legitimacy.",32
20,Mr ANTHONY,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Richmond) (11.30 a.m.)I have listened with great interest to the debate yesterday and this morning on the constitutional convention. I do welcome the comments, most of them sane comments, from the opposition, although there are a number of points which I would like to address in my speech. The first point I would like to make is I do not want to pass judgment in this parliament today on the pros and cons of whether Australia sticks to its constitutional monarchy or whether there is a change which will have to be made eventually by the will of the people through a referendum to change the head of state. I would, though, like to inform this House that, as a backbencher, I have held a number of public meetings in the electorate of Richmond-in the towns of Byron Bay and Ballina, which have very different demographics-about the constitutional convention. One of the reasons I am delighted to speak on this bill, and one of the reasons we are having a convention, is to try to increase the public awareness about what the potential moves will be if we are to change Australia's head of state, what type of republican model will be adopted and, of course, what the timetable will be. There is an overwhelming hunger for more information out in the electorate about these issues. When we look at previous conventions, reading from The People's Convention: Daryl Williams: The 1891 National Constitutional Convention held in Sydney was attended by delegations appointed by the legislatures of the six Australian colonies and New Zealand. In a sense, it was a parliamentarians' convention. As opposed to a people's convention, which we will be having in December. It continues: The Constitutional Convention of 1897-98, however, comprised 10 representatives elected at large from each of the Colonies. Exceptions were Western Australia . . . and Queensland who sent nobody! While the delegates to the 1897-98 convention were drawn from large fields of candidates ... only one non-parliamentarian was elected. It is therefore clear to what extent we can attribute the Convention's 'success' to the fact that it was a popularly elected body. Experience has shown that the Constitution is difficult to amend ... Electors have voted on 42 proposals to alter the Constitution on 18 occasions since Federation. Only 8 amendments have resulted. So, if we are to go to a referendum on this particular issue, the public has to be informed if there is to be any clear mandate for whether we maintain the status quo or whether we change. As I mentioned before, the first reason for having this constitutional convention is to help increase public awareness across Australia. Obviously, the debate now has very much shifted from the original ALP position when Paul Keating was the Prime Minister and, indeed, from when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) made his speech after that of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 4 December. It is interesting to note that there has been a major shift within the opposition on the merits of the people's convention, although now it is rediscussing the details. I would like to highlight former Prime Minister Keating's proposal of 14 February 1996. That proposal was to put to the people a plebiscite on the question: do you want an Australian to be Australia's head of state? Indeed, this was further confirmed by the Leader of the Opposition on 4 December 1996 when he proposed a three-step process to advance the republican debate. That process would involve, first, an indicative plebiscite to ascertain whether the people wished to move to a republic. If there was a yes vote, it would then go to a joint parliamentary committee and then, of course, it would go to a referendum. This people's constitutional convention will give a certain amount of ownership to the rest of the Australian community. I think it would be very unwise if we were to go straight to a plebiscite because the level of knowledge is so scant on this subject. We are dealing with an immensely important area. Whilst it might not put another meal on our table, fundamental changes to our constitution, particularly in relation to our head of state and the reserve powers that that person would have, are not critical to the democracy of this country. There is certainly no suggestion-and I would not like to see it at all-that the Westminster system should be changed. It has proved to be a very viable and a very safe system not just in this country but in many other countries. The ALP's original plan was to have less people participation. If you go directly to a plebiscite, I would suggest you would get a less informed decision. Indeed, when the details of the people's convention were first put forward by the Prime Minister, it was interesting to note an editorial in the Australian. These are the comments that it made about the Australian Labor Party's initial policy advance on moving Australia towards a referendum on the republic: . . . if we agreed with the ALP's proposition that a plebiscite be held as soon as possible, then we would be supporting a limitation of the debate. For paradoxically (considering Opposition Leader Kim Beazley's view that the Constitution is owned by the people, not the politicians) the ALP would then have the debate channelled through a joint parliamentary committee which would report to Parliament on the particular form of questions which should be ultimately put to the people. We believe a broader forum is required to attract and refine the public view. Those who fear minority-driven change should recognise the power of the Constitution which means that any proposed change needs majority support of States. It goes on to say there that the holding of the constitutional convention has merit because it will encourage this debate. Certainly, that was the input that I received from the public meetings that I had in the electorate of Richmond. There is certainly a lack of knowledge not just about this process but about our constitution. Perhaps this whole process that we are going through-firstly, the election of 76 of the 152 which will be from the publicwill start to generate interest. That will then flow through to the lO-day convention which will be held in December. A myth that has been brought about by a number of members of the opposition is that somehow a non-compulsory secret ballot paper will have less impact on the community and that somehow it will be a disenfranchisement for democracy. Another interesting point that was raised in the Australian on March 27-and this was written by Malcolm MACKerras, who is not known for being backward in his views-was: The essential point to understand is that each elector will receive a ballot paper in the post accompanied by all other necessary information. With two or three weeks available for voting the . elector will have no difficulty understanding the system, which is voter-friendly. After voting has been completed the counting will take about three weeks. One of the benefits of having a postal vote is that it does allow people to sit down and diagnose the information at their own leisure rather than going directly to a public ballot box. As the opposition is articulating, if it were compulsory, I would suggest that there would be less scrutiny of the issues. Unfortunately, on many occasions, particularly in general elections, there is a high cynicism displayed by swinging voters. So, by having a ballot process, by receiving information a number of weeks beforehand, people will be able to make an informed decision and an informed choice of who they wish to elect to the constitutional convention. One of the other interesting points that was raised was that having a secret ballot would somehow lead to manipulation or the government choosing to stack the convention. As most commentators and readers would be aware, there is a wide disparity of views, certainly within the Liberal Party, between pro-monarchists and those proposing the republican system. Indeed, there is even some division within the National Party. Thus, one of the arguments that some of our opponents are using is that if we do have a secret ballot it can be manipulated. It is interesting to note that people like Malcolm Turnbull in an article written by Michael Gordon in the Australian on 13 February say that, if this is the case, the ultimate beneficiaries, if we were to read public opinions, would be the republicans. The article in the Australian of 13 February states: Republicans are far more likely to participate in the Federal Government's People's Convention, according to a survey that also shows a dramatic drop in opposition to Australia becoming a republic. The Prime Minister has fulfilled his commitment by going to a people's constitutional convention. Ironically, during that periodmost people recognised the Prime Minister's position-there was an increase in support for the republic. So one could argue that this particular system would actually favour them, which in many ways negates a lot of the points raised by the opposition this morning . I think it is important to actually look at the convention. I have talked about the 76 of the 152 delegates who are to be elected. This will be broken down on a state by state basis: 20 from New South Wales, 16 from Victoria, 13 from Queensland, nine from Western Australia, eight from South Australia, six from Tasmania and two from the territories. This replicates the representation in the House of Representatives. I think that is a prudent representation, and that will then go on to a Senate style ticket. The other 76 who will be appointed in the next couple of months, assuming legislation passes through the Senate, will be made up of 40 parliamentary delegates, 20 of these delegates coming from the state and territory parliaments, and the Premier, the Leader of the Opposition and a third parliamentary nominee of the Premier will be invited from each state. It is also interesting to note that there is a wide diversity of views amongst the Premiers and amongst the conservative states as to whether Australia should move to change our head of state or whether we should maintain the status quo. The other 20 will be Commonwealth parliamentary representatives, and, not unreasonably, they will take the shape of the parliament we are in today: 12 from the government, six from the opposition, one from the Democrats and one Independent. These numbers broadly reflect the representation of parties in the parliament. To suggest that somehow we are manipulating the system, these people represent their constituents; were publicly elected anyway. So there is a pressure valve in the whole election process ofthose 152 delegates-half appointed by the government, or 40 parliamentary elected delegates, and the other 76 from the public at large. There will be 36 non-parliamentary delegates so that those people who do not have an opportunity-whether it be because of their finances, their disadvantaged position or their age, and that will include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders-will be able to be appointed to this constitutional forum. There will be a commitment to local government, which was not recognised in our constitution by our forefathers, and at least 10 per cent of government appointees to the convention will be young people between the ages of 18 and 25. Without those safeguards, without that provision, then you probably would not have representation from that group of Australians who will be tomorrow's leaders. For that reason, the actual breakdown of people that will be appointed and also elected to the constitutional convention, in my opinion, is very fair. The argument of having a voluntary ballot paper is also very fair. Why should people be punished, be fined, for not wishing to particiaccess pate in this process? The government has embarked upon a number of bites of the cherry to inform the public and make them part of the process. First of all, the public will have a choice of those, in my case, 20 delegates from New South Wales or, in Mr Jull's case, 13 delegates from Queensland. You will have a say there; you will be informed. Then it will go to the convention in December where there will be an enormous amount of discussion, which will probably come in the silly season where news items are of less currency. So this will get a fair hearing. If you go directly to a plebiscite, as was the ALP's original proposal, I do not believe the Australian public would get a fair hearing. In the government's process we would move to an indicative plebiscite after the constitutional convention and then move to a referendum, where there would be far more information they and a far more informed vote by the people. Regarding postal votes, there is some suggestion that there could be manipulation or fraud. We are not talking about telecommunication unions or other members of the trade union movement who are quite akin to manipulating postal votes. We are talking about a very secure system which the AEC would be policing, whereby ballot papers would be sent out. These will be coded and envelopes will be placed inside those general mail-outs which will also be coded to ensure that there is no duplication or fraud, a particularly important point. There is also a suggestion that the voting system, which has been highlighted by previous speakers, can be further manipulated because a number of people will be disenfranchised, particularly people who have a nonEnglish speaking background. This will be very different to election times. The AEC will have phone lines and interpreter services where you can ring and they will explain the ballot to you. To my understanding, when there is a general election, if you go into a ballot booth you do not have these interpreter services there. Certainly they are written down, but this way you will have three weeks to consider your vote and you will be able to this AEC procedure. There will be a national hotline right across Australia. If these new immigrants choose to be part of the process, they will be encapsulated in this process and I believe they will be given a fairer hearing. At the end of the day if you make voting compulsory, many people may not give an informed vote. The most important vote to be given on this issue is if it gets to a referendum. That is where people must have an informed decision on whether or not we change our head of state. This process that we are going through now is a lengthy process and a better process than what Paul Keating or even the Leader of the Opposition have articulated. It will give greater ownership to Australians and to Australian electors than what the previous government had planned. I come back to the article in the Australian. I think this is particularly important because what we are proposing is a far more democratic process than what the ALP initially wanted, which was to rush to a plebiscite. It would then go off to a joint parliamentary committee. How much ownership and democracy would there be in that decision? In our proposal at least 76 people will be elected outside of the political process. They will not be members of federal parliament or state parliament. Yes, they will encapsulate people from local government. Also, if you have a strong desire, whether you are in the ARM movement or Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, you can be a part of that process. Those people should be part of the process because they have been very articulate and very passionate about it. The ALP's original proposal was that it be hived off to a joint parliamentary committee. That is undemocratic. I support and commend the process that the government is putting forward in this bill. It has taken a lot of finessing by Nick Minchin, and I congratulate him for that. I also congratulate the Prime Minister for having the courage to follow through on this convention, notwithstanding that there are many within the Liberal Party who would probably prefer not to have this process. We are being democratic. I have held a number of conventions in my own electorate. What is terribly important here is that more information has to be fed out to the mums and dads and the next voting generation of Australia. They have to be better briefed on Australia's constitution. Massive implications would result if we did change our head of state. The next issues that we would address are how we codify that position, how we elect that person and what type of model we have in that person. As a younger Australian, I am in favour of looking at changing Australia's head of state, although I am less convinced that the minimalist approach-or certainly the models that have been produced so far-will deliver that type of certainty and that type of security for Australia as it moves into the 21st century that we have enjoyed in the 100 years since Federation. It is up to them to demonstrate to the Australian public why we should change a system that has been quite adequate to date. But I, like all other Australians, will enjoy listening and maybe being part of that constitutional convention which will happen for 10 days in December 1997.",34
21,Mr KERR,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"The premise of this constitutional convention is that it is designed to enable the Australian community to express a view about the manner and mechanism that may be thought appropriate to move towards a new constitutional framework. But the truth is that it is a process made in order to avoid an outcome. There is no doubt that this is a system that has been set up to fail. You would not devise a process less able to be implemented had you gone about this process with the intellect of a gnat, with the greatest of respect to the lower orders of insects. This is a very silly piece of legislation if it is intended to do what the government says it is intending to do-that is, to seek the views of the community and to find a forum for their expression. It could only be designed in this way if it was intended to fail. Why would the government put forward a proposition intending it to fail? The reason it is doing so is that the leadership of the government is not committed to a republic. It is not committed to an outcome that it knows the great majority of Australians support, but it is frightened to say that. It is frightened to clarify its position with respect to the way in which Australia should shape its constitutional future. The best way to prevent Australians expressing their will is to set up a forum and a process which are bound to create discord and certain to produce an equivocal outcome. The only outcome that can emerge from this convention, unless it is amended in the manner suggested by the opposition, is a deeply flawed process, participation at abysmally low levels, and a sense in the community that the outcome was tarnished from the start because many of the delegates came from conservative parties in numbers which were quite unrepresentative in relation to their participation in the political process-in other words, stack the process so that whatever the popular vote a group of laggards will stand outside the republican process who can be counted on to say, 'We can't possibly get a consensus.' I am not speaking of fantasy. Many prominent members of the coalition have already started to articulate the fact that even if 65 cent of the popular vote is in favour of a republic, by the nature of the nomination and appointment process this government has set in place-that is, electing delegates to the convention who are not in favour of a republic-we are certain to get a convention where it could not be said there was near unanimity or anything that represents consensus. In setting up a process which will work only if there is consensus and then devising a mechanism which denies legitimacy and ensures there will be no consensus at the end of the day, a structural failure is being built in from day one. There are some key deficiencies in the elements of this legislation. The first of those deficiencies is that, against the pattern of Australian participatory democracy, there is to be a voluntary postal ballot. The experience in other countries of voluntary voting systems is that participation is low. In our country, when ballots of this nature have been held at the local government level and within the trade union movement, participation rates have ranged from the abysmal to the merely ordinary. This system could never rival the mandate that comes with popular elections held under our normal democratic system, where all Australians participate through a secret ballot managed by the Australian Electoral Commission and in which all Australians have a responsibility, by nature of their citizenship, to participate. What we will have instead is a process which is built around an intention to get a low turnout so that those who are putting forward this process can point to that low turnout and have the first black mark to discredit whatever popular vote emerges. Next, the voting system will be inexplicable to many Australians. The voting system is not one that anyone will be used to. It is said the electoral system is one that people who fill in Tattslotto forms or punters will have some familiarity with, but it is certainly not one that citizens of this country have ever had any familiarity with in the voting system. So the ballot paper will be confusing. The ballot paper will also be provided to electors only in English and only through the per post. That is the starting point for two things: massive electoral fraud and the disenfranchisement, in practice, of many millions of Australians. Let us not focus explicitly on those whose first language is other than English. Let us talk about people who are sometimes embraced within what is wrongly called the Australian mainstream-wrongly because to talk of the Australian mainstream suggests that there are Australian citizens who are not legitimately part of the Australian community. If that includes the blind, how do they participate? If that includes people who have difficulty with literacy-unfortunately, still a substantial number of the adult population have difficulties with literacy-how does that affect them? Then there are the people who have changed address. The Australian Electoral Commission estimates that between two million and three million Australians change address between elections. There is no process here to ensure the electoral roll is up to date. Instead of what would be the case in a normal election, where people would know that there was to be a ballot on a particular day and go to a polling station to cast their vote, letters will be sent to people at their old electoral address. There will be no habitation update, so any Australian who has changed address is likely not to receive their ballot paper. Then there are those Australians who are overseas. If they happen to be overseas on the day, in a normal election there would be many processes to enable their participation. In this case there will not be. Then there are the people who live, for example, in isolated and remote communities, particularly Aboriginal people but also many non-Aboriginal Australians, who generally benefit from mobile polling booths. How are people who are normally serviced by mobile polling booths and who have habitation registration in community settlements in the bush going to participate effectively? They are normally serviced directly as part of the democratic system, at some cost, but under this system they are simply excluded. How do we deal with the possibility of extremist minority elements seizing hold of this process, knowing that it is going to be a voluntary ballot and seeking to play a part in the process in a way which is quite unrepresentative with respect to their numbers? With the emergence of the Pauline Hanson factor, I do not think that this government really ought to countenance the prospect that this would be a referendum not on what should be the future form of government in this country but which would be the first test of the electoral mandate of a Pauline Hanson One Nation party; yet that is the kind of that is emerging in a ballot which, by its nature, will not be an inclusive one. It will not, for example, be easily used by people whose languages are other than English. It will certainly not be used easily by people who are resident in nursing homes. The chances of fraud are massive. It is the case, of course, that there are opportunities for abuse whenever these postal ballot type elections are held. There have been instances in the past in the trade union movement where allegations of fraud have been made in relation to the way in which certain ballots of this nature have been conducted. I suppose a postal ballot of members is the best arrangement that you can come up with, because members are scattered around the country. You cannot have normal compulsory voting for people in those circumstances. But the potential for fraud is there and from time to time, it has been alleged, improprieties have occurred in those elections. Sending millions of letters out in the postsometimes to group addresses like nursing homes, but certainly up and down the streetwhen the only security that is built into the system is that you have to put your date of birth on the return, is a recipe for rorting. You can well imagine people simply following the postman, picking these letters out of the boxes, getting the names, identifying the dates of birth, filling the forms in and sending them off en masse. What is to prevent it? Certainly there will be penalties if detected, but the Electoral Commission has said that there is no identifiable way of dealing with such fraud. So you set up a process which most Australians will be sceptical about, because it will have low participation. You expose it to the possibility of massive fraud. You create the climate for people to participate not on the basis of the ostensible objective of the convention but in order to test their political muscle. You do it in an unfamiliar way with a balloting system which has never been used before, which is likely to lead to massive informality of votes. And you do it in a circumstance where, whatever the outcome of the election process, the appointed people who come to contribute an equal share will be possibility dominated by a political stack. We thought the best way to deal with the question of Australia's constitutional future was to ask the Australian people straight up, 'Are you in favour of Australia becoming a republic-moving to a repUblican form of government?' It is not a particularly difficult question and it is a question that all Australians could answer without complexity. Instead of that, what we are being asked to do under this legislation is to endorse a process which is bound to produce a muddled, inconclusive and essentially illegitimate outcome-an outcome that is guaranteed to produce a flawed and deeply divisive result. We have moved a number of amendments which are designed to improve this, to at least get it to a stage where you cannot expect failure or demand failure by the process. It is still not the best process, but at least if we are going to have a convention with half the members elected and half the members appointed let us do it in a way which has at least a chance of some success, of actually getting a constructive outcome. So let us have a ballot in which all Australians participate. We talk about Australians having rights, but they also have responsibilities. Some members on the other side have been talking up about the virtues of voluntary voting. I heard comments along the lines that, if you have no interest in this, it is undemocratic to insist that people participate in the democratic voting process. I think one of the things Australians should be proud of is the fact that, as well as having rights, we as citizens have responsibilities. When you take citizenship in this country, you do not just become a person who puts their hand out and asks for things to be given. You also have a responsibility to participate in the choice of your elected representatives and the form of your government. What could be more fundamental in terms of Australians and their future than the constitutional form that will take us into the next century? If it is important that all Australians participate in national elections, it is important that they participate in an election which will determine the form of government for the future. I am deeply cynical and extremely concerned about people who talk about-as if it is a good thing-those who are said to have no interest in a particular ballot not participating, as is their democratic right. That way leads us to the American model, where at the last presidential elections a minority of Americans participated in the election of their national head of state-the most powerful elected position in the worldwhere many of the most significant elections exclude people who are effectively disenfranchised by a whole variety of means from the democratic processes, and where politics becomes an exercise in spending huge amounts of money not on dealing with the questions of what are the correct policies to follow and which party has better credentials to govern but simply on how you can get those voters out and how you can stimulate people to have sufficient interest in the electoral process to vote. We do not suffer from that. We have a Commonwealth government where the government can claim the strength and support from an elected system in which all Australians participate and give legitimacy to our democratic system. Our democratic system is not held too robustly in the eyes of many. There are quite a few people who look upon us with some concern and suggest that we are losing the respect of the community at large. The way we will lose that respect and credibility and continue that process in which we are not held in good regard by the Australian community is to put up dodgy proposals like this, where the will of the people is in a sense being betrayed irrespective of whatever outcome they proceed to express by way of their vote. The elected delegates ought to represent the whole Australian community. The balloting system should be fair. When it comes to appointed delegates, there should not be a political stack. There should not be a situation in which, because of the temporary political majority that exists in this Commonwealth and the various states, there is a disproportionate representation of one political party over the others. That is what we are facing now. We are also facing a process in which this government has not set up an objective process for the selection of those non-elected members who are to be appointed. There is no fairness, no transparency and no democracy in this system. It is designed to fail. It is designed to satisfy John Howard's objective: to delay the Australian people expressing an opinion on that fundamental question, which we all wish to have resolved shortly, as to the future form of our democratic processes and whether we should have an Australian as a head of state.

22,Mr EOIN CAMERON,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I intend to speak fairly briefly on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997. It of course enacts another election commitment of the coalition and gives the power to the people of Australia to decide the destiny of our great nation. It enables Australians to elect representatives to debate our constitution and whether it should change and, if so, how it should change. It takes the power from the politicians and gives it to the people. It must be remembered that this bill is not about whether Australia should remain a constitutional monarchy or become a republic, although I am sure that that will be made an issue in this debate. It already has been made an issue. This bill is about giving the power to the people to determine our future by choosing their representatives to debate our constitution and, in particular, our head of state. It does not leave it in the hands of a few politicians and backroom party hacks, as was the case under the previous government. Prior to the election of the Howard government, we had a Prime Minister intent on imposing his will on the populace. He decided that he wanted Australia to become a republic, so he chose to pursue that goal, no matter what. The problem with that is that, when the people are not consulted, it inhibits the chances of achieving the intended goal at a referendum and only wastes the taxpayers' money. And that is the position that the previous Prime Minister risked by foisting on the people his intended agenda and not the agenda the people wanted. It was that sort of arrogance that showed how the Prime Minister and the Australian Labor Party had lost touch with the community. This bill establishes the framework for the election of delegates to the constitutional convention, which will debate our nation's constitutional future. I am delighted to support this bill-with a couple of minor reservations, which I will deal with later. There has been great debate over recent years about whether our nation should become a republic and at what time we should become one if we do. Some people have said that it is imperative that the Olympic Games in 2000 be opened by an Australian and that the new millennium is an appropriate time to become a republic. I do not think that that is the issue; indeed, I think it takes the debate away from the real issue of whether our nation remains a constitutional monarchy or becomes a republic, and why. The convention is scheduled for December this year. Prior to that, there will be an election conducted to elect delegates to the convention, which is what this legislation enacts. I note the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy and the Australian Republican Movement have launched their campaigns to elect delegates. I welcome the diverse opinion that will be a feature of the convention and trust it will prove to be not only a robust debate but, more importantly, a firm statement on what direction our nation's constitution should take. One very attractive feature of this bill, which I welcome, is the provision of voluntary voting. I support the concept of voluntary voting and do not believe people should be compelled to vote if they do not wish to. It is anathema to the freedom of the individual and an obstruction to proper democracy that they should be forced to vote. I think that a voluntary vote for the election of convention delegates would be a good precursor for the introduction of voluntary voting in federal elections. It will show that, even with voluntary voting, Australians will take an interest in our nation's democracy. I note that members of the Labor Party and in particular the Australian Democrats, who would never win a place in parliament if it were not for compulsory voting, do not support voluntary voting. But, in this instance, the vote for delegates need not be compulsory because the constitutional convention will not be the final say on our constitution. It will only make recommendations. I hope those parties do not delay the debate by moving all sorts of ridiculous amendments to make the vote compulsory. Those who are interested in this issue will vote on it; those who do not care or are not interested should not be forced to vote on it. Nevertheless, the final say would be with the Australian population at a referendum for which, of course, voting would still be compulsory. I also welcome the concept of conducting the election via a postal ballot. Recently, in Western Australia, council elections were held and a number of councils had postal ballots for the election of councillors. The end result was an increased participation in the democratic process in those areas which provided postal ballots. Postal ballots are also cheaper to conduct than the traditional ballot box poll. I think it allows electors to choose their preference freely without being attacked by people handing out how-to-vote cards which waste far too much paper anyway. I note that there have been some protests about the nomination fee and the fact that there is not a minimum number of female delegates prescribed. I think a $500 fee is suitable, given the enormity of the task that the delegates are putting their name forward for. To make it cheaper would be to invite the typical mischievous candidate who puts their name forward not because of a commitment to the task ahead but as a cheap publicity stunt. On the matter of representation of women, I oppose any form of quotas. The fact is that there could be more females elected than males. It depends on how many nominate, of course. But if quotas are imposed it again impedes democracy. There should not be quotas for men or women. It should be up to the people to choose who the delegates are. I would hope their decision is based not on the sex of the candidate but on their qualities. My only concern with this convention, which I have made known to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), is the disproportionate representation of the states. I would rather the representation be similar to Senate representation, where the states have an equal footing. As it is, New South Wales has 20 delegates, Victoria 16, Queensland 13, Western Australia nine, South Australia eight, Tasmania six and the territories two each. This convention has enormous implications for the future of our nation and should therefore be seen to be equal and fair in its deliberations. Mr Beddall-Sit down, you boofhead.",41
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,Order! I call the members on my left to order.,43
24,Mr EOIN CAMERON,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I would ask that that remark be withdrawn, Mr Deputy Speaker. My head is large but I am not a boofhead.",43
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,Order! I would ask members to follow the usual decorum and listen to the member in silence. I will listen very carefully to any interjections.,43
26,Mr EOIN CAMERON,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Good-flick 'em out. I fear that providing majority representation to the more populous states will place greater attention on the membership and biases of the major states and ignore the real issue of the future of our nation's constitution. The Senate has equal representation for the protection of the less populous states. This is an issue where the less populous states deserve, and should be provided with, a voice equal to the more populous states. I fear that failure to provide this could compromise the convention. I accept that this will not be changed. I only hope that this does not prohibit the will of the majority of Australians being heard and that the imbalance in state representation does not prohibit the opportunity for our nation to take the course of action the majority of Australians wish for simply because this will be used as a reason to oppose any proposed changes. I also express a little disquiet at the fact that interested parties are organising a ticket. In the best of all possible worlds it would have been nice to see open-minded citizens elected to the convention who had not already locked themselves into one particular position or another. Despite these reservations, I commend the bill to the House.",43
27,Mr BEAZLEY,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"The Labor Party's position on an Australian republic is well known to all in this chamber and to the community generally. At the last election we campaigned on a commitment to achieve an Australian republic by the year 2000. What a magnificent opportunity there is wheri we are displaying ourselves as a nation in the course of what will be a marvellous Olympic Games-and the world will be coming hereto show a vibrant, independent minded, commercially effective Australia with great sporting and cultural achievements, and to have that opportunity launched by an Australian head of state. That was the objective, the symbolism that would be associated with that. As we enter into a new millennium we enter it as a proudly independent nation with our own head of state, our own constitutional arrangements. We have always taken that position in full knowledge that the constitutional arrangements which served Australia at our creation were constitutional arrangements associated with a great democracy, that of the United Kingdom, with great parliamentary traditions, great civil libertarian traditions, and great democratic traditions. We do not spurn them; we relish them, we value them, and we are concerned about threats to some aspects of them that are contained within this bill. But our position on the republic is not a statement of our views about the United Kingdom or about our origins. We are proud of our origins and we are proud of the sources of the democracy that we have here in this country. We are made even prouder when we see magnificent results like that which were seen recently in the United Kingdom with an overwhelming vote for the Labour Party. I congratulate Tony Blair on his victory. Nor is our approach in any shape or form a rejection of the current Queen of Australia. This woman has been a magnificent monarch; there is no question about that. She has, for those of you who have met her, an encyclopaedic knowledge of the affairs of this country and indeed of the whole Commonwealth. We look forward to an Australian republic within that Commonwealth in which she is the head. We have absolutely no problems with that set of arrangements at all, nor any adverse commentary on any aspect of her reign nor any adverse commentary on her involvement with and commitment to Australia. This is not a debate about the royal family, nor is it a debate about Britain; it is about Australia, the sort of nation we are, what we stand for, who most effectively represents us. That is the source of the position we have taken on the creation of an Australian republic. We do not think it is a terribly difficult thing to do, either. One of the most interesting things, if you take that schoolboy debating trait, which people do from time to time, and pick up the Oxford Dictionary you will see in the Oxford Dictionary and that the term 'Commonwealth' is interchangeable with the term 'republic'. A republic is a Commonwealth. What is a Commonwealth?-a republic. You will find that in the Oxford Dictionary. We already have the correct title for the Australian republic. We do not actually need to make any changes as far as that is concerned. P-rhaps we see something of an answer in that Oxford Dictionary to what was reputed to be Queen Victoria's concern and distaste for that when the original Constitution of Australia was framed the delegates at that constitution chose the word 'Commonwealth', which was either in her mind associated with the republic, or with Oliver Cromwell. From her point of view neither were terribly acceptable associations. Nevertheless, our delegates at that time progressed the title of Australia to a republican title but did not progress our constitutional forms to the same position. That is left to us. What it ought to be about-this whole process by which we go about creating that final stage of formal structural independence of the Australian nation-is a vibrant debate in our own community, a discussion on one side as to whether or not this is a constitutional change whose time has not yet come and that they like the old forms and want to be in it-that is a perfectly legitimate position to express and ought to be expressed in the course of a debate in a referendum associated with such constitutional change-and on the other by those in our community who feel proud of where we have got to, believe the constitution can and ought to move on and that they ought to have an opportunity to express their point of view. This debate could be a unifying experience for the Australian community, an experience whereby they set aside their normal partisan commitments, their normal concerns with the political parties-indeed, maybe their hostilities with all forms of politics-and make a statement about themselves as a people and themselves as a nation. Either way, make that statement. That is why it is such a disappointment to find what ought to be an easy progress, via plebiscite and referendum to a final conclusion one way or another on this particular matter, is put like a limpet, if you like, to suck blood from this particular debate. What has been put in place for this constitutional convention has been done in such a way as to raise many questions about itself, as to be reasonably seen as a blocking mechanism by those who would deprive the Australian people of a meaningful debate, who would seek to bore them, who would seek to put in place a set of arrangements which confuses their assessments of what ought to be a fairly simple process--decision yea or nay-on this particular proposition, and to cause them to say, as they so often do, unfortunately, in this country, 'It's just the politicians playing games again.' Let us recollect where this particular convention came from. It did not come from a position inside the Liberal Party which said that this is the best way to go about this process. Indeed, as it has exited the last polls and been contemplated within the halls of government over the course of the last 12 months, I am as aware as anyone else that there has been a deal of backing and filling in this government as to whether or not they ought to proceed with a convention. That is perhaps because this leader of the Liberal Party, the Prime Minister, recognised the political fix that was associated with it for his predecessor as leader of the Liberal Party as he desperately tried to control an issue that was getting out of control inside his ranks at that time-a pretty ignoble and expensive fix, as far as the Australian taxpayer is concerned, and a fix which is worse than simply that and in fact sullies what ought to be an interesting and pure debate, a relationship between us as a parliament and the Australian people. We are not writing on a clean sheet of paper, as the delegates did back in the 1890s. Our founding fathers and mothers, for good or ill, set up a process by which the constituapace tion was changed. The process by which the constitution was changed clearly establishes a direct relationship between parliament and US. the people. That is the process by which ultimately it will have to be changed. This particular proposition merely is interference along the way. So we are entitled to scrutinise this not an essential mechanism for the task at hand. Other mechanisms can be pursued and ultiout mately will have to be pursued by this parliaanarchy. ment in relation to a consultation with the Australian people on their wishes as to whether we ought to become a republic. It is, therefore, an object that can be viewed within the context of what it does to the debate overall and what it does to the quality of Australian politics. The answer to what it does to the quality of Australian politics is: not much good at all. Indeed, potentially, it does a deal of damage. I go to the first issue which was raised by the person who spoke before me, the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), the question of voluntary voting. There is a suggestion here that this voluntary voting issue, in this particular context, in no way foreshadows an ultimate intention by the government. Of course it does. The previous speaker made that amply clear. The previous speaker on the Liberal side said that he was overjoyed by the prospect that there would be voluntary voting associated with this because he believed in that. We all know the consequences of, if you like, voluntary attendance at the poll, because there is not compulsory voting in Australia but compulsory attendance at the poll. You do not have to vote; you attend the poll. But, for shorthand, people talk about voluntary and compulsory voting. All you have to do, in looking at the consequences of voluntary voting associated with this and encouraging that attitude to develop in the community, is consider the unrepresentative nature of American politics, as it has now become, whereby the President of the United States effectively emerges with a mandate of about 15 to 20 per cent of the American people. If you think that the discrediting of politics has proceeded over the last few years or so in Australia and that a large percentage of Australians have turned off the political process, try the When you look at the citizen militias operating around the United States now, the fact that they feel totally disconnected from politics, that the political representatives do as not represent the totality of the people of the nation, means that they feel that they can opt of the nation in some sort of confederated Their followers in this country, of course, describe themselves as the Confederate Action Party. That is not because they are overjoyed at General Robert E. Lee and the folks who tried to revolt against the United States back in 1860; it is a description of the nature of the internal political process that they seek, essentially the dissolution of the nation. So the voluntary voting aspect of this is a bad precedent. The process by which it is taking place offends me even more-it may not necessarily offend all my party even more than the voluntary process, but it offends me even more than the voluntary process-and that is the postal ballot that is associated with this. There is one thing on which everybody in this chamber-Liberal, National Party, Independent and Labor--can stand proud in the international sphere, and that is on the fact that we in this country have come to epitomise corruption-free politics in the balloting process. The secret ballot is known globally as 'the Australian ballot'. It is the Australian ballot that has come to mark the peculiar contribution of the Australian nation to the democratic process internationally. That reputation has stood us in enormous good stead over time. Our politicians, our electoral officials and our public servants are eagerly sought internationally when a country becomes a democracy, as many have over the last 20 years or so. Our advice is eagerly sought, our participation is eagerly sought and our witness to the political process is eagerly sought. Why? Because back there at the turn of this century we defined the nature of the Australian people and the Australian nation by the corruptionfree aspect of that ballot. What is going to happen with this is several-fold difficulties. The first problem involved here is that up to three million Australians may well not receive a ballot paper because they will have shifted address since the last election. The second feature is that the material on the ballot will be available in writing and only in English. Unlike the polling booth process, whereby you can get assistance to vote, this is going to disenfranchise the blind, the frail or aged, the illiterate or people whose English skills are not of sufficiently high standard to be able to read what is going to be an inordinately complex ballot paper when it finally hits the table. There will be hundreds of candidates, extraordinarily difficult directions and an extraordinarily convoluted process which they have to follow to fill it out, covering material, including their date of birth, and all the rest of it. A whole series of difficult processes will have to be gone through to cast a formal ballot. Instead of the ease of assistance at the polling booth, you are going to get confusion, fear and worry as this lands on the kitchen table of the average Australian citizen as this ballot proceeds. Add to that the lack of secrecy. People are going to seek legitimate assistance; others are going to attempt to interfere. There will always be the need for legitimate assistance for that ballot paper to be properly concluded. Instead of a polling booth in which people's votes are cast in secret, we are going to have a kitchen table vote to which your neighbours can be witness, to which your friends can be witness, to which your enemies, if they can put enough pressure on you, can be witness. The whole point of the secret ballot process was to take that pressure out of politics, that corruption out of politics. This postal ballot puts it right back in. The fact that that great Australian tradition of the secret ballot has been so vehemently compromised by this process is an absolute tragedy in this process. Again, instead of having that vote cast in about five minutes flat when you are in the polling booth, these ballot papers are going to be lying about on people's tables for something like six weeks. This is going to compound the problems that are going to emerge with the difficulties that will be experienced from people having changed their address, the fact that large numbers are not enrolled and the fact that 200,000 people overseas will be effectively disenfranchised by this process but would not have been by another process. The time between close of nominations and close of rolls is going to be one week. So a whole lot of youngsters in Australia are going to be cut out of an opportunity to cast a ballot in this process. Even when they express a view, it is a minority who will return ballot papers. Sadly, we do have this sort of process associated with the voluntary ballot in Western Australia in local government. One could say perhaps that at that level of government you can live with it. At the local government level you get about a 20 to 30 per cent return. What you are going to get from this process is its discrediting. Whatever the outcome is from this particular process, it will be capable of being discredited. People will be able to say, 'It did not represent majority opinion' or 'It was flawed because large numbers of ballot papers were not returned' or 'It was flawed because we have got evidence that Aunt Maude turned up the day we all cast the vote, put the weights on us and-for fear of loss of our inheritance-we were in trouble if we did not cast our vote a particular way,' and so on. As well as that discrediting process, you are going to get the discrediting process that is associated with the fact that people will not be able to get themselves into a position to vote. There is another problem associated with this legislation, and that goes to the way that parliamentary delegates are drawn. The effort here is not to create partisan advantage-that has been the position on both sides of this - hamber for some considerable period, includmg when we were in government-but to create an opportunity for the whole nation to express itself. Yet the parliamentary representation is a parliamentary advantage for government, at both levels of operation. We have had constitutional conventions - efore when it has been a fifty-fifty propositIOn. That has been done with the Liberal Party in government and it has been done with us in government. When Mr Keating talke- about using a parliamentary committee for this process, he did not take advantage of the fact that we happened to be in government-and anticipated staying there-to say that there would be a majority in favour of the Labor Party. What he said was that it would. be even Steven on that parliamentary committee. '!ou cannot help feeling that an effort is being made here to further rig and discredit t-e pro.c-ss-on top of all the rigging and dlscredltmg that goes on in association with the way in which the ballot will be conducted-that there is a rigging going on here t- pr?duce an outcome in one particular duectIOn. Those on the other side of the House who oppose the notion of going to a republic-there are many who support the notion-are going around the corridors and talking to each other. They are saying to worried National Party members and worried monarchists from other parts of their organisations, 'Don't worry, boys, we have really got this one discredited if we need to have it discredited. We are not going to have majority votes. We are in there stacking it for all we are worth in the way in which we are going to have the partisan appointments from parliamentarians to it. We are going to get Into a situation where it will be such a muddle by the end of the day that we will be able to say that the whole republican process is compromised and flawed. Let's leave it and think about it a century or so from now. Let's not worry about it proceeding.' We on this side of the House do not want this process at all. If we are going to have this process, we do not want a flawed variant of this process such as the one we have before us at the moment. We want the Australian people to have a vote on the issue itself-not for the beauty parade that will be placed before them by a whole lot of eccen-ric opinions as well as valid opinions, which IS what we are going to get over the next couple of months, with the extremists and the zealots looking upon this as an opportunity to do this country some damage. We do not want that; we want the people to be able to express their views-pure and simple. We have an amendment that might help that process. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""w-lst not declining to give the Bill a second readmg, recognising that if it is to have the necessary standing and authority, the Constitutional Convention should be based on the most fair and straightforward electoral arrangements practicable, the House: (l) is of the view that the Government has exaggerated the cost differential between a postal ballot and a normal attendance ballot and considers that the elections should be made by means of a normal attendance ballot; (2) considers that the voting method proposed by the Government will (a) cause unnecessary confusion, and both of which will distort the results of the vote; (b) deprive many Australians of their right to vote. (3) is of the view that the proposed period of 1 week from the issuing of the notice of the election and the closing of the roll is undemocratic and will deny many Australians of participation in the process; (4) considers that the Government proposals for the nomination of persons to the convention are undemocratic and will allow the Coalition and its allies to have a disproportionate influence on the process; and (5) is of the opinion that a Joint Select Committee should be appointed to nominate community representatives, to advise on the processes and procedures for the Convention and to advise on the appointment of an independent Chair for the Convention"". Carry this amendment and there is a chance that this convention will not be sullied. There is a chance that this convention will actually advance community debate in this country in a way that makes Australians proud to be Australians. Reject these amendments and you will have a sullied process. It will be a disappointment to those who are republicans but, for those of us who are democrats, it will be a tragedy. (Time expired)",43
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,Order! Is the motion seconded? Mr MCMullan-1 second the motion.,48
29,Mr GEORGIOU,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"The convention for which the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill legislates is a vital part of a process for coming to a conclusion about whether or not Australia should become a republic and, if so, what sort of republic and when. It meets absolutely the commitments made by the coalition to the Australian people before the 1996 election. The path that led to this bill was shaped by the push and pull of political forces-there is no escaping that. But the process which has emerged has substantially transcended partisan politics and gives the Australian people a real chance to get the constitution they want. When Paul Keating mounted his campaign to achieve a republic he unleashed forces that did outlive his prime ministership. I think that, in the repUblic, Mr Keating found an issue in which he deeply believed and one which he thought would divide and damage the coalition. I cannot say whether he recognised fully that if his tactics succeeded they also risked dividing the nation. However, the coalition has progressively built an effective consensus on the politics and on the substance of the issue, which is based on our commitment to giving the Australian people the constitution that they want. This is a tribute to a succession of coalition leaders. John Hewson, despite the fragility of his leadership following the 1993 election loss, overcame what must have been a strong impulse to simply deny that there was even any need to discuss the issue and declared that the coalition would engage in the debate and would consider whether or not there was a compelling case for becoming a republic. Alexander Downer took the process a step further by proposing a people's centennial convention, the composition of which was essentially the same as the one proposed in this bill, to which a coalition government would refer a broad range of matters for consideration and put to a referendum significant recommendations approved by a broad consensus of the convention. John Howard confirmed this as Leader of the Opposition and finaJly blunted the divisiveness and partisanship of the Keating approach. Despite the fact that he is, by his own description, 'certainly not Australia's leading republican', and his quite accurate perception that there are and were more pressing matters facing Australia than the debate, he made the opposition's final commitment: If a consensus emerges from the people's convention regarding the head of state, that consensus will be promoted by the government at a constitutional referendum. If no consensus emerges, then the Australian people will be asked to vote on a series of options for change to establish which one of them they desire. These options for change will include that of electing the president by direct popular vote as well as by a parliamentary vote as proposed by the Prime Minister ... Naturally, the option of retaining the present system would be included in any vote. Taken together, these commitments provided security that the convention was not an attempt to bury the issue and guaranteed that, at the end of the day, the Australian people would be the ones who decided who their head of state would be. Getting things off the partisan agenda is one thing: delivering on promises is another. The Prime Minister and the government have delivered on their promises, despite media speculation that they would not do so and despite the imperative urgings of the opposition that the government break its commitment and go immediately to a plebiscite. Those urgings, I am interested to note, have been continued in this debate. While I am totally committed to a compulsory voting system for federal elections, I do believe that voluntary postal voting for the election of delegates to the convention is acceptable and sensible both because of cost and because the convention will debate and recommend rather than decide the issue of constitutional change. There is this funny thing called the postal vote that goes around in federal elections, which we certainly do not think is constantly being rorted! The decision on what comes out of the process will be decided by the people of Australia in a referendum at which voting will be compulsory. The government's commitments and its adherence to them have maximised the possibility of this nation coming to a rational and effective long-term solution to the issue of head of state. Despite tive and symbolic significance of the republican issue, it is not now a partisan issue amongst the public. The last public survey I saw indicated that it was one of the lowest factors motivating the vote one way or the other. The low intensity register reflects the fact that Australians, despite their different beliefs and predispositions about the best way to go on constitutional change, believe that the processes that have been put in place will allow the issue to be appropriately and sensibly resolved without becoming a focus for politically partisan division. Equally, anyone who does not know that low intensity issues can quickly heat up if they are mishandled is not about to win a Nobel Prize for political acumen. There should be no doubt about the potential divisiveness of this issue: it is significant. This is why I believe that the people's convention-a convention which will in part emerge from the direct election of delegatesis important and why arguments for abandoning it and going directly to an indicative plebiscite do not serve the cause of a rational debate or a sustainable outcome. I do not say this on the basis of any belief in the inevitability of the convention coming to a consensus. A consensus may be too much to hope for given that there will be strong and organised republican and monarchist factions and that achieving a consensus requires arriving at a general agreement, which is more demanding than getting mere majority support. The prospect of a lack of consensus has been anticipated. There are fail-safe mechanisms in the form of the government's commitment to an indicative plebiscite and, ultimately, there is the commitment to a referendum. Above all, the responsibilities of the convention are to expose the issues fully and frankly. The real benefits of the convention, short of its achieving consensus, are to focus the attention of the Australian people, to expose the issues, to explore the consequences on the operation of our political life of taking different courses of action and to deal with what our political system should look like in the substan- the 21st century. I do not believe that these issues will be dealt with appropriately nor that the convention will meet its obligations if it reduces the debate to a polarised and unreflective retracing of fixed positions. Both monarchists and republicans should review the set positions they have taken up and address straightforwardly the apparent predispositions of the Australian people. I want to focus briefly on some aspects of these tasks. The first relates to the fact that the monarchists cannot overly rest on inertia as a decisive argument for their position. It is common ground that the present constitutional system has served us well since Federation. The real issue is whether this system will be acceptable to Australians imd serve Australia as well in the next century. The old saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' does have a certain ring, but its attraction should not be regarded as overwhelming. Constitutional mechanisms do have their limits. Their bearings can wear out. Structures which worked well in the past may not work well in the future. A consensual recognition of a status quo's past success needs to be matched by a degree of foresight and vision about what Australia may need in the future. Past success is not a guarantee of future effective functioning, and this is certainly the case where one of the key elements that has allowed our system to work so well is the character and commitment of an individual. Queen Elizabeth II has been an essential part of the Australian constitutional mechanism. She has served that constitution superbly. The Australian federation has existed for 96 years. For 45 of those years, Queen Elizabeth II has been our monarch. She has bridged the period in which the British empire, of which Australia was once so proud a part, has been dissolved. She has been the only monarch that an overwhelming majority of the Australian people-80 per cent, on my estimate-have ever known. The Queen has been an intrinsic and much admired part of our nation, even in times of intense constitutional conflict. Indeed, although my recollections are a bit fuzzy, I recollect Gough Whitlam saying, in his moment of maximum distress at being dismissed by the Governor General, 'The Queen would never have done it.' Will the constitutional mechanism still bind as effectively, in the absence of the individual who has for so long and for so many Australians been the embodiment of the monarchy? Certainly, many Australians who are committed to the system have indicated that a key reason for their support of the constitutional monarchy is their personal attachment to Queen Elizabeth II and that, without her, they would consider republicanism. The convention, and particularly the monarchist component of it, must address this in an intelligent and dispassionate way. They cannot push the issue aside by saying it can be addressed later. To do this would run a substantial risk that the system would be put under stress when the time for a succession does come, as inevitably it will. The republicans, for their part, have to abandon the pretence that there would be no change to the system if we were to move to a head of state elected by two-thirds of parliament. The minimalist republic is a total myth. The Australian Republican Movement and the Republic Advisory Committee have taken the position that a change from a constitutional monarchy with an appointed Governor General to a republic with a president elected by the federal parliament and possessing the powers currently held by the Governor General-powers which the RAC believes would not have to be codified-would not have a real impact on the political system. The impact would be substantial. Governors-General are appointed by the monarch on the advice of a single individual, the Prime Minister of the day. They are unsupported by any direct democratic mandate or parliamentary electoral mandate. Despite this, the reserve powers of the office, those exercised by the Governor General-not on the advice of government but at the personal discretion of the Governor General-are formidable. These powers are part of the background against which we play our politics and they profoundly affect the politics of the nation. Governors-General can, in some circumstances, choose the Prime Minister and they have, on occasion, selected leaders of the minority party. They can dismiss governments on grounds of breaching the constitution. They can refuse to accept the government's advice that the parliament be dissolved. A Governor General can dismiss a Prime Minister who cannot secure supply: that has been proved beyond doubt. The republicans' proposals would create a presidency combining the powers of the Governor General with an unprecedented degree of parliamentary legitimacy and national authority. Elected by two-thirds of the federal parliament, the president would have greater parliamentary endorsement than the Prime Minister, who need only command support of a majority of the House of Representatives. Only four Prime Ministers in Australia's history have achieved a two-thirds majority in the parliament and no Prime Minister has had such support since the system of Senate voting was changed in 1949. This president would personify Australia. He or she would, to use Mr Keating's words 'embody and represent Australia's values and traditions, Australia's experience and aspirations'. It should be self-evident that the creation of a president with such powers, such parliamentary endorsement and such national authority would substantially change the operation of our political system. The president's views would, of course, find public expression. A new authority and a new influence would be created. This would impact on Australian politics and public policy in new ways. There would be frictions, uncertainties and new accommodations that, over time, would change our system of government. This conclusion is reinforced when we consider the experience of other parliamentary republics, which-the Republic Advisory Committee asserted--confirms the 'feasibility' of a change to an Australian president without significantly altering our political life. The international experience essentially does two things: first, it confirms that republics can deliver good, effective government; second, it confirms that the Republic Advisory Committee's assertions are invalid. I do not have time to go through a detailed analysis of the cases, but the bottom line is that international evidence simply does not support the RAC's assertion that we can have a president, with all the powers accruing to a Governor General, selected by a two-thirds majority of the parliament and leave our system unaltered. Finally, I believe that both republicans and monarchists must address the view registered by the overwhelming majority of Australians-that, if there is to be a republic, the Australian people want to be the ones who directly elect the president. The direct election of a president is the overwhelming preference of the Australian people. It is supported by over 70 per cent of Australians in all states; over 70 per cent of Australians in both city and country; over 70 per cent of Liberal, Labor and minority party voters; over 70 per cent of Australian men; and over 70 per cent of Australian women. I believe that there might be some cynicism amongst the Australian people if monarchists and republicans, whilst being unable to agree on a preferred system, reached a form of negative consensus on this issue. But th;s cynicism would not really be the issue h . cause, if the convention does not come to a consensus on its preferred alternative, the government is committed to a plebiscite which asks the Australian people to 'vote on a series of options for the changes to establish which of them they desire. These options for change will include that of electing a president by direct popular vote . . . ' It is clear that an elected president would change our political system profoundly. It is incumbent on the convention to fully draw out the changes to our political system that such a direct election of a president would bring. If the convention agrees that this is not the way to go, then it will have to put a significant effort into communicating to the Australian people the reason for its views on a directly elected president and convince them that this path should not be pursued. I do not believe that the convention can simply brush these views aside if it does not come to a consensus on the position of a head of state. I believe that the Australian constitution is uniquely the property of the Australian people. Dealing with it is quite different from the normal run of politics in which. essentially, the people delegate powers and elect politicians to discharge their will, and, if they do not like it, they can sanction them at the forthcoming election. Ultimately, the Australian constitution belongs to the Australian people. Only they can and should decide what constitution we should have. I believe that the most effective role for the politicians in this fundamental matter should be to draw out the consequences of change for the Australian people and for the future of Australian politics rather than to seek to impose their own prejudices, preferences and conveniences on the convention process. The attacks made by the opposition on the convention process-and they have been fairly sustained-do not have any legs. I reiterate that postal voting is not anathema to the secret ballot: indeed, it is part of our secret ballot. The fact of a convention rather than a plebiscite should focus attention on, and should provide the basis for, a rational and reasonable outcome. The fact is that Australia now has an opportunity to deal with the issue of a head of state in a thoughtful and deliberate way. we do not grasp this opportunity, the likelithe hood is that at some future point we will find ourselves in a position where fundamental structural decisions affecting the Australian polity are driven by political momentum, stress and passion. I believe that that would minimise the chance of achieving outcomes which we both intend and desire. The convenfirst, tion will make a significant contribution to this outcome. I commend the bill to the House.",48
30,Mr ANDREN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"As an Independent, I would have to say that it a great shame that this debate on the Constithat tutional Convention (Election) Bill has come so politicised over the past decade, results. since the push for Australia to become republic by the centenary of our Federation first gathered steam. It became politicised being designed. largely because members of the conservative side of politics in this country found themselves being left behind as the ALP, particularly Paul Keating, championed the cause for Australia having its own head of state. While it is fair to say that it is an issue has not galvanised the general electorateward most of us are more concerned about what consider to be more important day-today issues-it is fair to say that it is an issue significant importance to a large body Australians. So significant is it that, in time, the Liberal and National parties found theminterested selves having to play catch-up They realised that this was not an issue that was going to go away and they had to have some sort of credible alternative proposalwith alternative, that is, to Mr Keating's plan simply let the people of Australia have their say in an indicative plebiscite. What was wrong with that? So Mr Downer, the then opposition leader, put up this idea of holding a constitutional convention. It is a policy the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) inherited, and to his credit he has kept his election promise and we will proceed with the convention. While we have seen the government break quite a few pre-election commitments, it is a real pity, in some respects, that it has honIf oured this one because I am quite sure that Labor Party's proposal to hold an indicative plebiscite first would have been a preferable way of handling this issue. That way any convention would at least have had a clear-cut idea of what the people of Australia wanted in general terms. However, I accept that now we are stuck with holding the convention thus putting the cart before the horse. Now that we have it, it should be our priority to ensure we make it work and work fairly. Let us not create a confrontation. There are legitimate arguments out there on both sides of the republican and monarchist is causes. We should be facilitating a convention is transparently fair in its make-up and bedoes not disguise an attempt to distort the I fear there are elements of that in the a way this convention-what at the moment appears to be a Clayton's convention-is In the interests of promoting the consensus approach I believe is needed as we come together to discuss the constitutional future of this country heading into the next millennium, I support this bill's idea but certainly not its that substance. Amendments have been put forcalling for the vote to be made compulwe sory. I endorse those. Compulsory voting is an honoured tradition in our democracy. It is of important because it ensures all Australians of have a say on who they want to govern and the task is not just left up to those who are or do not have anything better to do with the ALP. on polling day. I know there are some on the conservative side of politics who would love to do away compulsory voting because they think it to favours the ALP. The same sort of thinking would reject preferential voting in order to squeeze out independence. No doubt some are looking forward to this non-compulsory election for the convention as a bit of a trial run, if you like, to see how it goes and to serve their narrow non-democratic cause. That is why this non-compulsory vote is morally wrong. This constitutional convention is every bit as important, if not more important, than a general election. Our political forefathers thought compulsory voting was important enough to have it safeguarded in the constitution. Now the government want to tamper with that and bring it in the back door without a referendum. As I said, compulsory voting is one of the basic tenets of our unique Australian democracy. It is one of the things that sets our democracy apart from some of the other great democracies around the world. The government's plan to make this a noncompulsory vote is heading into very dangerous waters. What if next time around we are having a poll to decide the nation's future the government of the day says, 'Let's ignore the constitution. Let's not have women or Aboriginals vote.' I know it sounds ridiculous, but in effect that is what this bill is doing. It is playing around with, or at least challenging, one of basic rules that this democracy has lived by for almost a century. It will be a sad day for Australia if this bill is passed as it stands without the opposition's amendments making voting compulsory. If sections of the Liberal Party really are determined to eventually abolish compulsory voting, then it should have the gumption to put it to the people in a referendum, let them have their say and not try to introduce it through this trial process, this testing of the waters. Here we are about to stage a multimillion dollar convention to decide whether to change one aspect of our constitution, while on the other hand another part of the constitution is being dishonoured and thrown out the window. I realise it would cost considerably more to make voting compulsory for this convention, as opposed to an expected cost of $36 million for a full election which, by the way, could have included an indicative plebiscite to give the convention delegates a real starting point. It would cost about $50m according to estimates to stage it as a full general election or as a full poll of everyone in the electorate. What price democracy? What price our future? When we are already investing so much to stage it, is it not worth spending just that little bit more to ensure it is done properly? As the saying goes, a job worth doing is worth doing well. If we do not, we face the real danger of the process being rorted. Already the republicans and monarchists are mustering their forces to ensure they can get as many people as possible to vote for their respective candidates. Looking at how politics works in the US, the side that can get around to as many nursing homes and retirement villages as possible and get pensioners to sign away their votes will win at the end of day. Non-compulsory voting in the US has led to marginalisation of unrepresented ordinary folk, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) alluded to in his speech on this bill. Extremism is being cultured by that process and, at $600,000 per congress seat, the US now has the best democracy money can buy. Do we want to head down that path? The real danger is particularly that young people who are not as politically aware and are generally apathetic toward politics will not have their say through this process. That is a great shame because it is their future we are talking about. At the end of day, it will be a real challenge for the republicans and monarchists to stage campaigns that will motivate as many people as possible to cast their votes for their respective sides. I think the noncompulsory vote will favour the monarchists, as it would the coalition in a general election. Yet the polls, as in the euthanasia debate, show a different story. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may have already seen on Monday of this week the Monarchist League announced its New South Wales team of candidates for the convention. There are six candidates headed by Brigadier Alf Garland, all very well respected and very experienced people and very committed to their cause, most of them over 50 and not a young person or someone from an ethnic background in sight-a ticket that really does not typify a multicultural Australia of the late 1990s but perhaps has more in common with Australia when the Queen first visited here in 1954. If that is the sort of representative ticket we are going to see in this election, then I would be very surprised if Australia's youth are motivated firstly to enrol and then to vote for such unrepresentative candidates. I was rather dismayed to note that one of monarchist candidates was reported as saying this campaign was 'even more serious than the fight against Hitler in World War II.' I am not an ardent republican by any means. I think we have far greater problems confronting us in this country, but I would hope that this comment is not indicative of the standard of debate we are about to experience over the coming months. I have already touched upon the great history of democracy in Australia and we really are fortunate to live in one of the world's most stable and free nations. But, while our British heritage has contributed to that stability, it has been established and safeguarded by the people of this great continent and their respect for common sense and a fair go. We do not need to wage scare campaigns to discuss this issue. What we do need is sensible, intelligent and constructive debate, much like we saw at the federation conventions of a century ago. I am pleased to say that one such convention took place in my own electorate. The Bathurst people's convention in 1896 was credited with getting the federation debate back on the boil. There are some remarkable similarities surrounding the federation debate of that time and the current republican push today. The People's Federal Convention was organised by the people of Bathurst frustrated that the push toward federation appeared to be on the backburner. Until that time, the federation debate had been dominated by politicians, particularly the father of federation, Sir Henry Parkes. Sir Henry died that year and the movement suffered because of the loss of a powerful and eloquent champion. While many state colonies supported federation, Queensland-funnily enough-remained a major stumbling block. Many in the general population were strongly opposed to federation, believing the time was 'inopportune'. Others were ambivalent and more preoccupied with more pressing problems of the day, such as bank collapses and drought. Today it is drought, bank profits and lack of bank services perhaps. The people of Bathurst were determined to get federation back on track and so organised their own people's convention, inviting representatives from all over Australia. Their sole aim was to educate the people on this important question. They insisted it was to be a people's convention based on the people's will, appealing to our sentiment, patriotism and intellect. The editorial of the Bathurst Times on the opening day of the convention wrote: Men of all shades of political thought are united in the one object of endeavouring, by giving expression of intelligent opinion to inform and educate the public mind upon a question, which, up to the present has received but scant consideration. The Sydney Morning Herald recognised the significance of the Bathurst people's convention, saying: Once we get the towns of the colonies to make an enthusiastic move in the matter, it will not be long before the sheer weight of public opinion will make Federation a realisable matter. That convention succeeded in its goal of taking the federation debate to the people. It resulted in federal legal organisations being formed throughout Australia and was a major catalyst in Australia finally becoming federated in 1901. One of the more interesting debates during the convention surrounded the question of how Australia's Governors-General should be appointed. Mr John Norton of Sydney put the cat among the pigeons when he suggested the Governor General should be voted on by members of parliament instead of being appointed by an absentee monarch. He argued that people in Australia should have the power to elect their own head of state. He said: Surely there were at least a score of public men in Australia, who by their long and arduous service, their experience, culture and training were qualified to occupy the highest position that it was possible to confer upon them. Mr Norton said he did not believe there would be the slightest difficulty in obtaining Her Majesty's assent to a bill giving the people of Australia power to elect their own chief ruler. He said: There would be sufficient ingenuity in the Federal Parliament when elected to provide those constitutional safeguards that would guarantee the selection would be a wise one. Mr Norton felt the appointment of a Governor General by the Queen would not be democratic, but others argued his motion calling for a parliamentary vote for the Governor General was 'disloyal to the motherland'. He was accused of 'inserting the thin edge of republicanism and trying to drive it home'. The convention was taking place just after the US presidential election of that year, and many argued Australia did not want to head down the same path as the USA. They said the US President had too much power and the campaign had disrupted business in the US for four months. 'We're far better to have a monarch who reigns but does not govern,' was the argument that won the day, with the Bathurst convention ending with three cheers for the Queen. Here we are again, 100 years later and about to begin another great debate about what role, if any, the English monarch should play in our governance and how our head of state should be elected. I would suggest that Australia's step towards having its own head of state at the beginning of the 21 st century is not nearly as difficult as the great step the colonies took back in 1901 or prior to that. Should we choose to debate the entire constitution-the role of local government, the duplication the states represent to sound administration and so on-then it would indeed challenge the debates of the 1890s for its complexity. But if the convention focuses on the head of state alone, its task will be far easier than that which faced the architects of Federation-but, I would suggest, far shallower in reform than the situation demands. I think we can learn from our forebears and the way they tackled the issue and worked towards a common goal that has benefited so many future generations. That is why it is so important for us to get this right and to ensure all Australians have their say. For that reason, I will be supporting the opposition amendments. As the member for Banks (Mr Melham) and other opposition speakers have already said, the way the proposed government appointments are weighted under this bill will ensure there are 25 delegates from the coalition, 13 from the Labor Party and two from the minor parties and the Independents. As much as I would love to be a part of the process, I realise that I represent only a tiny fraction of the national electorate, but I do question the way in which the Independents will be chosen. I happen to believe that I, and perhaps one or two other Independents in this parliament in either House, am a true Independent, yet my name goes into the hat with a group of people for whom I have varying degrees of respect, but I certainlyMr Ronaldson-Name them. Mr Tanner-Name them.",52
31,Mr ANDREN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,I certainly do not have any feeling that I am aligned in any way to any of those people. So how democratic is that procedure? Mr Tanner-It is just the same in the Labor Party.,55
32,Mr ANDREN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I cannot quite hear the interjections, but I am sure they are very amusing. To any independent objective person, this is grossly unfair and breaches precedents established in the most recent constitutional convention established in 1973. You could even suggest that, because of the way these appointments are weighted, the government could almost predict the outcome of the convention. You might think that is an outrageous suggestion, but I regret to tell you that is exactly the sort of suggestion put to a public meeting in my electorate last year. The member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) was guest speaker at this public meeting of local monarchist supporters in Bathurst. A senior staff member of mine was present at the meeting and recorded the member for W arringah' s comments. At that stage, the member for Warringah told the meeting the government was planning not to allow any delegates to be elected to the convention but instead would have them all appointed by state premiers. This comment concerned one ardent monarchist in the audience who felt such a proposal may favour the republican cause, given the New South Wales Premier Bob Carr was a well-known republican, as was the state opposition leader. The member for Warringah assured the audience the convention would 'go the right way' from the monarchists' point of view. He pointed out that Bob Carr was the odd Premier out and that the majority of state premiers were conservative and sympathetic to the monarchy, so the delegates they appointed could be expected to be the same. As far as I am concerned, that incident is now history and the proposal the member for Warringah was commenting on at that time is not exactly what we see today. But we do not want to see a constitutional convention that can be accused of 'going the right way' from the monarchists' or any other point of view. This gathering of delegates must be seen to be transparently open and fair. It is not fair for it to be slightly or otherwise weighted towards people from Liberal and National Party backgrounds--or the other way-just because they happen to be in political favour at this point in our history. We can almost judge how they will vote at the convention, judging by some of the comments we have listened to over the past few days. I find it hard to accept the remarks of the member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall), for example, when he says that the Governor General and not the Queen is our head of state. Have a read of the constitution. Take a coin out of your pocket and see whose face is on it. Let us keep that debate for the convention-a convention with equal representation of views, with equal opportunity for all Australians to take part-not taking part by just sitting down and filling out a ballot and mailing it, but by stepping forth on polling day, because this vote is as vital as any other the people of this nation will ever take. The republic deserves to be debated, discussed and voted on in a fair, open and honest manner. For that reason, I will be supporting the amendments moved by the Leader of the Opposition.",55
33,Mr SLIPPER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I wish to support the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill and oppose the amendments moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). I must say that it is unfortunate that the Labor Party and others have continued to politicise this debate. The aim of the coalition, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, is to give the people of Australia the form of government they want, rather than seek to impose a form of government that we want. That is in contrast to the Prime Minister's predecessor-the politically late, unlamented Mr KEATING - who was determined t? impose on the people of Australia a republIcan form of government, ignoring totally the fact that our existing system has delivered to us freedom, stability and a way of life that is the envy of people throughout the world. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) pointed out that the current Prime Minister is clearly not Australia's most enthusiastic republican, but what he has sought to do is deliver on a core election promise. He has sought to facilitate consultation with all sections of the Australian community, and thus we find ourselves debating the bill currently before the House. I think it is eminently regrettable that those opposite have not picked up the challenge of the depoliticisation of this debate which is necessary if we are going to have any rational debate on our constitutional future. Ardent republicans-as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis-were well aware that the greatest enemy of any change to Australia's constitutional structure was the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating. The way in which he turned this into a party political issue basically meant that people would vote on party political lines. This Prime Minister intends to consult the Australian people. He has brought forward a system which will ensure that the constitutional convention later this year is able to focus on Australia's constitutional future, particularly as we approach the end of the decade. I do want to point out, however, that I believe the honourable member for Cal are (Mr Andren) was quite wrong when he suggested that, by looking at the way the appointed delegates will be chosen, one could predict the outcome of the constitutional convention. The Liberal Party, the National Party and indeed the Labor Party are all parties which have people who are monarchists, people who are republicans and people who are ambivalent. I believe it is insulting the intelligence of Liberal and National Party premiers and other persons elected to parliamentary office to assume automatically that, because one is a Liberal, a National or a Labor Party person, one will adopt a particular course of action at the convention. Mr Tanner interjecting",56
34,Mr SLIPPER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I think it is unfortunate that the honourable member for Melbourne does not join the government's attempt to depoliticise this issue. It is a pity that he is using this place to campaign for an Australian republic. This debate is not about whether we should remain a constitutional monarchy or whether we should become a republic. This debate is all about facilitating discussion. It is all about talking with the Australian people. It is all about getting this matter out of the realm of politics and into the realm of the Australian people. Of course, the Australian people own our constitutional future not the politicians. The honourable member for Calare also suggested that, in having a voluntary postal vote, we were in some way breaching the constitution. Voluntary voting was used in Australia federally until about 1923 and it is not a matter of constitutional requirement that we should have either voluntary or compulsory voting. So what he had to say with respect to that is simply not relevant. Other people have suggested that the voluntary postal ballot will be the thin edge of the wedge, that in fact this is a precedent and that the government is trialling voluntary voting at this constitutional convention with an aim to introducing voluntary voting generally. I want to put my cards on the table. I am in favour of voluntary voting at national elections but no way in the world could the voluntary postal vote provided for in this bill be deemed to be a precedent. Even those of us who suggest that Australia should have voluntary voting would never claim that we should have a voluntary postal ballot. The reason we are having a voluntary postal ballot has been made perfectly clear and it really ought to be pointed out once again. We inherited a $10 billion black hole when the now Leader of the Opposition left office as Minister for Finance and Deputy Prime Minister. We will save $15 million to $20 million by having a postal ballot and I believe that is eminently the right way to go. Mr Tanner interjecting",57
35,Mr SLIPPER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"And the honourable member for Melbourne ought to sit down and listen to what I am saying. What he ought to do is to encourage those opposite to support the government's bill and to withdraw the amendments currently before the chamber. Postal ballots have been used successfully by the Australian Electoral Commission on a number of elections. They have been used successfully in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania by those states' electoral commissions. The bill currently before the chamber has been looked at by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee to make sure that the electoral system that we are bringing in through this bill is properly considered. We are going to be very careful to ensure that we do not allow any opportunity for fraud. The Australian Electoral Commission is well regarded right throughout the world as being a very reputable body. The Australian Electoral Commission will guarantee that the postal vote has security, transparency and integrity. I would like to outline some things that will be included. The AEC will put in place mechanisms to detect any attempts to vote more than once or to vote in the name of another person. This includes pre-printing every returned envelope with the elector's name and address and a unique bar code. Before the votes can be counted, voters will be required to sign declarations that they have voted only once and they will be required to include their date of birth on the declaration. This will be checked and, if there is any uncertainty, the returning officer must be satisfied that the declaration was signed by the elector. Where an elector claims not to have received ballot material, replacement ballots will be provided to ensure that the elector does not vote twice. Where both ballot papers are received, the returning officer will count only one vote. People say, 'Why are we having a voluntary vote with respect to the constitutional convention?' It should be noted that the convention itself does not have any decision making powers. The convention itself is not going to determine whether Australia remains a constitutional monarchy or becomes a republic. What the convention is about is consulting the Australian people and any recommendations or any consensus that might emerge from the convention will indeed have to be endorsed by both the parliament and by the Australian people at a referendum in a compulsory vote. The fact that the Leader of the Opposition comes in here and criticises the voluntary vote and the fact that the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) does likewise are just spurious attempts to politicise this entire process. The government, through the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Senator Minchin), has looked at our promise and has sought to facilitate discussion and consultation of the Australian people. It really is appropriate at this point in time to place record publicly my congratulations to Senator Minchin for the job of consultation and for the job that he has done. He has brought forward this proposal which I believe is widely accepted by the Australian people. I also believe that, given the fact that we are electing people to a convention and not to parliament, it would be entirely unreasonable to consider prosecuting those who choose not to vote or indeed sending them to gaol, as has happened with respect to some who have chosen not to vote at parliamentary elections. The other thing that ought to be noted is that, even in voluntary elections in many parts of the world, the tum out in many cases is quite similar to that at compulsory votes. This is not electing a parliament. This is electing a constitutional convention to consider the question of whether Australia remains a constitutional monarchy or becomes a republic and once that process of consideration has taken place, obviously there would be a vote in the parliament and a vote of the Australian people. I think it is really ironic that those opposite-having nearly killed off the republic through the former Prime Minister Mr Keating-are now coming in here and endeavouring, once again, to politicise this entire process. They simply cannot help themselves. They simply find themselves unable to participate in a bipartisan way, which this government is seeking to do in this place as a government. We have people who are monarchists; we have people who are republicans; and we have people who really are prepared to listen to the debate. What we are trying to do is to facilitate a process. We are delivering on an election promise and those opposite continue to seek to frustrate it. No doubt, when the bill gets to the Senate, they will seek to do the same thing there, and it is unfortunate, because whenever they do that, they tum people off. They disillusion people and, regrettably, they continue to politicise this matter which ought not to be a political issue. There has also been criticism of the fact that we are not discussing other aspects of on constitutional change. Clearly, there is a great concern in the Australian community over the way High Court judges are appointed. There is also a concern over the way High Court judges have acted in making the lawinventing the law-rather than simply interpreting it. There has also been a demand by local government for constitutional recognition. There has been widespread concern in the Australian community over the misuse of the external affairs power of the Commonwealth by the former government and so on. One could look at a number of other issues, if one wanted to. The government seriously considered this but we thought that, if we had this as a forum to discuss every wish list as far as constitutional change is concerned, we would be accused of seeking to frustrate the process. What the government wants to do is to have this issue of Australia's head of state considered first and foremost. We are not running away from our election promise. Although the other matters may well be considered by the government in due course in some way or other, the constitutional convention to sit towards the end of this year will be focused on whether we should remain a constitutional monarchy or whether we wish to become a republic. This whole issue is a complex one. It will require considerable time for discussion and should not be sidetracked or held back by other issues. If we discussed all of the other possible constitutional changes over a period of 10 days, we simply would not get anywhere. We simply would not have any chance of achieving a consensus. It is false to criticise the government's decision to focus on Australia's constitutional future as far as being a monarch or a republic is concerned. The opposition really ought not to continue to criticise the government in this respect. The government does not admit that any change is necessary. The Leader of the Opposition said that we ought to be encouraging change. Other members opposite said that we ought to be grasping the nettle and advocating an Australian republic. The simple fact is that this is not a matter for politicians. It is a matter for the Australian people, and the government will resist any attempt by those opposite to continue to politicise this matter and to turn it into a party political issue. Our aim is to ensure that there is full consultation. If there is any decision by the Australian people for change, it ought to be achieved through a process that unites rather than divides the community. The former Prime Minister was the great divider. He was not interested in consensus. He was determined to ram his ideas through whereas our current Prime Minister is facilitating a debate so that he is able to listen to the battlers of Australia who were ignored for 13 years by the Labor Party. What we want to do is to get it right. If are going to remain a constitutional monarchy, so be it, if that is what the Australian people want. If we want to become a republic, so be it, if that is what the Australian people want. If we do opt for change, obviously the change ought to unite rather than divide the community. The former Prime Minister suggested that, if we were to move to a republic, the head of state-the president-ought to be elected by a majority of two-thirds of the parliament and the reserve powers of the current Governor General and the monarch ought to remain. He also suggested that the powers of the president should not be justiciable and that the president would be able to be dismissed through a vote of two-thirds of the parliament. Sir Harry Gibbs, one of Australia's most eminent jurists, pointed out that such a modei could well turn into a republican dictatorship because, if there was a desire to sack the president, clearly the parliament would have to be called together for that purpose. The president would clearly hear of a proposal to sack him, and it would be quite simple for him to prorogue the parliament. There would, therefore, be no parliament to impeach him. In that situation, because his powers could not be challenged in the court, we would have a republican dictatorship. My own view is that there must be an overwhelming case made for change before we risk the freedom, stability and way of life that we have and which is the envy of the world. We tend to think of ourselves as a new country, but we are about the sixth oldest democracy in the world. Democracy is a fragile flower. Our constitutional arrangements at the moment have much merit. I do not see any point in change, particularly if we are going to risk becoming a republican dictatorship. I do not see any point in change unless the Australian people will be demonstrably better off. However, I am more than happy to have a constitutional convention at which half the representatives will be elected by the Australian people, and they will join the appointed representatives to talk about Australia's constitutional future. The government has got we the balance right. No doubt, governments will always be criticised for making decisionsand this is a decisive government, a government which has taken whatever steps were necessary to bring about and facilitate this very important debate. Some cynicism has been expressed about the appointed delegates. It ought to be recognised that the government will announce the names of the appointed delegates after full consultation, prior to a vote being taken for the elected delegates. The government has sought to represent the states and territories in an appropriate way. The honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) and, I believe, the opposition have both criticised the government because it has not provided for an equal number of government and opposition representatives at the people's convention. The simple fact of the matter is that the Australian Labor Party has been comprehensively rejected, not only by the people of the Commonwealth but also by the people of every state and both territories, bar New South Wales. What a hide, what gall, what audacity the Labor Party has to crawl into this place and demand equal representation, even though, at election after election after election, the Labor Party has been rejected. Democracy is not about having a vote and being rejected and then getting representation. It is important to recognise that democracy is about seeking the support of the Australian people and accepting their verdict. Mr Griffin-I thought it wasn't a political issue.",57
36,Mr SLIPPER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"The honourable member for Bruce is interjecting. He ought to remember that, in March 1996, his party's numbers were reduced to about 49 seats in this place. The Liberal Party and the National Party together have 94 seats. There are Independents. We have said that the parliamentary representation at the convention ought to represent the party make-up in the parliament. In other words, the Australian people have voted for parliamentary representation and we are saying that the decision of the Australian people federally and the decision of people in the states ought to be replicated in the representation of people at the constitutional convention. There will be elected delegates. The numbers have been outlined previously. The appointed delegates will include 40 parliamentary delegates, with 20 from state and territory parliaments. The premier and the leader of the opposition from each state will be invited, plus a third state parliamentarian, nominated by the premier. We will also invite the chief ministers of the Northern Territory and the ACT. There will be 20 Commonwealth parliamentary delegates-12 government members, six opposition members, one from the Democrats and one independent member. As I said, this represents the balance of party representation in the Commonwealth parliament. There will be 36 non-parliamentary delegates directly appointed by the government after consultations aimed at achieving a broad representation. Despite what members opposite have said, the appointments will ensure that groups which might not otherwise be properly represented, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, are afforded the opportunity to participate. Consistent with earlier commitments, local government will be represented and, most importantly, at least 10 per cent of government appointments will be young people aged between 18 and 25 years. The government will also ensure that there is a proper balance between men and women. The Prime Minister is consulting widely. He will consult with premiers, chief ministers, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Democrats, and we are determined to get this right. I want to place on record yet again my absolute disgust at the way the opposition has simply failed to pick up this opportunity to be bipartisan. Let's face it, we are talking about the constitutional future of this nation. What we are setting up in this bill is a constitutional convention so that the people of Australia are able to come together, through their representatives, to participate in our constitutional future.

37,Mr GRIFFIN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"It is always entertaining to follow the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) in debates in this House because he always gives you plenty of food for thought, although much of it is inedible. There is always something you can comment on if you are running short of time.",60
38,Mr KERR,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,More in the nature of regurgitation I would think.,60
39,Mr GRIFFIN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Certainly, some amount of gestation has occurred with some of the ideas and many of them are not new. Nonetheless, he certainly gives you something to talk about. I will not go my entire time today because I am conscious of the fact that many issues have been covered already, but I would like to make a few points regarding this particular issue. We are here today to consider the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill which basically sets out the parameters for the Constitutional Convention. The question which is to be addressed is the question of whether Australia becomes a republic. How important is this issue? I think it is a very important issue because it is about the question of our national identity. It is about how we project ourselves internationally. It is also about how Australians see themselves and how they see themselves progressing into the future. However, having said that, is it the most important issue we face? Clearly, it is not. There are many other issues which relate to the general operation of society today, and into the future, which are also crucial. The question of our national identity does impact upon those other issues in many different ways. Certainly, at the moment there is a debate which has been going on in Australia in a more general sense, many components of which have been quite outrageous, which also looks at the question of our national identity. However, other issues are important and those who have said that the Labor Party, and particularly the former Prime Minister, was about this issue and nothing else, effectively undermine the question of its significance and misunderstand the operation of modern government. Even when this was an issue which was getting considerable media coverage in earlier days, when it was championed by the former Prime Minister, many other things were going on around government at the same time. Much was being done as the debate continued. The fact is, it is not the only issue we face. The current system is also something that is often raised by people in this debate. I put it on the record that I think Queen Elizabeth II, as a monarch, as Queen of Australia, has done a fine job as far as it goes. However, the question of a monarch and a head of state resident in the United Kingdom but who also operates in relation to Australia is essentially hard to understand. The relevance of that to Australian society is difficult to justify. The question of relevance as we head into the new millennium, of how we operate as a country, and of how we utilise the offices of a head of state, are also very important. There are a couple of issues I want to raise which result from comments made by the previous speaker. Concerning the issue of a republican dictatorship, the view that we should maintain what we have because it has served us well, the old slogan, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it', has some appeal except that I do not think anyone is talking about ending up in a system which could lead to a situation of a republican dictatorship. That is really quite a ridiculous line. I think any sensible commentator around this issue would reject it. Any fair-minded Australian who is considering the detail of what is being proposed, will be proposed, and can be proposed and what will eventually go to a vote of the Australian people will realise that that is not the intention and will not be the result of what is undertaken by the parliament and eventually by the Australian people. It certainly will not be the result of this convention. Another view that has been put is essentially that the previous Prime Minister was about imposing his republic. You heard it on the TV and you heard it by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard): 'You will get the republic you want, not Keating's republic.' I think we have got to clarify just what the previous government was proposing. Essentially, the first point of reference in terms of the question of what would happen was to be a national plebiscite, involving all Australians, on the basic question, 'Do you want a republic?' If that was successful and indicated 50, 60, 70, 30 or whatever percentage support for that initiative, there would then be conventions, discussions and development of specific proposals and then a referendum. The argument often put by members of the other side in particular and others, who are not party political but involved in this debate, that in fact it was not going to involve the A. stralian people-that it was not going to be a situation where you got the chance to have your say-is absolute rubbish. I think that it does the debate no good to consider it on those grounds. Another issue that has been raised by many other speakers is the question of politicising the issue. This argument goes that decisions should not be an issue of party politics and that this one is becoming so because of the actions of the Labor Party. I think you have got to consider the nature of politics. The fact is in this House and in the media, debates are continued upon the question of, 'What do we want to see occur within our society?' Whether it is the question of tax rates; of home and community care; of immigration or of who is to be our head of state-all issues by nature are political. The question of whether it should be seen as being a party political issue is another point. There are people of varying opinions about what should occur throughout this chamber in varying degrees. It is fair to say that there is probably greater unanimity that we should become a republic on this side of the House than there is on the other. The fact of the matter is that to suggest that issues. politicisation has occurred around this issue is really quite ridiculous. It is an issue which relates to what is Australia going to be into the future. Such issues are by nature political because they require people to take sides. They require debate about what should happen and they require, in the end, people making decisions for themselves about what they see as being the way forward. The conduct of this election for this convention is in fact in itself political. Not party political but, as has been made clear, there will be tickets running for election to this convention. There will be tickets from the constitutional monarchists. There will be tickets from the Australian republican movement. There will be tickets from a range of different organisations representing different views along the spectrum. What you are being asked to do is basically to pick a side. I think it is fair to say, given there is a central question involved in the conduct of this convention, that people should be expected and will be expected to state where they stand on this particular issue. I think it is also fair to say that the overwhelming majority of those who will stand for election to this convention will have a view one way or the other. They may vary at the edges, but essentially, there will be pro-republic candidates and pro-monarchist candidates. That is their right and I respect that. I do not have a problem with that but I think to argue that it is not political is ridiculous. When we look at the question of the coalition at the moment, you can look at the question of the way the Prime Minister has handled this issue. We see an example of the sort of problems that he has been facing in government. Essentially, the Prime Minister is trying to take the politics out of this issue by subterfuge. He is trying to do the same thing with a number of other issues. Basically, he is trying to take the politics out of the coalition. He is finding that, in government, he is in a position where he has to make decisions, and those decisions have consequences, and so there is a difficulty in terms of holding the coalition together on a range of different Essentially, that was the problem the coalition faced on this question of a republic when it was first raised. That was one of the principal reasons why, rather than going one way or the other on that particular issue, we ended up referring it to a committee. Let me make it clear that we support the bill. However, amendments can be made to improve it to make it more representative of the views of Australians, more inclusive of the involvement of Australians, more able to cover the issues in a way which will ensure that there is some scope for consensus-they find that difficult-and so that it gives a clear indication of the will of the Australian people. The Prime Minister is a monarchist. He is quite open about that. I respect his view-I do not agree with it, but I respect it. He did not really want to be engaged in this debate. He does not see it as being crucial to Australia's future. He thinks that many other issues are more important. In some respects, he is right. There are other issues that are more important, as I mentioned earlier, but to suggest that we cannot address more than one issue at a time is a Gerald Ford argumentyou can't chew gum and think at the same time. I do not think that is the case. In this country we are capable, both as a parliament and as a people, of considering more than one issue at once. Lord knows, we have to. The proposal as it stands and as it was developed is designed to avoid decisions being made. The Prime Minister has talked about how he hopes this convention will lead to the development of consensus. However, the strategy behind it, the mode and the process of election, will work against that. For one thing, we are talking about a situation where there will be tickets. A number of delegates will be elected. Some will be stated pro-republicans and some will be stated pro-monarchists. Although I have great respect for the individuals involved, I cannot see a situation in which we will get agreement between Digger James and Malcolm Turnbull on the way to progress this issue. Essentially, they are coming from diametrically opposed positions. So there are difficulties in terms of coming to an agreed position. Many people who oppose what we proposed-an initial plebiscite-do so because they are anti-change. The intention of the plebiscite was to give an indication to delegates, through a convention, of the will of the Australian people on the general question of, 'Do we want a republic or don't we?' That indication is important because what will happen now is a situation where the elected delegates will have differing opinions, and it is fair to say that there is unlikely to be an overwhelming majority one way or the other. With voluntary voting, the turnout will be down on what we normally get at federal and state elections. That will, in itself, allow those who oppose the basic proposition of change to say, 'Look, a lot of people did not turn out. They weren't concerned.' Others have mentioned the United States and the appalling turnouts at their general elections. Others have mentioned a hidden agenda on this issue, with the coalition seeking in the future to move our system from compulsory to voluntary voting. Compulsory voting is not really compulsory. What happens in this country is that people are required to attend a balloting place and to have their name struck off the list. If they do not want to vote, they can turf the ballot paper. If they do not want to vote, they can vote informal. A number of people choose to do that-and that is their right. The nature of the way our system works means that we have turnouts of around 90 or 95 per cent, whereas in the United States 15 or 20 per cent of the people can decide who is the President. The American system could have a worrying impact on the way democracy in this country works and how our society works in terms of extremist minorities, from whatever side of the spectrum, gaining a foothold, what they could do to the operation of our system, and what that would mean for ordinary, everyday Australians and the conduct of their lives. In relation to the postal ballot situation, over the term of a federal parliament, even in 18 months to two years, something like three million Australians will move house. Many of those people, although they are required under the law to notify their change of address to the Electoral Commission, will not do so. It is the sort of thing-and I am one of the people who can plead guilty to this on occasion-which you often forget to do and do closer to the particular election only when you have heard the election being announced on the radio or the television. The fact is, a lot of those people will not make the change of enrolment and, through a postal ballot system, will not receive ballot papers and will not have the opportunity to vote. Something like 200,000 Australians will probably be overseas at the time of this vote, and they also will miss out. It is not an inclusive process. In the circumstances that we are talking about, the instructions are only in English. That suits the overwhelming majority of the population, but it will make it difficult for many Australians-many Australians who are very proud to have come to this country, to have made it their home and to have contributed to it. It will make it extremely difficult for them to actually cast their vote. With the voluntary voting and with the postal ballot you are seeing a circumstance which is going to denigrate the result before it is actually achieved. It will give the opportunity for whichever side that, in effect, loses at the convention to attack those results and cast aspersions on their legitimacy. Others have covered the question of appointed delegates and other issues. I will not go into that today; I think that has been covered quite carefully by others. The basic point I will finish with is that the Prime Minister says he wants consensus but he has designed a process, through this convention, which will avoid it. We see a situation of division, which he says he opposes, and that consensus, that comfortable and relaxed atmosphere that he seeks for Australian society, will be very difficult to achieve through this process. We support the initiative of the convention because it is the choice that we face today. We support changes to what is being proposed because we think it can be improved and we think that, through that process, a better, more equitable and more agreeable solution for the Australian public can be achieved. We look to a situation where that will hopefully come through this convention process, although we have our doubts. I commend the bill to the House, but I commend, particularly, the amendments that are being proposed as an opportunity to make this a real attempt to address this issue as we move into the next century.",61
40,Mr BARRY JONES,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Lalor) (1.53 p.m.)The 1st of January in the year 2001 will be the first day of the 21 st century-the beginning of the third Christian millennium. It will also be the day for celebrating the first centenary of the Commonwealth constitution, proclaimed in Sydney. The end of the century mood in the 1890s was a catalyst or intensifier which encouraged the founding fathers-no founding mothersto get on with it. From Henry Parkes' Tenterfield speech of October 1889, which revived the federation movement, until the inauguration of the Commonwealth in January 1901 was barely 12 years. The range of issues which faced voters in the six colonies in the 1890s was very much wider than the narrow issue to be put before the 1997 convention. In the first Australasian Federal Convention of 1891, an Australian republic was spoken of by a few delegates as a long-term goalperhaps a hundred years or so later-without arousing paroxysms of enthusiasm or rage. Our founding fathers took a pragmatic view. Unlike the Americans a century earlier, they did not think they were writing a document for all time; it was simply the best compromise that could achieve approval by the British government and acceptance by the six colonies. Even so, it took a decade to jump these hurdles. There was a proposal, soon defeated, that the Governor General should be directly elected by the voters-and that has a distinctly contemporary ring. A century ago, fear of isolation and concern about external threats persuaded six Australian colonies to join in a federation. This continent-wide aspiration sought nationhood within the British Empire, linked by the Queen, a promise of protection by the Royal Navy, White Australia and, to a degree, tariff protection. Parkes and later Griffith, Deakin, Isaacs, Kingston, Barton, Symon and other founding fathers had some vision, but they recognised that there were practical limits to how far they could go. Australia had a small, scattered population and a huge continent with poor communications-Todd' s telegraph and primitive telephones notwithstanding. The white population was overwhelmingly English speaking and nominally Christian. Many citizens had been born in Britain and may well have seen themselves as mere transients here. The constitution of 1901 was a compromise document which needed to satisfy the different needs of six colonies before it could be put to popular vote. It also required the imprimatur of the imperial government-particularly difficult when Joseph Chamberlain, the then Colonial Secretary, dreamt of an empire which was to be an organic unity, tied together politically, economically and through trade. Hence, the British government retained the right of veto on Commonwealth and state legislation, under section 59. A century later, in the 1990s, there is a comparable move towards national redefinition, with the beginning of a new millennium as a psychological target. White Australia and tariff protection are both gone. The British Empire rio longer exists. The United Kingdom is increasingly integrated into the European Community, both politically and economically. The relevance of the British connection is coming under challenge. Britain is no longer a major trading partner, although still a significant investor here, and the Royal Navy no longer guards our shores. The bill before the House is a very cynical exercise, designed to create a situation which is programmed to fail. It could be more accurately described as the 'Constitutional Convention (Impediments to Voting) Bill 1997'. It creates an obstacle race, setting up hurdles to actually discourage voting. It is in very sharp contrast to our existing system. Voting is to be voluntary-in other words, to persuade the community that it is not a very important vote; voters do not really have to tum up; voters do not have to own the result; voters do not have to have a personal commitment or investment in the result. It is to be a vote that is postal, not a vote by attendance. It will be non-secret, in effect. If you read those extraordinary provisions, you will see you not only have to sign the ballot but also confirm it by indicating your date of birth. If voters forget to put in the date of birth then, presumably, the vote is invalidated. Th:-, is in proposed clause 68. It is, by implication, excluding non-English speaking voters. None of the material provided will allow for explanation to those people who are not of English origin. It is extraordinary how much detail is provided to ensure that voters in Antarctica are given the right vote but there does not seem to be any provision to ensure that voters in London are given the right to vote. It is quite extraordinary to see the contrast there. Father Frank Brennan SJ has pointed to the oddity that 'there is an elaborate statutory scheme for the voluntary electoral process but no statutory basis for the convention itself. There ought to be statutory provision for the convention's procedures, including the law of privilege, for the setting of the agenda and for the choice of the chairman of the convention and any deputies'. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) calls himself a monarchist and he also supports what he calls 'the existing system'. I am a republican and I also support 'the existing system'. The problem is that the Prime Minister's approach could be described as the 'empty room' theory of constitutional monarchy in which the qualities of physical absence and political indifference by the monarch are the major assets. If one asked the Prime Minister where the national focus was, he would fling open the doors of an empty room and say, 'See! There's nothing there. Isn't it wonderful? And it works.' We must be able to have more than the empty room theory of constitutional sovereignty. When an anxious and eager House waits for my resumption of the debate after question time and later deliberations, I will, by peroration, go to a climax.",64
41,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Unemployment",65
42,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall that his first budget forecast a reduction in unemployment to 8.25 per cent? Does he recall the Treasurer subsequently revising that forecast up to 8.5 per cent? Is it not a fact that the level of unemployment is to stuck at 8.7 per cent, some 150,000 jobs short of your government's earlier forecast? Why should any Australian believe the forecast in last night's budget that unemployment will fall to eight per cent when economic growth does not reach four per cent, the target set by the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the level the former Labor government consistently achieved?",65
43,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The growth forecasts set out in the budget are in the eyes of most economic forecasters very conservative and, therefore, extremely achievable. The budget attacks the issue of employment on two fronts. Firstly, it improves the economic outlook for jobs by taking pressure off interest rates. I would remind the parliament that, since this government came to power, there has been a reduction of 1.5 per cent in interest rates and that has saved business about $3.6 billion in interest payments. It also puts us on the path of long-term growth rather than the boom-bust cycle that was so characteristic of the former government. There are also a number of direct measures contained in this and the first budget my government brought down last year which deal directly with the issue of employment. There is the $1 billion Federation Fund for nation building projects. There is the $1.25 billion fund for environmental projects, bitterly opposed by the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. There is road funding of over $1.6 billion that will create and sustain 19,000 jobs. There is a regional communications strategy that will spend $250 million in regional Australia--once again, a proposal opposed tooth and nail by the Australian Labor Party. There is a work for the dole proposal. In the primary industry area, there is spending on quarantine of $75 million over four years to protect the clean, green image, giving more exports and more jobs. In rural policy, there is a $200 million package to improve the outlook for Australian farmers and regions. In relation to the regional forest agreements, we are continuing the drive to fix the forest issue with a balance for jobs in conservation, and we have created 400 jobs from the first of the RFAs in the East Gippsland area. More generically, the major reforms that my government has carried out in the small business area will provide valuable help, valuable incentives, to the small business area. The most interesting thing is that I get a question by the Leader of the Opposition on the question of unemployment. I would remind the House and I would remind the Australian people that you tried your remedy. In your last six years of government, you ran up debts of $75 billion and created 7,100 permanent jobs. I repeat that: they ran up debts of $75 billion and they created 7,100 additional full-time jobs. It was absolutely fascinating that yesterday on radio, in preparation for the budget that was brought down last night, this is what the shadow Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, had to say: If I was running this budgetsaid Gareth, and listen to thisI'd be wanting to put a very substantial amount of money, indeed, intolisten to thisa sort of transitional pool of created jobs-artificial, if you like. Artificial! He admits it. Your mate from Hotham, the Two Billion Dollar Man from Hotham-remember him? Before the last election he created thousands of artificial jobs. It was nothing more than a chimera to cover the fact that unemployment was really a lot worse than you cared to admit. You will have to spend years in political purgatory before you have any authority to lecture us on unemployment. Commonwealth Debt",66
44,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given the fact that through a sensible and practical economic plan the coalition government is now wiping out Labor's legacy of deficit and debt, what are the benefits and opportunities that this achievement offers for our nation, in particular for the employment prospects of our nation and, of course, my electorate of Leichhardt?",66
45,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The best message for the people of Leichhardt and, indeed, the best message for the people of all the electorates of Australia out of last night's budget is that a government that inherited a $10Y2 billion deficit will have turned that into a $1.6 billion surplus in just three years. It is an achievement of which my government is entitled to be proud. It is an achievement that will underwrite stable economic conditions. It is an achievement that will give great economic confidence to the small business community of Australia. The first responsibility of any national government is to get the accounts of the nation in order. Our predecessors left us with a legacy of debt. They left us with huge deficits. In 1995, almost 20 per cent of the GDP of this nation each year had to be accounted for by way of debt. By the year 2000, we will have cut that in half. It represents the most dramatic decline in the debts of this nation. We will no longer be debtors and beggars. We will be lenders. We will be investors. We will be proud and confident of Australia and, as time goes by, that will feed in very effectively to job generation, particularly in areas like Leichhardt. Unemployment",66

48,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall telling the people of Australia that his government would be judged on its performance on jobs? Is it not a fact that in Labor's last year in office male full-time employment rose by 57,000, whilst in your government's first year in office 12,000 full-time male employees lost their jobs? Is it not a fact that Labor's last year in office long-term unemployment dropped by 45,000, whilst in your government's first year in office long-term unemployment rose by 44,000? Is it not a fact that, as yesterday's data from the ABS shows, the level of long-term unemployment is continuing to rise massively under your government with an April increase of 16,000-the worse result in more than 22 months? Why didn't the Treasurer's budget speech mention, for the first time in memory, the government's appalling record on jobs? Was it because it breached your government's charter of budget honesty?",67
49,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Can I tell the Leader of the Opposition that I remember telling the Australian people that we would introduce a $1 billion family tax initiative, and we did. I remember telling the Australian people that we would introduce a capital gains tax initiative for small business-and we have exceeded it-and we did. I remember telling the Australian people that we would have a $1 billion fund for investment in Australia's natural environment, and we have-and it was opposed by the Labor Party. I remember promising the Australian people that we would give relief to self-funded retirees, and we have. I remember promising the Australian people that we would give tax concessions for private health insurance, and we have. I remember telling the Australian people that we would give them a savings initiative, and I am proud to say that that savings initiative, delivered by the Treasurer last night, goes far beyond what we promised the Australian people at the last election. I am very proud to iead a government that has overdelivered in most of the areas and fully delivered in all of the areas that represented the core commitments of the coalition at the last election. I welcome the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has invited me to recall what I told the Australian people. I promised the Australian people these things and I have delivered them. I promised the Australian people that we would have family tax relief. I promised a charter of budget honesty, and in we have delivered it. I take the opportunity of reminding the Australian people, of reminding the parliament, of the abysmal employment record of the man who had the gall to ask me the question. That is Mr Eleven Point Two Per Cent Unemployment over there-the highest level since the Great Depression of the early 1930s. That was the Beazley-Keating conspiracy against the unemployed of Australia. And he has the gall to lecture us. Under Beazley, youth unemployment went from 30.2 per cent to 32.2 percent; the unemployment rate from 10.4 per cent to 10.6 per cent; long-term unemployed increased by 95,000; and the number of people unemployed increased by 34,000. In their last six years, they flung $75 billion of additional debt at the problem and created the princely sum of 7,100 full-time jobs. They have no credibility on this subject at all. Savings Rebate",67
50,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. The Treasurer will be well aware that over one-third of the Deakin electorate is over 50 years of age and can now participate in the government's new savings plan. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the benefits for the battlers of Deakin of the proposed new savings rebate? How does this fit with the government's overall plan for Australia's national savings?,68
51,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Just as this government has turned away from Labor's deficit and debt and begun saving again, so it is time for individuals to be encouraged to save. In last night's budget, for the first time ever, Australia got a new tax deal for saving. For the first time ever, tax rates on savings were reduced so that people have an encouragement to save. The government that delivered it was the coalition government. It is one of the things that we will be proudest of in a term of achievement. By reducing the tax on savings we have given Australians the opportunities to save. This is a saving opportunity which is open to all. The Labor Party wanted to be discriminatory. They did not want to give the aged the opportunity to save. They did not want to give parents who were looking after children at home the opportunity to save. They did not want to give people choice in saving because what the Labor Party was all about in relation to superannuation was not encouraging savings but delivering financial power to the trade union movement. That is all you ever cared about-locking up funds in industry and occupational superannuation funds. This is an opposition which opposed retirement savings accounts. You opposed them; you opposed setting up competition in relation to superannuation. This was a Labor government that opposed choice of superannuation funds. You were not allowed to have a say as to where your money went because, at the end of the day, it was not the politicians of the Labor Party that called the shots but the trade union tsars who wanted to get their hands on the filthy money so that they could direct it to industrial campaigns. This is a completely different approach that our government has. Our government believes in choice. Our government believes in incentives. We are giving choice in relation to superannuation. If you want to take the savings rebate on savings in banks, building societies or credit unions, it is your choice. If you want to take the savings rebate in relation to equities, it is your choice. If you want to take the savings in relation to superannuation, it is your choice. This is an opportunity for all people to have choices in relation to savings. This is the first great breakthrough to encourage savings through the tax system, and this is the coalition government that has delivered it to the people of Deakin. Savings Rebate",68
52,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer, on the same subject. I refer to his statement last night that the bulk of his new savings rebate benefit, as he chooses to call it, will flow to individuals with taxable income under $40,000. Has the Treasurer any information as to how many wage and salary earners in this category have personal savings of $60,000 or more, enabling them to get the full $450 rebate? Is it not the case that the overwhelming majority of wage and salary earners earning under $40,000 would be lucky to have as much as $3,000 in personal savings, which would entitle them under your scheme to a grand total annual rebate of not $450 but at most around $23 a year, or 43c a week? Is this your idea of a benefit?",68
53,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If that is the dimension of the attack, just roll it on. We stand up at the dispatch box with our little permutations and combinations and we read them out. By the time we have read them out, we have all the punch of a marshmallow ! You do not have to have $60,000 to claim this savings rebate; you can claim it on $1 or you can claim it on $100. If you want to put it into superannuation, you can claim it on $3,000 of superannuation contributions. Let me ask you this question: what tax rebate did the Labor Party ever give for personal superannuation contributions? Government members-None.",68
54,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What rebate did it give in 1983? Government members-None.,69
55,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What rebate did it give in 1984? Government members-None.,69

59,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They sit here and they say, 'Oh, this is a terrible rebate.' You had years to do something. Whenever we get to the failures of the Labor Party, guess what? They were always going to do it in the 14th year. They say, 'If only we could have had a 14th year. We might have failed for 13 years but, Mr Speaker, we were going to come good.' The horse was running last for 13 years and it would not have improved!",69

62,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take it that the shadow Treasurer is not looking for a supplementary. My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the government's plan to fix up the mess left by Labor and deliver a secure retirement income for all Australians? Does this deliver on our commitment to have a comprehensive retirement plan which will benefit all Australians, in particular the older people in my electorate of Hindmarsh?",69
63,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question and I acknowledge the interest that she has in the retired members of her electorate. The good news for the retired members of her electorate is that they will be able to access the savings rebate. People who are on retirement incomes and living off their investments will get a 15 per cent rebate on the tax that they pay. That is of enormous benefit to retired people. There was no other plan that could have delivered this. It was the coalition government that did it. It was the coalition government that gave choice in superannuation. It was the coalition government that introduced Australia's first ever breakthrough in relation to taxes on savings. Last night we also announced a number of other measures which will improve the operation of retirement incomes. We announced that from 1 July 1999 all contributions made by or on behalf of members into superannuation will be preserved. We announced a way of reforming the early release of superannuation benefits. We introduced provisions giving choice to employees between funds-between 13 a retirement savings account and a fund. We introduced into the budget for the first time budgeting for pensions to be held at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. Again, I ask the question: after 13 years of government, what year did the Labor Party do that in? None. They never put it into legislation and they never budgeted for it.",69
64,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it relevant for the Treasurer to go on talking in the way in which he has in answer to this particular proposition-and I make the point he just made-when every single year we legislated to give them 25 per cent of AWE",69
65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,69
66,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We would be disappointed if we did not get him to his feet. It is an indelible sign that he has been stung. The point remains: the Labor Party never legislated it; it never budgeted for it. The first budget in which it was ever done was last night's budget. We made a commitment to pensioners for 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. Of course, the other announcement in relation to pensioners was a pension bonus for people who choose to continue in the workplace. People who continue in the work force and give the government a saving will get a bonus of 9.4 per cent. Those who continue in the work force for five years and subsequently qualify for the single age pension will get a pension bonus over $21,000 untaxed. Mrs Crosi-And it cost a minimum",69

71,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under this proposal if you continue working, you will get $21,000 untaxed. Let us think about the bonus the Labor Party would have paid them. The bonus the Labor Party would have paid them is zero. There is a bit of silence over there about this. I forgot that if they had been elected for a 14th year, they might have done it that year. I forgot; they were always going to do it and they never did. Savings Rebate Mr GARETH EV ANS-I direct my question to the Treasurer again. The Treasurer was apparently unable to give me any information about the personal savings patterns of people on a wage or salary under $40,000. Can he give any information on the superannuation contributions pattern of people in that particular bracket? Is it not the case that the overwhelming majority of wage and salary earners in this group either pay no personal superannuation contribution at all or, if they do, it is very much less than $3,000? How can the Treasurer justify he and I and every one of us in this parliament now getting windfall $450 tax rebates for our personal superannuation contributions when those who clean our offices, some of whom I understand are paying personal contributions of three per cent, adding up to $600 a year, would get at most $90?",70

83,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We note the point: the Leader of the Opposition will not discipline the ACTU President. We note that point.,70
84,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We'll remember that.,70
85,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will remember that. Let me come to the point. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked how many employees were making personal contributions to superannuation. That is his question. Why would you? You got no encouragement to do so until last night. Why would you! What that illustrates is the failure of your system. You got no benefit at all for putting personal money, taxed money, into superannuation. That is why, for the first time, last night you got a 15 per cent tax break so that if you put the money in you get a tax bonus. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition's second point was-I think this was how he phrased it: why should you get it and not the cleaner get it? Was that your point? That was your second point. Can I make this point: in last year's budget we introduced a 15 per cent surcharge on employer contributions to superannuation and the Labor Party voted against it in the Senate. You stood here in House of Representatives and said the Labor Party would support it, and the Labor Party voted against it in the Senate. You voted for it in the House of RepresentativesMr Beazley interjecting",70
86,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What changed? You voted for il in the House of Representatives and you voted against it in the Senate. You voted two ways on the one bill. And do you know why? Because Senator Sherry does not take his orders from you. That is the point. You have a weak Leader of the Opposition and an ACTU President who is going to smear and slur against family members. You won't stand up to him. Senator Sherry won't stand up to him. Senator Sherry votes a different way to you in the House of Representatives-and, my friend, that is because your time is limited. To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I say this: if you are worried about the cleaners in your office, don't throw ashtrays. Budget 1997-98: Health Initiatives",71
87,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister outline for the House the major health initiatives which were announced in the budget last night? In what way will that benefit the people in the electorate of Forde? Mr Beazley interjecting,71
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition! Mr MCMullan interjecting,71
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Canberra! The day after budget day is usually a period of some boisterousness. But don't go beyond the limit. This is a general warning addressed to you all that I will not tolerate any further mayhem.,71
90,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. The government introduced a number of significant initiatives in last night's budget in relation to health and family services, and they have three basic priorities: first, to address areas where there have been unsustainable rates of increase in growth; second, to look at areas where we can improve out the comes for the public; and, third, to maintain our fundamental commitment to keep Medicare. What we have done in the health portfolio is rein outlays back from a 5.5 per cent average over the 10 years to 1995-96 to 2.6 per cent real growth over the forward estimates. The fact is, though, health expenditure is still going up and health expenditure is increasing as a share of government expenditure. Our key initiatives are in the public health area, where we are funding programs that were due to expire, and funding a number of immunisation initiatives. We will, for the first time, be making the hepatitis B vaccine universally available and part of the immunisation schedule. Secondly, we have been able to come to an agreement with the Department of Finance about a new process for listing new vaccines so they do not have to go through the budget process in a similar way to the cost effective criteria which apply to pharmaceutical benefits. This is good news, and the first vaccine being assessed under this is the acellular pertussis vaccine. The second area where we have announced a new initiative is in the national mental health strategy, a six-year strategy which was due to expire next year. We have said we will keep the national mental health strategy going beyond that time in conjunction with the states and territories. We have put new money into the acute care sector, which is $40 million over four years, particularly to strengthen the evidence and research base of public hospital treatment. We are introducing electronic claiming for Medicare benefits, which will do a few things. Firstly, it will be a significant boost to the public in terms of easier access to Medicare benefits. Secondly, it will give general practice an incentive to computerise. Unfortunately, at the moment only half of Australia's general practices have a computer. We are spending $15 million new money on emergency relief, $17 million new money on rural health and $15 million over one year for the palliative care program, which we hope to be able to wrap up into the Medicare agreements from 1998. We are introducing a new system of scholarships called the Howard Florey scholarships. That will be for bright, young Australian researchers who are currently overseas, who want to get back to Australia and who cannot because there is no position for them. They will not be in the position that Professor Doherty has been in, where we lose our great researchers overseas and they do not come back. The rural initiatives will be of particular interest to the member for Forde, because rural health remains one of our top priorities. We are introducing additional places for specialist training in rural areas and, because of some of the intractable problems of trying to get doctors into country areas, we will be looking at a range of innovative service delivery programs. One of these is obstetrics. A lot of country people simply do not have access to obstetrics services. We are making some substantial changes to the pharmaceutical benefits system. But that in the end will be to bring the pharmaceutical benefits system back from 15 per cent real growth to 7.8 per cent real growth. The expenditure under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will still go up substantially. Even with the changes we are making next year, the increase will be $300 million over and above the amount we are expending this year. All in all, this will strengthen Australia's research base and put health policy on a much sounder evidence based footing, and that bodes well for the long term. Savings Rebate Mr GARETH EV ANS-I have a further question directed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer concede that the Parliament House cleaner I spoke of in the case last mentioned who would get only $90 rebate under the government savings scheme would have received a matching contribution of $600 a year under the Labor co-contribution scheme which your government embraced last year in your budget expenditure projections? Isn't it the case that that same cleaner, on the assumption that he is 35 and earning just under $25,000, would be entitled, under that cocontribution scheme, which you have now torn up, to an additional $75,000 of retirement benefit? Isn't it also the case that someone aged 35 and now on average weekly earnings would, on retirement under that cocontribution scheme, get a retirement benefit payout of an additional $11O,000? How can you justify undermining the financial security of ordinary Australian wage and salary earners to the extent that you have by breaking your promise?",71
91,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Breaking which promise? Opposition members-Your promise.,72
92,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The l-a-w tax cuts? 'They were not a promise,' he said. 'They were l-a-w,' he said-your leader, Mr Keating; your still spiritual leader, not this temporary thing that sits there and masquerades in the job while Senator Sherry defies him over in the Senate and his front-bench is defying him here. What they never tell us is this: the cocontribution was a three per cent deduction from wages. You told the cleaner that-that you had a plan to deduct three per cent of their wages? You told them that-a new tax to take three per cent out of their after tax wages? You never told them that. You never introduced the legislation, did you? You know that the cleaner would not have been too happy to see another three per cent of their after tax wages taken out. Then you say, 'But it wouldn't have been so bad because we'd have put it back into superannuation and we'd have given it back to you in the year 2042.' There are all of those sums that you work on: 40 years in the work force, a retirement for a 25-year-old in the year 2042",72
93,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Terrific!,72
94,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'Trust us. We couldn't introduce the l-a-w tax cuts between 1992 and 1993, but trust us for 2042.' Let me go back to the point-the co-contribution scheme, your scheme. Name the year between 1983 and 1996 when you introduced it. Here you are trying to compare us to a fantasy. You have erected this fantasy of what you might have done on a 1992 promise in 1998",72

Also, the export market development grants scheme stays with a $150 million allocation and the tourist industry, as the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and I have confirmed, will in fact get the full rate of export market development grant-something Labor was never able to do.

104,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I just make the additional point that the Federation Fund will have a geographical spread, and that is assured by the Prime Minister. It will in fact be a very worthwhile boost to infrastructure at an important time in the nation's history. On top of that there are small and large items, like the $48 million for the regional forestry agreements further facilitation; the $200 million integrated rural package, which takes over from the rural adjustment scheme; the $75 million for quarantine, separate from the retrenchment payments; and the $1.6 billion in respect of roads, including the continuation of the black spots roads program, which Labor abolished and which we have re-established. On top of that, the minister for health has an enlightened approach to rural health over the last 14 months, which is further followed up in this budget. Full credit to him-not just for the John Flynn scholarships, the suicide prevention and other programs but for the obstets and other initiatives introduced in the budget. The one I liked the most, getting down to specifics, is in respect of Austudy-something practical, something realistic-a doubling from $3,700 to $7,400 in income deduction for larger families. It is another step in the right direction. Financial assistance grants to local government were sandbagged. Last year saw some spectacular increases for many councils, including those in western Queensland. This year, we are in there sandbagging those increases-a $40 million increase over two years. This babble over there can whinge all they like, but this has been a good budget for the bush. I just conclude by asking one question: which side of politics-was it the coalition or Labor-last increased fuel excise tax? It was Labor in the last parliamentary term. Which side of politics last increased the rate of sales tax? It was Labor yet again. We have not increased taxes. We have maintained discipline and we will have a budget surplus next year.

106,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Don't give up your day job, Tim. My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to his stated rationale savings rebate as being to encourage individuals to save. Right? Isn't it the case that, when your scheme is fully in place, someone reasonably well off, who starts the year with $70,000 in personal saving and then spends $10,000 in the course of the year, still gets the full $450 rebate? Where on earth is the encouragement to save in that?",74
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Did you write that?,74
108,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, Prime Minister, I did not write that question. Can I just explain it to you quite simply: at the moment if you save and you derive interest, you are taxed at the full marginal rate. A lot of people say, 'Why should I save? My interest is taxed at the marginal rate, I might as well go out and spend it.' But what we have said, for the first time ever, is that if you save you are going to get a 15 per cent rebate up to a cap.",74
109,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Answer the question.,74

111,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh! She says, 'You're in government.' It is our responsibility to introduce your policy, is it? Just like it is our responsibility to deliver the l-a-w tax cuts, is it? I have said this before: what I don't like is being blamed for you breaking your promises. What do you think we got elected for? To try to posthumously resurrect the legend of Paul Keating? Were we supposed to come into office and say that Paul Keating had broken his promise? He stole an election by fraud, but we will try to posthumously resurrect him by introducing his policy? We were not elected to do that. You were elected to do that. You are the representative of Keating Labor.",74
112,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which goes to relevance. The question sought an explanation from the Treasurer about how savings were being encouraged when people with savings over $60,000 were being rewarded for reducing the levels of their savings. It really is quite a simple question, I would have thought. Instead, he started for the talking about what were supposedly our promises when they were in fact his. We will settle for him keeping his promises.",74

117,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Because every one of them is Keating Labor-a Keating Labor minister--every one of them is responsible for the breach of promise on the l-a-w tax cuts. They sit here in this parliament as if it had nothing to do with them. You were all elected Keating Labor ministers on a l-a-w tax promise in 1992.,74
118,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a further point of order: this is absolutely over the odds. There is no possible way that relevance in the standing orders could meet this.",74

Can the minister please inform the House of how the government's Austudy budget initiative will assist Australian students. In particular, can the minister confirm the advantages of the new Austudy measures for regional Australia?",75
122,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyne for his question. Unlike the Labor Party, the coalition is committed to expanding access to tertiary education for young Australians. It was the Labor Party that thought it was fair to lock 20,000 young Australians out of the universities. It was the Labor Party that thought it was fair to prevent Australians getting into universities on the same terms that they were prepared to admit overseas students. They understand so little about higher education policy that the member for Werriwa thought that the coalition policies would cut access to universities by 30,000. The facts are that this year, as I announced to the parliament yesterday, the universities have enrolled 26,000 students above the targets they set for this year. That is how we have expanded access. No initiative is more important in this budget for regional Australia than the impact that we are going to have on access for students who need Austudy to move away from home to study at universities. This initiative in the budget recognises the fact families in regional and remote Australia incur additional costs when they have to move away to study. From 1 July this year the dependant deduction for second and subsequent eligible tertiary students will be doubled from $3,700 to $7,400. The effect of this decision is to increase the parental income cut-off point at which Austudy is paid for eligible tertiary students. It means that more students in rural and regional Australia will get Austudy and that many of those receiving Austudy will increase the amount of Austudy that they receive up to $925 per student. These are significant improvements to the Austudy system. The Labor Party never addressed satisfactorily the educational disadvantages of students in regional and rural Australia. The coalition has that commitment. Eligible families will receive their increased payments from around October, with these payments backdated to 1 July this year. Savings Rebate Mr GARETH EV ANS-My further question to the Treasurer goes to the economic rationale of the savings rebate which the Treasurer conspicuously failed to address in his last purported answer. I ask him: has the retirement incomes modelling task force in Treasury analysed your savings rebate proposal and estimated its overall effect on public, private and total national saving? If so, will the Treasurer make public that analysis? If not, can the Treasurer explain to the House why that analysis has not been conducted and the results made public? Is it because your own Treasury department has long argued against savings incentives of the type that you announced last night because there is no evidence anywhere that they lead to increased national saving and plenty of reason to believe that they do not-that they actually reduce it?",75
123,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to make it clear that the policies that this government introduces are the policies of this government. It is the government that was elected. I want to make this absolutely clear to you. It is the government that introduces them. You sit down and you say: 'Has the Treasury done that this? Has the Treasury done that?' What the Treasury policy is doesn't matter to the government. It is the government policy that matters to the Treasury. Right? Have you got that point? Because we run for election and we account to the Australian public. There seems to be a fundamental misapprehension in relation to this. The big question that all Australia wants to know is: are you against this? Are you going to vote against this? Are you? There is a big silence. Beazley is going to have to look around at Simon and ask Simon's view. Come on! What's the answer? Are you in favour of this? No answer. What's the answer-yes or no? When I asked after last year's budget were they in favour of a surcharge on superannuation for high income earners, the putative Leader of the Opposition said yes. But I asked the wrong person; I should have asked Senator Sherry, because he said no. How you can vote for a bill in the Reps and against it in the Senate when it is the same bill?",75
124,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take a point of order, Mr Speaker, and it goes to relevance. The Treasurer knows very well, and this is the point of relevance, that if he had allowed passage of amendments which eliminated BHP workers from the impact of it and which eliminated people under $70,000 he would have had us vote for it.",76
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,76
126,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are starting to get to the truth, Mr Speaker. Here was the Labor Party voting for something in the House of Representatives. You asked me before what I had done about MPs' super. We are the only government that put a surcharge on MPs' super. You were shamed into saying you would support it here and you voted against it in the Senate.",76
127,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My point of order goes to relevance again. We have had enough blah from this Treasurer. The question was this,76
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am very much aware of the question. It revolves around retirement incomes.,76
129,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was this: has the retirement incomes modelling task force in Treasury analysed your savings rebate proposal and estimated its overall effect on public, private and national savings? So what, because the superannuation changes",76
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,76
131,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But the answer has got nothing to do with it.,76
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question revolves around retirement income. The Treasurer is embellishing his answer with examples.,76
133,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There were five questions, as there commonly are from your Deputy Leader. By the time he finishes the last one even he has forgotten what the first one was. The last one was: had the Treasury advised us to do this or that? I made the point that the government advises the Treasury. The Treasury does not tell us what our policy is. Our policy is what we are elected to do. We account to the Australian public. You may find that hard to believe, but this is a government which was elected on a proposal to give a wide savings rebate and the thing that we like doing is going beyond it. We have overdelivered. We were elected to introduce a family tax initiative. We delivered. We were elected to introduce health payment bonuses. We delivered. We were elected to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor. We were elected to introduce capital gains rollover. The thing that completely wrongfoots you on this is that you are not used to governments that deliver their promises, and it has you deeply perplexed. Mr GARETH EV ANS- Mr Speaker, a supplementary question: if the Treasurer is so contemptuous of Treasury advice, why does he have 40 TV sets over there monitoring his every movement in this place?",76
134,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I would like to answer that question.",76
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Treasurer, I know you would like to, but it falls outside the guidelines. Carer Payments",76
136,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Could the minister please explain how the government's budget announced last night will help carers in the important role they play in our community? How will these initiatives ensure that this government provides the best possible health care for those people who need it?,76
137,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question because I know that the people in her electorate of Moncrieff are very pleased with the government's commitment to carers in this budget. The government's plan for carers indicates our ongoing commitment to some of the most needy and vulnerable groups in our community. For too long, carers in our society have worked tirelessly, very often putting the needs of the people they care for before their own needs and aspirations. This government has recognised the extraordinary work and commitment that is made to our community by carers. We have recognised that by putting in place a genuine plan for them and those they care for. This involves additional funding of $120 million over four years. Sixteen million dollars of that money will go directly to helping and supporting the carers and those they care for in the community. It builds on the $36.7 million that we allocated in the last budget to implement the national respite for carers plan. The centrepiece of our package for carers is a $16.60 increase in the rate of the domiciliary nursing care benefit paid to carers. This is a 28 per cent increase in the benefit for them. The other major component of this package is that for the first time those parents who are caring for children under the age of 16 who have profound disabilities will now be eligible for the carer payment. This is a very significant move forward for people who care in our community. The member for Moncrieff asked me how our package of measures for carers will improve the health outcomes. We know that having support for carers in the caring role is central to the good health of the carers and to the good health of those whom they take the time to care for. As the peak body for carers in this country-who do a wonderful job, I might say-the Carers Association of Australia said last night: The Howard government is to be congratulated for initiatives that will bring some light into the of some of the nation's poorest people. Members' Travelling Allowances",77
138,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Does the government intend to respond to the resolution of the Senate requesting the tabling of details of travelling allowances for members of the House of Representatives or is the minister prepared to put a proposition to the House that such details be tabled? If so, when can we expect such a motion for debate and, I would assume, the support of every member?",77
139,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer is yes, we will be tabling those figures and I expect to do it in the next sitting week. Budget 1997-98: Environment",77
140,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government representing the Minister for the Environment. Can the minister tell the House what action this government will be taking as a result of last night's budget to deliver restoration and conservation for Australia's natural environment? How does this confirm that the government is keeping faith with its election promises on the environment?",77
141,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. This government wants to take steps to rescue the environment. We indicated when we went to the last election that we would do so and we have delivered with this budget. We accept the responsibility for future generations that we must take very positive steps to look after our environment, our natural heritage. For the first time, in this budget there has been a consolidated statement across government about the steps that we are taking to invest in preserving our natural heritage; and I commend it to all members. And I thank the member for Macquarie for drawing it to the attention of the House in his question today. When we put this proposal forward for the Natural Heritage Trust, who was it who opposed us all the way through? It was the Labor Party-and wasn't it interesting. I sat here representing my colleague Senator Hill lives for 12 months and I got only one question from the shadow minister for environment about environment issues. You totally ignored the issue. You took no steps of a positive nature whilst you were in government for 13 years and had the opportunity. So I am pleased to draw to the attention of the House the steps that we have taken. We have also indicated in the budget figures that there has been an increased to $255 million from $194 million last year for Environment Australia-a positive increase of funds. We have also indicated that a further $100 million will be added to the heritage trust to assist with the long-term proposals address environmental issues across a range of matters such as vegetation issues, looking at bush care and developing all of those projects which are so vital for Australia, looking at biodiversity issues and developing, for example, $125 million this year for programs such as landcare and the national weeds strategy-all matters which, members would be aware, are profoundly important for the future environment of our nation. Look at the nation's rivers: $48.3 million for the nation's rivers programs. It has never been done before. There is a significant amount for the Murray-Darling, the most important river system in our nation. We are the ones who have taken the positive steps address those problems. What about coasts and seas? We never saw an oceans policy from the Labor Party. We have developed an oceans policy and a meagre coastal care approach, and this year we are going to be delivering significant finance those matters. World heritage: there are significant funds for our parks, Great Barrier Reef, this year-$18 million. Look at our forests. Look at all the debate we have had in this parliament over the years about forests. For the first time this governhonourable ment has reached a policy consensus to provide certainty in the forests. I have I commend the Minister for Primary Induspromise? No. tries and Energy in this regard for the work that he has done to provide certainty in this area. We are providing further funds for the development of those regional forest agreements to underpin the requirement of balanced use of the forests, generating regional Australia. They are the things that the people of Australia want to see. Finally, we are taking some steps towards protecting the environment. I always found it interesting that we heard a lot of rhetoric from the Labor Party about the environment over the years. I am in a position to know; I sat over on that side and represented this particular area right throughout the 1980s. Not once can I remember you people talking about urban air pollution, a major issue in this country. We are now having a national into quiry into urban air pollution. These are issues that go to the long-term benefit for our future generations. You did nothing about it. You ignored it. This government promised it would do something in this budget and it has done it. Savings Rebate Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme",77
142,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, are you aware of today's report on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald which states that, while you will pocket a tax rebate of $450, a battler with only $3,000 in the bank earning three per cent interest will to be entitled to a rebate of only $13.50 a year as a result of your pathetic savings scheme? Mr Crean-A year!",78
143,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, $13.5D a year. Won't this benefit for battlers be annihilated by your new drugs tax, which the pharmaceutical for industry and the AMA claim will force patients to pay up to $30 a month for more such as the effective and safer drugs?",78
144,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-Can I say that the savings rebate, in the interests of simplicity, has been made non-means-tested. I ought to tell the gentleman that I will not be claiming it-and it is up to you not to claim to say it. Are you going to make an equivalent Mr Lee interjecting",78
145,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Dobell will resume his seat.,78
146,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you going to make an jobs in equivalent promise?,78
147,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the honourable member for Denison on a point of order.,79
148,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What's this all about?,79
149,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, repeatedly during this question time ministers addressing the House have asked questions of the opposition, and that is not in order.",79
150,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order and you know it. Resume your seat.,79
151,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I repeat that, in the interests of simplicity, this measure has been made non-means-tested. I would remind the House that last year, when we introduced a measure to tax high income earners, to impose a surcharge on high income earners, what did the Australian Labor Party do? They moved heaven and earth to try to stop that measure going through. As for your allegation about drugs, the proposal that the government has introduced there is an eminently sensible proposal. It is a proposal that seeks to use the taxpayer dollars of the Australian battler in a more prudent fashion. It will put an appropriate discipline on the growth of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The essential principle of it is that, if two drugs of equal clinical value are available, the subsidy will be available for the less expensive one. It is an eminently sensible proposal which the government will defend. Budget 1997-98: Education",79
152,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Government and nongovernment schools in my electorate of Hughes will welcome the federal government's commitment to education and the needs of Australia's young people to be equipped for their future. I ask the minister how students, parents and schools will benefit from the Commonwealth budget and how the federal government's school policies compare with those recently advocated by the opposition.",79
153,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hughes for her question. Last night's budget reaffirmed the government's commitment to the education, and the quality education, of Australia's three million school students. Unlike the Labor Party, this government cares about the literacy and numeracy needs of young Australians and recognises the importance of these needs for young Australians to get jobs. The budget provides an extra $152 million for Australia's 10,000 schools. Commonwealth funding is increased in this budget by some four per cent, up from $3.6 billion to $3.75 billion in 1997-98. This includes $160 million for literacy to help ensure that every child is reading and writing properly at the end of grade 3, $156 million for special learning needs and $54 million for languages. It also includes some $20 million from the vocational education and training budget to expand vocational education offerings in schools. This government is delivering on its promise to improve education standards after the disastrous period of Labor in office. The legacy of 13 years of Labor is that one in three 14-year-olds cannot read properly and that many young people are dropping out of school because they cannot find relevant programs that will help them to get jobs. The new Labor spokesman for education, the member for Werriwa, has also unveiled Labor's new education policy. No-one in this chamber knows about this policy, I feel sure, because it did not receive any press coverage, which was lucky for the member for Werriwa because his policy could lead to the closure of 300 schools. In a speech to the Centre for Public Policy at Melbourne University some two weeks ago he stated that the Labor Party would introduce a minimum enrolment number of 50 students per school before a school would get funding from the Commonwealth, with a minimum enrolment of 20 students in rural and remote areas. And he said-he made this claim-that schools with these numbers of students did not have the support of their communities and he would not fund them. The shadow minister is a new boy, but let me just tell him a few facts. There are at least 331 government primary schools in Australia with 20 or less students in them and 35 nongovernment schools. Mr Latham-We're not talking about government schools. It's the enrolment benchmark",79
154,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I see, it only applies to nongovernment schools. That is what the shadow minister said. Here is the discriminatory, unfair, inequitable ideology of the Labor Party clearly stated by the shadow minister. What is educationally unsatisfactory for non-government schools is educationally quite satisfactory for government schools. He will close them all; 366 schools could close in regional and rural Australia-because that is where these schools are-under the education policies announced by the member for Werriwa. That is what Labor thinks of regional and rural Australia. It is a kick in guts for regional and rural Australia. You have nothing positive to put forward: all you can think about is your ideology-your narrow, harsh, discriminatory, inequitable ideology-and you are going to impose that again if you ever get back into government. This government believes in fairness for all Australians and fairness to regional Australia. It stands for the rights of all students to to read and write properly. Savings Rebate",80
155,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Since the Prime Minister has said that he will not accept the $450 savings rebate, will he then join me in supporting an amendment that I will move to his legislation to ensure that all people at our level are income tested out of this?",80
156,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I won't and I'll tell you why. I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition, who is utterly predictable, has asked me this question because it gives me an opportunity to say quite unequivocally that I believe that this is the kind of savings initiative for which all income earners in this country should be eligible. If you really want to encourage savings you ought to do so. The question of whether somebody who is eligible for a particular benefit claims it or not is a matter of personal choice. Once again the Leader of the Opposition is engaging in complete humbug. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Questions on Notice",80
157,Mr MOSSFIELD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I ask, understanding order 150: would you write to the Minister for Family Services requesting an answer to question 1440, standing in my name, which was put on the Notice Paper on 4 March?",80
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I will write to the honourable the minister on your behalf and seek a solution to the question. Members' Travelling Allowances,80
159,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Given the answer in the question time from the Minister for Administrative Services, will you authorise release of those details of allowances administered by the Department of the House of Representatives to supplement those details to be tabled by the Minister for Administrative Services?",80
160,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As members would be aware, there are a range of payments made learn by the Minister for Administrative Services and a range of payments made by my department to members. We are in the process of compiling this information and I expect, if it is the wish of the House, to table this information in the next sitting period .. World War II: Misappropriation of Money",80
161,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,On 20 March I addressed a question to the Prime Minister in respect to misappropriation of funds made available for the care of prisoners of war. On the 25th I asked you if you could ask the Prime Minister to answer that question. So far I have not received an answer. Could you take it up with him again?,80
162,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. I will take the matter up again on your behalf with the Prime Minister. AUDITOR·GENERALS' REPORTS,80
163,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I present the Auditor General's audit report No. 31 for 1996-97 entitled Performance audit-Medifraud and inappropriate practice-Health Insurance Commission. Motion (by Mr Reith)-by leave-agreed to: That: (l) this House authorises the publication of the Auditor-General's audit report No. 31 of 199697; and (2) the report be printed.,80
164,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Papers are tabled as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the papers will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and Hansard. The schedule read as followsAudit Act-Auditor-General-Report on the audit of the Australian Wheat Board 1995-96. Treaties-List of multilateral treaty action under negotiation or consideration by the Australian Government. Treaties-Joint Standing Committee-1st report, August 1996-Government response. NA Motion (by Mr Reith)-by leave-agreed to: That standing order 48A (adjournment and next meeting) be suspended for the sitting on Thursday, 15 May 1997. NA Budget 1997-98",81
165,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the budget to generate jobs and provide financial security for retirees. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",81
166,Mr GARETH EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In my 20 years now in this parliament, seven of them in opposition and including quite a lot of accumulated experience of other countries during that time, I can recall no budget speech more arrogantly and complacently unresponsive to the real economic needs of a country than that of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in this place last night. And nowhere was that failure more evident than in the arrogant, contemptuous failure to deal constructively with the issue of jobs and job security, overwhelmingly the biggest economPAPERS ic problem this country now confronts. That was not the only failure in last night's budget. The failure to provide financial security for retirees, in a way that both we and the government had promised in previous years and in a way that we have been discussing in question time today, was an outrageous failure. It was lousy in its morality and its economics, and it is a failure we are going to hear more about later in this debate. So too was outrageous the failure to deal decently with Australian families, particularly the struggling and disadvantaged members of our community who will continue to be subject to the kind of onslaught by this budget that was commenced last year, and on which issue you will be hearing a great deal more from us in the period ahead. But the greatest default last night in the budget was unquestionably on the subject of jobs. There was just one sentence on the subject of unemployment in that entire 12page speech. There was no expression from the Treasurer of any human concern about the scale of the tragedy unfolding out there in the community, with 800,000 Australians wanting work who are out of work. There was not even an expression of economic concern about the tragic waste of resources that is involved in that underutilised human potential. Nowhere in the Treasurer's speech last night was there any expression of regret that unemployment had in fact become worse over the 15 months that they have been in office, increasing from 8'12 per cent to the nearly 8%that we see at the moment. There was no apology for the fact that youth unemployment is now worse, nor for the fact that long-term unemployment has now become the highest it has been for the last two years, with nearly a quarter of a million people--on yesterday's figures-now out of work in that category. There was no recognition that job creationin the way that it had to be stimulated if we were going to see some advance in the situation which is now so tragic for so many people-has simply evaporated. There was no analysis, moreover, in last night's speech of why all this has happened. There was no analysis as to why economic growth has fallen away, no analysis of the impact of the slashing of so many Public Service and public sector jobs over the last 15 months-the last two budgets. There was no analysis of the impact of abandoning industry support policy in the way that occurred on such a spectacular scale in last year's budget. There was no analysis of the impact on the unemployment situation of abandoning regional support policy, which was such a crucial part of our approach to this, but now has disappeared completely from the horizon. There was no analysis of the effect on rising unemployment of cutting education and training funding, abandoning the job readiness and the labour market job skill training programs that were so crucial a part of our strategy. There were no positive proposals in last night's speech to do anything whatsoever about generating jobs, generating job security in the future. It was all a barren, tragic land on this issue last night. You turned the pages of that speech and of the other budget documents, looking for inspiration, leadership, direction and some hope on this issue. All of us found absolutely, precisely nothing. The truth of the matter is that, for this government, unemployment is a second, third or fourth order problem. However, there is no doubt that it is not a second, third or fourth order problem so far as the Australian community is concerned. The most recent opinion poll evidence of that was the AGB MCNair poll just before the budget, reported in the Sydney Morning Herald: 'Voters put employment top of their budget list.' Sixty-seven per cent of respondents rated the reduction of unemployment as the most important issue the budget should address. The truth of the matter is that out there in the community there was a big expectation that this budget would address the unemployment problem head on, that we would hear from the government a spelt-out set of strategies to stimulate growth and restore those labour market programs that were so crucial in establishing job skills and job readiness but which were slashed last year, that we would see something to restore the incentives and support to efficient industries to generate new jobs, and that we would see something to generate new momentum in the regions, especially those which have been hard hit by recent economic or business decisions, Newcastle being prominent and conspicuous among them most recently. The community had hoped that we would see some money spent and some commitment made to straight out job creation programs, in order to cover the very real transitional problems that exist in our community at the moment while we are waiting for growth to take hold and other measures to generate more sustainable jobs. But those expectations were profoundly and comprehensively disappointed. On all of these issues the Treasurer had three-fifths of fiveeighths of damn all to say, and that was outrageous and a disgrace. Whether or not the government admits it, we all know the scale of the problem of waste- unemployment--or I hope we do. The question is what the government can and should be doing about it. The government's response, as we have heard over and over again, is to say, 'It is all a matter of labour market flexibility. The cyclical problem will look after itself and, as to the structural problem of unemployment, labour market flexibility will fix that under the workplace relations bill when it comes into full force, effect and operation.' But, frankly, there is absolutely no-one in the country who believes that to be true, including the Reserve Bank Governor, Mr Ian Macfarlane. At the ANU in September last year, he gave a very polite little answer on the issue of whether labour market flexibility, through the present legislation, would have that effect-about as polite as a Reserve Bank governor ever gets when he is rejecting a policy position on which the government of the day has its heart. The Reserve Bank Governor said, very politely and very kindly, that he was agnostic. He did not believe it and nobody believes it. It is possible that, if labour market reform, so-called, is taken to the kind of extremes that some people on the other side want to take it to--if we do go down the American path of having a deregulated labour market that will result in that market being cleared at poverty wage levels-then we might do something to improve the notional level of people in employment. But at what social cost? It is no good going down the US path unless you are prepared to accept with those US figures the whole box and dice of US social problem implications that flow from it. As Ken Davidson said the other day in a very interesting article, it is all very well to pare the US figures with ours, but you have to take into account, among other things, that there is one very big difference between the American labour market and ours, that is, a very significant proportion of it is in gaol. There is about four per cent of the American work force tied up in the correction system at any given time. I am not making a cheap point against the social conditions in America. I am simply making the point that there are social consequences when you have an economic system that pushes people into depressed wages and that creates the kinds of social conditions that the other side of the House over there is so keen to talk about. You cannot get there by decent means unless you adopt a completely different strategy. The truth of the matter is that, to generate jobs in Australia, you have got to have a much more sophisticated, multifaceted strategy than anything we have seen capable of emerging from the other side of parliament at the moment. You have got to have, in fact, a strategy which addresses simultaneously five different issues. The first thing you have to do is generate internal demand in the domestic Australian economy through budgetary and interest rate policy which is growth oriented and deliberately designed to generate that demand. The second thing you have got to do is harness the domestic Australian economy to the international economy so that you get the benefit of extra demand that is out there, particularly in our own Asian region. That means trade policy and foreign policy that integrates Australia with that external demand and makes it possible to take maximum advantage of it. The third thing you have got to have is industry and regional development policy which is supportive, selectively crafted and operates in such a way as to translate that generalised demand into specific business opportunities and specific job opportunities. The fourth thing you have got to have is job skill creation through education, training and labour market programs that ensure that you have got the skill base in the Australian economy to take advantage, again, of that com- demand when it picks up through your other strategies. If you do not do that, you get inflationary bottlenecks through skills shortages--even worse, you export the job opportunities overseas. You abandon at your peril education, training and labour market and job readiness programs. They are crucial to ensuring that you can manage the process. Finally, what you need-I make absolutely no apology for saying this the other day and saying it very often-are some transitional job creation strategies to recognise the reality that we now have a very large pool of long-term unemployed people who, with all the formal skill training in the world, are going to find it difficult for quite some time yet-until this economy picks up and stays picked up for a long time yet-to get jobs. Work for the dole is no solution in this situation. You have got to be prepared to actually get out there and create through carefully crafted public spending jobs that do, in fact, meet community needs, through environmental measures and community service measures of this kind can provide rewarding and fulfilling job experiences and can provide, hopefully, some experience and training that will make people more job ready for the future but nonetheless just meet that need of keeping people in work. You need to address every single one of those things to get it right about jobs. How many of those issues, how many of those five themes, were addressed in this budget last night, in anything this government has had to do? Answer: none of them. The government has misconceived the nature of the task, misconceived the nature of its policy responsibility-abandoned its policy responsibilityon every one of those fronts. So far as growth is concerned for a start, beginning at the beginning-I have about one minute on each of them-this is not a growth oriented budget any more than was last year's budget. The forecast is for 3% per cent. That is less than what the growth needs to bemust be-if we are going to make a significant inroad on unemployment by generating a higher level of demand in this country. We are perfectly capable of generating four-plus per cent growth. We did it for our last three years in office, and a good deal of the period before that as well, and we saw unemployment coming down as a result-from 11 per cent to 8Y2 per cent--over that period. You have to go out there and have deliberate strategies, however-both budgetary and interest rate strategies-to achieve that result. It does not just happen, and it certainly does not happen if your whole approach to budgeting is contractionary, if you are obsessed with the balance and surplus bottom lines, if you do not understand the dynamics that are at work in the economy, and if you are simply not interested in generating the growth that the economy is capable of delivering. Of course that growth has to be sustainable. You have to have regard to the inflation constraint. You have to have regard to the current account constraint. But, on all the knowledge we have about the way the economy is structured at the moment, the way it is working, those constraints are not applicable in such a way as to inhibit growth moving along at much better than four per cent. The government has no confidence, obviously, that it is capable of generating that level of growth. Certainly, the figures that it is using about the unemployment that will flow from the growth that it is predicting are simply themselves hardly believable. But they are not very satisfactory figures at that. The trade point needs to be made very quickly. You do have to have active strategies if you are going to harness the Australian economy to the external one. That does not just happen. You have to have good, sensible trade policy and good, sensible foreign policy-God help us-and you have to have trade promotion strategies which are designed, again, to make those linkages. What have we seen in the last budget and this one? We have seen the decimation of the capacity of Austrade to do the job that everyone knows it can. We have seen the decimation of EMDG and ITES and a whole variety of trade promotion support mechanisms and budgetary mechanisms that were crucial for us making that connection. One of the things tucked away in this budget, which frankly just appals me, is that we have seen the demise of NTIOC-the National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference. Started three or four years ago, it has become Australia's most successful window on the trading world-literally thousands of delegates, a huge event in Melbourne each year. Now, for want of $1.3 million worth of government subsidy, it has been abandoned on the never-never promise that maybe it will be picked up the following year by some private company if there is a buck to be made from it. Industry and regional development policyit speaks for itself. This is a government which has just created a barren vacuum so far as that is concerned. It does not understand the necessity for having targeted strategies. It is not business welfare, it is national welfare-as Heather Ridout from the MTIA was saying the other day-to have sensible research and development strategies. It is not business welfare, it is national welfare, to have carefully crafted subsidies and strategies that are designed for particular industry sectors inherently affected and for particular struggling regions-like South Australia, like Tasmania and like Newcastle-to have that support which enables us to make a difference. We have seen what has happened with education, training and labour market programs. They were decimated last year and have remained decimated. They have not been picked up in any rational or sensible way by further measures in this budget. If anything, things have gone backward with a further cut in vocational training and, overall, a reduction in support in those sectors. As for job creation, all we have got is the whiteboard federation plan looming its scurrilous scamlike head so far as the future-18 months out before the election-is concerned, plus the work for the dole, which is not going to produce the kind of training experience or work experience that will make any difference to anyone. (Time expired)",81
167,Mr FAHEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What a pathetic attempt! The matter of public importance itself relates not just to job creation but also to financial security for retirees. There was not one word from the spokesman on behalf of the Labor Party, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), on the question of financial security for retirees. The reality is that financial security for retirees was a focal point in last night's budget. The honourable member from the Labor Party had every understanding of that and refused to address it because there was nothing to say other than to congratulate the government on the manner in which it has brought forward a number of initiatives that will give that security to so many people in our community. The Labor Party cannot and will not ever be able to stand up with any credibility on the question of employment. We heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in question time today assert the fact that, in the last year of Labor, 57,000 jobs were created. Let me take the House through the last five years of Labor. The last five years of Labor saw a net increase in full-time employment in this country of 7,100 jobs. It started in the early 1990s when, of course, the recession we had to have destroyed over 300,000 jobs in this country. That recession we had to have was as a result of a major contribution from the then Labor government to the economic policies governing this nation. The Labor Party was 300,000 behind as they started the 1990s, and who became the minister for employment in December 1991? It was none other than the current Leader of the Opposition. What was the unemployment figure in December 1991? I will tell you. The unemployment figure was 10.4 per cent in December 1991. Two years transpire and we move to December 1993. Who was still the minister for employment? It was none other than the current Leader of the Opposition. What was the unemployment figure in December 1993, two years after the current Leader of the Opposition had the opportunity to do something about jobs, to reduce unemployment in this nation? The unemployment figure in December 1993 was 10.6 per cent. Over two years under the stewardship of the now Leader of the Opposition, unemployment increased by 0.2 per cent from 10.4 per cent to 10.6 per cent. To tum around that very important problem, which is very much in our focus, very much to the forefront of the policies which we have instituted, this government has put the conditions, the foundations, the ingredients in place. The ingredients are, firstly, to stop the waste that we saw under Labor, to stop the increasing burden of debt, to stop spending what we do not have. We have already seen a $12 billion turnaround in terms of the management of the Commonwealth's finances in the context of three budgets-last year's, this year's and leading to next year's. That in itself has an impact downwards on inflation. That in itself has an impact downwards on interest rates. That in itself, with the initiatives of last night to encourage national savings, leads to that climate which gives certainty to small business, in particular. It gives the confidence that small business needs to expand. They have stable inflation at the lower end locked in. They have low interest rates, and there is every indication that those interest rates will continue to remain low on the basis of the policies of this government. And we can add to that initiatives promised before the election, delivered in full at the last election, to assist small business-the engine room of growth. Not only did we deliver on the provisional tax uplift factor reduction from eight per cent to six per cent and on the tax involvement in the capital gains rollover, not only did we deliver on bringing through reform of the labour market-the opportunity for flexibility, the opportunity for enterprise agreementsand not only did we bring them through in our first year, but we also responded to the Bell small business deregulation task force with a very significant commitment to getting rid of that red tape. We responded with a further $600 million over four years of support for small business. We continued to do that in last night's budget. We have public savings because this government will not operate on deficits, not like our predecessors. We will not spend what we do not have. We have private savings through last night's initiatives that were given in the context of the budget that was delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), and the encouragement there for people to save and to get a tax rebate for the first time. We heard today in the House a whole lot of posturing on the question of what it means. Let me say just one thing in terms of what it means: for anybody who gets any deduction in terms of their savings-if it is as little as $1, if it is as little as $100 or if it is as as $450-it is all a hell of a lot more than they were ever going to get under Labor's policies because Labor never had an initiative to encourage savings in respect of the public generally. They certainly did nothing to make a contribution towards national savings on the basis of the debt and deficit programs which they went into year after year. We will pay off $5 billion of debt in the course of being in government for just 14 months. We have set in place programs and a fiscally responsible approach that will lead to a halving of public debt. We are paying $10 billion in interest at this point in time. That was doubled in the last five years of Labor. We will reduce it by half by the turn of this century, and that leaves room to put in place other programs as we stop paying for the debt that Labor ran up. Let me just go to some specifics in terms of the programs in last night's budget. What is the natural heritage fund if it is not a job creation program? There is $1% billion there for job creation programs, particularly in respect of regional Australia. What is the integrated rural policy, $200 million? It is about assisting those who are out there on the land and it is about ensuring that they continue to not just survive but progress and employ in the process. What is the Federation Fund about? Tell the people in the ACT that several tens of miIIions of dollars in the building industry in the territory is not going to create jobs and they will laugh at you. That is what Labor is trying to bring forward. What is the work for the dole scheme? It is a base for people to get the understanding of what working is about to progress through to some meaningful job as they go past that particular point. What about the money that is in this year's budget for the apprenticeships and the traineeships? There is additional funding for those. There is incentive and encouragement in dollars for big business to extend the traineeship program. There is support there to ensure that those who have lost their jobs are picked up again. What does the $76 million dollar for AQIS mean? It means hundreds of jobs to ensure much that diseases do not creep through our borders. What is the small business innovative fund? It gives $130 million to small and medium sized enterprises to get out there, to get some additional work, to expand and to create jobs. Labor can throw buckets of money at employment programs-as they did under One Nation-but they did not bring unemployment figures down; they did not create real jobs. The economics spokesman from the Labor Party was out there yesterday saying that what we really need to do is develop some sort of transitional job creation, some sort of artificial program that will ensure that there is a transition that will assist. You have to have a base; you have to have an economic climate; you have to have policies in place that lead to sustainable growth. We started that program last year. We have continued it and expanded on it this year. That will bring certainty and confidence. What this budget delivers in terms of that confidence is a number of things. Let me just comment on a couple of them. We have business investment continuing to grow. It grew last year; it will continue to grow strongly this year. We have the housing industry going through a recovery after having an oversupply for years. The housing industry is just so important to what happens in our economy . We have consumer spending strengthening. That is one of the indicators that we all wanted to see come back. We are now seeing signs of that coming back. We have inflation remaining low and interest rates are down. We have the foundations in place to see growth and to see employment develop in the private sector. Labor did not address the financial security for retirees. Let me say a few things about it. It is in the motion, but the honourable member for Holt did not say one word about the financial security for retirees, despite the fact that he put up this matter of public importance. How important was it that you had 15 minutes to talk about financial security for retirees but did not say one word about it? Mr Gareth Evans interjecting",85
168,Mr FAHEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, he tells me that he is going to have his second speaker address it. He obviously had nothing to say about it because he could have only said what a good job the government has done. Let me just say a couple of things that will not amount to blowing my own trumpet or the government's trumpet on that particular issue. Let me quote a number of statements that have come since last night on the question of retirees. The Council on the Ageing said: The Government has definitely improved its outlook on community needs in this Budget compared to last. The Investment Funds Association said: The other announcements in the Budget package clearly mark out this Government's retirement income policy and will contribute to community certainty. The Minerals Council of Australia said: . . . the decision to abandon the second tranche the legislated tax cuts in favour of measures to stimulate savings is welcomed. The Master Builders Association said: The Government therefore is commended for pursuing job growth as one of its main policy priorities. What we have seen is a ringing endorsement from a number of people in respect of jobs and a ringing endorsement from a number of organisations in respect of retirement policy. What does that retirement policy do? It gives incentive and encouragement to Australians to put some money into superannuation because they will get a tax deduction for every dollar they put in. It gives incentive and encouragement for people to go into a number of other forms of saving to look after themselves. We preserve the benefits. Labor talked about it but never did it. We have done it. We have preserved the benefits of the contributions by employer or employee to ensure that there are benefits there for their retirement. We give to the self-funded retirees greater financial security because every one of those who is living off their income will get the full $450 tax rebate that is there for savings. So it is very clear that there are some considerable initiatives in this budget relating to the financial security of retirees. The savings initiatives used for retirement or any other purpose apply to everybody. They do not apply on a discriminatory basis-which is what Labor was proposing under their illfated, stupidly prepared l-a-w tax cuts. The sort of policy that Labor pronounced years ago never provided the money, never put it into the budget, never ensured that it was ever going to happen because they knew they could never face their union mates on that question and say, 'We're going to hit every person on a wage, the battlerswhatever their rates are-including all union members, with a three per cent after tax additional tax slug.' That is how you were going to finance it at the end of the day . You never would have delivered, you never could have delivered and it was only going to relate to those people in the work force. The self-funded retirees know that they of have an additional $450 this year in addition to what they got last year, which was the increase in the threshold of the tax that they paid-up from $5,400 to nearly $11,OOO--and in addition to the fact that they got tax deductibility for private health funds through last year's budget. We have given, in addition to those two initiatives, a further $450 this year. The ringing endorsements that are coming into this government are clearly a recognition by those people approaching retirement and in retirement. The associations that represent them are very clearly indicating that they appreciate and applaud what the government has done to give them the financial security that is there. The deferred pension bonus plan is another initiative that encourages people to make some provision-by choice, not by compulsion. The compulsion that Labor proposed under l-a-w is not part of what this government is about. Quite clearly, this budget is about job creation because it has the fundamentals in place. It has the climate right. It has the ingredients there to ensure that business expands and has certainty about its investment. It has national savings improving to ensure that there is investment that will flow from those savings that are there. It is about jobs. Growth will come. It is about retirement financial security.",87
169,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) talks about ringing endorsement. I think he is hearing the wrong sort of bells. After this budget, the bells toll for the. We heard from the Minister for Finance about what they were doing about employment. The simple facts of life are that in the last 14 months that this government has been in office, employment has increased by 92,000 and full-time employment has increased by a miserable 4,000, compared to Labor's last 14 months in office, when employment increased by 263,000 and full-time employment increased by 192,000. So do not talk to us about all the jobs you are going to create; just try to match us. This budget shows that you have no possible hope of matching us. You are on track to fall short of our job creation program in the last three years by 290,000 jobs. You are on record for a shortfall of 290,000 jobs on the projections in this budget. So do not lecture us about employment. You are failing massively on employment compared to the previous government. The centrepiece of this budget is the savings rebate scheme. That scheme is a rip-off and a sham. It is a rip-off because all wage and salary earners and many self-employed people will now be deprived of the hundreds of dollars per year they would have received from Labor's savings scheme which this government promised to introduce in the election campaign but has now scrapped. It is a sham because, whilst it masquerades as a boost to savings, the real story is that, unlike Labor's savings scheme, it will reduce national savings. Let me go to the rip-off point. In the 1995 budget everyone will remember that Labor promised to introduce a savings scheme funded from the second leg of the tax cuts, which would require all employees to contribute three per cent out of their after tax pay into superannuation and there would be a matching co-contribution from the government, dollar for dollar, up to $1,000, or three per cent of average weekly earnings at that time. It was subject to an income test, which would phase it out at twice average weekly earnings. During the election campaign the coalition promised to introduce that savings scheme if they were elected. Let there be no walking away from that. Page i of the 'Federal coalition's superannuation and retirement incomes policy' says: The Coalition will meet the Government's cocontribution commitment. It is absolutely clear. They talked about reserving the right to vary the mechanism, but the commitment to meet the co-contribution in full was made, and made several times. It was a promise they made to the Australian people. It is a $4 billion promise, which they walked away from last night. It was a $4 billion promise which they pulled the plug on. Most wage and salary earners and many selfemployed who would have benefited from Labor's scheme are big losers as a result. Under Labor a worker on average weekly earnings who contributed $1,000 a year to his superannuation fund would have received a matching $1,000 from our co-contribution into his superannuation fund. Under the HowardCostello scheme his $1,000 contribution to superannuation gets him a tax rebate of $150. That is $850 a year short. He has been ripped off by $850 a year-the $850 he was promised by this government. It is extraordinary that they can pretend they never made this promise and try to walk away from it and say, 'Hey, you're a big winner here; there's a beaut scheme here for you.' The fact is that these people-millions and millions of Australians-are losers as a result of this action by the government last night. It is important to note that to get the $450 rebate that is all over the press, you have to have $3,000 of superannuation contributions or investment income of $3,000. It is only those who have substantially high incomes and that level of superannuation contribution or that level of investment income who are going to benefit. Someone on $100,000 a year would get a $450 rebate on their $3,000 superannuation contribution under the Howard-Costello scheme. Under us they would have got nothing because they would have been means tested out of it. Our scheme was designed to help the low and middle income earners, not the well off. The HowardCostello scheme is the reverse. It is all about helping the well off. Only reasonably well off people are likely to have $3,000 a year in investment income, as I have said. People with little or no savings, such as low income earners, low income families especially, pensioners and the unemployed will receive little or no benefit from this scheme because they have little or no savings on which to receive the investment income. Someone with savings of $5,000 and interest income of $250 would receive a rebate of 72c a week. Wowee! The scale of this rip-off is just immense. When fully operational, Labor's scheme would have paid over $4 billion a year. This scheme gives just over $2 billion when it is fully operational. So it is a $2 billion plus off. It is a rip-off from low and middle income earners in this country, not the rich, who are the beneficiaries of this. They are benefiting while everyone else is suffering. That is what this scheme is all about. The government's scheme is an absolute rip-off. There is no doubt that this scheme is a complete rip-off for low and middle income earners and that this government is cheating them of several hundred dollars a year without a word of apology. No-one has said, 'Gee, we're sorry we can't afford this;' they just pretend they never made the promise and try to tell them that there are some goodies here for them. They should be apologising abjectly for their total breach of promise and failure to deliver. It is not just to deliver in terms of the individuals in Australia; it is delivering for the nation. As I said, this is a sham of the first order. But the failure to deliver to the people and then refuse to apologise and try to deceive them shows that this is a government which has no shame. In relation to the sham aspect, let me say that their savings scheme does not increase national savings, contrary to the claims made by the government. Labor's scheme, as shown by the Treasury retirement income modelling task force calculations, would have boosted national savings by 1.4 per cent of GOP by 2005 and over two per cent of GOP by 2020. This was on top of the boost that came from the superannuation guarantee scheme, which would have given us another two per cent. We would have increased superannuation savings by 10 times, to $2 trillion by the year 2020. According to Treasury, our scheme would have provided a major boost to national savings, but the additional saving of two per cent of GOP from Labor's SCG scheme has now been lost. Instead, we have a scheme that is likely to reduce savings because, firstly, the money spent on the tax scheme is a loss to national savings. The tax rebate reduces national savings, and the money paid out as a tax rebate will be largely spent because it is paid to people to spend as they like. Most of them will probably save a little of it but they will spend most of it, whereas all of Labor's rippayment with the co-contribution went into savings. There was no leakage to consumption. It was totally saved. This is a dramatic difference between the two. Secondly, because of the way this scheme is designed, the inducement effect for increased savings is likely to be very small because the scheme is not targeted in any way at rewarding additional saving. Instead, it will reward current savers, who will receive a bonus for doing what they were already doing without the bonus. Thus, private pension recipients, shareholders with dividend income, landlords with rental income, investors in interest bearing deposits, investors making capital gains and partners in business will all be eligible for this bonus for doing what they were already doing. Where is the boost to savings? Many of them will fully utilise this with their current entitlements. For many of them there is no incentive to undertake any further savings because they have the maximum investment income they can get from what they are already doing. So why would they bother making any more savings because of this? It will not give them anything. In fact, people could even reduce savings and receive the benefit, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) pointed out in question time. So this measure is little incentive to increase savings. In essence, it is just a handout to those already saving. Also, the scheme does not require people to hold their savings for any length of time. They can get the rebate one year and then spend it the next, which is just ridiculous. In other countries where these sorts of schemes have been introduced there is usually a holding time requirement. My time is running out, but let me say simply: this scheme does not have the approval of Treasury. The mark of that is all Treasury reported in its economic round-up in 1995 that the OECD found that such schemes do not improve savings. Of course, this contains no figures from the retirement income modelling task force showing what the boost to savings will be. Do you know why that is not there? Because there will be no savings. So much for the charter of budget honesty. When the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said that this savings scheme would knock your socks off, he was misreported. What he really said was: 'This'll knock you suckers off.' And in saying that he was 100 per cent right.",88
170,Mr NEVILLE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think the only suckers that were knocked off were the Australian public-knocked off, I might say, by the previous government. Never before have I heard such a pathetic attempt to demolish the coalition's budget. I would like to echo the words of the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey): the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) did not even address half of the matter of public importancepensioners. Obviously pensioners rated very little in the scheme of things when his party was in government and they rate very little now. For the 13 years that Labor was in government, they failed to look after their core constituency and they created for this country high levels of unemployment and huge levels of debt, which threatened not only the battlers but also the security of pensioners. I suppose what logically follows is that because they failed they expect us to fail. Quite frankly, we will not. I do not know why those opposite even put this matter of public importance up for discussion-I suppose it deserves a response seeing it has been listed for today-but I would like to examine two aspects of what they have put before us today. The first relates to the jobs issue. If we are going to create jobs we need, firstly, a climate in which the jobs rate can grow. I reiterate that in this budget there were no new taxes-no new income tax, no new sales tax, no new company tax and no increase in the fuel excise. We have reduced the deficit and, in so doing, removed pressure from interest rates. Clearly, this will encourover it. age small business to create jobs. There is a savings initiative which will reduce the reliance on foreign debt, which in tum will form the basis for steady economic growth. We have the Federation Fund and the Natural Heritage Trust Fund, with a total of $2 billion between them. The focus of these funds is to create not only national pride, pride in our 100 years of government, but also pride in our heritage. But the heritage fund goes further. It goes into rivers, land restoration, various forms of foliage, microenvironments and the like. The opposition feels this money will be spent willy-nilly. Of course it will not. It will be spent in a structured way, and delivering these programs will in tum create jobs. In looking through our budget papers, people will see that, far from neglecting jobs, we have put a lot into creating them. For example, we will spend $1.6 billion on labour market assistance in 1997-98 and, on the work for the dole scheme, $17 million-not to mention our small business package, the reforms to the delivery of employment services to the unemployed and the recently announced changes in IR reform. Then we have $41'h million over three years for the Green Corps. Surely Labor cannot criticise these measures. Members of the opposition have the great gall to come into this place and knock the coalition. Let me take honourable members through part of Labor's record when they were in government. The ALP under Keating drove us head-on into a recession that we had to have. It was the ALP government that destroyed 400,000 full-time jobs. Under Labor, unemployment rose to a massive 11.2 per cent in December 1992, its highest rate since the Depression in the 1930s. Under the ALP, for three years our unemployment rate was higher-note this-than 10 per cent and for 32 consecutive months it was higher than it was at the end of the war-32 consecutive months! You would think that in three budgets they would have been able to make a bit of an impact on that, wouldn't you? From June 1990 to the election of 1996, Labor created only 35,700 new full-time jobs. Under Labor the percentage of people in part-time work looking for full-time work or more hours rose from 19 per cent in 1983 to 26 per cent in 1996. In Labor's last five years of government, youth unemployment went to 27 per cent and at times touched 30 per cent. It is interesting to note that, under the previous coalition government, which experienced a lot of the same difficulties as the former Labor government, youth unemployment never rose above 17 or 18 per cent. As if that was not enough on the national scale, let me take you into the Wide Bay statistical region, made up of my electorate and that of my colleague the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). From December 1991 right through to the election, for had almost consistently, with one or two exceptions, 13 per cent unemployment. At times it went to 14, 15 and 16 per cent. For the three months prior to the election it was at 18.9 per cent and 20 per cent-twice the national average. That was the legacy of Labor in my electorate of Hinkler and in the electorate of Wide Bay. Some legacy! So today in the parliament they adulated themselves for their marvellous labour market programs-these programs that achieved so much for people! They were nothing more than a cruel hoax that recycled youneS people from one level of hopelessness through a period of Indian summer into another phase of hopelessness. Just have a listen to the cost per net impact of some of these programs: jobstart, $3,700-odd; job clubs, $6,100; skillshare, $3,800; jobtrain, $7,000; wait for this one, job skills, $76,500; and the doozey of them all, the much celebrated, the last desperate attempt of Labor to seal their place with the Australian public, the NWO program, the new work opportunities program, $143,000 per net impact. Just think how many jobs that could have created. If that was not enough, we even had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition going through this nonsense that somehow they had a marvellous regional package. Before I came into politics, I spent over 20 years in regional development and I know what regional development is about. If ever I saw a badly structured program, it was the REDO program. It was full of promise and delivered absolutely nothing. If you sat down, took out a pen and analysed what it was offering, you could see that it was really nothing more than a sham. Quite apart from the fact that it duplicated what in five of the six states was already present by way of local regional development boards that could have been quite easily funded by the government, what did they do? They provided $150 million over four years to 41 regions. Just work that out. Take $150 million, divide it by approximately 40 regions, divide it by the number of years, then take off a third-a massive third-for administration and then you can see that it was 41,4 years, we nothing more than a sham. It had no sense of ownership because it was not based on local membership. They were Labor hacks who were appointed to most of these committees. Not only that, they delivered a cargo cult mentality. Everyone thought that this manna was about to come down from heaven, and it did not. They were excessively bureaucratic. They promised at first that there would be no bureaucracy with this-not at all. Within 12 months they were endowing these committees with $200,000 a year for administration. So I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that what we saw today was nothing more than an absolute sham. They were disgraced in government in their labour market programs, they were disgraced in their regional programs, they showed no care for the old and the infirmed and then they have the gall to come in here today and try to criticise what we are doing about jobs and for the aged.

171,Mr CAMPBELL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In speaking on this issue, I find myself once more having to take issue with both sides. I heard the Labor spokesman talking about the importance of their labour market programs. Quite frankly, they were greatly overstated. I was in the Labor Party caucus when Paul Keating said that the future lay in the service sector. The service sector political code for tourism. It was from that point on that we stopped training metal trades apprentices. As a consequence, you cannot get a boilermaker now in Kalgoorlie, Bunbury, Port Hedland, Gladstone or anywhere where there is any development required, because we stopped training them. Australia, the country that used to provide arguably the best metal trades apprentices in the world, now produces drink waiters. It also needs to be made clear that while you have S.7 per cent unemployment, and that is an artificially low figure, there will be a continual erosion of wages and conditions, and there is nothing government or the unions can do about it. I think the opposition are right when they say that there needs to be transitional job creation programs. But they are wrong when they say that work for the dole cannot work. If it is properly structured, work for the dole can be very useful. But I fail to see any reason to believe that the government understand this. If there is going to be work for the dole, it would clearly be much better to administer it through local government, who actually understand the problems. They have the skills to administer and they have the jobs that need to be done. I urge the government to rethink their position and manage their scheme through local government. If you are going to do transitional job creation, it is quite clear that roads are a big priority. Roads in my electorate create real new wealth: every mile of road built has the potential to open up a new mine, creating new wealth and new real employment. Roads built in the city can only cost-and that is a point that seems to be not understood by either party. The best welfare is a job--a good, worthwhile, credible job. There seems to be no evidence that this is on the minds of either party. It is true: there are people in the opposition who believe that a deregulated labour market is the answer. A deregulated labour market can take us down the American road. I have been there and I have seen it. In 1973, the Americans declared class war on their own people and now they have 20 per cent of is those people in gaol. They are incarcerating people at a rate 10 times that of Europe and about four to five times that of Australia. They are using gaol as a remedy for unemployment, and building gaols is one of the growth industries in America. You see areas of very low wages. You see areas where illegal immigrants are being employed at very low prices-being exploited. That is the America of today. It is not a pretty picture. It is certainly not something which we would want in Australia. In the budget, there was a clear absence of an industry policy. But there is no sign either that the Labor Party see a need for an industry policy. They mouth the jargon. In the debate today I heard talk about small business being the powerhouse of job creation. What a fine platitude and how well the government and the opposition like to mouth it. The truth is I do not believe there is any real understanding of the problems of small business and I do not believe that the government come anywhere near in addressing their needs in this budget that was brought down yesterday. There has to be an industry policy. And this does not mean just blind re-introduction of tariffs, although I do not resile from tariffs under some circumstances. There are lots of other things governments can do. One is to change the government's purchasing policyfoolishly changed by a Labor government-to capital cost. The real criterion should be through live cost. If through live cost is the criterion, Australian products shine. Let me just give you a few examples relating to a town on the east coast of Australia-Sydney. In Sydney, you have probably the last integrated truck manufacturer in Au stralia-RFW. RFW were consulted by the Australian Army for the purchase of 55 recovery vehicles. RFW have got a lot of expertise in this area. They are probably the premier constructors in the world of large offroad four-wheel drive vehicles. The army opted for Mercedes-Benz. Each one of these units creates between 2,000 and 2,500 hours of work-in round figures, 137,000 hours of work per year or 34,000 weeks of work. What is the cost of giving that to Germany? They ended up buying from Mercedes-Benz an overgrown Unimog six by six. Given the enormous trouble that we have had with the Unimog vehicles, the need for recovery vehicles is in part to recover the damn things. Another example of the stupidity to deal with is that the army bought Mack trucks because the American army bought Mack trucks. The Americans have much better roads than we do in a lot of our countackle try, where our trucks do not run on bitumen. The trucks were so rough the army could not carry troops in them for any distance. They did this for occupational health reasons. They decided that they would have to change the suspension. Australia invented air suspension. It was invented by Permatrak in they offered to re-equip all the army Macks with the Permatrak suspension-the one commercially chosen not only in Australia but throughout the world-for $16,000 a pop. The army signed the contract with the Americans at $22,000. It is true that RFW did not tender. They just said, 'Take away your 12 inches of tender documents. This is the price. You know it works commercially. Every truck in Australia is running on these things. You know it's a superior product. Our price is this. See if you can better it.' The army signed the contract at $22,000, and the trucks are still unrideable. That is what you are dealing with. And no government seems to have the will, the wit or the wisdom to take on these facts. Let us look at another example-a qangoQantas. Qantas purchased 30 RFW s. Remember, when I am talking about this one little company in Sydney, I am only talking about their construction hours, not about the hours of the people supplying the castings, the electrical or the other components-just their own construction hours. One can undoubtedly add substantially to that figure. Qantas bought 30 of these catering vehicles and they were well satisfied with them. They get a consultant, however, who, for whatever reason, decides that he will buy on price, so he sources the next supply of vehicles-over 100 of them-from Sweden. The first Volvo that came from Sweden fell to pieces. But Qantas will still persevere and buy 100 of these things from Sweden when it could have got a superior vehicle from Australia. The cost difference was not that great and of course the taxpayer of Australia gets an enormous clawback when the government collects a 30 per cent tax on the wages you have that were paid. There is no sign that any government on either side, of any persuasion, is prepared to these real issues which go to the heart of an industry policy. It gets very depressing when you see both sides of this parliament get up and blackguard each other, blame each other for the problems, when it is quite clear that neither of them care or understand what needs to be done. There is so much that we Sydney and can do in this country. I recall when we were buying helicopters for the Australian Army. I was involved in the committee that looked into this. The air force, which were foolishly left in charge of the acquisition, very quickly ruled out the Westland helicopter, for reasons of their own. Westland had a superior machine and they were going to transfer all the technology to Australia. They said to us, 'In five years, you can build helicopters.' We are right next to th(. biggest potential market for helicopters in the world, which of course is China. They said to us on that committee, 'My word, you can build anything in Australia. There is nothing you can't do. You have these enormous facilities-a government aircraft factory that is the best in the world.' Our committee voted for the French because they had a better machine than the Black Hawk and they were giving us transfer of technology. But the government of the day opted for the Black Hawk. Of course the problems that we have with the Black Hawk are now absolutely legendary. I have run out of time. I could talk for hours on this subject. It is close to my heart. Without a manufacturing industry, there are no jobs in the future and there is no end to the current account deficit.",92

NA SURCHARGE (ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION) BILL 1997 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendments(1) Title, page 1 (line 11), omit ""surcharge"", substitute ""tax"". (2) Clause 1, page I (line 17), omit ""Surcharge"", substitute ""Tax"". (3) Clause 16, page 20 (after line 27), after subclause (6), insert: Surcharge debt may be reduced (6B) The member may make payments to the provider for the purpose of reducing the deferred amount in the surcharge debt account. (6C) If a member makes a payment under subsection (6B), the provider must: (a) credit the payment to the surcharge debt account; and (b) acknowledge receipt of the payment to the member; and (c) advise the member of the revised balance of the surcharge debt account.

(8) Clause 43, page 49 (after line 12), after the definition of superannuation (unfunded defined benefits) provider, insert: surcharge (wherever occurring) means a tax.",94
173,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I want to explain that the Senate amendment No. (3) allows members of unfunded defined benefit funds to pay the surcharge liability as it accrues rather than when the benefit is paid. What this means is that members of unfunded defined benefit schemes are treated in the same manner as other superannuation funds where members can make additional contributions to cover the amount of the surcharge. The Senate amendments Nos (4), (5) and (6) are consequential on the amendments to the change in the tax file number arrangements and allow the Commissioner of Taxation to amend an assessment where a tax file number is subsequently quoted and where no surcharge had previously been applied. Senate amendment No. (7) changes the definition of 'adjusted taxable income' to remove eligible termination payments paid from superannuation funds, rollover funds and lump sum payments for unused annual leave and unused long service leave received when an employee's employment is terminated because of bona fide redundancy or under an approved early retirement scheme or because of invalidity. This amendment prevents low and middle income earners being caught up in the surcharge in the year they receive their retirement benefits or other superannuation lump sum payments. The government will be agreeing to those amendments, but let me make it quite clear defini- that the government maintains that the surin charge measure was all about reducing the tax concessionality in superannuation. High income earners gained large tax benefits from the concessional tax treatment of superannuation. The surcharge is not about raising taxes. redundanEven after the surcharge, superannuation continues to receive concessional treatment. The Senate is quite clearly grandstanding and playing for cheap political points by relying on the surcharge and asserting that it is a tax. The government does not accept that the surcharge is a tax. The government does not accept in any way that it has broken any election commitments on new taxes. However, the government does want to get this package of legislation through the House because these bills are now two budgets old. To avoid further obstruction from the Senate over these bills, particularly from the opposition, we will accept the amendments. Despite the claims of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to be supportive of the surcharge, the Labor senators in the upper house defied their leader and voted against the bills in the Senate. Labor senators evidently took the statesman's view that, as the surcharge affected them, the surcharge could not possibly be in the public interest. Let the responsibility for this action in the upper house be squarely on the opposition and minor parties if there are any unforeseen consequences from the amendments to this bill.",96
174,Mr ROCHER,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Ijoin the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in his bemusement at the action of the Labor Party, at the insistence of my Independent colleagues and I voting for these measures in the House of Representatives and then doing exactly the opposite up in the Senate. I do not think anyone could put any rational explanation to that. I expect it will only be a token attempt. Anyway, it did give the Treasurer (Mr Costello) the opportunity to have a few gibes at the opposition in question timeand I suppose that could be said to be entertaining. Equally, of course, I cannot imagine how the minister or his government has the gall to continue the line that a surcharge is not a tax. Look up your thesaurus. 'Surcharge' is a synonym for 'tax'. If you want to play around with the language, you are free to do so of course, but it really is very childish. Why that charade has been perpetuated I cannot understand. Even the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), is embarrassed about it because he knows it to be childish and just an attempt to avoid the use of the correct adjective to describe what the government was proposing to do. I guess after several months of perfecting the art of tax avoidance-the coalition, that is, avoiding calling a tax a tax-the government has finally conceded that its 15 per cent superannuation surcharge is indeed a tax. That is despite the words of the minister who spoke to the motion before the chair. .In agreeing to replace the word 'surcharge' wIth the synonym 'tax', the government is also clearly coming clean to having broken one of its 1996 election promises of no new taxes, as it did indeed with its selective Medicare impost. Why pretend? You have broken a few promises and we understand w-y y-u had to do that, but to go tLr0 ugh wIth thIS pretence is a little bit irksome and I do not think it brings any credit upon the government. The amendments to clause 5 of the original bill. will mean minor changes to the way in which the superannuation tax will be applied to funds for which no tax file number TFN is provided to the fund manager. The g'overn!llent initially intended for the full 15 per cent Impost to be levied against any superannuation account if the account holder failed to provide the TFN. The general consensus amongst the taxation fraternity and fund managers was that that was quite unreasonable. The Senate amendments will have the following effect. If a TFN is not provided, if an individual's superannuation contribution does not exceed the contributions threshold of $2,000 and if the contributions began to be paid before 7 May 1997, then the account will not be subject to the new tax for that year. However, if the TFN is provided at a later date, these contributions will be reassessed and subject to the additional impost. If the contributions amount does not exceed the threshold limit, and if the account holder commenced payments prior to 7 May 1997, then the full 15 per cent tax rate will be levied against the contributions for that year. Any contributions made after 7 May this year will also be hit by the 15 per cent superannuation tax. The Senate nominated 7 Mayas the date of effect, as it was the date on which the amendments were first canvassed. The clear intention was to discourage taxpayers from opening multiple small superannuation accounts in order to avoid paying the new tax. The amendments to clause 5 of the principal act will see little change to the cumbersome procedure that the Commissioner-of Taxation is obliged to follow in obtaining TFNs. (Extension of time granted) The commissioner will be accountable for ensuring that every fund contributor who fails to provide their TFN receives two letters advising them of their compliance obligation. According to the legislation as now proposed, the commissioner is to determine 'the most appropriate' address for each fund member. This is absurd. The commissioner earlier described the super tax as an 'administrative nightmare'. I am quoting the commissioner. It is even more nightmarish after the inclusion of these Senate amendments. How can anyone argue that this amendment me-ts the criteria of simplicity and efficiency, WhICh are two of the three measures of a reasonable tax? Quite simply, it does not. Even the revenue that it is reckoned will be raised by these measures cannot justify the principal measure because it involves bad, bad, bad, bad law-it is bad law. The Senate's amendments have determined that, while the surchargeable contributions threshold for the 1996-97 financial year is $2,000, it will be indexed on an annual basis. That is a reasonable inclusion. The amendments to clause 5 are also of consequence for those in clauses 16 and 19. Clause 16 in the original bill describes the various alternatives for reducing the surcharge debt available to fund members. It also indicates the procedures that the fund provider must follow if a member does opt to make payments to reduce the deferred amount in the surcharge debit account. Consistent with the words of the Commissioner of Taxation, this procedure is unmanageable and is likely to-in fact almost definitely will-increase compliance costs for fund managers. So you have the additional cost of collection because of these amendments on top of already horrendous collection costs and you have equally untenable compliance costs by the fund managers. Nothing in these amendments is going to change that and in fact will exacerbate that state of affairs. all likelihood these increased costs will eventually be passed on to those fund members who are liable to pay this new tax, as well as every other Australian taxpayer who contributes to a superannuation account. Despite the justification for some of these amendments in the Senate, that will be the case. As I indicated in my speech on the second reading of the cognate bills, this tax is destined to affect many people not originally intended to be caught in the net. At the same time, up to 60 per cent of the supposed high income earners, who are the main targets of the tax, are working with their accountants to minimise the effect of the superannuation impost. Some of them will flee from the system. It is as simple as that. Where is the equity in that arrangement? Clause 43 was also amended during debate in the Senate. The effect of this particular amendment will be to exclude those who receive redundancy and invalidity payments from the additional superannuation tax. This is a worthy amendment; this is worthwhile. From the beginning the government handled this legislation in a very careless manner. As a result it has further damaged the already fragile confidence that fund contributors have towards superannuation. Superannuation is not the preferred savings option for most Australians. As I indicated in my speech during the second reading debate, Australians will not use superannuation more than necessary unless they are confident of stability in both the industry and the system. (Extension of time granted) Successive governments have continued to destabilise superannuation, at least since 1994, with the release of legislative changes or media releases affecting the operation of superannuation funds once every 6.5 days on average. When will the madness end? The coalition has remained true to form and follows the example of its Labor predecessor by introducing, in last night's 1997-98 budget, another raft of changes to the way in which superannuation will operate. For those in the industry who were hoping for a halt to the incredible pace of change to superannuation In laws and regulations this must be a disappointing, if not predictable, response by the government. In general terms, the amendments suggested by the minor parties in the Senate and agreed to now by the government are worthwhile. But they will not alleviate compliance costs in the hands of the fund managers and the funds themselves or collection costs to the Commissioner of Taxation and, therefore, the revenue. They are worthwhile; the government has accepted them. However, all they really do is make a very unsavoury tax slightly more palatable.",96
175,Mr MCMULLAN,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Canberra) (4.39 p.m.)It will not surprise anyone to hear that the opposition will not be supporting this motion. The Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill will be better after these amendments than that which the government put to this House and which we thought review in the Senate would have rendered both fairer and more efficient. Many of the criticisms of the efficiency of the scheme outlined by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) are absolutely correct. I do not agree with all of the things he said, but his essential critique of the administrative complexity and the absurdity of the process through which the government has gone in dealing with this is absolutely correct. The problem is that the bill, even after these amendments which do improve it, is simply not good enough. It is like the problem we confronted in this House with the workplace relations bill: the amendments in the Senate improved the bill but left it so profoundly inadequate in key ways that we could not support the motion. We find that again here. As it relates to superannuation, these amendments and the bill as a result of these amendments make absolutely clear-and, once again, the member for Curtin was correct about this-that this government has no fundamental understanding of superannuation at all. It was made crystal clear by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in question time today when he asserted, in response to a question by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), that to get the matching contribution from the government under the previous scheme workers making their own three per cent contributions would have to give up three per cent of their award wages to receive the matching contribution. That is just not true. In other circumstances one might have thought the Treasurer was seeking to mislead the House. But I am absolutely sure he was not; I am sure he just did not have a clue what he was talking about. And he is the minister responsible for superannuation. He just got it wrong. They are wrong again on this, although eventually after nine months of pretending they have at least admitted it is a tax. They still came in and tried to say, 'We are going to vote for it to be a tax but we really think it isn't.' That is taking the ridiculous to a new level of absurdity. The member for Curtin gave one reason that explained simply why it is a tax in terms of the nomenclature but, by any definition, a tax is a law that says, 'Some money that otherwise is in your pocket has to go into the government's pocket.' That is what this is. Pass the law and the money transfers from you to the government, not in return for a particular service for which you are paying a fee but as a compulsory acquisition to the consolidated revenue fund. And that is what this is. At least we will not have to put up with that humbug much longer. The government does not understand superannuation. All it understands is that it hates industry funds. This bill will seriously damage industry funds and the interests of many members who are ostensibly not the target of this legislation. That is where we get to the reason why the opposition will not be supporting these measures. It is funny that we get this incredulity. We said, in the Senate, we ought to have an inquiry into this legislation, but everybody in the House assumes-perhaps I have this naivety because I was in the Senate for a while and I have seen it happen-that you have an inquiry just for fun, that you will never change your point of view no matter what the evidence is. Actually, we listened to the evidence and it was overwhelmingly obvious that there were a number of problems with this bill that meant we could not support it, notwithstanding that we continued to be prepared to support the principle of higher tax on higher income people and their superannuation. If a bill came in that did that, and did not hit lower income earners and effectively miss the target of higher income earners and did not have the capacity still to hit retrenched workers like those in Newcastle, we would be prepared to support it, as we said in the House before. This bill is so fundamentally flawed that low income earners who are not supposed to be the target will be paying this surcharge when you say they will not. They will. Most high income earners will be repackaging their incomes so they will avoid it. Most of the revenue will be coming from people who are not the target and too little of the revenue will be coming from those who are. That will be exacerbated by the extraordinary complexity of this proposal as you try to avoid making it a straightforward tax. (Extension of time granted) While the amendments improve the circumstances for retrenched workers, they still leave them vulnerable. There will still be workersfor example, those retrenched in Newcastle or those thousands more who are going to be retrenched here in my electorate of Canberra-who will be liable to have this surcharge applied to them as a consequence of their redundancy. For example, the amendments exclude some forms of eligible termination payment but not employer eligible termination payments. The amendments exclude some forms of leave but not accrued leave. These concerns mean that there is still the capacity for workers to get forced above the $70,000 cut-off-and it will get worse and worse because the cut-off line is not indexed-because they have had the misfortune to be retrenched. Do not come in here and preach piously that this is a bill designed to hit upper income earners. If you have a bill that does that and does not hit retrenched workers and does not have the unintended consequence of hitting the low paid, we will vote for it. Mr Rocher-But it always did that, and you voted for it down here.",98
176,Mr MCMULLAN,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"But we said here that these were our reservations and we were going to have an inquiry to see if we could develop amendments that would overcome the problem. And we did. But they were not passed. It is quite arguable that we should have said, 'The bill is in an adequate form in the House, take it away,' but, firstly, we can count and, secondly, we felt that it was not impossible to develop amendments in the Senate to improve it. And we did develop those amendments, and we moved them in the Senate. But the government slunk off and did another one of its deals with the Democratsand, to be fair, the amendments make the bill better but they still make it inadequate and unfair. We do know that this is a bill that is going to have the unintended-we hope it is unin-ended-consequence of hitting many low Income workers, and it is going to have an adverse effect on the superannuation of every one of them, even if they are not affected by the tax, for the reason, outlined by the mem?er f?r Curtin, that it will force up the l-tratlve costs of every industry superannuation fund-not as much as some of the changes you proposed last night, which are going to make it worse, but we will deal with those when they come in. Mr Ronaldson-You oppose the budget?",100
177,Mr MCMULLAN,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"These are not budget measures; these are further attempts to wreck superannuation. You outlined them. You have not introduced the bills, but you outlined them last night, and they are revolting proposals. Mr Ronaldson-Which part of the budget are you not going to support?",100
178,Mr MCMULLAN,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"We do not like what you have decided to do in taking the choice about superannuation from workers and giving it to their employers, and we will be arguing against that in here. But that is a problem for another day. What you are doing here is increasing the administrative cost for every superannuation scheme. There is only one way that charge can be met, and that is by increasing administration charges on the overwhelming majority of members of superannuation funds who are low and middle income workers whose retirement income will be adversely affected. So what we have is an absolute botch of appallingly handled and drafted legislation, driven, unfortunately, by the Treasurer and, in the Senate, the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), who have not got the faintest idea what superannuation is about and do not-and never did-understand the detail of their own legislation. We will not be supporting this bill because these amendments, while they improve it, leave the bill inadequate in many ways that I have not had time to address yet. After my colleagues have spoken, I might come back and outline some of those. We will support the principle, whenever you bring back a bill that will deal properly with the principle you sought to introduce when you originally introduced the bill.",100
179,Mr CREAN,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"As indicated, the opposition will be opposing these amendments. I want to make two points which are significant as to why this superannuation legislation is back before us in the adminHouse with some amendments which, even though they make some improvements, still do not go far enough. The first point is that we have finally got the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to fess up. He has been telling this country for nine months that this so-called surcharge is not a tax. Looking at us across the dispatch box, he has got those wafer-thin lips telling us, 'No new taxes'you heard him say it again last night: 'This the government with no new taxes' - and he has had this tax staring people down the barrel ever since he introduced it in the last budget. What a fraud. And he has been exposed. Until recently, he was even going to come into this House, or send his goons into the House, to persist with opposing the amendments because the Senate has now amended his piece of legislation to call it not the surcharge bill but the tax bill-what it should have been called all along but what these people have dishonestly and deceitfully tried to hide from the Australian public. It has taken him nine months to own up, and we know that there are more taxes in the current budget. By the time the next election comes around, you will be exposed for the frauds and deceivers that you are. That is the first point. Let me go to another point. The closure of the Newcastle steelworks has exposed a number of flaws in this government's approach to policy. First of all, it exposed the fact that there is no leadership by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He told Ray Martin that he was going out to Newcastle, but he still has not been there. He is in hiding. The Prime Minister said he was concerned about the people of Newcastle, but he has gone into hiding. He hid from his responsibilities to the BHP steel workers back in 1982 when he was Treasurer, and he is still hiding. Fifteen years is a long time to be hiding, but we will flush him out, because he has to stand up to some responsibility in this country. The Newcastle steelworks has exposed his lack of leadership. It has also exposed the fact that this is a government without an industry policy and a government with no commitment to the steel industry or to developing a steel industry policy. We have a situation in which this government will not lift a finger to save the jobs of the Newcastle workers but which will tax them on the way through. This legislation before the House taxes them. Therefore, we are opposing this bill because they should not be taxed. We have got the hypocrisy of a government front-bench that last night paid its own members a rebate for savings but now is hits Newcastle steel workers with a tax slug. Real concern for the battlers. And tomorrow, when they attend mass meetings to consider what further action they should take and are told of this duplicity, set of double standards and hypocrisy, they will love it. We have a circumstance whereby amendments in the Senate now actually exclude from the superannuation surcharge superannuation payouts which are combined and called an eligible termination payment. Those are excluded, as are any payments from a redundancy package-the things that give you four weeks pay for each year of service. What is not excluded yet by this legislation is any lump sum payment they get by way of accumulated long service leave, accumulated annual leave or accumulated sick leave. They get rolled into the income of steelworkers and get slugged with a tax. If you are prepared to exclude the superannuation payments, why will you not exclude these? More to the point, there is a thing that BHP has already put on the table for its steelworkers-a special employee eligible termination payout-which BHP has signalled it is prepared to pay to any worker who has been with them for more than five years. That, too, will be slugged. This is a tax on loyalty. This is a tax on people who have given their total working lives to BHP, and this miserable government is going to tax them. That is why we are opposing this particular piece of legislation. (Extension of time granted) It is not only the Newcastle steelworkers who are affected-2,500 of them will be affected if BHP goes through with its threatbut also the 1,000 Qantas workers for whom this government has sat on its hands and done nothing to protect their jobs; the 22,500 Telstra workers who, because of their policies, are going to be put on the scrap heap over the next three years; and the further 16,500 public servants they announced in the budget the other day will go. These are all people who are going to be slugged on the way out. These are the people who have committed themselves unstintingly and willingly to the service of this nation and to the service of the companies in which they are employed, and this government is going to tax them for it. This is a government that promised no new taxes, yet they come into this House and slug them with a tax. We could write a new set of those Mr Men books. We have all read them to our kids. We have a new set of Mr Men in this parliament now. The Prime Minister is Mr Wishy Washy-cannot make up his mind on anything. The Treasurer is Mr Smug-labelled today by the business community.

It is too difficult to put a means test on it; we are going to do it for simplicity.' It did not stop you with child care-that is means tested. Why do you not introduce a simple system for that? You frauds! You hypocri tes ! What about the battlers themselves, slugged with this tax? You are there pocketing the $450 million. What compassion!

All he has to do is pick up up, the phone-if he does not know the number, I will make it simpler for him, I'll give him  meeting and develop a strategy for saving the jobs. They then would not be his seat. hit by this tax slug. The fact of the matter is that, whilst we have some improvement through the Senate, are going to fight this all the way. This is why we are opposed to it. This is a government that is detached from reality and a Mr government with no direction, no commitment for and no compassion. We will oppose these Moore)- bills to sheet that point home.",102
187,Mr MCCLELLAND,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Barton) (4.59 p.m.)As the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) pointed out, the government has now changed its tune. It is now calling a tax a tax. Mr Crean-Changed the tune but no frauds, conductor for the orchestra.",102
188,Mr MCCLELLAND,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"There is absolutely no conductor for the orchestra. Perhaps a are draftsman has sorted it out, however. The Senate amendment to clause 43 of the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill says: Surcharge (wherever occurring) means a tax. Of course the draftsman had to say that because a tax is a tax is a tax. It is not just question of semantics-it is much more than that. The failure to call it a tax in the first place has resulted in this lavish, convoluted and ridiculous scheme. We all would have received, I have no doubt, letters from various chartered accountants. I have one from a firm in my electorate which points out that just to communicate with the 15.7 million individual superannuation accounts is going to cost $30 million. It has also been estimated that the cost to the superannuation funds will be $100 million a year. They say that, while the government hopes to raise $450 million in going to be nowhere near that as a result of these administrative complexities which this started because the government wanted to pull a swiftie. They were not prepared to own and call a tax a tax and hence apply the proper collection and administrative procedsecond ures. The second point is that this now admitted tax is something which is going to give the government a windfall gain every time there is a round of retrenchments. are going to see those more and more under this government because the government do not have an industry policy, unless you can call a doctrine of calculated neglect an induslot try policy. That is precisely and only what government have in mind. They are fundaannual mentalists saying, 'If you have a small government, if you retreat and retract from involvement in industry, by some miraculous process of conception the economy is to lift off.' While other countries are promoting their industries, somehow ours is going have life divinely brought into it so that are able to compete on their terms. It does not happen. It is not the real world. We are already seeing that. The Newcastle steelworks is the most recent and dramatic instance of such a tragedy, but we are going to see many, many more of those, as the member for Hotham has pointed out. We are going to see it with Telstra and Qantas and, every time it occurs, the government is going to make a windfall gain at the expense of workers and their families. Many of those workers, particularly if they a are in their 40s and beyond, have virtually my hope and Buckley's of getting another job-this is the only chance they have to provide some sort of stability for their family, to pay off the mortgage a little to get ahead so the family is not destitute as a result of the trauma of having their jobs obliterated. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) still has not answered whether they are going to have to pay for employment assistance or whether they are going to be entitled to free service from the Commonwealth Employment Service to help them find another job. He did not know and he still does not know. He still has revenue, it is not answered that. There are all kinds of ridiculous things in bill. For instance, we are trying to avoid a situation where, if a worker has not providup ed his tax file number, the Commissioner of Taxation has to write him two letters-the letter has to be within three months of the first letter. It does not say what happens if it is three months and one day after the date of the first letter-presumably the process would have to start again or any tax collected Regrettably, we would be invalid. As the member for Hotham said, while there is some advance in excluding eligible termination payments, that phrase itself has a of complexities. It certainly does not the include accumulated long service leave, leave and sick leave. While that is being included in a retrenched worker's termination pay for the purpose of assessing this tax, there is no way that the Labor Party going would support a bill such as this. Mr FITZGffiBON (Hunter) (5.04 p.m.)-I to note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the we Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), who is at the table, has been very agitated throughout the consideration of these amendments. I think his performance throughout the consideration accurately reflects the vulnerability of his government on this issue. Why would the parliamentary secretary not be particularly agitated? He is from a very marginal seat and, just as importantly, he is from a regional marginal electorate. He knows the impact of these bills on his electorate and he really fears them, now he has to sit at the table and wear them. I said throughout my speech on the second reading debate on this package of bills that any browse of the newspapers at that time indicated that these bills from the start have been a farce and they have only been going downhill since then. I think it is fair to say that anyone in this country who knows anythe thing about tax and superannuation arrangenot ments has condemned these bills from the beginning. The parliamentary secretary had a bit to say throughout the second reading debate about the fact that the opposition supported this package of bills. Of course, we did so relucresponsible tantly, but I think it is fair to say that we the responsible thing. I am also happy to that I am not too happy with that proposition because I think there are some faults in the basic principle behind this package of bills. For example, the Prime Minister (Mr participants Howard) tells us consistently that this is package of bills for a new surcharge, which we now know is a tax, targeted at the big end of town. Yet, in my electorate of Hunter have thousands of coalminers who, only because they might work under dangerous conditions, only because they get penalty rates for working unusual shifts, only because they - ften work in dirty conditions, earn more than $70,000 a year. But I could hardly describe them-to use the Prime Minister's term-as the big end of town. These are hard working Australians who put in a hard day's work night's work for just reward. Mr Crean-The real big end of town gets a bonus. Mr FITZGffiBON-Of course, the real big end of town, the white-collar workers, have an opportunity before them to restructure their remuneration packages. My coalminers have that opportunity, so my coalminers will be whacked. Mr MCClelland interjecting Mr FITZGffiBON-As my colleague says, the r--l big end of town will be in a position to utilise family trusts and the like to their assessable income down below the threshold level. As the member for Barton and (Mr MCClelland) has also indicated, the wonderful thing about these amendments is that not only now does Dennis Rose QC believe this is a tax, not only does the opposition believe this is tax, not only does the general Australian community recognise this is a tax, but now the Senate also recognises this is a tax. By accepting these amendments, government now recognises that this is a surcharge but a tax and, as a result, is a blatant breach of a very important pre-election commitment from this government. So we did the responsible thing. We supported the motion for the second reading of these bills. As I said, I think that was a thing to do. But, while we did so, did we pointed out the administrative burdens that say were placed upon small business, the impost on low income earners who might fail to submit their tax file numbers fo their fund managers and that the administrative costs of the fund would be borne not only by fund earning more than $70,000 a year a but also by low income fund participants. The real thing I want to talk about todayI and the main reason I rose today to speak to these amendments-is those workers who will be retrenched from BHP. I asked the Prime - inister yesterday whether he is prepared to gIve them special consideration. 'No,' he said, unequivocally. He gave us a bit of hot air first, but when pushed to answer the question he said, 'No, they'll be treated like every other Australian worker.' That means that or they will be whacked like every other low income earner in Australia. That is the result of this package of bills. The member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) has pointed out that the Senate amendments do improve the package of bills, but that they are far from amendments that are satisfactory to us. That is why the opposition has chosen do not to oppose them in this place.",102
189,Mr MCMULLAN,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Canberra) (5.09 p.m.)There are a number of extra issues to which I previously indicated I wish to refer-and I will deal with some of those in a moment. I simply want to make it very clear to the bring House-and some will not understand it, I know, because there are a couple of big words here-that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), when he spoke for the opposition when the Superannuation Contribution Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill came forward initially, said that while the opposition did not oppose the principle of this legislation-and that, therefore, he would not be voting against the motion for the second reading-it was an unholy mess. We moved an amendment then which said that it should be withdrawn and redrafted to achieve its purpose. That was defeated by the government, which felt that it was fine. We moved the same amendment at the proposition second reading stage in the Senate and said that the principle this bill was trying to achieve was okay but that it was a messcriteria exactly as the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) made clear. We said, 'Take it away and come back with a bill that actually does what you purport it to do. Come back with a bill does hit the upper income earners, whom you are going to miss, and doesn't hit the lower of the states. income earners, whom you are going to hit, and that does not create all the administrative mess, the constitutional uncertainty and the chaos in the superannuation system that proposal will create.' But you defeated that proposal in the Senate. Therefore, we are confronted with different circumstance where we have to with the final consequence of your failure get this bill in order. We have given you every chance to implement a principle we share, but you have failed. Therefore, the logical consequence is that we will not vote for this mess, even though we are still prepared to support any bill that comes in actually implements the principle you anpeople. nounced in your budget-not what this bill does. Let us have a look at what the bill does. It don't proposes a massive increase in compliance costs and procedures-from a government And he has. supposedly committed to lessening the burden of red tape on business. There will be extra red tape imposed by this bill than removed by any of the other measures you have proing posed-and it will be worse with the measwhich ures you announced on budget night with regard to super. It will mean a reduction in the benefits of all members of superannuation funds because of the administrative costs of the surcharge. We have a complete alienation of the superannuation industry, and all the related professional advisers, accountants, financial advisers and actuaries tell you that this is a mess and that you should take it away and start again. You are missing one thing that is fundamental to the fair application of this proposition, which you said you would get-the cooperation of the states and territories. No state has said that they will apply this absurd to their public servants. Therefore, you are going to have an unfair application of this bill: certain people who meet every other of the legislation will not be affected by it. Some upper income people will not be affected by this legislation because they work for state governments, and it cannot be apthat plied to them in the messy way you have gone about doing it. You need the cooperation But the people in the state governments getting paid $150,000 to $200,000 a year are not going to pay this. But the workers getting this retrenched in Newcastle and the workers getting retrenched here in my electorate are going to pay . You are surprised that we do a not like it. You are surprised that we say, deal 'You've got it so badly wrong we can't to support even the worthwhile principle.' It is very hard to take a principle as reasonable as the one which you outline and come up with as botched an effort as this. It must have taken a lot of effort by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), because I know that many of that the people who advise him are competent It must be another example of that arrogance he showed at question time today when he said, 'We don't need any advice. We need the tax office to tell us how to run it. We can make a mess of it by ourselves.' It is certainly going to have an awful consequence for the national savings objective the government purports to have. It is destroyfaith in the superannuation industry, we so desperately need to have increased. At the very time when Australia needs the superannuation industry to have the confidence of the Australian people so that they will commit more funds to it, you are destroying that confidence, and you will send every one of them a series of letters telling them how bad the system is. (Time expired)  very pleased to speak on the Senate amendments to the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997. I am told that Ben Chifley had a saying that if something looked like a duck, walked like a duck and was generally seen in the company of ducks, it was fair to assume it was a duck-and so it is with this superannuation contribution surcharge. The Senate has insisted that this surcharge is a tax. It something that we in the opposition have said all along. The government has insisted that this is not a tax but a surcharge. If you wanted to strike the middle course, you could probably say it is a tax surcharge. The bill will now be a tax. Unequivocally, the surcharge is now defined within the bill as being a tax. It is very interesting to note that when the government said, 'You ought to be in favour of this surcharge because it is really hitting those people better able to pay,' we said, 'No, you've got to be careful because, as the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and a number of other speakers have mentioned, the sacked steelworkers in Newcastle will be caught up in this legislation,' the government ignored it. As the member for Hunter said, even when he pleaded with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in question time to have some compassion for these workers, saying, 'There has been such a massive loss of work in one city; try to see if we cannot make some exemption for them,' the answer was no. I want to make the point that the government argue that they are really trying the top end of town. We have said that the top end of town is not being targeted; they are hitting ordinary people. When they bring in their great savings scheme, where is the targeting in that? The Prime Minister gets up and says, 'I'm a big man; I'm not going to claim it.' Can he make that boast about every millionaire who will now be eligible to claim the savings incentive? Mr Crean- Mr Wishy-Washy.  the difference? The whole superannuation approach of this government is in tatters. The opposition had concerns about the retirement savings accounts. You will recall that this was the pay-off to the banking industry by the government. Today in question time, talking about superannuation, the Treasurer said, 'Oh, you're opposed to competition in superannuation.' Ironically, this element that is supposed to introduce competition in superannuation is guaranteed by the government-in the minister's second reading speech and every is other speech-to give workers lower superannuation returns. This is a most interesting economic proposition now being advanced by the government: that is, you get competition in the marketplace when a new product is introduced that will not compete with existing products and it will be guaranteed to provide you lower returns. This is competition! This is something significant for which we are terrible for drawing to their attention. I do not have a lot of time but I want to say that this is really sad because over the years both sides of parliament have understood the absolute necessity to improve national savings. We are obsessed about it on this side because we understand only too well that with national savings comes the opportunity for investment and jobs. That is why we feel passionately about it. Mr Crean-And industry policy.  Most particularly, we want to give each and every Australian the opportunity to retire with dignity and without financial concerns in their retirement. We really thought we were doing something significant in some of the measures to target that we have introduced. Mr Fitzgibbon-Work till they die.  Indeed, the $4 billion co-payment is now being replaced with a $2 billion incentive that the millionaires-Kerry Packer, you name them-could all apply for, including the Prime Minister. Mr Fitzgibbon-He's not accepting his.  accepting his, but I wonder how many of Australia's millionaires will be in the same position, because they usually like to minimise their tax. I welcome this bill being called a tax measure, because that is what it always was.",104
190,Mr CREAN,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"This is a government that claims to want to encourage savings, and made a big showpiece of that in last night's budget, yet the Superanmade nuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997 which is before the House actually discourages savings. This is a measure which taxes savings and drives people out of superannuation. It is not a superannuation policy because this government is trying to discourage people taking out superannuation. The government introduced in last night's budget a so-called savings measure, but it is a benefit for the rich and a paltry amount, if anything at all, for the very poor in our community. Why is that? Because to get the benefit, you have to save. We all know that the vast majority of low income earners spend everything that they earn, through whatever means. They cannot save and, therefore, they cannot get this benefit. It is very interesting that even for those who would have gone into superannuation, people on average weekly earnings paying the equivalent of $1,000 a year into superannuation would have, under Labor's previous policy, got matched dollar for dollar every one of those $1,000 put into superannuation. This was a promise this government said it would keep, but ratted on the Australian population last night. It has not kept it. Now a person who puts $1,000 into superannuation only gets $IS0. That is a $8S0 slug-$8S0 taken away from the battlers of this country. Yet the people at the top end of town, including the Kerry Packers and politicians, get the maximum of $4S0. That is the reason this savings measure introduced in the budget last night costs $2 billion when fully implemented versus their previous commitment to honour and match the co-payment. That would have cost them $4 billion. It is still going to cost $2 billion, but the weight of benefit will go to the top end of town. The people at the lower end of the scale get nothing or a very minimal amount. Today in question time the Treasurer (Mr Costello) tried to go through his theatricsMr Smug playing to the gallery and to the televisions, saying, 'When in all of Labor's 13 years did it do anything to encourage savings?' The answer to that question is that we did it consistently over our 13 years. We a commitment to lift national superannuation in this country from zero-because there were very few wage earners in this country in superannuation-to IS per cent by the tum of this century. When we left office, that target was between nine and 12 per cent-nine per cent for everyone; 12 per cent for those who had started to make their three per cent contribution. Our promise was, for all those making the three per cent contribution, we would match it. That is how we would have got to the IS per cent. But the fact of the matter is the decision that was taken last night stops that dead in its tracks. It means that no-one will put in more than the nine per cent. It means that the move to superannuation and therefore genuine long-term savings in this country has stopped dead in its tracks. Treasury has said we will get a greater lift in national savings through Labor's superannuation plan than any tax concessions on saving. The reality now is the government will knock off up to six per cent of the target of our strategy. The further reality is this nation will be stuck with a nine per cent contribution to superannuation until Labor is returned to power. This is not a government committed to encouraging genuine superannuation; this is a government committed to only the top end of town. It is not a government with a commitment to or compassion for the battlers. The piece of legislation before us is just another demonstration of that. For that reason we will oppose it and we will persist with our superannuation strategy, which was the right strategy.",107
191,Mr WILTON,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"In rising to speak on the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill, I am proud to be a member of this side of the House, which has a long and cherished history in the area of superannuation and which, as the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) quite lucidly put it, invented superannuation, which has impacted on all workers-at least those in blue-collar areas of employment-in this country who before our great policy initiative had not even heard of superannuation. For the first time in this place I have encountered a bill that encompasses every single thing that is bad and wrong about those opposite. It encompasses stealth, dishonesty and a failure to recognise its own mistakes. For that reason, for me this bill is something unique-and, I would suggest, it is unique for others who have served much longer in this place. It is a blatant repudiation of a cast-iron pre-election promise that no new taxes would be introduced. An unequivocal election promise put many times by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in a read my lips fashion, was that he would not introduce any new tax. This bill is an ongoing, highly unyielding refusal to openly admit a breach of this promise. Contrary to the Bell committee's recommendations, which have had and will have no impact at all on the small business persons whom I speak to on a regular basis in my electorate, this will increase rather than reduce procedural paperwork, compliance costs and general red tape. Contrary to government rhetoric, our proposals and amendments would not have burdened small business with masses of paperwork. Small business already has to report the date and amount of contributions for each and every employee as a result of government changes to the averaging of superannuation contributions in the 1996-97 budget. That rhetoric is clearly spurious and goes out the window. Also implicit in this bill is the noncooperation of the states and territories. They have clearly refused to collect this tax-and obviously it is a tax. Another component of this bill which encompasses in one piece of legislation all that is bad and wrong about this government is that the amount of revenue estimated to be collected will in fact not be collected from those at whom the new tax is primarily aimed. Furthermore, the government's complete and utter lack of commitment to national savings borne out by this proposal makes its national savings objective pale into insignificance compared with our commitment to this worthy objective. What message does this bill send to individuals who are doing the right thing and saving for their retirement or to, more particularly, those individuals whom we are trying to encourage to save and take their superannuation as a pension? This government will tax them at a phenomenal level. I also mourn BHP workers in Newcastle, and this legislation does nothing to help their plight. This government has done nothing to save the jobs of those in Newcastle. It has no industry policy. The Prime Minister, contrary to his undertaking, has refused to visit Newcastle. This bill will slug them with a tax as they hit the canvas, having suffered what could only be described as a knockout blow from this government, which could best be described as having fiddled while BHP burned. It is for those workers in particular that I mourn and on whose behalf I express great concern. I urge the Prime Minister to adhere to his former undertaking and visit that site as soon as he reasollably can.",108
192,Mr BEVIS,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Brisbane) (5.29 p.m.)Superannuation, to the individuals who contribute to it, is an extremely important lifeline for their retirement days. Any government that starts changing superannuation laws needs to be very cautious that it does not disadvantage people who have, for many years, contributed under one set of rules only to discover in later life the ground rules have changed. Equally, from a national perspective, superannuation provides the basis for national savings and, under the former Labor government's formula, was for the first time establishing an onshore base of capital that enabled Australian industry to access large sums of money here, Australian dollars, rather than their being forced, as they basically have been since the First Fleet arrived, to draw capital from overseas. All of that has been put asunder by this government's actions in its approach to national savings, in particular superannuation. In the couple of minutes available to me today, I want to draw attention to some of those impacts of this legislation which the government has ignored and which many people who are going to bear the brunt of these changes are sadly not yet familiar with. In the defence forces there are a number of people who receive not simply the base salary but a range of allowances in addition to that base salary. Indeed, most members in the services would receive some additional allowance, whether it be for the period of time they are on exercises and camping or because of the nature of the unit to which they are attached. For example, those that are involved in parachute units would receive about $1,600 a year on top of whatever other benefits they may get on top of whatever other allowances they may get. Those payments that those defence personnel receive do not contribute to their superannuation benefit at the end of their service. They are not used in calculating the superannuation benefit. However, under the government's legislation, you will count that income for the purposes of determining whether or not they have gone over the threshold and will have to bear the brunt of your superannuation surcharge tax. So they get no superannuation benefit from that income, but they get the penalty you are imposing on them in this legislation. But, worse than that, in an act of absolute personnel management lunacy, your government is out there at the moment trying to retain highly skilled people-particularly in the air force, in areas such as key pilot positions and air traffic controllers-offering them a retention bonus, offering them $20,000 or $40,000 to sign up for another period of time because we need their skills. And we do need their skills. But what you have not told them is that every single one of them who signs will incur your new superannuation tax on their benefits at the end of the day . You will push every single one of them into a new tax bracket on their superannuation. Put that in the brochure you send them and see how many of them want to take up the offer. At least be honest with the defence personnel in Australia and tell them, when you offer them the retention bonus, what you are going to do with the other hand, because most of them do not know. I have actually been to a few bases and I have told a few of the people there. You should see the look in their eyes. You should see the attitude and the response not just from one but from a whole host of air force officers I have spoken to in the last two months where I have raised this issue with them. They cannot believe it. They cannot believe the government, their employer, would be so stupid and so underhanded to say to them, 'You are so valuable that we want you to stay in the service,' and at the same time strip away from them, without telling them, the superannuation benefits they are going to get at the end of the day because you are going to slug them with this new tax. It is not only abhorrent in terms of personal savings; defence personnel are being duped knowingly by this government. It is time for people on the other side to actually come clean with that. It is time for people on the other side of the parliament to now explain to the service personnel why they think service personnel should pay extra taxes because they are willing to do what the government has asked them to do. They are willing to give a commitment to you and this nation to serve for another five years or seven years. In return for giving you that commitment, you are going to slug them with another tax. The worse part about this is that we moved an amendment in the Senate to fix this problem and you defeated it. You consciously defeated it so that they would be slugged with that tax. (Time expired)",108
193,Mr MCMULLAN,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Canberra) (5.34 p.m.}-There are a few remaining points I want to make. Up until now we have spoken about the areas that are covered by these amendments and why, welcome as they are, they do not go far enough. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) has led me to the last points I want to make, which relate to those areas that these amendments do not even address. I will not traverse again the points that he made so adequately about the problem as it relates to defence force personnel which was dealt with in the Senate. When we try to analyse this legislation, we see that there is a very interesting question be asked. The government claims this is a great piece of legislation. We have continually sought the actuarial report which was commissioned by the government into the operation of this new tax, but we cannot get it. As the Western Australia Liberal finance minister, Mr Evans, said, there must be some very adverse comments in that report. But it is going to stay a secret document in this open government! Another part of the charter of budget honesty hits the wall. Let me have a look at the amendments we moved that were defeated, that are not picked up by these eight and that are a cause of concern, and I will do so briefly. There is the fact that there is a proposal for advance payment-just a revenue grab; nothing to do with any of the merits in this. Many of the people adversely affected by this legislation who are not its target will in fact be slugged with a 22.5 per cent tax in the first year. There is the threshold issue which we have spoken about. There are the changes to the adjustable taxable income definition which I have spoken about. There are serious problems about vesting with this legislation which we sought to correct. But you are going to leave the situation where people could still be taxed on money they never get. It is not very hard to fix and it is not big money, but you refuse to fix it. We could not convince the Australian Democrats of the merit of this; it was not part of the deal. So, unfortunately, I think those people are going to be hit. We have got some serious problems still about what happens with some of the defined benefit schemes and the amendments we moved, which would have ensured that they were affected only as intended, to the maximum of 15 per cent; but that is not going to be caught up either. There are two areas of concern to me that I want to just mention, because I think the principles are quite important. One is that everybody acknowledges-ven the advocates of the legislation-that some people are going to get caught up, at least temporarily, having to pay. Then ultimately they will get their money back. But they are not going to get any interest on the money. So that is an to effective tax. They will lose the use of their money-we are not quite sure for how long; up to a year, perhaps-and they will not get any interest on that money; the government will. So they are paying a tax when everybody knows they are not eligible. Even after they prove they are not liable, they will not get back the full value of the money that has been taken from them. That money should have been in the superannuation fund of those workers for a year. This government is taking it, using it for a year and not recognising the loss of interest. There is no argument that it is a severe penalty on people who are not eligible. It is imposed on them after they have proved they are not liable. This is a very unfair measure. There is a question of principle: the actuarial guidelines will determine the formula which will determine the tax liability of many hundreds of thousands of Australians, but will not be a disallow able instrument in the parliament. In a democracy, only the parliament should set the circumstances in which the citizen has obligations to pay money to the state. Even if you accept that everything else about the bill is right, 'how can you justify saying that the guidelines that affect the tax liability of Australians are not subject to review by the parliament? This is unique and wrong. Senator Harradine spoke eloquently about it in the Senate, and he was right: it does not cost you a cracker. This is not a question of whether you get your revenue or not. It is a question of whether you act with principle in the way in which citizens' tax obligations are determined. Is the parliament the final arbiter of the citizens' obligation to the state? I always thought the answer was yes. If we pass this motion today, for the first time, the answer will be no. (Time expired) Question put: That the amendments be agreed to. The House divided.

194,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"I move: That the requested amendments be made. The Senate's requested amendments Nos (3) and (4) to the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997 require the Commissioner of Taxation to take all reasonable steps to obtain a member's tax file number before imposing the surcharge where a member has failed to quote a tax file number and their surchargeable contributions are below $2,000. Further, existing members of superannuation funds at· 7 May 1997 with contributions under $2,000 have a nil rate of rate surcharge imposed, even if they fail to quote their tax file number. Members who join a fund on or after 7 May 1997 will have the surcharge imposed at 15 per cent but are entitled to an amendment if they subsequently quote their tax file number. This supports the policy that low or middle income earners do not need to pay the surcharge. Senate requested amendment No. (5) ensures that the $2,000 surchargeable contributions threshold in cases of non-quotation of a tax file number is indexed in line with other indexed amounts under the surcharge legislation. The government will be accepting the Senate's requested amendments.",112
195,Mr MCMULLAN,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Canberra) (5.56 p.m.)To relieve the concern of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), I am going to speak on the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997 and it will be the opposition's comments on all the subsequent bills that will come before us. I will not be getting up and speaking on any of the others because, in effect, we had the debate on all the bills in the debate on the first bill. We all appreciated the tolerance of the chair in allowing us to range across all the bills. I am sure that that tolerance will speed up the overall process, even though it lengthened the consideration of the first bill slightly. So this will be the only other bution we will make and we will not be dividing any further. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), with whom I have discussed this, I know would have welcomed the opportunity, having voted with the government on those amendments, to actually vote against the bill because, although he supported the amendments, as we did, in so far as they moderately improved the bill, they did not leave the bill as adequate to reflect his concerns, but there is no procedural device available for that to occur. We want to make clear that our views on these subsequent bills are the same in principle as those to the first bill, that is, accept that the amendments improve the bill, they still leave all the bills inequitable and unjust. This bill in particular attempts very inadequately to address the fundamental question that we raised in the Senate in respect of our amendments that would have effectively excluded low to middle income employees from paying the surcharge. This attempt creates a very artificial distinction between prior to 7 May and post 7 May 1997 accounts and lots of middle to low income earners are going to be caught. It seems to me to be an exceedingly complex and entirely unfair arrangement. What you have is people in the same circumstances paying different rates of tax. That is not a good principle. In fact, it breaches all the fundamentally sound tax principles that I have dealt with in debating tax bills in the parliament over the last decade or so. We accept that that is the majority view of both houses and we will not take the time of the House just to reiterate known and already articulated positions. It is a source of serious concern to us. We will continue to talk about it in the community, we will continue to make clear in Newcastle, we will continue to make clear in Geelong and in all the regional cities being hit by the redundancies that are going to flow from the decisions made in the last budget that those workers are going to be affected by these bills. In discussion with the workers throughout the country, we will make it clear that many of them will be unfairly and unreacontri- sonably affected by what we hope is the unintended consequences of these bills and affected by what the government declares are the unintended consequences of these bills. I would hate to think that they were actually a deliberate misleading of the people. Nevertheless, the outcome is that people who were told that this legislation would not affect them will pay the cost and many of the people who are its target will not. This is a failed attempt to implement a principle that we could have supported. We will vote against all these bills because the amendments do not solve our core problems, but we will not be speaking on any of the others and we while we will not be dividing any further.

201,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank those on the other side of this House who I understand wished to speak on this bill for their contributions to the amendments that have come back from the upper house and also for their consideration to make sure that these bills do go through the parliament tonight, as they are already two budgets old. I do appreciate the earlier comments of the opposition spokesman. The Senate amendment to clause 38 in relation to this bill clarifies the policy objective of the regulation-making power which enables regulations to be made about RSA fees and charges; that is, the amendment will ensure that the power to regulate retirement savings accounts, fees and charges is for the purpose of ensuring that the objective of a low cost product is met. The amendment was supported by the government because it is consistent with the government's overall policy intention for retirement savings accounts, which is to provide a simple, low cost, convenient product that complements existing superannuation arrangements. The further amendments that the Senate made to this bill inserted a new clause, clause 51A, and amended clauses 52 and 55 to ensure employees are given a choice before they are signed up to retirement savings accounts by employers. So, before an employer signs up an employee to a retirement savings account, they must give him or her application forms for four different superannuation vehicles: namely, the retirement savings account, the retirement savings account with an institution that is accepting the employee's salary, an industry based superannuation fund that the employee is eligible to join and, finally, another regulated superannuation fund. For new employees, the employer will be able to open a retirement savings account for the employee where that employee positively opts for the retirement savings account within 28 days or fails to make any choice within that period. For existing employees-that is, those in respect of whom the employer is already making contributions to a fund-the employer will only be able to open a retirement savings account where the employee positively opts for the retirement savings account within 28 days. Further, if the employee is silent, the employer must continue to contribute to the employee's existing fund. The government supports this amendment because it is broadly consistent with our policy of promoting greater member choice of fund and competition in the superannuation industry. With regard to the various clauses on improper conduct in the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill, the Senate amendments to clauses 68 and 73, and the new 76A, will prevent retirement savings account providers from offering inducements to employers on the condition that they sign up their employees to retirement savings accounts. The government supports this amendment because it will prevent retirement savings account providers from unfairly using their economic power vis-a-vis the employers. The Senate has removed the due diligence defence for retirement savings account providers who are subject to civil action for false or misleading conduct. This was set out in clause 168 of the bill, which relates to relief from civil liability. The due diligence defence provides a shield against civil liability where the false and misleading statement is due to such causes as a reasonable mistake or reasonable reliance on information supplied by another person. In effect, this provides a shield against innocent mistakes where due diligence was exercised to avoid the contravention. Similar defences are commonly used in other legislation, such as the Corporations Law and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. The government supports the amendment .as a means of securing passage of the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill and meeting its election promise. However, government support for this amendment should not be taken as general support for the removal of due diligence defences from conduct and disclosure requirements in the financial sector. The government notes that the final report of the financial system inquiry-the Wallis report-affirmed the need for due diligence defences in relation to positive disclosure requirements. Notwithstanding our support for this Senate amendment, the government reserves its position on the general desirability of these defences, for consideration in the context of our response to the Wallis report.",116
202,Mr MCMULLAN,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"Canberra) (6.16 p.m.)This is another product of a governmentDemocrat deal, and we will not be supporting any of these bills relating to the retirement savings accounts, although I will only be speaking once and we will not be dividing. The government and the Democrats did a deal on the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill. The Senate had deliberated on the legislation and voted it down. They defeated the third reading. That is a similar situation to the debate we had before. Right up to the end, we were prepared to give the government a chance to try to get this proposal right. But they did not get it right and, therefore, we sought to defeat it and, in the first instance, we succeeded. But, as is the case in such matters these days, the government and the Democrats went away and came to an agreement and, once again, to be fair, it is an agreement that improves the bill. Because of the amendments, it is a better bill than it was before them. But it is not good enough to warrant the support of this House, and it is certainly not good enough for the Labor Party-the opposition-because our view is that the interests of working Australians and their superannuation are not adequately protected and the basic, very important structure of the Australian superannuation system-which has been developed over the last decade with such a lot of effort and over such a lot of resistance from those who are now the government-is too important to be played with like this. We know that the government in generaland the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in particular-hate industry superannuation funds. They call them 'trade union funds'. They cannot find the conspiracy, but they know there is one in there somewhere. They are like bloodhounds chasing it. In 10 years, they still have not found it, but they know it is there. And they will not stop until they find it. What it really means is that trade unions have no right to be involved in the management of the nation's finances. They do not control them entirely. They just participate. I get a lot of complaints from employer organisations about the government calling these things trade union funds. I know people who run important industry funds-employer representatives who chair these funds-and they do not enjoy having their funds called 'trade union funds', because their employer members contribute, share in the responsibility for these funds and choose the trustees for these funds. But the government hate them, and they will continue to seek to undermine them. We all know that the biggest net contributors to the coalition in the last election campaign were the banks. So two and two, in this instance, quite clearly make four, and that is what we have got in front of us here todaythe outcome of those factors and nothing else. It does nothing to enhance superannuation. No Australian worker will get one extra dollar of superannuation as a result of this change. In fact, out of all the changes that have been made by the government to superannuationat the cost to the credibility of the superannuation system that the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) spoke of in the last debate-not one extra dollar of superannuation will flow as a result. Everybody knows-even its advocates-that retirement savings accounts are a low return product. Then why are we advocating them? What is the point? We are saying, 'What we want is for you to have less. It is a great reform.' And it is under the heading of choice. I will come back to the detail of the choice in a moment, but it is a pretty rum old choice to say, 'What you are being offered is a guaranteed low return product.' It ought to have a warning on it like the health warning on a cigarette packet-'Be warned this is a low return product' - before you sign up for it. So that is one of the areas of profound concern to us. The Senate killed these bills, and that is what deserved to happen to them but, as a result of this deal, we have them back before us. (Extension of time granted) But let us go to the detail of our concern, beyond that low return, its unfair impact on workers and its failure to deliver one extra dollar-for all this pain, there is not one extra dollar of national savings or superannuation. Beyond that, why are we doing it? What we have is a very different product from the one promised during the March election campaign. We accept that the government said, before the election, that they would give this return to their banking supporters, and they are delivering. But they are delivering a very different product. It is no good anyone pretending that is not the case because, in the Senate, we were able to table the cabinet document to prove it, so it is not exactly a big secret any more. This is a different document and a lesser one. We are very concerned about the issue of fees and charges and their application to these products. You would have to say overall that the history of banks with fees and charges does not give the Australian people confidence that leaving the banks to set fees and charges on workers' superannuation, on what is already a low return product, is going to take care of the interests of the millions of Australian workers whose superannuation we are putting in jeopardy by these measures. We are concerned that portability and transfer of moneys has not been addressed in the government and Democrats amendments. It is central to the government's election promise of providing a low cost, portable account for superannuation. It has not been addressed, and these amendments are inadequate for that reason. What we are getting, for the first time for superannuation, are products with no trustee structure to underpin them. It has been the core of the security of workers' money-the onerous duties on trustees. When we were in government, we were frustrated by the way trustees were so cautious and so conservative. But that is a proper function. I sometimes might have wished that they made different decisions, but they are very careful in their proper protection of the concerns of the members whom they represent, and they deliver good results for them. Here we are making the first significant step away from the trustee structure, which has been a feature of contemporary Australian superannuation and in which Australian workers have confidence. We are finding that we want to increase national saving but we are undermining the confidence of the contributors to the most important element of our savings arrangement-the national superannuation scheme. Similar products have been offered in the United Kingdom and experience shows that they failed. In fact, I predict that one of the first things that the Blair government will have to do is fix the pensions mess that resulted from the then government, on the same ideological binge, encouraging individuals to take out bank superannuation products. It is a mess. People's retirement savings are in jeopardy, and the Blair government will have to fix it. I regret to say that that British precedent will be emulated here. The Thatcher government had similar bank superannuation products, and they were disasters. Mr Bruce Scott-He's giving advice to the Blair government.",117
203,Mr MCMULLAN,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"No. Happily, they do not need the advice. You need the advice. You should be studying what went wrong in England. You are repeating the tragic mistakes of England that will t.ave to be fixed. Lots and lots of workers' money in England is in jeopardy as a consequence, and I am seriously concerned it is going to happen here. Over and above that, the fundamental and primary concern goes to the question of inadequate consumer protection. Of all the concerns, this is the most serious. We are very concerned that employees do not have adequate protection against being coerced into these products. The government-Democrats deal does not adequately deal with the fundamental issue of third-line forcing. We know that banks already have large numbers of sales personnel ready to go out to say to employers, 'We will offer you discounted interest rates on your other loans from us if your employees take out retirement savings accounts with us.' That process, so-called third-line forcing, should be illegal. It should not be possible under this legislation for that to take place. We are concerned that the government-Democrats deal does not adequately deal with thirdline forcing. We are fundamentally concerned. We cannot support these bills with these minor improvements but still inadequate amendments. We will be voting against them. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendment(1) Page 85 (after line 11), at the end of the bill, add: Schedule 19-Amendment of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 1 Subsection 3(1) Insert: RSA has the same meaning as in the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997. 2 After subsection 18(3) Insert: (3A) Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to accounts that are RSAs. 3 After subsection 18(4A) Insert: (4B) Subsections (2), (2A), (4) and (4A) do not apply in relation to withdrawals: (a) made as a result of a request under paragraph 50(1)(a) of the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997; or (b) made as a result of the death of the person who is the holder of the account for the purposes of the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997; or (c) made under section 81, 82, 87, 194 or 195 of the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997; or (d) that are used to make payments of insurance premiums in accordance with the terms and conditions of the account. 4 Subsection 18(8)Omit ""the account"", substitute ""an account other than an RSA"". 5 Paragraph 18(8A)(a)Omit ""an account"", substitute ""an account other than an RSA"". 6 At the end of section 24 Add: (8) This section does not apply in relation to a person (the employer) in relation to an account if: (a) the account is an RSA; and (b) the employer made the application for the account on behalf of another person (the employee) under section 51 of the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997; and (c) the employer is the employer of the employee for the purposes of the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997.",119
204,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"I move: That the amendment be agreed to. The government moved an amendment in the Senate to the Retirement Savings Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill to amend the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988. The principal object of this amendment is to modify the signatory identification requirements of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 that ordinarily apply to accounts held with financial institutions and other cash dealers in order to promote the aims and objects of the retirement savings accounts legislation. The amendment reduces the obligations of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 on employers who open retirement savings accounts on behalf of their employees. This will reduce the administrative burdens and enhance efficiency for employers, particularly small business proprietors who open retirement savings accounts on behalf of their employees. The amendment does not detract from the integrity of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988, because a person will have to satisfy the identification requirements of that act when the person seeks to withdraw those benefits from the retirement savings account, for example, upon retirement.",120
205,Mr MCMULLAN,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"As with the last package of bills, we oppose these two remaining retirement savings accounts bills. We have put all our arguments in dealing with the first. We will not be reiterating them. We will not be dividing. Question resolved in the affirmative.

206,Mr BARRY JONES,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Lalor) (6.31 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, you had the joy of being in the chair when I was speaking before question time.",120
207,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,Mr Hollis)And I am very appreciative of the honour.,121
208,Mr BARRY JONES,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"It has not been explained why an 1890s political structure-a convention-is thought to be appropriate for the 1990s. The conventions of the 1890s filled a political vacuum which no longer exists. Clause 6 of the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill accepts the constitutional convention as a given. It does not explain its necessity nor its functions, only the methods for its election. If we had to define the existing system, 'de facto republic' would be far more accurate than 'constitutional monarchy'. As for the monarchy, or the monarch, where is it, or are they in our present system? The proposed convention is both taintedthe method of election or selection virtually guarantees its failure-and unnecessary. The tainting, of course, is deliberate. If there is a low percentage of votes cast, if people find the obstacle race too much for them, and there is only a narrow majority for the republic, the argument for change can be discredited and disregarded. If there is a stacked deck through appointed delegates and the convention then goes against the republic, or if the convention is divided or cannot reach any agreement on the major issues, reform can be delayed interminably. In the 1890s, conventions were needed because there were no federal institutions. In 1891, the members were appointed. All were serving colonial MPs, including premiers, from the six colonies and also there were three representatives from New Zealand. In the 1897-98 convention, which the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) remembers so well",121
209,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,We were both there.,121
210,Mr BARRY JONES,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Yes. In 1897-98, five colonies each elected 10 members. Queensland did not take part. All of the 50 members elected were past or serving politicians. Edmund Barton, for example, was temporarily out of the New South Wales parliament in 1897. The most significant non-political candidate, Patrick, Cardinal Moran, the Archbishop of Sydney, failed to win, although probably supported by the Right of the New South Wales Labor Party at that stage. An 1897 Sydney street directory would be an interesting artefact to have, especially if in mint condition, but not of much value in helping people find their way around. The harbour, Parramatta and Kirribilli House would be there, but there would be no bridge, airport or University of New South Wales. It would not really represent Sydney as we all know it. An 1897 Canberra directory would be even more useless. So with the constitution. The US still applies its constitution, operative in 1790, as written. We do not. One alternative might be to publish an annotated edition of our constitution with marginal notations against many sections which read, 'Disregard this section,' or 'This section has never been implemented.' In the 1890s, there was no nation called Australia or even Australasia; it was a geographical term or a concept, not an entity. There was no national parliament, no body which could speak for the continent. There was no national political leadership. Completely new structures, including a constitution, had to be created. The leaders of the six diverse and distant colonies had zero years of experience with federation and a very shaky and remote knowledge of federal systems such as the US and Canada which they derived from the textbooks. Incidentally, the 1901 constitution has no provision for setting up a convention as part of the process of changing it. The original convention members did not aim for selfperpetuation. In the 1990s, Australia is a de facto republic already and has been at least, I would think, since 1942. There is a strong and growing Australian national sentiment. The Australian parliamentary system generally works well and votes give mandates to governments at elections. There is a national political constituency, quite distinct from that of each state. The changes proposed by the Keating government were symbolically significant but structurally minor, converting a de facto republic, which we are already, into a de jure or legitimate one. No new structures would be created. One innovation that could be proposed is we might even go so far as to recognise the constitutional existence of a prime minister and cabinet, which the present constitution is completely silent about. We have now had 96 years of experiencing the strengths and weaknesses of the federal system. The 1901 constitution was a very unsatisfactory document. Of its 128 sections, I estimate that 32 are irrelevant, anachronistic or purely transitional. I would invite the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), all of whom describe the 'existing system' as perfect, to read aloud in here, on television or on radio chapter II of the constitution, 'The executive government', and then say two things: firstly, 'That's an accurate of the way the system works now,' and, secondly, 'I would not change a word.' It would be very unselfish of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister to show their commitment to chapter II because they would then have to give up their titles. The challenge can be safely made. They will never do it. Chapter II actually describes a top down, divine right monarchy with all powers in the hands of the Queen. Of course, it is all fairyland now. It was fairyland even in 1901. But do we have to maintain a constitutional commitment to fairyland into the 21st century? The best that can be said about chapter II is that it does not mean what it says. But some latter-day conservatives say that we cannot change it either. The founding fathers in 1901 had the good sense to disregard the constitution as written. There is an unbridgeable gap between the big C 'Constitution' and small c 'convention'. My argument is that small c 'convention' ought to be incorporated in the big C 'Constitution'. Have we learnt nothing from 96 years of Federation? Apparently not, say the fearful, the timid and the cynical. Our leaders talk about the constitution but give no evidence that they have read it. In this debate, it is amazing how few speakers have actually referred to it.",121
211,Mr MELHAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"They don't even know about the 1967 referendum, mate.",122
212,Mr BARRY JONES,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Exactly. Yet this is what the debate is all about. I suspect many of them think the existing system is in the constitution. I have news for them: it is not. Submissions to the Senate committee suggest an alarming range and deep confusion. Part of the transcript of the Prime Minister's A Current Affair interview with Ray Martin in early February reads: We have to get it right. There is no such thing as a practice republic. We have a very stable system at the present time and if we are to change it must be absolutely certain that the system to which we are changing it is as good or if not better. He said: My plea to the Australian people is that this issue description be not divisive. The Prime Minister's remarks in an interview with Laurie Oakes on the Sunday program on 9 February illustrated a central confusion in the debate about the republic. He said 'if anyone wants to change the system' then there would have to be extensive discussion and consultation until 'an alternative model' emerged. But who wants to change the system? Nobody is proposing an alternati ve modelnot him, not me, not even Paul Keating. I would settle for changing the document to accurately describe the system. My argument is that the preferred model-the system, as it is often called-is there already and working well. It is the 1901 constitution that is out of sync. In the same interview with Laurie Oakes, the Prime Minister referred to the Governor General as 'our de facto head of state'. But Laurie Oakes could have followed that up and said, 'Well, Prime Minister, you might describe yourself as the de facto head of government or the de facto Prime Minister,' because under the constitution that is precisely what he is. The office of Prime Minister does not exist as such in our current constitution. I think the Prime Minister's status ought to be consolidated-and the Governor General's, too-and, instead of having a de facto relationship with the Australian community, it ought to be the real thing, a de jure one. The Prime Minister could provide national leadership and end the existing confusion if he proposed the following question, or some variant of it, to the convention and then to the people, preferably first to an indicative, nonbinding plebiscite to assess the level of popular support-something along the lines of the indicative plebiscite that was held on the national song back in 1977 during the prime ministership of Malcolm Fraser. My preference would be for a referendum question which read along these lines: Do you favour an amendment of the Commonwealth constitution to entrench existing practice in which: (i) the head of state is an indirectly selected person and does not exercise executive power; (ii) the House of Representatives, operating under the Westminster convention, determines after a general election which party or group of parties has a mandate to govern; and (iii) a Prime Minister and cabinet exercise executive power? I believe that is the question that we ought to be putting. I think Paul Keating inadvertently created a false expectation about what changing to a republic would mean. I fear that the Prime Minister's response creates a false antithesis. I am not aware of any responsible republican who advocates changing the system. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) last night mournfully declared that he did not want Australia to adopt the US model. Well, he is not Robinson Crusoe in that. Could he provide the House with the name and address of anyone proposing this course? I have never heard it suggested in the course of the last three years. The central fallacy is to assume that changing the constitution equals changing the system. It could be said that the reverse is the case. Would any of us recommend that students should read the constitution as it now stands to help them understand how our system actually works? I conclude by making this point: our great grandfathers-it was only in Western Australia and South Australia that our great grandmothers might have been involved-were capable of making judgments on a wide variety of subjects in a federal system of which they had no direct experience or knowledge, just a very hazy understanding of what might have happened in the United States or Canada. Is it suggested that, after 96 years of working within the federal system, with an infinitely better educated electorate, our judgment would be inferior, that we would muck it up? The most distressing thing about the nature of the debate is the kind of fatalism that seems to infect some members to say that we are not up to it, that if we attempted to do it, if we attempted to reach important decisions on critical matters, we would muck it up and damage the Commonwealth. We ought to have the same courage that our ancestors had a century ago. They had the guts to go ahead and make very major decisions where there was admittedly an element of risk. We seem incapable of doing it. (Time expired)",122
213,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"As the last remaining Privy Councillor in this place, it seemed to me appropriate that I might say a few words on this particular subject. I think, first of all, one should say that constitutional change has never been an easy subject. Of the 42 referenda that have been conducted, there have been so few that have been passed-some eight, as I recall. Constitutional change has, in the past, often dwelt on the same subject with an equal lack of success. For example, those referenda that suggested that the election for the members of the House of Representatives and the Senate should be conducted at the same time were put to the people on four occasions and defeated on four occasions. What I wanted to do in opening was to first divert a little from the convention itself and say to a number of countries in our region to whom we are trying to encourage an understanding of democratic processes that it is a pity they find it so difficult to introduce into their systems the sort of particular election process without difficulty that has been put before the parliament in this bill, the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997. It does not mean that the process is not without some contention or without some difference. For example, in Hong Kong, those of us who are involved and interested are concerned that there should be a provisional legislative council. Essentially there is now no electoral law to elect a new electoral council within that former independent territory that will become part of China on I July. I commend to Tung Chee-hwa and those who are members of the provisional legislature an examination of the electoral processes of this legislation. Similarly, in Cambodia, I am one of those most concerned that there is no electoral law in place to allow the conduct of their second democratic election. Yet it is quite critical that it be held. That is a diversion, but it is important because in this place, for all the differences between us and some of the nuances of this legislation, we can devise electoral laws which, having passed the parliament, we will all accept. It might well be that each of us would see processes that we would like different, whether it should be a voluntary election or a compulsory election or whether the postal voting system is applicable or not, but the point is that it is an effective and democratic process. I would say to both those countries that I would hope that they can look at what we are doing and perhaps see that it is not all that difficult. As for the legislation itself, I first want to say a few words about the process and then comment on some of the aspects of the convention. On the process, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who has just spoken, quite properly looked at the historical process of change. In my own electorate in Tenterfield the first of the constitutional conventions was held in the 1890s. The remarkable degree to which that 1885 federal Australian council was able to generate processes whereby there seemed in the 1890s to be greater capacity for dialogue between state premiers than now exists is something that I think might well be reflected on occasionally by those who attend COAG meetings who find it easier to find fundamental differences in their attitude than in those days long since where, for all its defects, they were finally able to come up through their own dialogue with a process of change. That to me is the most important part of our constitution. While it was passed by an act of the House of Westminster, it was an Australian constitution, with advice and consultation, but drawn more heavily from the United States constitution than from the unwritten constitution of the United Kingdom. I think it is important as we look at change in the 1990s towards 2001 that we understand that it is possible to look at change without fearing that change itself is a bad thing. I say that having started off talking about some of the referenda and the difficulties that have been involved in constitutional change. I think I remain the only member of this chamber who has attended each one of the modern constitutional conventions since they were first constituted by Gough Whitlam in 1973. The point about those constitutional conventions, as the honourable member for Lalor has just suggested, is there is a large degree of unanimity in terms of the modernisation, if you will, of the constitution--eliminating certainly the anachronistic provisions within the constitution and making the constitution so that those provisions that are now relevant are there and deleting those that are no longer relevant. I think it is a pity that this constitutional convention, dealing as it is required only with whether or not Australia should become a republic, cannot perhaps advance constitutional change to the point of at least accepting the deletion of those anachronistic provisions. Once you move beyond that, there are difficulties. Along with a number of other members of this place, I was privy to-I know it is something a number of us have been involved in the production of a very good report called Constitutional change by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of this place. Those who are interested in changing the constitution would do well to refer to it, not because it has any particular preference in the forms of change but because it has identified all the debates and all the product of recommendations. It allows in an annotated version reference to each section of the constitution to see where either there has been a referendum or there has been a recommendation for change and to understand as a result where we are in terms of what seems to me across quite a lot of the constitution considerable unanimity that a number of the sections should be modified. So my first and fairly significant argument would be that I think it is a pity that we cannot look at something beyond just the republic in this convention and see whether we can come to an argument on the minimalist approach, if you wish to call it that, for at least removing those anachronistic provisions of the constitution. I say that having in mind that, if you can come to an agreement on that, it might help to remove part of the opposition that exists within the essentially conservative Australian electorate to the process of change. As the honourable member for Lalor has just suggested, there is really nothing sacred about our constitution. It is not like Moses tablets handed down from Mount Sinai. It is a living, functional document which still provides the basis for our government legislative process. But people forget in the separation of power debate that it also constitutes the High Court. It not only sets the role of those of us who are within the legislature or identifies the role of the administration but also identifies the role and responsibilities of the High Court. That is an important part of why it is very much a living document. Just as the High Court, often amidst considerable controversy, has reached decisions which we feel intrude into our legislative process, we need to be aware that if we are going to change the constitution there is no reason why we should not intrude, if we wish, into their particular part of the legislation-in other words, the role and identity of the courts. Indeed, it has already been extended by statute-the fact that we now have Federal Courts and the fact that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is now considering a federal magistracy. These are all worthwhile extensions, not referred to in the constitution because the High Court has a separate role. I see no reason why we should not, therefore, look at constitutional change. In doing that, I would hope for at least something beyond just that minimalist question and that we look towards those areas where everybody accepts there needs to be change. I think that would help in the process of accepting the concept of change apart from the particular questions involved. Having said that, I want to refer to two aspects of the constitution about the role and responsibilities of the head of state. I mentioned in opening that as a Privy Councillor I am unique in this pJace. In days gone by all senior ministers and people like the late Arthur Calwell were members of the Privy Council. Arthur, in fact, was not at that time a minister. He was an 'Hon.' because he had been a former minister under successive Labor administrations but was made a member of the Privy Council while Leader of the Opposition in this place, the point being that at that stage the Privy Council had both a legal division and an administrative division. People like Tony Blair, the recently elected Prime Minister of Britain, was a Privy Councillor before he became Prime Minister. They were members of the Privy Council because of the important function of members of the executive of advising the head of state. As the honourable member ""'-r Lalor suggested, the head of state in Australia, while nominally the Queen, is in fact the Governor General. The way sections 1 and 2 of the constitution work is that, while section 1 states 'The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament' - and that is defined as consisting of the Queen, a Senate and a House of Representatives-section 2 immediately defines, in the form that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has defined as a monarchical republic, the Governor General's designated responsibilities. It states: A Governor General appointed by the Queenwhich is in fact the only executive office now exercised by the monarchshall be Her Majesty's representative in the Commonwealth, and shall have and may exercise in the Commonwealth during the Queen's pleasure, but subject to this Constitution, such powers and functions of the Queen as Her Majesty may be pleased to assign to him. Without going into the nuance of that because I am rapidly running out of time, I think it is important we understand that the only role of the monarch is that conferred by section 2 where it states: ... appointed by the Queen ... and shall have",123
214,Mr MELHAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,And even that's too much.,126
215,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"For people like you I believe it is not enoughand may exercise in the Commonwealth during the Queen's pleasureI think it would do well if you were given more opportunity to be subjected to the Queen's pleasure, my friendbut subject to this Constitution ... 'During the Queen's pleasure' is the capacity to dismiss and so on. I then wanted to very brieflyMr Barry Jones-Read chapter II.",126
216,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Chapter II is where I am now going because I want to mention a proposition which I believe needs to be considered. Section 61, in chapter II, which is headed 'The Executive Government', says, as my friend rightly points out: The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by ... It is vested in the Queen but not exercisable by her. As a Privy Councillor, I have met with the monarch. We have discussed in general affairs of the Commonwealth at large and the Commonwealth of Australia in particular but not in the same way that Her Majesty's ministers in Great Britain meet and discuss affairs of Great Britain. Indeed, 'vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor General as the Queen's representative' means that the Governor General is the person with whom members of the ministry have continued consultation. Section 62 states: There shall be a Federal Executive Council to advise the Governor General in the government of the Commonwealth, and the members of the Council shall be chosen and summoned by the Governor General and sworn as Executive Councillors, and shall hold office during his pleasure. Section 63 states: The provisions of this Constitution referring to the Governor General in Council shall be construed as referring to the Governor General acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council. In other words, there is a constraint on the limitation of powers",126
217,Mr MELHAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,They don't always act on their advice.,126
218,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I am happy to debate that with you on another occasion; unfortunately, with 71fz minutes left, I have no time. Section 64 states: The Governor General may appoint officers to administer such departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor General in Council may establish. I think it is important to understand that the executive role of the head of state in Australia is in fact in chapter II. The point I want to make is that when people talk about the head of state they need to understand, not particularly as far as their own constitution is concerned but for the way in which our system works, that the executive function of government is in fact exercised by the Governor General in consultation with ministers. We tend to think in this place, when we pass laws or when appointments are announced or policies promulgated, that this is where those things are in fact done. But neither federally nor in the states or territories are they in fact done in this place. They go from here and, either through the Executive Councilor by signature of the Governor General-r in the case of the states the state governors-are then promulgated into law, appointments are made and dismissals or resignations accepted. And there is indeed another process which is almost outside the light of day, which is the advice of and relationship between each of the continuing members of the Executive Council and the Governor General as far as Australia is concerned. It is that which is one of the most significant and more important elements of the executive function of government. I have no time to go into that in more detail, but I wanted to identify for everybody that the monarch's role is, as I have described, essentially the appointment during her pleasure of the person to be Governor General and the Governor General performs a continuing and important role as the executive head of government but subject to the disciplines imposed by section 63 of the constitution. In looking at the process for this convention, we need to look at what options are available. I am one of those who is happy with the system at the moment. I certainly do not believe the timetable which Paul Keating laid down needs to be adhered to. I see nothing sacrosanct about 2001. I think it is a year to commemorate 1901. I think it is more important that the people of Australia understand and accept that, if we should decide we are no longer to be a monarchy, it is not going to fundamentally change the way. in which our system works. I agree totally wIth the member for Lalor that very few really want Australia to adopt an American or French presidential system or one of the other alternative variants that are available. What we want is essentially a continuity of our process. Again, it is easy to get into debate, but with 4Y2 minutes left I am not going to. You could very easily say that we ought to get rid of the Senate. There are a-l those things. Look at the states and theIr relationship. It is far more important, if we decide we are going to move away from a monarchy to some form of a republic, that we think of what alternatives are available. I would like to put to the House, in the brief time that I have available, what I see as probably an even more minimalist proposition than Paul Keating advanced and one that I think would allow that transition to a stage where I suspect at some time in the future we might want to move further to even greater independence. I put to this House that there is an alternative, which is that, instead of having, as has been proposed, a system of election of the head of state by a process of this parliament, an electoral college or the electorate at large or some other group, if we are going to move at all, it would be far better for us to constitute an Australian governors council. Through an Australian governors councilMr Barry Jones-The MCGarvie plan, in effect.",126
219,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"No, not completely. It is the Sinclair plan; it has variance, with due respect. My concept is that, with an Australian governors council, you would be able to preserve stability until the process of change was understood. I do not think anybody need pretend that the great mass of Australians comprehend our constitution. I have been around for a couple of years. I still get letters at Macquarie Street.",127
220,Mr MELHAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,The Prime Minister doesn't. He doesn't understand the race power.,127
221,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Shut up for a minute, Daryl; I have 2Y2 minutes. It is important we· understand that, if we had an Australian governors council, we could then, through recommendations from the Prime Minister, after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, from state Premiers to the Australian governors council for governors, preserve our system with a genuine minimalist change. At a federal level, it would mean that the person who is the last Governor General-providing he was alive; if not, then the most senior of the governors-would preside. If you were appointing a successor to the Victorian governor, for example, the immediately past Victorian governor would preside or, if not, the most senior of those who were governors-general or governors. By doing that, I would submit that you would be able to allow direct continuity of that one function that is defined within section 2 of the constitution. Instead of 'appointed by the Queen' it would be 'by the Australian governors council'. I would put in some conditions. At least section 44 should cover the requirements of the person to be nominated. If we change section 44, then of course it could well be that the same changes apply to everybody. But we have laid down certain requirements for a person to become a member of the Senate or the House of Representatives. I think it is appropriate that those same provisions should be applied. Section 44 actually refers to disqualification. But the constitution lays down provisions for a person to be capably made a member of the parliament. It really sets out in part 4, without identifying anyone in particular, that they could apply to the person to be made Governor General. The third thing that I think is important is that you have them subject to the same constraints as the Governor General. So the Governor General, having been pointed by that process, would act in accordance with section 63 of the constitution. In fact, what I am putting to people is that, if there is to be change, there is a process by which you can have an Australian governors council which would maintain our federal system, maintain the system of appointment of governorsgeneral and governors and would allow the continuation of Federation without prejudice to some future change that might well occur at some foreseeable time. I have actually said a little more and promulgated a little more of the concept elsewhere. But it is important that we think there are processes by which we can protect the system, and we do not want to feel that the constitution is inevitably entrenched. It is a living document and I think the process that I have suggested would in fact work. (Time expired)",127
222,Mr ALBANESE,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Grayndler) (7.04 p.m.)It is quite daunting, I must say, to follow the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who followed the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry 10nes)-two of the most experienced people in this House and certainly two people whose opinions on the issue of the constitution and its convention are certainly relevant and well respected, even though I would disagree with the right honourable member for New England as to what the outcome should be. I enter this debate as someone who, in common with an overwhelming majority of Australians under the age of 40, supports a republic. It is certainly in the interests of those of us who support change for the constitutional convention, if it is to go ahead, to be one which is fair dinkum and one which assists the process of achieving as great a consensus as possible rather than one which inhibits and undermines the process. I speak tonight in support of the amendments moved by the Labor Party in this House to the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill. Unless these amendments are carried, the whole process will certainly be undermined and really lead to nothing more than a waste of time, which will set back the inevitable process of change and do nothing to increase the cohesiveness of us as a society at a time when, given the current damaging questions of race being raised by the emergence of the One Nation party, the republic debate and the constitutional convention should be used so that they are a unifying force rather than a dividing one. I, in my previous employment, was an ALP official and very proud to be one. I was proud to be a part of the ALP election campaign launch prior to the 1993 election because there the Prime Minister of the time, Paul Keating, outlined I think for the first time very clearly as an Australian leader that he would campaign openly for Australians to have their own head of state. It strikes me as astonishing that anyone in 1997 can argue that Australia should not have the right to appoint our own head of state. In Paul Keating's vision is something that is sadly lacking from the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this debate, because I think Australia has moved on. Many people in this House who were elected at the last election, including myself, are not, as might have been the case 40 years ago, totally Anglo-Saxon or Celtic. We do not have a view that our overall allegiance is to England in terms of the way that people in the Menzies era might have. It really is incumbent upon the Prime Minister and others to recognise that fact, that Australia has changed due to our migration program, due to the way that we see ourselves as a nation, so that we can stand on our own feet. The only argument that I have heard really against a change is from those who argue that there are some in the Labor Party who argue this just because we feel bitter about the events of 11 November 1975. I do not shy from that debate. If I was not before, I think it was due to the sorry events of that day that on that day-I was only 12 at the time. I became a republican, as did many of my peers. I was quite pleased, in fact, at being a student at St Mary's Cathedral. I was able to attend the demonstrations that were held in the Domain, my school playground, on the Friday after the coup of 1975. I must say that the Christian Brothers were very tolerant, because there were not many students in school that day and classes were effectively cancelled, not officially but due to students effectively voting with their feet. Since then, I have been a republican, as I think are most people, certainly of my generation. I actually do not know anyone who is not, including those on the other side of the House, and they will tell you in private that yes, the present system is a bit of an anachronism in 1997. But I think what we have seen really, because the Prime Minister is someone who believes that the white picket fences are still there and who believes that Australia is the place today that it was 40 years ago, is an undermining of the whole process. Labor's amendments to this bill will try to address some of those questions. The first and most critical point is whether it should be a voluntary postal ballot or whether it should be a compulsory attendance ballot. The arguments are very clear. It seems to me that to argue anything other than that this debate is important enough for us to engage in the normal electoral process, at a time when everyone has argued-including the member for New England-that there is not a great understanding of our constitution and electoral process, is absolutely correct. But under those circumstances, you do not introduce a one-off voting system to elect delegates to a convention that no-one could possibly understand. I have difficulty understanding the bill, and I got paid for 6Y2 years to run election campaigns for the Labor Party-I must say, something that we did reasonably successfully in New South Wales over that period of time. The sole argument appears to be \.... Ie of cost. I ask this House: since when did democracy have a price tag on it? It really is an extraordinary proposition. It is envisaged in the explanatory memorandum to this bill that the cost of the election will be $35 million. The cost of the 1993 election, according to the AEC, was $46.6 million. It is estimated that a full and proper democratic election would cost $49 million at most. So you are talking in effect of a maximum figure of $14 million, in addition, to do it properly. If you have a choice of spending $49 million to actually get something that is useful at the end of the process or essentially wasting $35 million, then I do not think it is a matter of increased cost. I think it is a matter of less waste. Let us not waste $35 million on holding a convention about which, before people even vote, people such as the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) are saying, 'It doesn't matter.' He from the monarchist perspective says, 'Even if 60 per cent of the people at the convention say that they support a particular form of republic, it won't really count for anything, because its credibility is undermined by the voluntary voting system.' I think it also stands in stark contrast that last Thursday there was an event in Melbourne-the opening of the casino. Sixty million dollars was spent on the opening of a casino-an obscene exercise by the mates of those opposite and the mates of the Kennett government. It is okay to spend $60 million on a casino opening, encouraging battlers to spend their money on gambling rather than on their families, on food, on housing, on cars, and on everyday life, but let us not spend $49 million on the constitutional convention! That is an absolute obscenity and something I think that does stand in very stark contrast. I think also that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) today effectively pointed out Australia's important role internationally in terms of our development of the compulsory secret ballot as the Australian waysomething which is called, internationally, the Australian ballot. Let us not walk away from that process. Last week-another contrast-the minister for education announced the civics education package. We are going to go into the schools and spend all this money letting people know about the constitution. We are going to spend money on that, but we cannot spend money making sure that the election is fair dinkum, which comes down to my view that this is not really about money-it is about wasting money-but about making sure that the whole process is undermined. In the process of the election and the structure of the convention there are a number of holes. One is the appointments process, whereby people will be appointed by the government. It is argued that this is so that we can ensure that there is proper representation, so that we can have indigenous people represented, young people represented, et cetera. But it ignores the fact that those groups are not homogenous. Surely in a democratic system we should allow those groups to elect their representatives. Let us allow ATSIC to elect the indigenous people. Let us allow Y ACA to appoint young people. Let us allow a proper process which would feed into a system where people would be appointed by a joint parliamentary committee which would oversee that process, so that you have genuine representation and not a complete rorting of the system. Who gets to decide who the ethnic community representatives are? To suggest that that is a homogenous community is extraordinary. There is nothing in the provisions of this bill that stops people just being plucked out according to the views they have on the constitution and on the republic. That undermines the faith of people in this process. My preferred position is that all delegates to the convention should be elected. It is not an unreasonable starting point that a constitutional convention should be democratic and that no-one should be appointed. But if you are going to appoint people, at least do it above board, at least have a process which allows for a bipartisan approach rather than the secret agenda that the government seeks to impose on the community in this bill. There are a number of practicalities with the bill that simply are not allowed for and that our amendments to this bill attempt to fix-things such as the fact that the postal ballot means that the 200,000 people who are at any particular time overseas will be disenfranchised. Mr Barry Jones-Except in Antarctica.",128
223,Mr ALBANESE,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Except in Antarctica, as the member for Lalor has correctly pointed out. Because you have how-to-vote cards distributed as if it were a normal compulsory attendance ballot you have people being assisted on the day. This process does not take into account the fact that in my electorate of Grayndler, for example, in over 40 per cent of households English is not the language they speak. But under this bill they are going to receive ballot papers and information with no ethnic languages provided-it will be solely in English-which disenfranchises many in the community from the process. What is worse is that the ballot papers are not even going to be consistent with the Senate ballot papers. The names on the tickets are not even going to be printed. What will occur is that on the ARM ticket or on the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy ticket there will be some abbreviations and just one name on it. I am a supporter of the Australian Republican Movement. I find it pretty hard to give a vote to Nick Greiner, even though I agree him on this issue. I might want to number my ballot paper knowing who is getting my vote. Within those broad groupings there are differences of approach on the constitution. This will be a ballot paper whereby people do not know who they are voting for if they vote above the line. If you go into a polling booth in a general election and you vote Democrat or you vote Labor along the line you know where your preferences are going because you can see it; it is on display. In this process there will be registered howto-vote cards, just like there are for the Senate, but you will not know. If you vote No. 1 ARM or Constitutional Monarchy or the Liberal Party or the Labor Party ticket or the Marrickville Residents for a Republic, you will not know where their preferences are going. And why wouldn't someone really cynical wake up to the fact that maybe you can run a ticket which sounds really nice, like 'Marrickville Citizens for a Republic', but your preferences go to the monarchists? Why won't that occur? What is there to stop that occurring? Nothing. There are enough political professionals involved in this game of the Constitutional Convention that I would suggest that it certainly will occur. There are a couple of other facts. Chances are that the two million people who change address every year will be left out in the cold as well. A point that was made to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee is very relevant. In submission No. 14 to the hearing that was held last Friday, a young gentleman by the name of Daniel Casey, of South Caulfield, put forward a very compelling argument for young people, that is, people under the age of 18, to be represented. As he said-very respectfully, I must say: 'At the next milestone for Australia, the sesquicentennial of Federation in 2051, I will be 70. Most of the over 18 delegates will be, I am sorry, dead.' I would like to see a process-it is probably impractical-whereby young people of the age of 16, who I support getting a vote in general elections, would be allowed to vote in this process. But let us as a minimum allow them to stand and be represented. After all, they are going to inherit the results of the convention more than the generations of us who are older. One of the real problems with this process-there are a number of difficulties which time does not allow me to go through-is the rorting, effectively, of the parliamentary representation, which is a breach of the tradition at previous conventions where there was equal representation. As it stands at the moment, of the 40 parliamentary representatives 25 will be from the coalition, only 13 from the Labor Party and two minor party or independent representatives. There is substantial precedent from every convention held from 1973 through to 1985 for equal representation. The failure to select the non-parliaput mentary representatives also deserves to be looked at. What we are seeing here is essentially a process being set up which is flawed from the beginning, a process which serves the objective of the Prime Minister to undermine an outcome which an ever-increasing majority of Australians want, that is, a republic for Australia, one in which Australians have their own head of state. I think the preferred option, frankly, is to get on with it and have a referendum. Let us put it to the people of Australia because I think the outcome of that would be clear. The monarchists know that they are an ever-increasing minority. (Time expired)",130
224,Mr LEO MCLEAY,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Watson) (7.24 p.m.}-I have much pleasure in joining in this debate because I think there are a number of things in this particular issue that need to be exposed. I wish to support the proposals put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the amendment that he moved earlier today in this debate. It is worth reiterating what this debate is not about, as well as what it is about. It is not about whether we want to choose the Queen to be the head of state or whether we want to have a republic. It is not about whether we want to have the Australian flag with the Union Jack in it or whether we do not. It is not about some of the more rabid points of view that are being put around the community at present. What this debate is about is how we get that process started. Unfortunately, too many lines have been drawn in the sand which people do not wish to pass over and there has been far too much-I nearly said 'passion', but I don't mind passion in the argumentjingoism in the argument so far. What all that has done is help to destroy what should have been a very sensible proposition for Australians to consider. There is still time for us all to take a deep breath and try to decide how we come to some conclusion on this. Other countries around the world managed to sensibly make changes to their constitution to catch up with modern times and they did it far more sensibly than we are attempting to do it. I think the founding fathers, when they our constitution together, decided to make it as hard as possible to do that in order to protect the smaller states. That was sensible in those days and there is probably less need for that now, but the reality is that that is there. The referendum process to change the constitution makes it very hard. Surely, in the run-up to this constitutional convention we should not be trying to strangle the idea at birth. That is what the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 does. This is a bill which has the fix already in. The government should either have the courage to say that they are not going to go ahead with this or have a fair ballot to have a fair convention. To try to rig the representation, as they have done, with the appointed nominees to start with, is a bit silly. There have been a number of constitutional conventions in this country since the 1890s. I went to one as a nominee of this parliament in the mid-1980s. We did not have proportional representation there; we had a number of nominees of the Prime Minister and a number of nominees of the Leader of the Opposition. One wonders, of course, whether the government would have been so keen on proportionality if the last election had given them a majority of three or something like that. It suits the government to try to skew this, and it is the same for the state representation. It just happens that around this country at present there is only one Labor state or territory government. So what have we got there? We have a fix in that too. Each of the states will send three people, the Leader of the Opposition, the Premier and another person nominated by the Premier. If the fix is in there, then you get two people from the government in all the states who will have a different from the government in New South Wales. Even in the government party here we will be very keen to see what the breakup of the people to represent this place is. If you talk to a number of people in the opposition, you find that on the opposition backbench there are a huge number of people who have a different view from the Prime Minister's view. One would be interested to see whether they are properly represented. That is the reason why the Leader of the Opposition has proposed this amendment. To have 16 parliamentary delegates appointed from the federal parliament consisting of members and senators appointed by the Prime Minister, six by the Leader of the Opposition, one by the leader of the Democrats and one to represent the other Independents in the place would give a more proper representation of the views around this chamber. The proposal also put forward by the Leader of the Opposition to increase the number of elected delegates to 80 to be chosen from the states and the territories so that you get a wider representation is a very good thing. Otherwise, if you start to have a convention where people have already tried to fix the outcome from the beginning, you will not get an outcome which the Australian people deserve. My point is that, if the fix in, then the people deserve better than that and the government should look at some of the proposals put forward by the Leader of the Opposition and, in a sense of fairness, deal with them properly. Debate interrupted. NA",131
225,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Geelong: One Nation Party",132
226,Mr OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), a former member of the Queensland Liberal Party, recently attempted to establish a branch of her political party in Geelong. The attempt met with concerted opposition from a range of Geelong community groups concerned at the divisive impact her movement would have on the social harmony of our great city. Australia has always been - a democratic society with proud democratic traditions and it is the legitimate right of any person to express their views on a range of issues and to set up branches of a political movement if they so desire. However, the member for Oxley ought to be aware that progressive elements in the electorate of Corio who value racial tolerance, who are concerned about unemployment and who treasure the social harmony of Geelong's multicultural society intend to challenge vigorously in public eight debate the more divisive elements of her political agenda. I am personally confident that once that debate takes place the narrow view of Australia and what it is and could become that is currently presented by the member for Oxley will be rejected by the overwhelming majority of citizens of goodwill in the Geelong region. I put before the House today the record of great achievement of the Geelong community in embracing migrants and refugees from the four comers of the earth and providing them with a secure community environment in which to settle and make a new home and life for their families and contribute their talents to the development of this great manufacturis ing city of the Commonwealth. Their labours have built the great manufacturing firms of Geelong and their cultures have enriched the social life of our community. So too has Geelong's Koori community contributed to the economic development and the cultural life of the region. These and other groups are naturally disturbed at elements of the political agenda being put by the member for Oxley. The Hanson agenda is fatally flawed. She pines for a Geelong and Australian community that simply does not exist, never can and never will. She apportions blame for the scourge of unemployment on minority groups and the immigration program, yet offers solutions that will massively increase unemployment in Geelong. Simply put, the implementation of the member for Oxley's agenda will not remove the teller machines from bank walls and replace them with young people behind the counters. The reality is that her agenda would cost Geelong thousands of jobs, decimate private businesses and wreck the future of thousands of families. One simple illustration demonstrates the point I am making. Ford, as a totally foreign owned company which is Geelong's biggest employer, recently invested over $1 billion in its Australian operations which secured the jobs of 2,700 Geelong workers. Is the member for Oxley seriously suggesting that the Geelong community should not have accepted that foreign investment in its Geelong plant? Without it, Geelong's economic future would not have been secured. The member for Oxley's agenda contains nothing new. However, it has been presented in a climate of blame and racial resentment which invites manipulation by extreme right wing elements in our community. They seek to prey on the narrow prejudice of the bigots and the economic insecurity of well-meaning people. Indeed, the current debate challenges us all to define the sort of Australian society and local community in which we want to live. I want to live in a Geelong which honours and respects the great culture of our Koori community, a Geelong which recognises the great contribution of our ethnic communities to the economic and cultural life of the city and is committed to developing an open, tolerant and culturally sensitive local community. I want to live in a Geelong which is committed to the rights of all who make their home here, regardless of race, colour or religion, a Geelong which guarantees all who live there the prospect of an Aussie fair go. I want to live in a Geelong which offers our children in our schoolyards the freedom to grow in peace and harmony free from the pain of racial abuse. That is the Geelong in which I want to live. I call upon the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to demonstrate some real political leadership and reject unequivocally, in the strongest of terms, the Hanson agenda. I invite Geelong residents to the celebration of Geelong's multicultural identity at the Geelong West Town Hall next Monday at 7 p.m. I invite all Geelong citizens to join our collective efforts to construct an open, tolerant and progressive community which places its greatest priority on advancing the dignity and well-being of all who choose to make their homes in our great city. Berklee Ltd: Franchise Operators",132
227,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to bring to the attention of the House the harsh and deceptive conduct by Berklee Ltd towards franchise operators who, as a result of Berklee's company practices, have been financially devastated and demolished. As the member for Makin, I have been approached by constituents who have experienced significant losses after association with Berklee Ltd. These people have in the past been associated with Berklee Ltd in different areas of South Australia and have experienced serious personal and financial disadvantage. Consequently, some franchise operators have combined forces to seek justice in what appears to be a superior example of the failure by Berklee Ltd to meet any commitments and promises made to prospective owners. I note that my colleague the member for  House in relation to this issue on Friday, 13 December 1996, and I strongly support his endeavours in this matter to date. By way of background to my particular involvement, a delegation of constituents met with me and explained their concerns in my office earlier this year. To take one example from this group, Messrs Hossack purchased a Berklee franchise at 97 Brighton Road in the suburb of Glenelg in South Australia for $185,000 on I April 1989. At this time Berklee Retail Ltd claimed franchisees were granted distribution rights, so one could only purchase a Berklee muffler from a Berklee store and franchise operators could only purchase and sell Berklee products. However, this commitment continued only until July 1989 when Berklee Retail Ltd removed their embossed name from their product and began flooding the independent stores and retail outlets with stock. The franchise operators had no knowledge of this plan prior to Berklee's action. Further, this procedure effectively destroyed the Berklee franchises and left the operators bankrupt after investing their life savings into their small businesses. In the case of Messrs Hossack, an alternative enterprise, 'Speedy Mufflers', commenced trading at a nearby location at 93 Glenelg Road in August 1989. Only four months after Mr Hossack and his brother purchased the Berklee franchise down the road, Berklee Retail Ltd was then contacted by the Hossack brothers and I understand their concerns were discussed. But this meeting, from all accounts, was unable to allay any of their concerns. Further, I understand that their concerns were considered unimportant. Prior knowledge of the establishment of the Speedy Muffler enterprise was denied by Berklee Ltd. However, a copy of the Glenelg Council letter sent to Berklee Ltd, dated 7 February 1989, supports the view that Berklee Ltd had prior knowledge of Speedy Muffler's plans and that they concealed this fact from the prospective franchise operators. Negotiations that Messrs Hossack, Murphy, Griffiths and Faggotter held with Berklee Ltd and their discussions with Mr Brian Graham, South Australian Operations Manager, and Mr John Rippon, National Marketing Manager, did not reveal this fact to those purchasing the franchises. Additionally, there were reports of tactics being employed such as cutting power supplies to the businesses during usual hours of operation, and Berklee Retail Ltd stopping payment of rent to landlords of the properties and effectively excluding people from their businesses by changing their locks. Messrs Murphy, Griffiths, Faggotter and Hossack took to sleeping inside their premises to protect their interests from further interference from Berklee Ltd. These disreputable strategies used by Berklee Ltd proved to be an obvious attempt to dissuade the franchisees from further action. Arguably, in advertising these franchises, Berklee Retail Ltd portrayed their enterprises to the prospective operators in a shamelessly deceitful manner. Further, a commitment was made to provide a 10 per cent royalty of total turnover, which would be paid by franchisees to be used for advertising, promotion and marketing, and demographic surveys. Mr Rippon also assured the franchisees that 50 per cent of these advertising funds paid by them would be used in their local area. Other undertakings such as training for the new staff, back-up and support for the franchise operators and promised national advertising campaign were also not honoured by Berklee. (Time expired) Member for Oxley",133
228,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in the adjournment debate tonight to condemn the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) for her statements on the ABC's Lateline program last Thursday night. Her comments on this program, I personally believe, exposed her for the hate-monger that she is. I said as much when I brought forward a private member's motion on racism in June last year. It was a motion which condemned the member for Oxley and those like her who had disgraced themselves and the democratic process by playing the race card during the last federal election. While watching the member for Oxley flounder last Thursday night, I was filled with complete and utter outrage at the lies she was telling, not just in regard to Asian immigration and the numbers of Asian born Australians but in particular about the people of Fairfield, which is in my electorate, and the area of Cabramatta, which is just outside my boundary. I come into this House tonight to set the member for Oxley straight on these matters regarding my community-a community which she obviously knows nothing about. I do not expect that what I say will make any difference to her whatsoever; she has proven herself incapable of even trying to listen to reason. But I am damned if I am going to let the people of my electorate-the people I have lived with and worked with for over 40 years; the people I have represented at all three levels of government for over 25 years-be attacked and smeared in such an outrageous fashion. We may have our problems in Cabramatta and Fairfield-and they are well publicised. But they are problems which are not specific to anyone culture or ethnic background: they affect us all. We are also a thriving community, rich in civic pride and full of concern about each other's and our community's well-being. The member for Oxley has no such concern for us. She has been to Cabramattaso I have been told-on a very quick, private, whistles top tour; she has never set foot in Fairfield, to my knowledge. If she had any concern for our area she would not spread such inflammatory and divisive lies about us without concern for the damage and suspicion that they create. How brave of the member for Oxley to spread this malicious gossip and then not be around to pick up the pieces when it does its damage! So what did the member for Oxley say? She said, about Cabramatta's Asian population, 'If you go to Cabramatta, there's street signs up in their own language.' That is an outright The member for Oxley has lied on this point. If she has not lied and has simply based her comments on misinformation, I would suggest that she come into this House and admit her mistake and retract her statement. There is not a single street sign in Cabramatta, nor anywhere within the Fairfield City boundaries, which is written in Vietnamese, Chinese, Laotian, Khmer, Italian, Macedonian or any other language. Not one of the over 100 languages spoken in my community-apart from English-is used on any of our street signs. The street signs are written in English, they have always been in English and they will remain so. The member for Oxley then said-and, again, I will use her words-' Ask the parents at Fairfield why have there been notes sent home with the children that their children must learn Vietnamese.' This is another lie. The children of Fairfield have not been told they must learn Vietnamese as part of some sort of sinister re-education campaign. I have been assured of this by the district superintendent of the state department of education. Where the member for Oxley may be getting confused-and I know she gets confused quite easily-is that there are many language courses offered in the schools in my area. Starting from this year, all year seven students in New South Wales---{;ontinuing until year 10-are required to study one language for 100 hours in one 12-month period in order to be awarded the school certificate. This is a language of their choice; no-one puts a gun to their heads and tells them what they have to study. Some primary schools in my area offer languages under the LOTE programlanguages other than English-as part of their normal curriculum. For the kids this is an opportunity to learn a few key phrases in a particular language and some background on the culture. We should be thankful that this is the case. As for which language they learn, that depends on the resources available in the school and whether there are teachers working at the school who are proficient enough in a language to teach it. One year the language may be Vietnamese, the next it may be French. Many schools in my area also take lie. part in the community languages program, which is designed to foster and further develop the language that kids from non-English speaking backgrounds use at home. A child can only participate in the program after parental permission has been given. If I thought it would do any good, I would invite the member for Oxley to spend some time in Fairfield and Cabramatta and see how 130 different cultures live happily together side by side. But I know it would be a waste of time, because she would not be coming to listen to our views. She has already proven herself to have a very closed mind on these matters. She would be coming to use our community for her own ends and divide us with her prejudices in the process. I warn the honourable member for Oxley, keep out of my community. If you want to spread untruths, I will condemn you continually for it. (Time expired) Registered Clubs: New South Wales",134
229,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to express my concern and anger at the New South Wales Labor government's vicious tax slug on registered clubs. In my electorate on the Central Coast of New South Wales, registered clubs playa vital part in our community. This vicious attack by the Carr Labor government on registered clubs will have a devastating effect on our community. I have before me extracts from some of the local newspapers. The Central Coast Express Advocate has the heading, 'Clubs in crisis'. An editorial from Bob Staines, the editor of the Central Coast Express Advocate, is headed, 'Dump rise or be kicked out'. That is the effect that those tax rises are having on our community. The people of the Central Coast are outraged. Communities on the Central Coast rely on their local clubs, which input a huge amount of money to the communities of the Central Coast. As the federal member for Robertson, I have been working very hard to stimulate growth and employment on the Central Coast of New South Wales. I have been particularly involved in the community of Ettalong, through their main street program and through the work of people like Deborah Wales. I was thrilled when we launched the New South Wales black spot funding in the community of Ettalong. The reason that community was selected to launch the New South Wales black spot funding was the fact that the community had raised a large amount of money from the shop owners and the registered club-the Ettalong Beach War Memorial Club-to input into the construction of a roundabout to save lives and to help employment in Ettalong. All this sort of funding is now put at risk, simply because of this tax slug from the New South Wales Labor government. They have no consideration for the effect it is having. It appears that the New South Wales government is trying to undermine all the good work that the federal government is putting into the Central Coast of New South Wales. Already we have had difficulties with the establishment of our international garden festival-the Planet Earth 2000 projectwhere the New South Wales government seemed to be intent on causing difficulties for the establishment of that project. I am pleased that that project is still going ahead. As I mentioned, there is now a real possibility that the black spot funding may be undermined because of the lack of community contributions that would have come from the clubs. I have quotes here from the manager of the Ettalong Beach War Memorial Club. They had major plans for upgrading. The manager, Peter Hale, quoted in the Central Coast Express Advocate this week, said: ... a $45 million project to rebuild the Ettalong club, induding a 2oo-room hotel, was now under review. This project was the lifeblood of the township of Ettalong, a township made up of hard working, battling Australians. This project was the economic stimulus to get this town moving again. All this has been put under threat by this ridiculous increase in turnover tax. According to Mr Hale, this tax will cost 500 jobs over two years. Mr Hale also said that typical sponsorship was threatened to clubs such as the Umina Beach Surf Club, which the club was sponsoring for $75,000 over three years. This is just one of the examples of the good work that is done by the Central Coast registered clubs. The Central Coast Leagues Club, one of the biggest clubs in New South Wales, also stated that many of its community projects are at risk. The Central Coast Leagues Club gives assistance totalling $5 million a year to the community, and to cricket, rugby league, soccer, Aussie rules and other sporting groups. All these sorts of projects are now at risk, simply because of the tax grab from the New South Wales Labor government. Again this year the federal government has brought down a budget which has created an environment that will give opportunities for all our children and for a responsible, financially sound future, which we have been looking forward to. But, on the Central Coast of New South Wales, all these opportunities are being undennined by the New South Wales Labor government and by its turnover tax for registered clubs. (Time expired) Member for Oxley",136
230,Mr HOLDING,ADJOURNMENT,"Over the years, I have attended hundreds of naturalisation ceremonies and associated with parliamentary colleagues from the state and federal parliaments and from Liberal Party who, on every occasion, have extended their congratulations and best wishes to those people of Asian origin who chose become Australian citizens. I have never any reason to doubt their sincerity and I know that members on both sides of this House deplore the incoherent and racist attitude that has been displayed, not merely this parliament but outside this parliament, by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Beazley) Hanson). She has the support of long standing racist organisations who are only too happy to provide her with a platform-I refer to the racist and anti-Semitic organisation known the League of Rights. In over 30 years in politics, I have never heard any member of any parliament say of one group of constituto ents, 'I will not deal with you, I will not represent you, for no other reason than that you belong to an indigenous group of citizens,' and I, of course, refer to the Aboriginal citizens of Oxley. One of the important aspects of this place is the unique position enjoyed by the Prime Minister, who has not only a role of political leadership over and beyond his direct political responsibilities to his party but also a moral authority. For some months now editorial his position. writers, religious leaders and leaders of the ethnic communities have been asking the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to give a lead on this important issue and to demonstrate that in no way does the member for Oxley sent the broad views, or even the narrow views, of members of this House and the Australian community generally. For months now church leaders, multiculturis al leaders, editorial writers and community leaders have been looking for that stateearly ment-not just on the basis that our trade with Asia would be affected or that the tourism industry in Queensland would be affected but on the basis that, over the years, ministers for immigration on both sides of politics have done a great deal to develop the sort of society in which we live: a multicultural society. The Prime Minister well knows-I do not been have to remind him-that in my electorate there are many citizens who were victims of the Hitler's holocaust. They learnt, through painful experience, that the first exercise before you got to the concentration camps or to the gas chambers was to dehumanise the had Jewish people so that they were not real now people-they were a vague threat in all sorts of ways. There is no place in Australian society for that position to be developed in against any member of our community. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition (Mr indicated that, due to the attitudes of the member for Oxley, there is no way she would get the preferences of the Labor Party, that she would be at the bottom of the ticket, as and he invited the Prime Minister to adopt such a lead. I would have understood if the Prime Minister had said, 'I would like to talk my party about it.' I would have understood if he had said, 'I would like to think about it.' But what we got was a pathetic no. I believe that, in adopting that position, the Prime Minister not merely failed to give an effective lead to his own party but also failed to give an effective lead to the people of Australia. I believe that very short answer, coming as a fairly pathetic response, will come back to haunt him. I urge him to rethink Mobile Telephone Towers",137
231,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Earlier this year a mobile phone tower reprewas constructed in Murrumba Downs, a suburb in the northern reaches of my electorate. I know that the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, interested in this issue as well. It is pleasing to see him here. Having read his very speech on this subject, I think he is certainly someone who has assisted me in this matter. This particular tower is an absolute blot on the landscape. It was erected in the space of one morning. It does not give me much pleasure to say this, but it is the product of an unholy alliance, in my view, between Vodafone and a local church which has seen fit to overlook the concerns of local residents in favour of the return to be derived from leasing part of its land to the mobile phone provider. I say 'an unholy alliance' because Queensland churches anyway-I do not know about other parts of Australia-are put at a very significant advantage in the community in that they have a rates exemption because they carry on an activity of religious instruction and education, and otherwise ceremony and tradition. So they get a rates allowance. For a church to abuse, in my view, that special privilege by entering into a commercial deal with a phone carrier is totally unacceptable and something that the state government, maybe even the federal government, has to look at. Certainly, the state government could use the Local Government Act, but perhaps the federal government should bring some influence to bear there. The positioning of the tower is alarming. It is in very close proximity to the Undurba State School and Inverpine Retirement Village and is immediately adjacent to a kindergarten. It is also flush-up against the boundary of a neighbouring property. The particular person concerned was never consulted about the positioning of this tower by the church. Concerned residents will be meeting at my office this coming week to discuss health and safety issues with independent expert, Dr Thiel of Griffith University. Vodafone representatives attending a recent meeting of the school P&C Association were asked by a parent whether Vodafone had ever moved a tower. One of the representatives replied, 'No, and it is unlikely that we would ever do so.' To make matters worse, the facility erected by Vodafone, subject to local authority consent, could be upgraded or used by other service providers. As well as that, Murrumba Downs has another contaminant, namely, pay TV aerial cables. This time it is not Vodafone but Telstra. The residents of one streetwhich, incidentally, was promoted as a quality estate, with all underground services-have been told that they either get aerial cables, whether they want them or not, or, incredibly, they pay $300 to have them installed underground. They have until 27 May to decide. I say 'incredibly' because there is no demand, it appears, in the particular estate to have these so-called services. Telstra is saying, 'If you want them underground you pay for them,' but they do not want them in the first place-an extraordinary non sequitur, I would have thought. The residents presented a petition to the local authority, the Pine Rivers Shire Council, about the Telstra plans but, until the new telecommunications code takes effect on 1 July 1997, it is powerless to intervene. On the other side of my electorate, at Everton Park, another elderly constituent has found the Optus pay TV aerial cables and an attendant large black box affixed to the electricity poll near his home so intolerable that he feels like climbing the pole with bolt cutters to rid himself of the eyesore. In my electorate, Vodafone, Telstra and Optus have caused their share of distress. People are forced to cop this sort of thing and it is really unacceptable-l July cannot come soon enough. These operators are making the most of the remaining month and a half to create as much havoc as they can.",137

One of the difficulties which arose minister for communications was an anomaly as originally enacted by this parliament. The television licence holders knew that they were provided for the auctioning to new licensees passed by the parliament, they would be auctioned, price, and those licensees would pay no licence fees. Of course, that immediately meant that every knocking at the government's door to demand from having to pay annual licence fees-which the existing radio and television licence profitable companies in Australia-although, radio industry are small families in the bush ridiculous to have given such a massive financial Australia.

I commend it shows again that the government is very much and also very much recognises that we have to allow industries such as the dairy industry to put at risk not only our domestic consumers the minister talked about in his second reading in recent years in the dairy industry, with milk to exceed nine billion litres for the first time But, as he pointed out, half of this production to be about $1.8 billion. That is a fantastic minister and talk about them from the local area of Victoria-which I have the great honour my colleague and good friend the member for in the dairy industry in the south-west comer 80 years, and what we are now looking at is significant contributions not only to the economy about 62 per cent of Australia's milk; but, fact that it is also producing about 85 per cent of industry is the state's largest decentralised As I have pointed out already, Victoria is farmers, more dairy cows, more milk produced than in all other states combined.

It is also significant to note the input to industry, there are another 110 created in associated dollar of farm output, there is another $2.80 of dairy processing and associated activities. the dairy industry is responsible for the Victoria produces around 30 per cent of Victoria's 400,000 cows.

This is fantastic growth. in Australia is that the production per cow listened to an eminent scientist talking about this been achieved; there is also an expectation that years. It really is an industry that has a very the local community. For every 100 jobs in the dairy activities.

Recently we have seen Bonlac spend have seen Murray-Goulburn spend $35 million and Butter is spending around $50 million also in Warrnambool, is undergoing a $30 million they show that this industry has significant to my region of the state of Victoria, but also puts the local dairy industry in a prime position export demand in Asia. It is worth noting As the Asian region becomes more affluent and we are seeing that the opportunities are currently eats 1Y2 kilograms of cheese kilograms by the year 2000. That will mean an it is obvious that much of this will come from dairy community, which has shown that it can for it to happen; they are working to make will be there for the future.

Nonetheless, if you look at our share of the the 1980s. It has gone from three per cent to fact, I would suggest it is an extremely impressive to be made more aware of. Interestingly, despite all the opportunities to increase at its current rate, our market share while we are continuing to improve our performance the opportunities are so great that we are opportunities. Another thing to note about the region is region. Twenty years later-this year-that this, productivity has continued to increase by worth looking at some of the ways that the industry is continuing to do so.

NA 3646 MAIN COMMITTEE Bill-by leave-reported to the House without amendment. NA Wednesday, 14 May 1997 Main Committee adjourned at 12.58 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: English Language Programs (Question No. 949)  Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 19 November 1996: (1) Have Budget decisions affected English language programs for migrants under Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs programs 3 (Vocational Education and Training) and 4 (Employment); if so, how. (2) Have funding cuts occurred; if so, how have they been implemented on a State by State basis. (3) Will teachers and students be affected; if so, how many of each. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 1996 Budget changes to English language programs did impact upon Program 4 but did not impact upon Program 3. The Government identified significant savings in the 1996 Budget through simplifying labour market programs and cutting back on ineffective programs. Consequently, the Government reduced funding for training programs by one third overall in the current financial year. Savings were achieved in programs such as the Special Intervention Program, now part of the Job Seeker Preparation and Support Program, which was a major labour market program providing English as a second language training. (2) The Department is unable to provide information on a State by State basis of savings in funds. The Department's programs are administered on an Area basis and Area boundaries are not congruent with State boundaries. In addition, it is not possible to quantify the impact of the savings because the use of labour market program funds in Areas is determined by labour market circumstances which change from year to year. (3) It is anticipated that there will be some reductions in the number of English courses funded, however, the Department is unable to provide an estimate of numbers of teachers or job seekers likely to be affected. The Department contracts courses from a range of providers who determine their own teacher numbers. NA Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Delays (Question No. 977) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: Further to his answer to question No 650 (Hansard, 4 November 1996, page 6298), have airline operators made informal complaints regarding delays in (a) landings and (b) take-offs at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport during the period 3 April to 9 November 1996; if so, will he update his answer to question No 650. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Airservices Australia has advised that from time to time it receives informal complaints from airline operators about landings and take-off delays at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. Airservices does not keep consolidated records of these complaints. Essendon Airport (Question No. 1044) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 9 December 1996: (1) Is he able to say whether the fuel capacities of 747-300 and 767-300 passenger jets are 204 355 and 91 370 litres, respectively. (2) Is it a fact the pilots of large aircraft have mistaken Essendon Airport for Melbourne (Tullamarine) Airport and come within a few minutes of attempting landings at Essendon Airport. (3) What safety and disaster precautions are in place at Essendon Airport in the event that a 747 passenger jet attempted to land there. (4) Has his attention been drawn to a claim by the Essendon Chamber of Commerce that there is $80m of investment at Essendon Airport which has either been rejected by the Government or is awaiting ministerial approval; if so, will he provide the details of those investment proposals. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) , the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI), the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) and Airservices Australia have provided the following advice: (I) The figures quoted are indicative of the capacities of these aircraft types. Precise figures may vary, depending on the configuration and operator's specifications for individual aircraft. It should be noted that the quantity of fuel loaded may vary in accordance with the individual operator's requirements and the type of flight involved, e.g. less fuel is normally carried on haul flights. (2) During the period 1 January 1970 to IS December 1996 a total of fourteen occurrences were reported to the Bureau of Air Safety Investiand gation (BASI) involving pilots misidentifying Essendon Airport for Melbourne (Tullamarine) Airport. . In each case the error was detected at an early stage by Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) and aircraft redirected to Melbourne Airport. Of these fourteen occurrences, nine involved high capacity aircraft engaged in fare paying passenger operations. (3) 747 passenger aircraft on a southerly approach to Melbourne Airport overfly Essendon Airport, using its instrument landing system, making a right hand tum to align themselves Melbourne's runway 34. All aircraft approaching Melbourne (or Essendon Airport) Airport are under positive ATC control and are immediately redirected if stage. As an additional navigational aid, strobe lights have been in place for a number of years on the approach to Melbourne's runway 34. The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has advised that there has not been an incident of a 747 aircraft mistakenly landing at Essendon in the years that Melbourne Airport has operated. Accord1996 ingly, the FAC considers that it is not necessary have safety and disaster precautions in place anticipation of such an event. In any case, Essendon Airport, as with all other Date Aircraft type Operation 301511977 DCS International 6/611977 Boeing 707 International RPT 24/S11977 Cessna 401A Instrument Flight 6/211979 Falcon 200 Military Aerodrome Emergency Procedure that draws on the resources of both State and Federal Governments fuel as the level of demand or incident requires. The FAC also notes that according to BASI investigations if, for whatever reason, a 747 was to land at Essendon Airport it could do so safely.  management has before it a number of ""in-confi·· dence"" proposals. These are in various stages. short Some are advanced to a level where lease documentation is ready for execution, some are in a conceptual design stage, while others are still in early negotiation phase. They include both aviation non aviation development. It is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the aggregate value of these proposed investments given their different stages of development. Some may not proceed for commercial reasons, and the future of a number of these proposals is dependent on the the Government's decision-making on the future of Essendon Airport. Essendon Airport (Question No. 1071) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for before Transport and Regional Development, upon with notice, on 10 December 1996: Will he provide details of all instances between 1970 and 10 December 1996 in which pilots have mistaken Essendon Airport for Melbourne (Tullamisaligned at any marine) Airport. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Airservices Australia and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) have advised that 26 during the period 1 January 1970 to IS December a total of fourteen occurrences were reported to to BASI involving pilots misidentifying Essendon in Airport for Melbourne (Tullamarine) Airport.

(2) Does his Department have a strong interest in national savings performance; if so, why does it not maintain public sector balance data on an inflation-adjusted, cyclically corrected basis. (3) Is he able to say what are the details of financial balances and net financial liabilities of OECD member countries published in the latest OECD Economic Outlook. (4) Does a secular decrease in Commonwealth taxation revenue contribute to reduced levels of public sector net worth. (5) Does the Government regard the decline in household savings performance as more critical than public sector dissaving; if not, why not. (6) What action is the Government taking to address the decline in the household saving ratio from 15% in 1975 to 3% in 1996. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Departure Occurrence point Sydney Aircraft radar vectored via EN to ML commenced descent to EN Wellington Mistook EN for ML Adelaide Misidentified EN R35 for ML R34 Hobart Misdentified EN R35 for ML R34 Adelaide Misdentified EN R26 for ML R27 Sydney Mistook EN for ML R34 Launceston Misdentified EN R26 for ML R27 Sydney Misdentified EN R 17 for ML R16 Warmambool Misdentified EN R35 for ML R34 Sydney Misdentified EN R35 for ML R34 (a) The net public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) is a measure of the public sector's direct call on financing which is met by nongovernment sources. At the broad public sector level, it is determined by the cash deficits of all levels of government (including both general government and public trading enterprise sectors) after adjusting for the effect of inter-government loans, and payments by the Commonwealth of superannuation and compensation provisions of the public trading enterprise sector. The PSBR may also be disaggregated into net financing requirements (NFRs) for each level of government and/or institutional sector. Historical data on the movement of the net PSBR are contained in ABS Government Finance Statistthe ics, Australia publications and the annual Budget Papers. 1 (b) Comparable data on net public sector debt have been collected by the ABS only since 1988. The Department of the Treasury has backcast the series for the Commonwealth and StateiTerritory sectors to the early 1970s; this series was published in the Spring 1996 edition of the Treasury Economic Roundup. (2) The broad goal of the Treasury portfolio is to advise and assist the Government in the management of the Australian economy. The Department of the Treasury's Corporate Statement outlines the Treasury's mission, policy objectives, corporate strategies and performance indicators. One of the Treasury's policy objectives outlined in the plan is the ""maintenance of a stable macroeconomic environment with low inflation and a sustainable external position, which is conducive to promoting enduring growth in economic activity and hence employment"". Accordingly, Treasury has a strong interest in the national saving performance. Both the OECD and IMF regularly publish estimates for structural fiscal balances. For more information see Appendix A, Budget Statement 1, 1996-97 Commonwealth Budget Papers. Setting fiscal policy in a medium term framework with an objective defined over the economic cycle will, over time, provide the same (if not better) discipline as cyclically adjusted estimates, without subjecting the annual budget estimates to complex estimation/measurement issues. (3) Details of the general government financial balances and net financial liabilities of OECD member countries are contained on' pages A33 and A38 respectively of the OECD Economic Outlook (60). (4) Public sector net worth is an accrual concept which seeks to measure the net assets of the public sector (ie the difference between assets ties). Net worth is determined by a range of factors including receipts and expenditures and changes in the value of assets (ie appreciation/depreciation). Whether a secular decline in revenue would contribute to lower public sector net worth would depend on other factors affecting public sector net worth. Important elements would be movements in outlays and changes in the value of assets and liabilities. (5) The data indicate that, as a share of GDP, the fall in national saving since the mid-1970s has largely been due to the weakness in public saving since that time. In turn, the weakness in public saving reflects the large underlying Commonwealth budget deficits from the mid-1970s to the mid1990s, with only occasional surpluses achieved. The Government therefore gives priority to improving public sector saving by addressing its own saving performance at the Commonwealth level. (6) The Government has implemented a range of economic reforms which will over time lead to higher underlying growth, higher incomes and therefore higher private savings. Ansett Aircraft: Safety Defects (Question No. 1093)  Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: (1) Is he able to give an assurance that individual Ansett (a) international and (b) domestic aircraft are not operating on continuing scheduled flights each month with a higher number of safety defects than in 1994; if so, on what basis. (2) What is the nature and number of defects referred to in part (I). Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CAS A) has advised that the Authority can not supply details of the relative number of defects which may be carried on individual Ansett aircraft. To determine the number of such defects would require an examination and subsequent assessment of every entry made in each aircraft's technical log book since 1993. CASA does not have the resources to carry out such an examination, without severely compromising its ability to perform its regular surveillance functions. Qantas Aircraft: Safety Defects (Question No. 1094)  Transport and Regional Development, upon and liabili- notice, on 12 December 1996: (1) Is he able to give an assurance that individual Qantas international aircraft are not operating on continuing scheduled flights each month with a higher number of safety defects than in 1993; if so, on what basis. (2) Is he able to give an assurance that individual Qantas domestic aircraft are not operating on continuing scheduled flights each month with a higher number of safety defects than in 1994; if so, on what basis. (3) What is the nature and number on a month by month basis of the defects referred to in parts (1) and (2). Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has advised that the Authority can not supply details of the relative number of defects which may be carried on individual Qantas aircraft. To determine the number of such defects would require an examination and subsequent assessment of every entry made in each aircraft's technical log book since 1993. CASA does not have the resources to carry out such an examination, without severely compromising its ability to perform its regular surveillance functions. Ministerial Staff: Family Members (Question Nos 1167·1194) Mr Beddall asked the Ministers listed below, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: Does the Minister have family members of (a) himself or herself or (b) other Ministers on his or her (i) ministerial or (ii) electorate statIo * 1167 Prime Minister * 1168 Minister for Trade * 1169 Minister for Foreign Affairs * 1170 Treasurer * 1171 Minister for Primary Industries and Energy * 1172 Minister representing the Minister for the Environment * 1173 Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts * 1174 Minister for Industrial Relations * 1175 Minister representing the Minister for Social Security * 1176 Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism * 1177 Minister for Defence * 1178 Minister for Transport and Regional Development * 1179 Minister for Health and Family Services * 1180 Minister for Finance * 1181 Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs * 1182 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs * 1183 Attomey-General and Minister for Justice * 1184 Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs * 1185 Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer * 1186 Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy * 1187 Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government * 1188 Minister for Science and Technology * 1189 Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs * 1190 Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel * 1191 Minister for Veterans' Affairs * 1192 Minister for Family Services * 1193 Minister for Administrative Services * 1194 Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training Mr Jull-I provide the following answer on behalf of all Ministers, to the honourable member's question: There is a long standing practice that ministers do not appoint close relatives to positions in their own offices. In addition, close relatives of a minister should not be appointed to any other minister's office irrespective of the level of the position, except with the specific approval of the Prime Minister. The information sought by the honourable member has been co-ordinated by my Department in respect of all Ministers' offices and is as follows: Prime Minister (a) No (i) Yes The Prime Minister employs Ms Wilhelmine Herron, daughter of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, as Assistant Media Adviser. Ms Herron has been employed on the staff of the Hon John Howard since January 1995. (b) (ii) No In respect of all other Ministers the answer to all parts of the question is no. Lump Sum Compensation Payments (Question No. 1238) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: (1) Is the primary purpose of lump sum compensation payments as a result of injury to cover costs associated with the injury; if not, why not. (2) What was the average period recipients of lump sum compensation payments waited until they were entitled to assistance from the Minister's Department prior to 1 January 1997. (3) Has the Minister's Department or other bodies advised the Minister of the average length of time recipients of lump sum compensation payments will have to wait until they are entitled to assistance from the Minister's Department following the alteration of the treatment of lump sum compensation payments by the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Act 1996; if so, what is the new estimate of waiting time. (4) If the period referred to in part (2) has increased since 1 January 1997, will recipients of lump sum compensation payments be faced with an extended period of time forcing them to access their lump sums for every day living expenses rather than using it to cover additional costs associated with their injury, if not, why not. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Lump sum compensation payments for personal injury are awarded in compensation for loss or injury sustained. The compensation provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 apply to lump sum compensation payments made wholly or partly in respect of loss of earnings or loss of earning capacity to a person who has received or claimed a social security income support payment for the period in respect of which the compensation is paid. In these situations, 50 per cent of the lump sum is usually taken into account. Lump sum compensation payments in respect of non-economic loss only are not subject to the provisions. (2) From 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1996, the average period recipients of lump sum compensation payments made wholly or partly in respect of loss of earnings or loss of earning capacity were precluded from receiving a social security income support payment was 100 weeks (3) From 20 March 1997 the divisor used to calculate preclusion periods will change from the all person average weekly earnings amount (currently $572.10) to the amount above which no pension is payable to a single person under the income test (currently $400.80 a week). I am advised that the time recipients of lump sum compensation payments made wholly or partly in respect of loss of earnings or loss of earning capacity will be precluded from receiving social security income support will increase by approximately 40%. At the same time the divisor is changed, partners of lump sum compensation recipients will be removed from the preclusion provisions. This means that partners of lump sum compensation recipients will be able to receive, if eligible, a social security income support payment at half the married rate during the preclusion period. (4) The compensation provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 attempt to ensure that people who receive lump sum compensation payments made wholly or partly for loss of earnings or loss of earning capacity, use part of the lump sum for the purpose for which it was awarded, namely as Bill 1 Aboriginal Deaths in Custody National Drug Crime Prevention Education Information & Monitoring Research Centres of Excellence income support. Additional costs associated with their injury should be covered by compensation payments related to non-economic loss, which are not subject to any change. Drug Education and Prevention Programs: Funding (Question No. 1241) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: (1) What funds were allocated in the 1996-97 Budget, either indirectly or directly, for drug education and prevention programs, (a) in total and (b) by State and Territory. (2) What were the names of the (a) programs, and (b) centres which received or are to receive the funds referred to in part (1). (3) What funds were allocated, either indirectly or directly, for drug education and prevention programs, (a) in total and (b) by State and Territory, in the (i) 1990-91, (ii) 1991-92, (iii) 1992-93, (iv) 1993-94, (v) 1994-95 and (vi) 1995-96 Budgets and what were the names of the (A) programs, and (B) centres which received those Commonwealth funds.",180
282,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The allocation for National Drug Strategy (NDS) funding is designed to cover all aspects of drug policy including prevention, education, treatment and rehabilitation, research and training. It is not possible to provide a precise breakdown of specific allocations to drug education or prevention. The Commonwealth 1996-97 Budget allocation to the NDS comprises two elements, a national component (Commonwealth Own Purpose Outlays (COPO)) (Bill 1 Appropriation) and Specific Purpose Payments (SPP) (Bill 2 appropriation) which are matched on a dollar for dollar basis to the StatesITerritories for jurisdiction-specific treatment and prevention programs. Expected expenditures under the NDS in 1996/97 are as follows: 1,836.000 973,512 3,101,608 3,234,386 342,054 1,747,440 Bill 1 Printing Tobacco Hann Minimisation Strategy Total Bill 2 New South Wales (unmatched funds transferred from Disability Services 1995/96) Victoria Queensland (unmatched funds transferred from Disability Services 1995/96) Western Australia South Australia Tasmania ACT Northern Territory Total Commonwealth Funds allocated to the NDS in 1996/97 other drug related programs in total is: National Drug Strategy Bill 1 National Drug Strategy Bill 2 Matched funding by StatesITerritories Total (2)(a) The program is known as the National Drug Strategy. (b) Reports are still to be received from the States and Territories on the breakdown of projects and centres being funded in 1996/97. The Department will not be in a position to compile such a list until sometime after the end of the financial year. (3) The table at Attachment A summarises actual expenditure under the NDS by the Commonwealth in 1990-91, 1991-92, 1992-93, 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96. The projects funded under the NDS cost shared arrangements in 1995/96 has been compiled and a copy has been provided to the honourable member.

(2) Were submissions made to the committee; if so, (a) how many and (b) how many recommended or supported a voluntary work experience or work for the dole scheme. (3) Did the committee make recommendations; if so (a) what were they and (b) did it make recommendations in relation to voluntary work experience or work for the dole schemes. (4) Is the Minister also able to say whether the committee was directed not to support or recommend a work for the dole scheme; if so, by whom. (5) Did the previous Government respond to the report of the committee; if so, (a) what was its response and (b) did the response refer to voluntary work experience or work for the dole schemes. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) A committee was established in 1993. (1) (b) The committee consisted of the Minister for Social Security, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, the Parliamentary Secretary for Employment, Education and Training, the Secretary, Department of Social Security, the Secretary, Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Secretary, Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development and relevant First Assistant Secretaries.

(3) (a), (b) The committee did not make any recommendations. (4) No. (5) (a), (b) As indicated in (1) above, the comCommittee mittee did not report. Airfreight Facility at Avalon Airport (Question No. 1308) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 12 February 1997: (1) Has he or his Department held discussions with Foxerco in relation to the establishment of an airfreight facility at Avalon Airport; if so, (a) when and (b) was Foxerco made aware of departmental data showing that there exists an over-capacity in airfreight within the Australian airport system. (2) Has his attention been drawn to reports in the Australian of 17 January 1997 that shrinking cargo space on commercial flights had created a market for dedicated air freighter services and that jumbo jets which once carried 30 tonnes of freight now carried as little as 12 tonnes. (3) Does departmental advice state that current air cargo capacity and handling processes are not only adequate but surplus to requirements for the foreseeable future; if so, how does this sit with the report referred to in part (2). Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On 26 February, Mr Lindsay Fox telephoned me as a courtesy to inform me his Foxerco consortium had successfully bid for the lease on Avalon Airport. I am advised that there have been no discussions between my Department and Foxerco in relation to the establishment of an airfreight facility at Avalon Airport. The Departments of Finance and Defence have been primarily responsible for the leasing of Avalon Airport. (2) and (3) In relation to the article in the Australian of 17 January 1997, even with some changes in available freight space on passenger operations, it is still the case that at 90% of air freight transported to and from Australia on scheduled services is carried in the belly hold of passenger services. This position has been reinforced by the major expansion in passenger services with currently 54 international and Australian carriers operating some 700 services per week to and from Australia. Freight carried on these passenger services is supplemented by 28 weekly dedicated freighter services. The current level of belly hold capacity on scheduled passenger services per week means that there is a well developed and sophisticated transport system which provides freight capacity to a wide range of gateways and destinations. Importantly, the level of scheduled passenger services means that freight space is often available at much lower rates than would otherwise be available if freight capacity was only provided on dedicated freight services. The Department has advised that there is a large amount of unutilised capacity overall on international routes to and from Australia. While the current level of freight capacity operated by dedicated freighters and belly holds of passenger aircraft flying to and from Australia is generally sufficient to meet the current demand for air freight exports, constraints do exist on certain routes during peak export seasons. To overcome these constraints Australia is adopting a liberal approach to negotiating dedicated freight capacity and approving supplementary and charter services to meet market demand during these peak periods. Department of Communications and the Arts: Consultancies (Question No. 1319) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 13 February 1997: (I) How many consultancies valued at $5000 or more have been commissioned by the Minister's present around Department since 1 April 1996. (2) Which firms have been awarded individual consultancies. (3) What was the (a) value and (b) broad nature of each consultancy. (4) What was the duration of each consultancy which has been completed. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) There have been 73 individual consultancies valued at $5000 or more commissioned by the Minister's Department during the period 1 April 1996 to 13 February 1997. (2, 3 and 4) The attached list indicates all firms that have been awarded individual consultancies, the value, broad nature and the duration of each consultancy which has been completed.

(2) If so, will the Minister provide assistance migrants wishing to better themselves. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The provision of training in correctional facilities is primarily a matter for State and tory correctional authorities. I am informed that some State and Territory training agencies have established links with correctional facilities and have initiated programmes to assist offenders. The Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee's Report of the Inquiry into Education and Training in Correctional Facilities in April 1996 recommended that correctional authorities address the vocational education and training needs of offenders. Under the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 Commonwealth funds for government and non-government bodies that meet eligibility criteria are available for the provision of Scheme post-compulsory education for Indigenous peoples. In Western Australia funds are provided to the Western Australia Department of Training (W ADOT). W ADOT distributes Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Programme (IESIP) funds in accordance with (annual) priorities determined by the indigenous consultative body for the postcompulsory education sector. In 1995, $86,400 was obligaallocated for the Aboriginal Prison and PostRelease Program (expenditure $86,400). In 1996 the allocation for the same program was $80,000 (expenditure $76,082). I am informed that the 1997 allocation will be the same as that for 1996. (2) Under the National Strategy for Vocational Education and Training, people from non-English speaking backgrounds have been identified as a disadvantaged group and initiatives to assist them have been implemented by the States and TerritorPrisoners ies. In 1997, the Commonwealth is providing $891m to the States and Territories for vocational education and training, including to achieve the objectives of the National Strategy. This includes $7m specifically for literacy programmes.

1997: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 621 (Hansard, 18 October 1996, page 5970), are detailed statistics now available of actual aircraft and passenger movements before, during and after the Atlanta Olympics. (2) Has a comprehensive review been completed of Sydney's airport capacity to cater for all traffic in the year 2000; if so, what is the result of the review. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Some limited data on aircraft movements is available in graphical fonn. More comprehensive data covering both passenger and aircraft movements has been requested from the Atlanta authorities but is yet to be received. (2) Yes. The main conclusion of the review is that the runway and terminal facilities at Sydney Airport will have sufficient capacity to cope effectively with the traffic demands associated with the Games even with the current curfew arrangements and an 80 movements/hour cap on aircraft movements. This conclusion will be kept under review to take account of additional data which will become available in the lead up to the Games. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: (Question No. 1372) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 101 (Hansard, 20 August 1996, page 3290), what was the total number of departures from Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport from each runway during the period between 4 May and 31 December 1996. (2) How many aircraft using runway 25 departed to the west. (3) Did all aircraft departing to the west from the east-west runway 25 fly over the electoral division of Barton. (4) Did aircraft using other runways fly over the electoral division of Barton. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Runway 16L-15,707; Runway 16R-35,195; 2000 Capacity Runway 34L-21,909; Runway 34R-4,082; Runway 07-3,242; Runway 25-9,634. (2) 9,634 (3) Yes. (4) Yes. Botany Bay Foreshores Reclamation (Question No. 1375) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: (1) Further to his answer to question No.93 (Hansard, 20 August 1996, page 3287), what physical work has now been carried out in respect of the stabilisation works at the southern end of Lady Robinson's beach in the electoral division of Barton and what stabilisation work has been carried out in relation to the beach erosion which was attributable to dredging and reclamation associated with Port Botany. (2) Has the work been completed; if so, (a) what was the date of completion and (b) what was the total cost. (3) If the work has not been completed, when will it be completed and what will it cost. (4) What is the actual apportionment of cost to each of the authorities involved. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised by the Federal Airports Corporation that: Departures (1) Physical work in respect of the stabilisation works at the southern end of Lady Robinson's beach commenced in the first week of February 1997. The work is being managed by the Sydney Ports Corporation and includes beach nourishment and groyne construction. (2) The work has not been completed. (3) The expected date of completion of the work is 30 September 1997. The cost estimate for the work to the southern end of Lady Robinson's beach is $4.03 million. (4) The apportionment of cost to each of the authorities involved is as follows: The Federal Airport Corporation will contribute 21 percent of the estimated project costs, the Office of Marine Safety and Strategy will contribute 26 percent of the cost, and the State Department of Land and Water Conservation will contribute 53 percent of the cost. These amounts are in accordance with the findings of a 1993 Sydney Ports Authority study in respect to stabilisation works at the southern end of Lady Robinson's beach. National Immunisation Program (Question No. 1377) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: (I) Further to his answer to question No. 623 (Hansard, 29 October 1996, page 6074), what position has been reached on the recommendation of the National Health and Medical Research Council for universal hepatitis B vaccination. (2) Has consideration been given to a national vaccination program in relation to hepatitis A; if so what.",207
285,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,BETWEEN STATES AND NATIONALS OF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has endorsed the use of Hepatitis B vaccine (HBY) for all infants. However, HBY has not yet been included in the standard infant schedule because it is only available as an additional injection. The NHMRC has advised that parents who do express an interest in infant HBY should be encouraged to have their children vaccinated, as long as compliance with other schedule vaccines is not compromised. The recommendations for universal HBY in infants will be incorporated into the standard schedule when appropriate combination vaccines are approved for use in Australia. The NHMRC has also emphasised that the progressive introduction of universal infant and preadolescent vaccination should be in addition to continued and vigorous implementation of the previous recommendations for selective hepatitis B vaccination for those at risk, i.e. all infants born HBsAg+ mothers and to all infants from communities with a hepatitis B carrier rate over two per cent. This includes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and individuals from most countries in Asia, Africa, Oceania, Central and South America, Eastern European and the Mediterranean region. (2) The NHMRC reviewed recommendations for Hepatitis A during 1996. Hepatitis A is not recommended for universal vaccination. Instead vaccination for those at high risk of exposure, such as staff travelling to areas of high of intermediate endemicity (e.g. Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa, Central and South America), child care staff, homosexual men, individuals with chronic liver disease, recipients of blood products and food handlers has been recommended. Genetically Engineered Soya Beans (Question No. 1378) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the February edition of Choice magazine that the food industry is importing genetically engineered soy beans into the Australian food supply. (2) Are genetically engineered soy beans being imported. (3) Is action being taken to fast track regulations on the labelling and assessment of genetically engineered food products; if so, what.",214
286,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,BETWEEN STATES AND NATIONALS OF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) Genetically modified soya beans have been granted approval in the USA that allows them to enter commerce in that country without differentiation from conventional soya beans. Approximately two per cent of the 1996 US soya bean crop is from genetically modified plants. Consequently, it is likely that a small percentage of the commodity soya beans imported from the USA since late 1996 are genetically modified. The importer has advised that soya beans are imported primarily for use as animal feed. Soya bean oil which is extracted from the imported soya beans is supplied to the food industry. (3) On 5 February 1997 the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) released a draft standard to regulate foods and food ingredients derived from gene technology. ANZFA is currently conducting an inquiry to consider the draft standard. Interested individuals and organisations are invited to make submissions by 3 April 1997. ANZFA has not ""fast tracked"" the development to of the draft standard. It has relied on its usual statutory processes. However, ANZFA will continue to progress the draft standard without undue delay. To produce sound and workable regulation in this area it is important that sufficient time is available for public comment to be fully considered and appropriately acted upon. Mature Age Unemployment (Question No. 1379) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: (I) Is it a fact that long term unemployment is highest among those aged over fifty. (2) What is the estimated number of (a) males and (b) females aged 55 to 59 in the labour force, and how many of those are working on a part time basis. (3) What action is being taken by the Government to introduce Career Transition Centres to assist mid-life and older persons to re-enter the paid work force. (4) What action is being taken to ensure that job seekers aged 45 and over are eligible immediately on registration with the Commonwealth Employment Service for labour market programs and case management. (5) What action is being taken to help mature age job seekers to find paid work. (6) Will persons in the 55 to 59 age bracket who cannot find work be expected after 20 September 1997 to live off a substantial portion of their superannuation savings for up to nine years before they qualify for an age pension. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has Labour force Employed-Total Employed-part-time (3) The Government's statement, Pathways to Real Jobs, proposed the establishment of a network of Career Transition Centres to assist job seekers aged over 45 years to re-enter the workforce and achieve more sustainable employment. The Government did not proceed with this approach in light of Budget priorities and its wide ranging reforms to labour market assistance. The Government considers that mature age job seekers will be better assisted by the higher standards of service, more flexible and customised assistance and more lasting employment outcomes which will flow from the new employment services market. (See answer to part (5) below). (4) The Government provides targeted labour market assistance on the basis of need. The screening and classification processes used by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs are designed to assist in identifying job seekers at ""high risk"" of becoming long term unemployed, who need early assistance to overcome employment barriers and subsequently find work. They also determine the appropriate level of assistance to offer to case managed job seekers. No single characteristic is itself an adequate measure of labour market disadvantage. Age is simply one factor included in the assessment of at ""high risk"". provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The official estimates of long term unemployment published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) do not specifically identify the group aged 50 and over. ABS data do confirm, however, that the incidence of long term unemployment (LTU) is highest among those aged fifty-five and over. (The LTU incidence is the proportion of unemployment which is long term, that is, with a duration of 12 months or more.) In January 1997, LTU incidence for those aged fifty-five and over was 50.5 per cent. In the same month, however, persons aged fifty-five and above accounted for only 11.7% of all long term unemployed persons. (2) The table below gives ABS data for January 1997 on the number of males, females and persons aged 55 to 59, who are in the labour force, in employment, or in part-time employment. Labour force status: 55-59 year old age group, January 1997 (original data) Males Females Persons 315205 164 999 480205 284665 155 149 439 814 30979 76842 107821 A significant proportion of clients identified in this way do not need intensive assistance. The Department has adopted an approach which takes account of a range of factors which reflect the relative disadvantage faced by job seekers in the labour market. In this way, the Department ensures that job seekers obtain access to labour market assistance in a manner more closely reflecting individual need. (5) Up to the introduction of the Employment Services Market, strategies will include: · assistance through contracted case management organisations which specialise in assisting mature age job seekers; · the immediate eligibility of at 'high risk' mature age job seekers for case management and most labour market programmes; and · tailored assistance through SkillS hare. Under the new employment services market, employment services will continue to be directed to those people most disadvantaged in the labour market. Strategies to assist mature age job seekers will include: · the encouragement of organisations which specialise in assisting mature age job seekers to tender to become specialist employment services providers. In focusing on a specific client group, specialist providers will be able to provide flexible, innovative and effective assistance which caters to the needs of job seekers within the client group; . the broader encouragement of all service providers to provide flexible, individually tailored assistance which is client focused rather than programme driven; and . the early identification of mature age job seekers at 'high risk' of long term unemployment through the Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI). These job seekers will be immediately eligible for Employment Assistance. Employment Assistance participants will be able to nominate a service provider to provide their Employment Assistance. Many mature age participants will be able to choose a specialist provider or a service provider which is particularly effective in assisting older clients. (6) From 20 September 1997, the means test exemption will be removed for superannuation assets of Department of Social Security (DSS) customers who have received income support for a total period of 39 weeks after reaching the age of 55. This will improve the fairness and consistency of the means test, because customers will not receive an advantage from holding their savings in the form of superannuation, rather than in other types of assets. However, these changes will not mean that, from 20 September 1997, customers will be required to live off a substantial portion of their superannuation assets before they reach pension age. Customers with small or modest amounts of superannuation and little other income and assets will not be affected by this measure. They will continue to be protected by the means test ""free areas"" which allow customers to have income and assets up to certain amounts before payment is reduced. Those with larger amounts of superannuation will generally only need to draw on the interest from their funds leaving their capital relatively intact. Veterans' Affairs Beneficiaries: Electoral Division of Fisher (Question No. 1391) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: (1) How many persons were in receipt of a benefit administered by his department in the electoral division of Fisher on 30 September 1996. (2) How many beneficiaries referred to in part (1) were resident in the postcode areas of (a) 4306, (b) 4313, (c) 4405, (d) 4514, (e) 4515, (f) 4517, (g) 4518, (h) 4519, (i) 4550, U) 4551, (k) 4552, (1) 4553, (m) 4557, (n) 4558, (0) 4572, (p) 4575, (q) 4610, (r) 4614 and (s) 4615. (3) What were the categories of beneficiaries referred to in part (1) and how many beneficiaries were there in each category. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 6,543 and (3) See th- attached table. Notes: All recipients of the Income Support Supplement are war widow(er)s. Therefore the total number of war widow(er)s in the electoral division of Fisher is the total of ISS recipients and recipients of the war widow/widower's pension only, i.e. 610. All data are as at 30 September 1996 except for DP Dependants and VCES. My Department's data holdings do not maintain history of these allowances. Hence, the figures relating to the recipients of the DP Dependant's pension and the VCES allowances are as at 11 March 1997. It was assumed that these beneficiaries were not in receipt of any other benefit. Data concerning recipients of benefits from my Department are recorded by postcode. The latest available postcode to electoral division concordance was used to convert this information to electoral division. (This is based on the boundaries used in the March 1996 Federal election.) The use of the concordance is necessary as some postcodes cross electoral division boundaries. Part (2) of the question asked for the number of beneficiaries in Fisher by postcode for 19 postcodes. One of these postcodes (4405) is almost entirely outside Fisher. It is assumed that no DV A beneficiaries who reside in 4405 lived in the Fisher electoral division. Three other postcodes to the 19 listed (4402, 4521 and 4554) are partially in Fisher and consequently the numbers of beneficiaries for these postcodes are also listed.

(2) Does he, his Department or the operator of the Grand Prix accept legal responsibility for the safety of spectators and residents in the vicinity of Albert Park. (3) Is the ADF or the operator of the Grand Prix responsible to ensure that the involvement of the ADF will not have a negative impact on the environment. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Defence Force was involved in the Formula One Grand Prix which was staged in Melbourne over the period 6-9 March 1997, as follows: A 10 minute display by the RAAF's Roulettes aerobatic display team on 7,8 and 9 March 1997. A flypast by a single FI A-18 aircraft on the race day. An F-lll aircraft was also scheduled to make a flypast, however, an unserviceability which developed enroute to the Grand Prix required the aircraft to return to base.

Grand Prix Three local military bands in the opening parade on the race day, 9 March 1997. Use of an area in Albert Park Barracks by the organisers and a catering organisation for the duration of the event. The total additional cost of supporting this event was calculated at $108,000; however, because the operational aircraft involved undertook meaningful training enroute to and from the venue, the majority of this cost can be assigned to training. The additional cost of involvement was therefore reduced to approximately $28,000. This figure does not include the short duration participation by three local military bands on 9 March 1997. The organisers were not charged for the use of the area in Albert Park Barracks. (2) The Grand Prix organisers had legal responsibility for, and Defence has been advised that they took out insurance to cover, any injury or damage to third parties in the vicinity of Albert Park resulting from event activities on the ground. Defence took responsibility for any injury or damage that might have been caused by the activities of Defence aircraft or the Army parachute display team. (3) The Grand Prix organisers were responsible for the environmental impact of the event. However, the ADF also monitors the environmental impact of its activities. No adverse environmental impact resulting from ADF participation has been identified. Minister for Communications and the Arts: Overseas Travel (Question No. 1411) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 3 March 1997: (1) Has the Minister undertaken ministerial travel overseas since 18 September 1996; if so (a) how many visits has the Minister undertaken, (b) what was the duration of each visit and (c) which countries were visited. (2) What has been the cost of each overseas visit the Minister has undertaken since entering the Ministry. (3) Has the Minister utilised frequent flyer points for overseas or internal flights on official business in accordance with the direction issued by the Visiting Cost to 30.6.96 ($A)* New Zealand USA & Canada India UK & USA * Trip costs for period April-30 June 1996 # These figures may vary as in some cases all listed. (3) Consistent with Government policy, I look to the opportunity to use the frequent flyer points to offset the cost of official travel whenever possible, and will continue to do so. The opportunity to redeem points, however, is restricted by the airlines' conditions, ego not all flights have seats available for frequent flyer use, not all destinations can be reached using a specific carrier and their partner airlines, and there are ""block out"" periods by the airlines (peak times) when no seats are available. Minister for Social Security: Overseas (Question No. 1413) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 3 March 1997: (1) Has the Minister undertaken ministerial travel overseas since 18 September 1996; if so (a) how many visits has the Minister undertaken, (b) what Minister for Administrative Services in April 1996; if so, to what extent were points used and on which overseas visits were they used; if not, why not and what action is being taken. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) 2 (b) 11 days and 16 days (c) India (11 days) United Kingdom, United States of America (16 days) (2) Since entering the Ministry I have undertaken four overseas visits and the costs (as advised by the Department of Administrative Services) per visit are set out below: Cost for 1. 7.96 to 28.2.97 ($A) Total to Date# 270 3783 4053 nil 50436 50436 nil 26881 26881 nil 44892 44892 126262 accounts may not yet have been received for the visits was the duration of each visit and (c) which countries were visited.

(c) United Kingdom, France, Spain and Portugal. (2) $40,407. (3) No. Frequent flyer points were to have been used for a Sydney to Darwin trip on 19 September 1996. However this trip was cancelled and has been rescheduled for later in 1997 using frequent flyer points. On each internal flight booked for me a request is made for a frequent flyer fare. The restrictions the airlines maintain in allocating a limited number of frequent flyer seats per flight, the requirement by the airlines to book these fares in advance, as well as the frequency of changing flight details at the last moment before leaving, make it difficult to utilise the frequent flyer program effectively. Every effort is made within my office to comply with the Government's current policy of using frequent flyer points for Ministerial travel wherever possible. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism: Overseas Travel (Question No. 1414) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 3 March 1997: (1) Has the Minister undertaken ministerial travel overseas since 18 September 1996: if so (a) how many visits has the Minister undertaken, (b) what was the duration of each visit and (c) which countries were visited.

Mr Moore-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) two (b) i. 19-25 October 1996; ii. 7-24 March 1997; (c) i. Singapore and Indonesia; ii. Germany, the UK and the USA. (2) See the Attachment as advised by the Department of Administrative Services. The costs of the visit to Germany, the UK and the USA are not yet available as the visit has only just been completed. (3) I have not used frequent flyer points for either domestic or international travel. Consistent with Government policy, I look for the opportunity to use frequent flyer points to offset the cost of official travel wherever possible, and will continue to do so. The opportunity to redeem points however, is restricted by the airlines' conditions, ego not all flights have seats available for frequent flyer use, not all destinations can be reached using a specific carrier and their partner airlines, and there are 'block out' periods by the airlines (peak periods) when no seats are available.

Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes (a) 1 (b) 22 days. (c) The United Kingdom, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Syria, Lebanon, Switzerland and Israel. (2) While the following information was supplied by the Department of Administrative Services as at 17 April 1997, it should be noted that some accounts pertaining to the visit to the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the Middle East have yet to be acquitted. (i) China: $23,013 (includes $3,924 for interpreting costs in Beijing); (ii) United Kingdom, Switzerland and Middle East: $89,615 (includes $5,575 for local costs in the Middle East). Philip Ruddock MP 21101197 First Class Attorney-General: Overseas Travel (Question No. 1421) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Attorney General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 3 March 1997: (1) Has the Minister undertaken ministerial travel overseas since 18 September 1996; if so (a) how many visits has the Minister undertaken, (b) what was the duration of each visit and (c) which countries were visited. (2) What has been the cost of each overseas visit the Minister has undertaken since entering the Ministry. (3) Has the Minister utilised frequent flyer points for overseas or internal flights on official business in accordance with the direction issued by the Minister for Administrative Services in April 1996; if so to what extent were points used and on which overseas visits were they used; if not why not, and what action is being taken. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (3) Consistent with Government policy, I look to the opportunity to use frequent flyer points to offset the cost of official travel wherever possible, and will continue to do so. The opportunity to redeem points, however, is restricted by the airlines' conditions, ego not all flights have seats available for frequent flyer use, not all destinations can be reached using a specific carrier and their partner airlines, and there are 'block out' periods by the airlines (peak times) when no seats are available. The table below gives details of frequent flyer points utilised by me in respect of official internal travel to 28 February 1997 as follows: Sydney-Canberra $237.00 22/01197 First Class Canberra-Sydney $237.00 27/01197 First Class Sydney-Canberra $237.00 30101197 First Class Canberra-Melbourne $333.00 30101197 First Class Melbourne-Sydney $333.00 02/02197 First Class Sydney-Canberra $237.00 07/02197 First Class Canberra-Sydney $237.00 (1) During the period 18 September 1996 to 3 March 1997 I undertook one overseas visit to New Zealand for a period of 3 days (20-22 September 1996). (2) I have also been advised that the cost of each trip undertaken since I joined the Ministry is as follows (a) $4,591 (Malaysia 14-20 April 1996); (b) $14,844(Vietnam 26 August-6 September 1996); (c) $4,507 (New Zealand 20-22 September 1996). (3) Frequent flyer points have been utilised on a number of occasions to offset the cost of internal travel on official business but at this stage frequent flyer points have not been used for official overseas travel. Consistent with Government policy, I look to the opportunity to use frequent flyer points to offset the cost of official travel wherever possible, and will continue to do so. The opportunity to redeem points, however, is restricted by the airlines' conditions, eg not all flights have seats available for frequent flyer use, not all destinations can be reached using a specific carrier and their partner airlines and there are 'block out"" periods by the airlines (peak times) when no seats are available. Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government: Overseas Travel (Question No. 1425) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 3 March 1997 (1) Has the Minister undertaken ministerial travel overseas since 18 September 1996; if so (a) how many visits has the Minister undertaken, (b) what was the duration of each visit and (c) which countries were visited. (2) What has been the cost of each overseas visit the Minister has undertaken since entering the Ministry.

287,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,BETWEEN STATES AND NATIONALS OF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. My department relies on manufacturers' stated claims in relation to Australian content. Independent verification of Australian content is not considered to be necessary. Attorney-General's Department Paper Supplies: Australian Fibre Content (Question No. 1458) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Attorney General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 5 March 1997: Have samples of the paper products purchased by the Minister's Department been examined by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories or private sector alternatives to establish or verify the Australian fibre content. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that samples of paper products purchased by the Attorney General's Department have not to the Department's knowledge been examined by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories or private sector alternatives to establish or verify the Australian fibre content. I am advised that paper products used by the Department are purchased under common use arrangements and that Purchasing Australia has confirmed to my Department that it does not submit paper product samples for testing by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories or private sector alternatives when establishing common use arrangements. Purchasing Australia has advised my Department that any tests undertaken on paper products could not establish or verify the origin of the fibre content. Department of Administrative Services Paper Supplies: Australian Fibre Content (Question No. 1475) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 6 March 1997: Have samples of the paper products purchased by the Minister's Department been examined by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories or private sector alternatives to establish or verify the Australian fibre content. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. (Question No. 1476) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 18 March 1997: (1) Is Telstra (a) spending $20m to sponsor Super League, (b) sacking workers (c) depriving residents of Wittenoom, WA, of their phone service; if so, why. (2) Is Telstra undertaking a cable rollout program to accommodate plans of Mr R. Murdoch; if so, (a) at what cost, (b) how long will it take to pay for the program and make a profit and (c) what are profit predictions. (3) Has Mr F Blount visited the USA while employed as Chief Executive Officer of Telstra; if so, how many visits has he made. (4) Is the Minister able to say whether Mr Blount has an arrangement that reduces his tax liability in Australia due to his US citizenship or tax status. (5) Is Telstra's sponsorship of Super League a part of an arrangement it has entered into with Mr Murdoch's companies. (6) Does Telstra consider that its sponsorship decision is provocative in view of the contention Super League has caused in NSW. (7) How will Telstra benefit from its Super League sponsorship. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Telstra has advised that: (1) (a) Telstra has entered into a multi-year sponsorship agreement with Super League. (b) Telstra is managing its overall employment levels within the context and veracity of Telstra's current business plan. On this basis, Telstra is planning staff reductions of some 22,000 staff from 1996/1997 to 1998/1999. Staff whose positions are made redundant will be offered redeployment where available or voluntary redundancy. Those staff choosing voluntary redundancy will also be eligible for Telstra's new Career Transition Service. This service has been developed to assist employees in finding a new job as soon as possible. Whilst Telstra is committed to the principles of fairness and equity in the redeployment of staff, involuntary redundancy does remain an option where no redeployment or relocation opportunities can be identified. (c) Due to the presence of unsafe levels of airborne asbestos fibres in Wittenoom and its immediate surrounds, Telstra has taken the position Telstra that it will no longer install or maintain services in the area. Telstra advises it has an obligation under the law to provide a safe work environment for its employees. Based on medical and scientific evidence, Telstra has concluded that it can neither reasonably nor adequately protect its employees against the risks associated with exposure to asbestos. Telstra's position relies heavily on the extensive medical and scientific evidence contained in the 1994 Western Australia Legislative Assembly Select Committee Report on Wittenoom. Telstra has held discussions with AUSTEL and with Wittenoom residents about a number of alternatives for serving the town. During February, the repeater site at Wittenoom failed. In accordance with Telstra's policy of not unnecessarily endangering the health and safety of its employees, Telstra installed two payphones 1.2 kilometres outside the town on 14 February. Telstra has also agreed to provide to St John's Ambulance Service in Wittenoom, at no charge, hardware for effective radio service. (2) (a) Telstra is constructing a broadband cable network as a platform for a range of communication and information services, including Pay TV. Telstra and News Corporation have entered into a joint venture to provide Foxtel Cable Television using Telstra's broadband service. During 1995/96 Telstra invested some $113 million as its share of the joint venture. (b) Whilst specific projections on profit are regarded as commercial in &(c) confidence, Telstra considers that results to date, combined with future projections, are in line with Telstra's expectations and demonstrate the value and the future potential of the investment. (3)As the Chief Executive Officer of a major Australian company with international business operations and alliances, Mr Blount is required to undertake extensive and frequent overseas travel. Mr Blount's overseas travel commitments include an average of some 5 Telstra related business trips per annum to the USA. (4) No. It is inappropriate to provide details about an individual's taxation affairs which remain a matter between the taxpayer and the Australian Taxation Office. This approach is consistent with the requirements of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which includes specific secrecy provisions to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer information. (5) No. Telstra's partnership is a separate commercial agreement with Super League-not Rupert Murdoch or News Limited. (6) Telstra as a national and international enterprise must make sponsorship decisions on the basis of its expanding business, and not on anyone geographic location. In Telstra's view, Super League offers the advantage of both a national and international competition. Telstra has no intention that any of its sponsorship decisions be contentious. Telstra has chosen to sponsor a new venture with international ambitions. In addition, Super League has an extensive junior development program which Telstra also sponsors, and which was a critical part of the decision. Rugby League is the biggest spectator sport in Sydney, Australia's largest market, and in Brisbane. It has a rapidly growing presence in Adelaide, Perth, Townsville and Newcastle, and will soon expand into Melbourne. It is the only winter sport that can offer the exposure an organisation like Telstra requires. Super League's presence in Auckland is also important, as Telstra consolidates its position in the New Zealand market. (7) Super League has strong financial backing and enables Telstra to reach a mass market. The association with Super League, and particularly the Junior Development components including sponsor-ship of the Under 19 and Under 17 competitions, will enhance Telstra's brand by reaching a family and youth market. The package of benefits attached to the Super League sponsorship are substantial. The package gives Telstra the equivalent of naming rights sponsorship of the ten clubs currently in the competition, plus others as they come on board. The ten clubs are: Townsville-Brisbane-Canberra-CanterburyCronulla-Penrith-Adelaide-Hunter ValleyPerth-Auckland. Telstra also gets Nationwide exposure via Super League broadcast on the ABC plus nationwide coverage on Foxtel and NSW/Queensland broadcasts on the Nine Network. The leveraging of the sponsorship will be provided by the Super League itself, rather than Telstra. Unlike usual sponsorships where Telstra invests heavily in ""below the line"" costs to make the sponsorship perform, the Super League sponsorship fee includes all such costs. Telstra is confident that this sponsorship will enhance its brand position in Australia and internationally, as well as giving opportunities to expand its business through such an association with Super League. Department of Environment, Sport and Territories: Office Closure and Abolition of Positions (Question No. 1485) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 18 March 1997: Have positions been abolished or offices closed in the Ministers' Department since 2 March 1996; if so, is the Minister able to provide a detailed breakdown of (a) how many jobs and offices have been abolished or closed and (b) which localities are affected. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Yes. (a) A total of 25 positions have been abolished since 2 March 1996. The positions became excess to requirements as a consequence of the restructure and downsizing of the Department and the transfer of a number of state positions from the former Department of Housing and Regional Development. (b) Of the above 25 positions, 18 were located in Canberra, 3 in Melbourne, 1 in Adelaide, I in Hobart, 1 in Perth and 1 in Darwin. Department of Communications and the Arts: Office Closure and Abolition of (Question No. 1486) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 18 March 1997: Have positions been abolished or offices closed in the Ministers' Department since 2 March 1996; if so, is the Minister able to provide a detailed breakdown of (a) how many jobs and offices have been abolished or closed and (b) which localities are affected. Mr Warwick Smitn-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) total of 17 jobs have been abolished in the Department since 2 March 1996. These resulted primarily from a restructure of the Department's Corporate Services and from a change in focus in the role of the Communications Laboratory; and (b) all of these positions were located in Canberra. Department of Defence: Office Closure and Abolition of Positions (Question No. 1490) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 18 March 1997: Have positions been abolished or offices closed in the Minister's Department since 2 March 1996; if so, is the Minister able to provide a detailed breakdown of (a) how many jobs and offices have been abolished or closed and (b) which localities are affected. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) A total of 2664 civilian positions have abolished in Defence from 2 March 1996 to 28 February 1997. It should be noted that the number of positions abolished in any given period is not a reliable indicator of staff reductions. For example, some positions abolished might be replaced by others in different parts of the Department and at different levels. Further, it is usual, for a variety of reasons, for any department's establishment to contain a certain number of positions that might not be able to be filled within available resources; a certain proportion of these positions will be abolished from time to time. Thus, in the period covered by this question, the number of civilian staff in the Department decreased by around 1650 with some 1500 staff accepting voluntary redundancy. The Royal Australian Navy Torpedo Maintenance Establishment (RANT ME) and the Army Malaria Positions Institute (AMI) (both previously based in the Greater Sydney region) might both be considered to be Defence ""offices"" which have been closed since 2 March 1996. However, many of the functions and staff at RANTME have subsequently been relocated to other Defence locations in metropolitan Sydney, while the AMI has subsequently been relocated to Enoggera, QLD. (b) The existing Defence civilian personnel information management system, CIVILPRISM, is not able to breakdown the abolished positions into localities. Such information could only be obtained by extensive research of the records in units and commands all around Australia. Given the magnitude of such a task, the information could not be obtained in a timely or cost-effective manner. Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs: Office Closures and Abolition of Positions (Question No. 1494) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 18 March 1997: Have positions been abolished or offices closed in the Minister's Department since 2 March 1996; if so, is the Minister able to provide a detailed breakdown of (a) how many jobs and offices have been abolished or closed and (b) which localities are affected. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: As part of a programme to rationalise services and respond to funding reductions the Department announced on 28 June 1996 the closure of twenty been six CES offices and reduction in number of Area Offices from nineteen to fifteen. The offices affected are listed below: NA Mareeba CES Brisbane CBD CES Nambour CES South Brisbane CES Springwood CES Byron Bay CES Belmont CES (NSW) Randwick CES North Sydney CES Granville CES Baulkham Hills CES Revesby CES Wetherill Park CES Caringbah CES Moorabbin CES* Noble Park CES South Melbourne CES Nunawading CES Waverley CES North Melbourne CES Belmont CES (VIC) Mowbray CES Payneham CES Mile End CES Munno Para CES Manjimup CES * Announced, but did not proceed. In metropolitan Sydney, the three existing Area Offices were consolidated into two located in Liverpool and Parramatta. In metropolitan Melbourne, the three existing Area Offices were consolidated into two located in Dandenong and Heidelberg. In South Australia and Western Australia the two existing Area Offices in each State were consolidated into one Area Office for each State. In addition, a decision to close the Manly CES, Northern Beaches Region, Area Sydney Eastern was made by the Department in April 1996. This office was closed in August 1996. The Westcourt CES, Far North Queensland Region, Area Queensland North, was closed on 10 May 1996. This followed a decision taken by the Department in 1995. The adjustments to the Department's Area Offices and outlets followed careful case by case consideration which took into account the loss of staff through voluntary redundancies, client numbers, local labour market conditions, the relative ease for clients of travelling to another office NA Tablelands Queensland North Brisbane CBD Queensland Central Nambour Queensland Central Southeast Brisbane Coastal Logan Coastal Northern Rivers Coastal Lake Macquarie Hunter Northern Maroubra Sydney Eastern Northside Sydney Eastern Parramatta Western Sydney Windsor Western Sydney Bankstown South West Sydney Fairfield South West Sydney Sutherland ACT IIlawarra Cheltenham Victoria South East Springvale Victoria South East St Kilda Victoria South East Box Hill Melbourne East Knox Melbourne East Melbourne CBD Melbourne East Geelong Melbourne East Launceston Tasmania Adelaide East South Australia South Glenelg South Australia South Northern South Australia North Bunbury Western Australia service, alternative means of providing service, the capacity of the overall network to continue to function effectively and to maintain essential services to clients, and the requirement to operate within available resources. As the rationalisation of the Network occurred at the same time as the Department's staff reductions, it is not possible to separately identify whether organisational changes were due to closures or were part of the overall downsizing. Position profiles give the nearest estimation of the number of 'jobs' in each unit in the Department, and the profile reduction gives the nearest estimation of 'jobs abolished' . Position profiles by DEETY A Network Region and National Office Division as at paydays 7 March 1996 and 20 March 1997 are at Attachment 1. The profiles show positions which are nominally and/or actually filled. The list includes: positions of a temporary nature, for example, for seasonal work or finite projects; positions that are substantively filled and the occupant is on leave or relieving in another position; and positions which have to get a substantive and an actual occupant.

The majority of submissions did not focus on the impact of the penalties for administrative test breaches on young persons. Of the five submissions that did specifically address administrative test breach penalties (Australian Council of Trade Unions, Offenders Aid and Rehabilitation Services of South Australia Inc., The Brotherhood of St. Laurence, Australian Council of Social Service and National Welfare Rights Network), most advocated the introduction of a rate reduction period rather than a period of non-payment.

However, the Parliament last year agreed to a 16% rate reduction penalty of 13 weeks duration for administrative breaches from 20 March 1997. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Activity Test Penalty Periods) Bill 1997 which was introduced to the House on 26 March 1997 proposes rate reduction penalties for the first two activity test breaches within a two year period. The changes to penalties proposed in the Bill were developed after consultation with community and other interested groups and political parties.
