1,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,Some weeks ago I asked the Assistant Minister of Defence if consideration would be given to the sending of a naval contingent to the I m perial Government for service during the war. I wish to know now if any decision has been arrived at?,4
2,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The matter is under consideration, and is being dealt with by Sir William Creswell and the Minister. SUGAR DUTIES .",4
3,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister if the statement in today's Age that the Government has decided to remit the duty on the parcel of sugar which must be imported to meet the shortage between last season's and next season's crops, which is said to be affirmed by the statement of the Premier of Queensland, is correct?",4
4,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have not seen the report referred to, but I do not tliink that it is correct.",4
5,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As the right honourable member has not seen the newspaper reports on this subject, will he permit me to call his attention to them ? The statements of the Argus and Age conflict, and I should like to ask which is correct. The Age statement is this: Mr Ryan, with regard to the suggested remission of duty on imported sugar, said he had received a communication from Mr Fisher some time ago intimating that the duty would ,be remitted. This is the Argus statement: Mr Ryan said that he had received an intimation from the Prime Minister some time ago in which it was intimated that ihe uuty would not be remitted. - Mr FISHER - The truth lies between the two statements, but I have turned over the matter to the Attorney-General, and if honourable members will have patience, he will make a statement to the House on the subject at an early date.",4
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Surely the honourable gentleman can say which of the - statements that I have read is correct ? [164],4
7,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I could not do that without making a lengthy explanation. RECRUITING WEEK.,4
8,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"Will the PrimÂ© Minister consider the advisability of fixing a recruiting week for the whole of Australia, on lines similar to those proposed by the Government of Victoria for this State?",4
9,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"This Government is in. favour, not only of a recruiting week, but of fifty-two recruiting weeks a year for the duration of the war.",4
10,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Will the righb honourable gentleman consider the advisability of proposing the adjournment of this House over the week during which a recruiting campaign is to be carried on in Victoria? I shall be glad to hear any information that he may have to give to the House on the subject.,4
11,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have conveyed to the gentlemen who are organizing for both parties the opinion that, as the movement is at present confined to Victoria, it is not desirable for the National Parliament to adjourn; but it might be agreed to pair off those taking part in the work, this House proceeding with its business in the usual way.",4
12,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Will the right honourable gentleman promise not to introduce contentious business, such as the Tariff, during the absence of members?",4
13,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Not h in g will be done by the Government that would affect the political views of honourable members in any way. I am prepared to talk over the matter with the Leader of the Opposition, but I do not think that the National Parliament should adjourn.",4
14,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister if he will definitely clear up, for the convenience of Victorian members, a point regarding next week'si recruiting campaign in Victoria. 1 have now three telegrams awaiting answers which I cannot give until this point is settled. Will the Prime Minister give me the assurance that during our .absence next week no contentious legislation or the Tariff will be dealt with?",4
15,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Yes .,4
16,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Why did you nob say right it long ago?,4
17,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have already given such an assurance. FARMERS' CONVENTION: QUESTIONS.  the Prime Minister if his attention has been called to the rebuke which was yesterday administered to the Leader of the Opposition, and the honourable member for Balaclava, by the Farmers' Convention at Wangaratta, in its refusal to allow those"" gentlemen to",4
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Question s of this sort may not be asked. Were I to allow the honourable member to proceed, I might be put in an awkward position, because he might conclude with a perfectly legitimate question, though one not really designed to elicit information. Very often questions are asked which are not prompted by the desire to obtain information, and such questions should not be asked. I shall be glad if the honourable member will say straight out what it is that he wishes to know.  the attention of the Prime Minister has been called to the inconsistency of these - gentlemen in advocating the cessation of party warfare",5
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Question s such as the honourable member' is proceeding to ask are not permissible. When a member founds a question on a newspaper report, it is very often difficult for me to divine what he really intends to say. I have warned the House on several occasions that questions such as this should not be asked. As a matter of fact, I do not think that questions should be founded on newspaper reports, and if the practice continues, I shall have to put a stop to it. I have allowed, as far as possible, legitimate questions for the eliciting of information, but I must prevent the asking of questions of the sort now being - asked. WEST TAMWORTH POST OFFICE.",5
20,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Is the Postmaster General aware that his Department is calling for tenders for carrying on the work of the West Tamworth Post Office at a salary considerably less than is now \paid? Will the honourable gentleman look into the circumstances of those who ; are at present managing that post-office for the Department, and have been managing it for many years, and will he take into consideration the expense to which they have been put in erecting premises specially for the Department's work?",5
21,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I do not know anything of the matter, but I shall look into it. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. RECBUITING: NON-DELIVERY OF LETTERS AND CABLES : CRIMINALS IN MILITARY POLICE : REJECTS : DESEBTERS.",5
22,Mr HAMPSON,Unknown,"- I ask the Assistant Minister of Defence if the call for more men for the Expeditionary Forces means that the Defence Department will accept all men fit for military service, equip, in Australia, all that it can, and send the balance to Egypt to be equipped by the British Government there?",5
23,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Yes .  letters that are returned from Egypt on account of the Postal Department not being able to find the addressees, and owing to cable messages to Egypt not being delivered, and those from Egypt not being received at this end, will the Prime Minister take into consideration the suggestion made by the honourable member for Wannon last night, that some individual should be appointed to organize arrangements in Egypt so that correspondence to and from the Expeditionary Forces may be attended to with the utmost de1 spatch ?",5
24,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The idea of the honourable member is one of which everybody is in favour, and the only point in question is the best method of giving effect to it. I will consult with the Minister of Defence with a view to improving the correspondence service if that be possible.",5
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I had a letter yesterday from a man who stated that he had written to his son thirty-four times, and he had not received one of his letters.",5
26,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I ask honourable members to be patient, because the circumstances are beyond our control; but anything that the Government can do to improve the conditions will be done.",5
27,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"In reference to a question I asked yesterday regarding a member of the Expeditionary Forces who had a record of several convictions against him in the criminal Court, is the Assistant Minister of Defence aware that the police have declared that they warned the military authorities that the man in question was a confirmed criminal, and that, despite that warning, the man was made a member of the military police ? I understand that that is not the only such case.",5
28,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I promise the honourable member that the matter will be in vestigated.,6
29,Mr EINLAYSON,Unknown,"Does not the Assistant Minister of Defence consider the enormous number of rejects on account cf physical unfitness amongst those who volunteer for active service enough to warrant an investigation ""by a Board ?",6
30,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I shall bring the question under the notice of the Minister of Defence with a view to ascertaining the best means of investigating the point which the honourable member has raised.,6
31,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I should like to bring under the notice of the Assistant M i nister of Defence the fact that, owing to a number of men deserting on the eve of embarkation for the front , other men have been selected to fill the vacant places in the ranks at such short notice that they have had no opportunity of taking a farewell of their relatives and friends, and making necessary final arrangements.",6
32,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I shall bring that mattor under the notice of the Minister of Defence, and give the honourable memher a reply later. NATIONAL GOVERNMENT ",6
33,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Has the attention of instructions, Mr Speaker. the Prime Minister been drawn action of the New Zealand Government in having already appointed a Committee of both Houses to deal with war matters, and tlieir expressed willingness to consider the formation of a National Cabinet, so that the whole strength of the Dominion Parliament may be concentrated on war matters? Is it the in tention of the Commonwealth Government to take any action which will enable this Parliament to similarly concentrate its energies ?",6
34,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have received from New Zealand a cable message which of states the facts practically as obtained by the honourable member. All I desire to say on - the subject is that, in the Dominion Parliament, the parties are practically even in numbers. [ 1 6 4 ] -2 NA HARVEST.",6
35,Mr RODGERS,SHIPPINGTONNA GE FOR TH E,"In view of the excellent prospects of the next wheat harvest, and the shortage of food supplies in the United Kingdom, will the Minister of Trade and Customs get into touch with, the Imperial Government, aud also with the shipping trade and the Chambers of Commerce, with a view to securing tonnage for the carriage of our surplus wheat overseas? serious Mr TUDOR - I informed the honourable member for Calare yesterday that the Government are taking steps in regard to this matter, but I am not yet in a position to state what is being done. The Government hope that the anticipations of the honourable member for Wannon that we shall have a bumper harvest will be realized, and that adequate arrangements for its transport overseas may be made. ALTERATION OF QUESTION. '",6
36,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPINGTONNA GE FOR TH E,"I was asked by the Minister of Home Affairs yesterday to place on the notice-paper a question I desired to ask without notice with regard to voting facilities for Australian citizens serving at the front. I accordingly gave notice of a question in which I asked what facilities could be given to any Australian voters who, at the time of the forthcoming referenda, might be prisoners of war. That question has been omitted from the notice-paper, I understand under your May I ask to the the reason for that course?",6
37,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPPINGTONNA GE FOR TH E,"When there is any doubt as to whether a question is one which should appear on the notice-paper, it is referred to me. In my opinion the latter portion of the question asked by the honourable member not only could serve no useful purpose, but was satirical in tone, and was so worded that it should not appear on thÂ© notice-paper. I instructed that that portion should be omitted.",6
38,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPINGTONNA GE FOR TH E,"I should like to say, by way of personal explanation, that many the electors in my constituency have gone to thÂ© front . When an important question is to be submitted to the people, am I not justified in asking what voting facilities will be given to those who .are at the front ?",6
39,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPPINGTONNA GE FOR TH E,-The honourable member will certainly be justified in asking such a question if it is couched in proper language. NA OPPOSITION.,7
40,Mr HAMPSON,SPEECH BY LEADER OP,"Has the Prime Minister read the report in the Melbourne press of a speech in which the Leader of the Opposition warned the farmers that these were days when people had to look after themselves, and he had never believed, and did not now believe, in the State fixing prices? Does the Prime Minister think it would be useless to point out to the right honourable gentleman that he should follow the noble example of Mr. Lloyd George",7
41,Mr SPEAKER,SPEECH BY LEADER OP,"If questions of this character are to continue, I shall have to take steps to compel honourable members to give notice of all questions. The honourable member is endeavouring to introduce a debatable point by way of question without notice. I ask honourable members not to follow that course, because it will only oblige me to take steps which will prevent many legitimate questions beinp asked. NA SOLDIERS.",7
42,Mr RODGERS,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"This Govermnent has, very rightly, decided to remit the bate duties on the estates of soldiers who may die at the front. Will the Prime Minister bring this decision under the notice of the various State Governments, with the suggestion that they should take a similar course? Will he also consider the desirability of providing some central means whereby the administration of these estates may be carried out cheaply and economically?",7
43,Mr FISHER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"It is a rule of etiquette, and a very good one, that one Parliament shall not interfere with any other in its legislative capacity.",7
44,Mr RODGERS,ESTATES OP DECEASED,But they are our soldiers!,7
45,Mr FISHER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,I do not think that would justify interference on our part.,7
46,Mr GROOM,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Sen d the suggestion along without comment.,7
47,Mr FISHER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"All the Parliaments have agreed that none shall deal with the affairs of the other. Otherwise there might be much inconvenience and misunderstanding. If the honourable member would send his suggestion to the proper officer, it would, no doubt, receive sympathetic consideration. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",7
48,Mr JH CATTS,ESTATES OP DECEASED,I should like the Prime Minister to say what was the nature of the arrangement entered into between himself and the Leader of the Opposition in regard to private members' business last Thursday afternoon?,7
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,There was no arrangement.,7
50,Mr JH CATTS,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"T n moving the adjournment of the debate on my motion in regard to sugar, the Prime Minister is reported, on page 4324 of Hansard, to have said, "" I have made an arrangement with the Opposition that other important matters shall be dealt with."" It appears from that that I was breaking some arrangement entered into by both sides of the House, to practically dispense with private members' time.",7
51,Mr SPEAKER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Order ! Is the honourable member making a personal explanation ?,7
52,Mr JH CATTS,ESTATES OP DECEASED,I want to ask the Prime Minister what was the nature of the agreement ?,7
53,Mr FISHER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Briefly , may I say that I made a statement that the time would probe required for dealing with the referenda.",7
54,Mr JH CATTS,ESTATES OP DECEASED,That was some time ago.,7
55,Mr FISHER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,I announced some time previously that both sides would be agreeable that the time should be devoted to the discussion of these Bills. That was the reason I said what I did. I think it was expected that the time would be given entirely tc the discussion of the referenda proposals.,7
56,Mr JH CATTS,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I should like to make a personal explanation. I understood that the only portion of private members' time that was to be taken away was the time usually devoted, on Thursdays, to dealing with private members' notices of motion, but I also understood that the usual arrangement regarding the third Thursday was not to be interfered with. Consequently when I proposed the amendment I did last Thursday I considered that I was quite within the arrangement by which this time at least was guaranteed to private members. I met with a number of interjections, and in the confusion hardly knew whether an arrangement had been made or not with the Opposition that this particular private members' time should be also sacrificed. Certainly I did not know of any arrangement. I offered then to give way if any arrangement had been made. This offer was refused. I can quite see that the Prime Minister did not intend the statement as it appears in Hansard, which might lead readers to believe that the time. I was occupying was part of the time covered by an arrangement previously entered into.",7
57,Mr GREENE,ESTATES OP DECEASED,There was no arrangement of any sort.,8
58,Mr FISHER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,I made a public statement in Parliament that these days were required for the discussion of the Referenda Bills.,8
59,Mr MASSYGREENE,ESTATES OP DECEASED,You made a public statement that you would like to debate the Bills in that time; that was all.,8
60,Mr JH CATTS,ESTATES OP DECEASED,The Opposition Whi p now supports his leader in stating there was no arrangement. I did not understand that the third Thursday was to be taken away from private members. If that had been the intention there is a proper way of doing it-by moving to take such time for Government business. The fact that the Order of the Day being called on shows it was not arranged or understood that it should be dispensed with .,8
61,Mr SPEAKER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"The honourable member is now going beyond the bounds of a personal explanation. . Mr JH CATTS - I do not want the people of this country who read Hansard to be under the impression that I had broken any arrangement. It appears now that this was not an arrangement made to do away with the time allotted to private members on the third Thursday. It came as a surprise to me to find that the Opposition had only occupied about fifteen minutes in dealing with the referenda business, which shows that they could not have arranged for the whole afternoon beforehand. ADJOURNMENT (Formal).",8
62,Mr SPEAKER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I have received letter from the honourable memher f o Nepean, in which he states his desire to move the adjournment of the House in order to discuss a matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" the administration of the military camp at Liverpool."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",8
63,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Nepean) [2.55] - For a considerable time past rumours have been in persistent circulation regarding the condition of affairs at the Liverpool. Camp.,8
64,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,You might have given me an intimation of this.,8
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"It is not hostile, and is not intended to be. What does it matter?",8
66,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I had no desire to be discourteous to the Minister. Probably my inexperience in these mattersthis is the first time. I have taken a course like this-is responsible for no notice having been given. I wished to consult my leader, but, unfortunately, he was not here. I hope the Minister will accept my assurance that I intended no discourtesy. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear! ' Mr ORCHARD - For some time past rumours have been persistently circulating in New South Wales, and are still being circulated, to the effect that a good deal of mismanagement exists at th& Liverpool Camp. So serious were some of the allegation!) that I determined to investigate for myself, and to place the results before the members of this House. Honourable members will well understand the difficulty that lies before anyone who endeavours to obtain confirmation of these matters from the officers. My experience has been that, however well an oflicer may be personally known to an inquirer, immediately an attempt is made to obtain from him some definite statement regarding any complaint, he becomes as dumb as the proverbial oyster. Therefore, I sought my information elsewhere. There are in the Liverpool Camp a number of men whom I have known for many years. I have had the opportunity of judging of their ''veracity, and the statements I am about to make have been given to me by men whose truthfulness and sincerity I have not the slightest occasion to doubt. One of the chief causes of complaint concerns the lack of uniforms at the camp. I spoke a to one man who was acting as guard. r There are forty men whose duty it is to act as pickets, sentries,' and guards in and around the camp. He informed me that there were only twelve overcoats available for the use of these forty men. some of the overcoats. They were a disgrace to the Department, and, in my opinion, would have been rejected by any decent old clothes purchaser. I asked my informant whether it was a fact that all the men wore these coats at different times. He replied' that most of them .did, though some men wore their own coats in preference to military overcoats which had been worn by men some of whom had been sent to hospital suffering from various complaints.",8
67,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,This is the way courage recruiting!,9
68,Mr KELLY,ESTATES OP DECEASED,If the Government want to encourage recruiting they should see that the camp is decently managed.,9
69,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"My informant went on to say that it was h u r t f u l to the men in camp to find that at the German concentration camp every requirement was provided. He stated that only the week previous 1,000 overcoats were sent out to the German camp to be worn by the prisoners interned there.",9
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,That is the way to encourage recruiting!,9
71,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I paid a visit to the German concentration camp, and found that every statement that had been made to me in regard to it was correct. There are 1,300 prisoners interned there, and Â©very man is provided with a new, warm overcoat. What is more, there is a surplus stock in the racks waiting for other prisoners who may be sent there. The lack of uniforms at the Liverpool M i l i tary Camp is general. Some men who have been in camp for two months have had only the clothes they were wearing at the time they enlisted. They have been training and doing the ordinary work of the camp in these clothes, with the result that their garments have speedily become almost unfit to wear. I was assured that many of these young fellows had been unable to go home to say farewell to their parents or .friends, because they could not appear before thera* decently clad. One man assured me that ho had spent nearly Â£ 2 0 on clothes which he had been compelled to wear since he had gone into camp. He had been there over two months.",9
72,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Does the honourable member mean to say that he had worn out Â£ 2 0 worth of'clothes in two months?,9
73,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I should have said that he had been in camp for four I saw months. At the Redfern railway station, a few weeks ago, I met a young fellow whom I have known for some years, and who told me that he was leaving for the front with the 13th Regiment two days later. When I inquired why he was not in uniform he said, "" I have no uniform, but we have been told that uniforms will be issued on the morning of the day upon which we embark."" He told me that he had been in camp six weeks, that he had never handled a rifle in his life before he enlisted, and that to enhe had not undergone any rifle practice since he had been in camp. No ammunition, he said, was available at the butts, and no blank cartridge was obtainable to demonstrate to the men how to fill the magazines of their rifles. This young fellow told me further that there were only t h i r ty rifles available for 500 men for training purposes, and that they were of an obsolete pattern, so that any in struction given to the men regarding the use of them would be valueless when they received the Lithgow rifles. That statement was confirmed by scores of men upon my visit to the camp. Men also told me that some of the rifles coming from Lithgow are defective, inasmuch as the screws attached to the "" sights,"" which regulate the distance you desire to shoot at, were becoming detached and lost, thus making one of the most important sections of the rifle quite useless. This lack of rifle practice constitutes thÂ© gra'vest charge against the military authorities. I am bringing forward this matter, not in any party spirit, but in the interests of the men themselves. It is almost criminal to send away these boys before they have received thÂ© necessary rifle practice. In all probability the authorities will say that they will obtain the necessary practice when they' reach Egypt. Mr FISHER. - What practice does the honourable member say a man needs ?",9
74,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,It takes a long time to make a man an efficient rifle shot.,9
75,Mr FISHER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,A man can become efficient in three months.,9
76,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,But these men have had no practice.,9
77,Mr FISHER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,I know what I am speaking about. I have done my trials after three months' practice.,9
78,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"A lot of these troops axe now leaving as reinforcements, and if they are to be useful as reinforcements they will not be able to stop at Egypt, but must go direct to the front. One of my complaints is that there have been sent away as reinforcements men who have been in camp at Liverpool for only a week. If the authorities wish to send seasoned men-o r men who have had some degree of practice-as reinforcements, why should they not select those who have been longest in camp, and who have had some training, instead of calling for volunteers from men who have been in camp for only a few days? Continuing my investigations, I found that the huts which are being erected for the men aâ¬ Liverpool, while a big improvement in many respects on the tents, are really no improvement in the direction of conserving health. They are too draughty. The floors of these huts, which are laid on brick piers, have a space of from 1 foot to 2 feet beneath them, and since they are laid down in sections, openings arc l e ft through which the draught comes up. The men are provided only with a waterproof sheet and three blankets for bedding, so that honourable members can understand the discomfort which they suffer and the liability to catch cold under which they labour. Fogs are very prevalent at Liverpool and colds are common. The principal sickness amongst the men consists of chest and throat troubles. These huts do not protect them from such complaints. The men in their spare time are fillin g in the openings in their huts in order to try to keep out the draught Hundreds of cases of pneumonia and kindred complaints have gone through the hospital, and numerous deaths have resulted. I would earnestly suggest to the Department the necessity of supplying the men in camp with mattresses. Straw is cheap enough, and straw mattresses would add to the comfort and protection of the men. I do not suggest that our soldiers in the making should be pampered and coddled, but we must take into consideration the fact that many of the men in camp have gone there direct fro m good homes, and that they have never had to rough it . One of the first considerations of the Government should be to insure the health of the troops. These men at Liverpool Camp at present are not receiving the consideration they deserve. Owing to the draughty character of the huts those occupying them are liable to catch cold even more readily than would be the case if they were under canvas. Considering the hardships and suffering which lie before them, we should at least make our lads decently comfortable while they are learning the work of a soldier. Each of these huts is occupied by forty-six men, and I find that no provision is made in them for the storage of bread. Bread is issued every night, and lies exposed in the huts all night, without even a partition between the bread and the men who are sleeping there. The Government should consider the desirableness of applying to our military camps some of the provisions that the various State Governments apply to ordinary employers of labour, to protect the well-being of their men. I ask the House to consider the difference between the treatment of the Germans at the concentration camp and our men at Liverpool. I found that those interned at the German concentration camp had everything possible to make them comfortable. They had straw mattresses and decent bunks, whereas our men at the Liverpool Military Camp say anything apparently is good enough for them. They say, "" We are treated not like men, but like dogs.""",10
79,Mr HAMPSON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,A disgraceful statement to make.,10
80,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,I am only stating the truth in repeating what is said in the camp.,10
81,Mr HAMPSON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Twaddle !,10
82,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"A speech like this will do a lot to encourage recruiting! Mx. FISHER - No , no; let the honourable member proceed. Mr ORCHARD , - I think it my duty to bring the matter before the House.",10
83,Mr FISHER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Hear , hear!",10
84,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"If the Assistant Minister of Defence wants to know why more recruits are not offering, let him go to this camp and he will find out for him . self. A want of system also prevails in connection with the hospital arrangements. It is said that men are asked to line up at 6.45 in the morning, and if they are not in the ranks at that hour they cannot .be seen again by a medical man u n t i l evening, they being called upon to do their ordinary duties during the day. It iB quite common for men to be lined up for an hour and a half or two hours waiting for the doctors to examine them, and this in wet weather, when the men have only their dungarees on. The result is that men, when they are admitted to the hospital, are in an infinitely worse condition than when they first applied.",10
85,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Do you say that the men are in their dungarees only?,11
86,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,In their dungaree outer clothing only.,11
87,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Hav e they not woollen underclothes?,11
88,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Possibl y they have, but that is not much protection with only dungarees over them.",11
89,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Ah !,11
90,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"At the camp of the German prisoners every man has a woollen undervest, though only a proportion-abou t one-third of our men-at the Liverpool Camp have such a garment. I am sorry that the Minister should regard my action today from a hostile point of view.",11
91,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,I can assure the honourable member that I do not.,11
92,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"What I am doing is for the best; and I earnestly suggest that one of the huts should be lined and placed near the hospital, in order to afford the men some protection when they are seeking medical aid. This would be an innovation highly appreciated by every man; and I feel confident that it would prevent a good deal of sickness. When a man is not sick enough to go into hospital, and is given a prescription, the first thing the chemist asks is, "" Where is your bottle ?"" Naturally, the man replies that he has no bottle; and he is then informed that he cannot have any medicine until he produces one. Just imagine asking men, who are offering their services and to have the forethought to provide themselves with medicine bottles in case they should become sick! All the details mentioned are such as should be attended to, in the interests of the men themselves.",11
93,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"You ought to make specific charges, and attempt to prove them.",11
94,Mr FENTON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Giv e names.,11
95,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Yes .,11
96,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I challenge the Minister to go to the camp and make inquiries. I could go direct to the men who have made the charges, and I am prepared to go through the camp with the Minister, and take him to the sources of my information.",11
97,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Well , I shall give you the opportunity.",11
98,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"If my action today results in improved conditions, I shall feel that I have not spoken in vain.",11
99,Mr FISHER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Will you accept the Assistant Minister's invitation?,11
100,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,I shall be very pleased to take the Minister direct to the men who gave me the information. I am sure that the Assistant Minister does not know what is going on.,11
101,Mr FISHER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,May I ask the honourable' member whether he laid these statements before the Minister before introducing the subject in the House ?,11
102,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"No , I did not. The military machine moves so slowly that the men will be gone before any improvements are made. I find that men who have gone through the hospital speak of it in the strongest terms of condemnation. One man went so far as to say that if he were sick again he would sooner do something in order to get dismissed the Forces than go to the hospital.",11
103,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Some men have said that sort of thing about the best private hospitals in Australia.,11
104,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"The meu say that the doctors are callous and indifferent, and show no sympathy for them. One man told mo that he had been informed that a man had been in the hospital three days before he was examined by the doctors. Another made the statement - and it was acquiesced in by others standing around-that the reason they had no confidence in the hospital was that the doctor in charge is a Germanof German parentage-and believed to their lives, have German sympathies.",11
105,Mr FENTON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Who is the doctor? .,11
106,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Dr Schlink. Men who have devoted their lives to the study of first-aid, and have gained certificates and medals, have been rejected in favour of men with no experience or service in the Army Medical Corps. One man with over eleven years' experience, who had been an instructor ih connection with the Railways and Tramways Ambulance Corps, was told by the doctor in charge, when his certificates had been read, that he had too much experience-al l that was wanted was a man who could "" wash a face."" It is impossible for a man to have too much experience for such work. It is said that this doctor, who is of German parentage and sympathies, is endeavouring to make the work of the Army Medical Corps as ineffective as possible at the front . That is the statement made, though it may be correct or otherwise.",11
107,Mr HAMPSON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Do you believe it ?,12
108,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Jus t one moment, let me bring forward the facts. opinion can honourable members hold o l the military authorities who have selected for such a highly important position as that of Chief Medical Officer a man who has already been reported for disloyal utterances at the Australia Club, and who, according to a letter which Senator Pearce said in the Senate last week he had received, has relatives against us on the German side.",12
109,Mr BRENNAN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,This is very poor stuff - i b ought to be proved.,12
110,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"The men at the camp have beeu through the hospital, and have seen this doctor's demeanour and methods, and have arrived at the opinion I have expressed.",12
111,Mr FISHER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,How near are the relatives ?,12
112,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I understand they are brothers. I say that the presence of this doctor in the hospital is an insult to the people of Australia, and an outrage on those boys who are freely offering their lives in this time of the Empire's need, and he ought not to be permitted to remain there one moment longer. We have plenty of fully-equipped Australian doctors, and some of these ought to be placed in charge. I should now like to refer to the matter of the horses. Last week I asked the Assistant Minister of Defence a question in regard to 1,200 horses having been left at the Liverpool Remount Depot without feed, and the honourable gentleman practically admitted the fact. Here we have horses- a living asset of Â£30,000-lef t without feed. At Liverpool the horses are tied in an enclosure, the ground of which is as bare as the floor of this chamber. The animals receive a few handfuls of feed per day, but as no nose-bags are available, these have to be improvised. Until very recently there were no halters, and I was informed, on reliable authority, that some horses had to be tied up with string.",12
113,Mr FENTON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Why do you cotton ? ,12
114,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"This is a serious question, and is not a subject for unseemly levity. The men of t i e 12th L i g h t Horse, who left recently, were compelled, after asking in vain for halters, to purchase some out of the money privately subscribed to provide comforts for the troops; and they had difficulty in getting What a refund. At the same time, I am in formed that at the Ordnance Department there are halters galore, and that their non-supply is all due to red-tape, with which the place is reeking. It does not seem to matter how urgent the need, weeks may elapse before it is supplied. In order to show how wasteful the Department can be in some directions and fighting penurious in others, I may point out that, though a water main passes within a few yard's of one hospital, and could be connected with the institution at a cost of about Â£ 5 , the authorities have been paying a contractor 15s. a day for months past to cart water to this hospital. They can waste money in this direction, but they have no money to spare in order to provide medicine bottles for the troops. I have a few further facts which I would like to bring before the House if honourable members will grant me permission.",12
115,Mr FISHER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,We want to hear the facts; we are as anxious as the honourable member is to get them. I move That the honourable member be granted an extension of time.,12
116,Mr SPEAKER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,The honourable member's time has not yet expired.,12
117,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Fro m the Liverpool military camp I went to the German concentration camp.,12
118,Mr SPEAKER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,In his notice the honourable member distinctly referred to the administration of the military camp at Liverpool. I take it that the internment camp is not a military camp.,12
119,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Bot h camps are at Liverpool. I must confess that I can speak in the highest terms of the excellent management of the concentration camp. There are brains behind it . The sleeping arrangements are infinitely better than those provided in the military camp. Whereas in the military camp the men sleep in enclosed huts, the huts in the concentration camp are open to the north, and waterproof blinds are provided, not say which are dropped at night and rolled up during the day"", allowing the sun and air to heat and ventilate the huts. In the concentration camp the prisoners are allowed to use the floors of the huts as places on which to have their meals. Quite properly, at the military camp the authorities will not permit the men to have their meals in their tents, but this means that the men have to get outside their tents and eat where they can in all sorts of weather. At the German concentration camp there is a better system of serving meals. The meals are served on the principle of a sheep race, and I saw 1,300 men served in fourteen minutes, each man getting his food steaming hot. The system is not so good at the military camp; neither is the cooking. I earnestly commend to the M in ister the desirability of sending an officer to copy some of the innovations made at the concentration camp.",12
120,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Mad e by the Germans? They are their own cooks and waiters.,13
121,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I do not care who has been responsible for inaugurating those arrangements at the German camp. The ideas are very good, and they should be copied. The system of distributing the food is excellent. The huts are built of fibro-cement; a hut to hold 110 men costs Â£184, whereas at the military camp a hut to hold forty-six men costs Â£250, and is not nearly so effective or healthy. Before the authorities erect any mora huts at the military camp they should certainly go to the concentration camp, and take a leaf out of the books of the authorities there. As an Australian, I felt my blood boil when I went to Liverpool and found that our own men were suffering disadvantages,- while men were living in the concentration camp in comparative luxury at our expense.",13
122,Mr SPEAKER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired. Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member have leave to proceed ? Leave granted.,13
123,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I take up my newspaper and read the following: STUDIED CRUELTY - FOUL-MOUTHE D GEKMA.WBRITISH MAJOR FLUNG INTO KILTIC. Official papers forwarded to the Premier by the Agent-General contain copies of correspondence between Sir Edward Grey and the American Ambassador respecting the treatment of English prisoners of war in Germany. Advices, dated 25th March, stated that thing possible was being* done by the United States Ambassador at Berlin for the inspection of camps and relief of prisoners. The correspondence shows that British prisoners, with a few notable exceptions, have been treated with studied cruelty. Sir Edward Grey quotes a report by Major Vandeleur (1st Cameronians), who escaped from Crefeld, after being taken prisoner. The major stated, on the authority of a French priest:"" The German soldiers kick the British prisoners in the stomach, and break their guns over their backs. They force them to sleep out in marshy places, so that many are now consumptive. The British are almost starved, and such have been their tortures that thirty of them asked to be shot."" Describing his own experience, the major wrote :"" All along the line we were cursed by officers and soldiers alike at the various stations, and at Mons Bergen I was pulled out in front of the waggon by the order of the officer in charge or the station, and, after cursing me in filthy language for some ten minutes, he ordered one of his soldiers to kick me back into the waggon, which he did, sending me sprawling into the filthy mess at the bottom of the waggon.""",13
124,Mr BRENNAN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,That German oflicer must have been nearly as bad as the military policeman to whom attention wasdrawn today.,13
125,Mr FOWLER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,The honourable member is trying to set up a very unfortunate parallel.,13
126,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Considerin g what our men are endeavouring to do for Australia, we should do our best for them. We should give them better, and not worse, treatment than is given to the Germans in this concentration camp.",13
127,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Shame ! It is a shame for you to insinuate such a tiling. It isscandalous.,13
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,The Assistant M in ister had better hold his silly tongue and hear the facts. We have had enough of his bluff.,13
129,Mr SPEAKER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Order ! I point out . to the right honourable member for Parramatta and the Assistant Minister that it is my duty to conduct the business of the Chamber. I ask the honourable members, not to interfere.",13
130,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Notwithstandin g the Minister's interjection as to my statement being scandalous, it is the truth . Then another complaint concerns the officers who have volunteered for the front. Many of these men are giving up excellent everypositions in order to discharge their duty to the Empire, many of them are makinggreat sacrifices by enlisting. We all know the type that they represent. They have proved their worth on the heights of Gallipoli . The officers of whom I speak are about to take the places of officers who have sacrificed their lives there, and who, by their fearless daring and dash-assisted by their gallant men-hav e made one of the most glorious pages in the eventful history of our Empire. The officers who are about to go to the front are men who have been engaged in various professions and businesses, and naturally a good many details in connection with their private affairs require to be attended to before they leave Australia. It has been generally understood that the military authorities have been in the habit of allowing them ample time to complete these arrangements. cently an order was issued under which these officers are required to appear at 10 o'clock in the morning before the Commanding Oflicer at the Camp, and to state their reasons for desiring leave. If the reasons advanced are satisfactory, passes are issued under which they are permitted to leave the Camp. But at the gates they are stopped by a sentry who examines their passes before they are allowed to proceed. On reaching the bridge, another sentry is encountered, and the .same procedure is.repeated. On the day - of my visit to the Camp an officer chanced to be leaving it in a cab, with the result that nearly the whole of the traffic on - the road was hung up whilst his pass was - being examined. I do not say that the precaution is altogether unnecessary from a military point of view, but considering that these men have big private interests, I think that more latitude should be allowed them to arrange their private affairs. By adopting the password a good deal of the existing friction in respect of officers' leave might be avoided. ' My investigations have convinced me that - some very great change is necessary if we desire to make our military machine an effective one. I am sure that one of the causes of dissatisfaction in the Liverpool - Camp arises from the evil of centralization. I am assured that it is necessary - to send to head-quarters in Melbourne for official confirmation of everything that is done at the Camp. The omcers dare not act without that oflicial confirmation. In his report last year General Ian Hamil - ton predicted that this would be the case if war ever broke out. He expressed his - opinion in very strong terms, as will be seen by reference to paragraph 73, at page 25 of his reportActually, the Australian system, as it exists today, is so purely a product - of peace procedure that it could not hope to carry on beyond ' the first few weeks of war. The centralization in the Defence Department at Melbourne exceeds anything I have experienced during more than forty years' service in India, in the United Kingdom, and in every part of the world where troops administered by the British War Office are stationed. That this centralization is due wholly to the existing system of financial control I am not prepared to assert; but, unquestionably, it is on financial grounds that the present mass of petty questions, which in a well-ordered business would be dealt with locally, are now referred from districts to head-quarters. Hence an inevitable tendency to centralize in other branches of work. Hence* also, an increasing unwillingB u t reness on the part of officers to act on their own responsibility. Hence, again, a real danger that, in course of time, the spirit of initiative throughout the Army may suffer. Hence, finally, the most fruitful cause of disaster in time of war-namely , the collapse of the officer trained for many years to be frightened to death of a sixpence when he is suddenlycalled upon to decide a matter in which thousands of pounds may be involved. That prediction is being verified today. I am of opinion that many of our high officers, as the result of living for years in an atmosphere of red-tape, have become absolutely incompetent to deal with the present position. It is only too true that men who have been long accustomed to such an atmosphere fail to utilize their full powers of initiative. Whether the security of Government positions induces mental laziness, or whether there is some peculiar germ in the atmosphere of red tape which results in a kind of sleeping sickness, I cannot say. But I ' am justified in affirming that our military system is suffering from what may be termed- ""the blight of the official mind, which sits'u'pon the service like a frost, and which nips the most promising shoots of originality in the bud. This blight is'cementing the whole of the service into a hard, inelastic mass, which is incapable of initiative or original thought. The Minister of Defence has a unique opportunity at the present time, but he is hampered-as anybody else in his position would be hampered-if he does not possess the courage to break the bonds which bind the service as effectively as Gulliver was ever bound by the L ill i putians. I am quite prepared to accept full responsibility for my action today. Nobody regrets more than I do the necessity for bringing these matters before the House. But honourable members talk about recruiting. W it h the knowledge I possess as the result of my visits to the Liverpool Camp, how can I conscientiously go on the public platform and advise people to send tlieir sons to the front? If my own son were of age, I would have to seriously consider the wisdom of allowing him to enter the Liverpool Camp unless some better conditions are substituted for those at present existing.",13
131,Mr HAMPSON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,And yet the honourable member says that the fate of the nation is hanging in the balance.,15
132,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,It is not fair to raw recruits against trained men-agains veteran soldiers like the Turks.,15
133,Mr HAMPSON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Our troops are better equipped than are any other troops in world.,15
134,Mr ORCHARD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"We are sending men to the front who lack necessary experience with the rifle. Upon this matter, I enwell tertain very strong feelings. I invite orable members opposite to visit the Livera pool Camp, and to see for themselves the conditions which obtain there. To send lads to the front in an unprepared state criminal. It is not fair to Australia; is not fair to those parents who are giving their lads to the Empire; and it is not to the brave boys who, by their heroic deeds, have made a name for Australia which will live for ever in the imperishable annals of our race.",15
135,Mr FOWLER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Perth) [3.40] - I have ing only a few words to say on this motion, partment. but at the outset I wish to express my impatience at the exclamations with which honourable members opposite greet any honourable member on this side who endeavours to bring about some improveto ment of a condition of things that is noI torious regarding the' training and ment of our Expeditionary Forces. to Speaking for myself, I have during rein cent months had to exercise a very conhaa siderable degree of self-restraint indeed, because I did not wish even to suggest anything which might discourage ing, or interfere with the work which I was'hoping that the Minister of'Defence and the Assistant Minister were performmy ing to remedy shortcomings so notorious. The honourable member has referred to conditions prevailing at the Liverpool Camp, but they are not confined to that camp. I have been for many months in close touch with both officers and pricamps, vates of ""the Expeditionary Forces of this State, and if only a tithe of what they inform me is correct, some very radical change is required at head-quarters. I do not know how it is, but the Defence Department seems to be considerably lacking in ordinary horse-sense. Things are done which make one's blood boil, and are repeated again and again until one wonders where we have obtained the men who have control of these matters. I have a very high personal regard for the Minister of Defence. I do not care to criticise him too harshly in the circumstances. Again, in this connection I desend precate the cry which is heard from the t Government benches, whenever any matter connected with the Defence Department is discussed, that we should not the blame the Minister, but some one else. Senator Pearce appears to be sacrosanct in the opinion of honourable members opposite. I know that he has been kept to the front as an ideal Labour M in honister. I am aware that he has achieved high reputation in this respect merely by leaving himself almost entirely in the hands of his officers, and speaking such is words as they have instructed him to speak. it Knowing the Minister of Defence well, I say deliberately that he is almost the fair last man of ""the party opposite who ought to be in charge of the Defence Department at the present time.",15

In last Monday's press, a report was published from the British Ordnance Officer in Egypt stating - that the rifles supplied to the Australians Â«ame up to anything he had seen, and were of very - superior quality. . Mr ORCHARD - That may be; but that is not to say that some are not defective.",18
190,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"There may be one or two defective, but the honourable member'sallegation was that we were giving our men rifles that were practically not fit to shoot with . No doubt there is room for some little complaints.",18
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Do not say that.,18
192,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,I should be very foolish to stand here and say that in all these camps throughout the Commonwealth not one genuine complaint can be made.,18
193,Mr RODGERS,ESTATES OP DECEASED,What does the honourable member say as to the absolute lack of rifle practice?,18
194,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"That is not general. The Minister will not admit such a thing. It must be remembered that nearly every soldier in the firing line had three or four months' experience in Egypt in solid training and firing practice before he went to the Dardanelles. If the troops have He not received quite sufficient training here, they have sufficient before being put into the firing line. I promise the honourable member that his complaints will be looked into to see if there is any foundation for them.",18
195,Mr FENTON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Would you not have looked into them if the honourable member had come to you privately?,18
196,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Certainly ; and if the honourable member had sent the Minister soldiers are a letter containing these allegations they would have been promptly looked into.,18
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Parramatta) Quartermaster- [ 4 . 0 ] - I want to say just a few words about the Liverpool Camp. I have not been there on this occasion, but I know the place very well, and I am afraid that a great many of the troubles) arise from the lay-out of the camp itself, its location being on the edge of the river.",18
198,Mr FLEMING,ESTATES OP DECEASED,It is very low ground.,18
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Yes ; but 2 or 3 miles away there is an area of high ground, in every way suitable for a camp, and I am given to understand that that is where the German internment camp has been placed. There is high and dry ground only 3 or 4 miles from the river, but yet our camp is dotted over the river, so to speak. I am afraid, therefore, that a good many of the medical cases reported there are due to the location of the camp itself on the edge of the river. Now, may I suggest another thing? I very much doubt whether the principal medical officer is given the requisite discretion and authority necessary for the preservation of the health of the camp, and when I say that, I am not speaking without book.",18
200,Mr WEBSTER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Hav e you mation ?,19
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Yes , I have some information, but it is of a private character. I know the principal medical officer there, Colonel Perkins, and so does the honourable member.",19
202,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,It is the thir d best camp in Australia.,19
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"The principal medical officer is a good man, in my judgment, and from what I know of him. I think in the old days he used to be a Labour man. ",19
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I am only pointing out that fact to suggest that if he has any bias it would be in the direction of this Government, and against the Opposition. But, as I have said, he is a good medical oflicer, in my judgment, and if he were given the necessary freedom, and had full responsibility thrust upon hi3 shoulders, he would see that a Jot of the troubles lately reported were rectified. That is my firm opinion, and I urge upou the Minister that he sliould consult with this officer, who is on the spot, and is responsible for the health of the troops. If the medical officer has to shoulder the responsibility, he should have the requisite freedom to act according to his own judgment. At any rate, he cannot be held responsible until the Minister has taken his advice, as the responsible officer on the spot. I now want to point to a case within my own knowledge. I had a complaint the other day, but I did not trouble honourable members with it . A man in my electorate rang me up to say that one of these young doctors at the camp had sent his brother-in-law, who resides with him, home for a day or two on account of a bad cold. When the man got home, however, the local doctor found that he was suffering from measles seven days old. The camp doctor had not diagnosed the illness, and had sent the man home for a day or two on account of a bad cold. The man, of course, was very indignant that his brother-in-law should have been allowed to roam about the camp, taking all the risks which come in cold weather to people suffering from measles, if not properly treated.",19
205,Mr WEBSTER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,And spreading the disease.,19
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"It has been any infor- admitted time and again that, during this cold weather, the men on the sick list should not be lined up for medical in spection, but it is still being done. They are rounded up in batches of twenty and thirty in the morning for medical inspection. If the Minister were sick, I should guarantee he would want the doctor to come to him, and not be required to go to the doctor. .",19
207,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Hear , hear.",19
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"The Minister, I am sure, would not like to be rounded up and taken some distance to see a doctor.",19
209,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"If that is still going on, it will be stopped.",19
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"It is still going on, in spite of what the Minister has said, and it is time that this matter was rectified. The honourable the M in ister makes assertions so freely from time to time that I can only conclude he has no knowledge of the facts.",19
211,Mr RODGERS,ESTATES OP DECEASED,It is a duplication of Broadmeadows.,19
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"The Minister has a habit of saying point blank that such and such things are not as reported; but I venture to say that all honourable members will acquit the honourable member for Nepean of party bias. I do not think that he ever laid himself open to such a charge, and we have been informed this afternoon that he has, been to the Liverpool Camp, and has investigated these matters for himself. The honourable member for Nepean is_ a man of the world. He has made his own way in his own business, and is able to pass judgment on these matters as well as any of the honourable members on the other side of the House who have been hurling interjections at him. He has been to the camp to see things for himself. Is it not unfair that honourable members who have never seen the camp should gibe and jeer at him when he givesfirsb-handinformation?",19
213,Mr HAMPSON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,You say you have never seen the camp?,20
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"No . It was in my electorate, and I know the ground very well.",20
215,Mr HAMPSON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,What did you say in the beginning of your speech?,20
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I said that I had not been there on this occasion. The honourable member seems to be so obDepartment sessed with party bias that he cannot hear anything said on this side of the House. Meantime I should like to mention other case, while we are on these details. Last evening, as we came out of the hall from a very crowded and enthusiastic meeting at Wangaratta",20

219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I have never practice ? had a more excellent reception in my life from the farmers. The only people the farmers turned down, I think, the Prime Minister and his party. . Mr JENSEN - What has that to do with the Liverpool Camp?",20
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Nothing at all; but honourable members opposite not keep these things out of a debate even of this nature.,20
221,Mr HAMPSON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Who introduced them ?,20
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I did not. I being trained here. was merely about to point out that last evening, as we came out of the hall Wangaratta, one of the farmers bailed me up and told me that a relative of his, who had been sent away as one of the reinforcements to the Dardanelles, had never fired a shot out of a rifle during the whole of his training here.",20
223,Mr RODGERS,ESTATES OP DECEASED,That is the whole trouble.,20
224,Mr GREGORY,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"That is not the only instance, either.",20
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,I did not ask him,20
226,Mr RODGERS,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Rifl e practice is the every day. one thing that gives a man a fighting chance for his life at the Dardanelles.,20
227,Mr HAMPSON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,What has this to do with the Liverpool Camp?,20
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,It confirms what the honourable member for Nepean says is taking place at Liverpool. Men are being sent away without sufficient rifle training.,20
229,Mr HIGGS,ESTATES OP DECEASED,But have you not urged time and again that men should be sent away without delay?,20
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I am urging that the men should have rifle training, which is an important matter, in my judgment. The necessity for this training evidently has not been grasped by the during the last eleven months, for in front of my house there is a rifle range which, with a little expenditure, ancould be so improved as to double its capacity. The Department cannot be persuaded to spend n fraction over it , and still the men are not getting rifle shooting.",20
231,Mr FENTON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Will the honourable member answer me this question: Does he think the British Generals who would have charge of these men would send them to the front without sufficient rifle,20
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,I am sure they would not if they could help it. I do not were think they would even then.,20
233,Mr FENTON,ESTATES OP DECEASED,They would not do it .,20
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Is that a sufficient reason why Ave should send them away without any rifle training here? canWhat nonsense this is!,20
235,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Since they cannot be sent to the front until they are efficient, there is the greater reason for their",20
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"That is the at very reason which I was going to point out. It is because the General cannot send the men straight to the front that they ought to receive the training here. Let it be remembered that all the while the men will be getting three or four months' training in Egypt our numbers in the trenches will be depleted. It is really a serious matter, and party considerations ought not to come into play. Here are the facts; the Minister cannot deny them, because they are facts within my own knowledge; they are occurring",20
237,Mr ARCHIBALD,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"Do you not think that they could be brought under the notice of the Minister without being laid before the House? - ,",20
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,All that I have to say to my honourable friend is that I have brought these things before the Minister mauy a time. The range to which I have referred is the same range the settlement in connection with which occupied five years. It now requires only a little extra expenditure.,21
239,Mr SPEAKER,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Order! Will right honourable member confine himself to the subject-matter of the motion 1,21
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I am discussing the question of r if e training at the Liverpool Camp, and pointing out that my own place is close to that locality, and that the authorities could easily take troops there and train them in the use of rifles if they would only go to the expense of duplicating the existing targets. That is one instance of reform which I am mentioning. We cannot get the authorities to incur the little expenditure necessary in such matters. Year in and year out we are at the Department, and here is a chance when the authorities have unlimited funds at their disposal. Nobody is questioning them on matters of economy, yet with all this infinite pressure upon us the trouble still exists, though it could be at once obviated by the Department if it would only spend a little money. regards the matters of administration referred to at Liverpool, I know that there are very serious complaints. The question of the supply of cloth has been referred to. The honourable gentleman made the statement that every place in the Commonwealth which can turn out a roll of cloth is doing so at top speed, but that is not so. Notwithstanding the statement of the Assistant Minister, it is not the case.",21
241,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,Excep t one m ill .,21
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"In the Commonwealth there are mills which are not supplying cloth to the Department, while there are other mills which are not working full time. In a time like this every ounce of energy ought to be pressed into all the preparations, no matter where they may be made, because the matter is as serious as it can be, both for our troops and for our cause and all that relates to the preservation of our Empire. I ask the Minister himself to look into these matters, particularly .into the health of the troops. I have suggested to him a way of getting at the truth . I suggest to him that, instead of being content to ask a general question of the Commandant, who no doubt answers to the best of his ability, and on whom I make no reflection, the man for him to consult in regard to the medical conditions of the camp is the Chief Medical Oflicer in charge of the camp and of the State. If the honourable gentleman will do that, I the shall await with the greatest possible interest the outcome.",21
243,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,I promise you that we will ask him for a report.,21
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,The honourable gentlemau should do more than ask him for a report; I have no doubt that he has' already had yards of reports from the medical officer which he has turned down.,21
245,Mr JENSEN,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"I will ask him for a recommendation, too.",21
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATES OP DECEASED,"It is of no use for the honourable gentleman to call for a report if he is not going to act upon it . That is the thing which we want done. The medical officer is the only man who is responsible for these things, and the Minister should not only ask him for a report-and I have not any doubt in my mind that he has his reports.",21

Men have done part of their training in one district, and completed it in another.

We have already appropriated, by our Supply Acts of the last financial year, practically the whole amount included in the Appropriation Bill for the year, and the small sum mentioned in the motion is the unappropriated balance.",23
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Parramatta) [4.26] - Ha d I been present yesterday when the Estimates of the Postmaster General's Department were under discussion, I should have asked some questions about a matter of some importance to the working of that Department-the application of preference to unionists in its administration. Some time ago, the line repairers aud others obtained from Mr . Justice Higgins, as President of the A r b i tration Court, an award whose benefits were conferred only on those who were parties to the plaint. As these did not constitute nearly the whole of the employees of the Department, the Public Service Commissioner recommended to the last Government that the terms of the award should be applied generally throughout the Department.",24
275,Mr GROOM,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,That the award should be made a common rule.,24
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"So far as the Department was concerned. That was done, but I understand that this Ministry has repealed the act of its predecessors. The award, amongst other things, fixed the terms and conditions of officers as well as of the men in the Department, and, I understand, affected officers of salaries as high as Â£40 0 a year. This Government, in reversing the act of their predecessors, have practically decided that from today no man in the Department may expect an increase of wages or of salary u n t i l he has joined a union. As there are no unions of officers for this section of the Public Service, that means t h a i a manager or overseer must join the men's union, whence it will follow that, while the men may be under the control of their overseers during the day, they can at night haul them before the union and place them under control. A r e you likely to have discipline under a system of that kind? This is, in my judgment, carrying unionism to an absurd extreme. Outside the Service, men in many cases refuse to allow bosses to join their unions, objecting to their influence there, but in the Department of the Postmaster-General you compel the managers and overseers to join the men's union, because you refuse to pay them increases unless they do so.",24
277,Mr RILEY,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,Do officers receiving Â£400 a year obtain increases under the award ?,24
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,The salaries of such officers were fixed by the award.,24

280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,Yes .,24
281,Mr SPENCE,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,A great many officers are in the union.,24
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Yes , and the honourable gentleman is forcing the others to join.",24
283,Mr SPENCE,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,The officers are moving now to form a union of their own.,24
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I . am not raising the question of unionism per se; I am dealing now only with its application. Ministers are so tying themselves up by this action that they will ultimately be glad to get out of it . How can you expect discipline if the bosses can be hauled before a union to be brought to book by the men under their control ? What does it all mean? It means that honourable members have had to say to the men, "" We, your special representatives, have been unable to give you justice, and have, therefore, set up an outside court to do so."" Their action in that matter was a confession of failure.",24
285,Mr BRENNAN,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,Is the Leader of the Opposition referring only to the increases made by the arbitration award?,24
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Precisely . No man may get the benefit of the award u n t i l he has joined the men's union. I understand that the Public Service Commissioner, under the new regulation, will have no right to recommend men for in creases unless they have joined a union. Thus the administration of the Service is taken out of his hands.",24
287,Mr BRENNAN,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,That is another matter.,24
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"The two things are inseparable. Honourable members opposite say, in effect, through the medium of Mr Justice Higgins, that the men are - going to manage the Department from the bottom. That is the result in the last analysis. My honourable friends are running mad over this matter of unionism when they apply the principles of uinonism in this way. and will ultimately wish that they had not gone to these extremes. Things cannot continue as they are. There cannot be discipline in the Department unless those in control are free from any but reasonable restrictions on their conduct. The overseers and managers must have control of those under them, but proper control is impossible 0 if they themselves are to be subjected to discipline imposed by the men. Indeed, that is a contradiction of terms. as things are, the men in control are, by the fiat of the Ministry, subjected to the discipline of the men. This is a reversal of the position outside the Service, and I dp not think the results obtained wil l be good for unionism in the long run, nor beneficial to the public interests. I say that the men emploved by the Government should have the best conditions possible. State employees should be treated well; but to say to the bosses, ' ' Unless you join the men's union, and thus subject yourself to the discipline they may impose, you will not get increases of salary,"" is absurd. M i . MAHONY - Are the bosses told that they must join the men's union, or are they merely told that they must become unionists ?",24

The Government's attitude is so utterly foolish and fatuous that I cannot conceive that a great many honourable members know what is actually taking place. In a memorandum to me, when I was Prime Minister, the Public Service Commissioner pointed out what the decision of the Court would lead to, and how it would be destructive of discipline in the Department. To get over the difficulty, he proposed to give the officers justice by making a regulation exempting them from the award of the Court, and yet paying them the increments to which they are entitled.",26

330,Mr GLYNN,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Angas) [4.48] - In view of the statement made in regard to the sugar question, I think the Ministry ought to carefully avoid entering into any understanding with the Queensland Government that might forestall the deliberate judgment of this House as to the contract or arrangement. I do not think that any Government ought to give a contractual undertaking to, or make any binding agreement - with, any person in relation to the Tariff, and I include in that opinion the State Governments, because we cannot regard one State as representing the whole people of Australia, whom it is our duty to protect. There are one or two facts in connection with the sugar industry which we must not leave out of account. The Royal Commission which reported in 1912 stated that the adjustments made up to that date in connection with the sugar industry meant an annual subsidy by the Commonwealth of about Â£1,000,000 a year, and an obligation on the consumer of about Â£1,500,000 annually. I have been endeavouring to look up some figures, but I find it difficult, without checking, present them as I should like to do. However, there are a few statistics to which I wish to draw attention. When we began to deal with the sugar question in 1901, the. import duties produced Â£780,000 per annum. Looking at the Budget figures for this year, I find that in 191? the Commonwealth received only Â£351,821, and that the estimate for this year- a time of drought and of shrinkage in production as well as in importation-is ' Â£90,212. What is apparent is that we have wiped out at least three-quarters of the revenue we were receiving in 1901 from a smaller population, whilst the sugar industry itself, though better in that white labour has been practically substituted for coloured labour, does not show that development which was one of the chief grounds upon which some honourable members advocated the adjustments that were made in 1901. Por instance, we had at first an import duty on cane sugar of Â£6 a ton, and I think there was a rebate of Â£4 a ton for sugar grown by white labour. There was also, until 1907, an Excise duty of Â£ 3 a ton. About 1903, at the instance of Sir George Turner, we changed the rebate into a bounty. We continued to give this bounty until about twelve months ago, and imposed an Excise duty, keeping an effective rate of Â£6 a ton on cane sugar, with a comparatively ineffective rate of Â£10 a ton on beet sugar. The result of that policy is seen in the figures I have given. I am not going to deal with the development of the sugar industry throughout the world during these years, but, taking normal times, there is no doubt that there has been a large increase in the world's production of sugar, and had the more normal import duties that prevailed before 1901, which, I think, averaged Â£ 3 a ton, been maintained, we (should probably have been able to benefit more than we have done by the increased world's production- I mean that the large consumers in Australia, the purchasers for various industries such as jam making and confectionery, who use something like 60,000. or 70,000 tons a year, must have obtained a large benefit by the competition in the world's markets which would have been caused by a more moderate import duty. The thing we have to remember is that in 1905, when Dr Maxwell reported on the sugar industry, and before we came to the arrangement to which was to end in 1913 or 1914, there were 28,614 persons directly or indirectly engaged in the sugar industry. Of these 21,970 were in Queensland, and 6,644 in New South Wales. The number in New South Wales has greatly declined, but for many years we had a rather foolish policy as regards bounties. We so framed our bounties that we paid New South Wales a fairly large sum-it ran to over Â£70,000 in one year, I remember-for growing sugar by white labour, but not for substituting white labour for black labour, because almost all the production in New South Wales before 1901, when we brought in our Federal policy, was grown by white labour. Against the remonstrances of one or two of us, we made this blunder in arranging our policy, thinking that the Constitution would not permit the provision as regards bounties to be framed otherwise, and we actually paid New South Wales a very large sum, although it did not involve the substitution of white labour for black labour, which was the policy we wished to encourage, simply because the labour was white before. I might go on to show how misplaced that policy-was by following up the figures for the last three or four years, showing the numbers engaged in the industry in New South Wales, but I "" think the Budget-papers disclose that there has been a considerable diminution. I have not got the Queensland figures for 1912, but I do not think there has been a great variation in the proportion as against earlier years. I think the Budget-papers show that ou 31st December, 1912, there were 24,789 persons directly or indirectly engaged in the production of sugar ""n Queensland and New South Wales-that is, practically in all Australia. These figures compare with 28,614 in 1905, so that the prophecies that there would be a large development in the sugar industry which were made in support of the policy of 1905 and 1906, when wo extended the provisions of the Acts of 1903 and 1901, have been falsified by the figures given in the Budget-papers. This is a somewhat serious matter for the people of Australia. Let us remember in connection with the sugar industry that from the first have been legislating on the basis of understandings and undertakings. I hope that this Government will not again make the mistake of entering into any undertaking with the Government of Queensland that will forestall the better judgment of this House, because I say deliberately that there is no precedent anywhere for binding a Government with a private party, or even with a State, to continue duties, or to modify duties, or to abolish duties. If we do such a thing at all, we ought to do it , as we did in 1901, by making it part of the schedule of a Tariff Act . We have acted similarly with regard to bounties; we have done so with the import duties; we have done so in connection with the Excise Tariff on stripper-harvesters. The matter is one of general policy, which should be incorporated in the schedule of an Act of Parliament. I repeat that our legislation has all through been based on understandings. In 1885, Queensland determined to put an end to the importation of Kanakas, and, in 1889, in consequence of the report of a Commission which then sat, ten years' grace was granted-fro m 1892 to 1902in the matter of the introduction of Kanakas. We then had a sort of implied undertaking--som e called it a contractwith the producers of Queensland to take up the sugar question under some sense of moral obligation, which led to the policy to which I have made reference. I could go further, and show that it is a great mistake to enter into any understandings of this sort. Let us look at the report of the Royal Commission of 1912. That Royal Commission gave the net revenue of 1910-11 as Â£157,000. The figures for 1901-2 were Â£780,000. The Royal Commission spoke of the f u t i l it y of bounty and Excise systems as a means of promoting a just apportionment of the profits of the industry, in that it virtually abolished all competition by placing the control of prices in the hands of large industrial concerns. It spoke of the failure cf these.systems as a means of securing fair wages. We have, since then, provided by Act of Parliament for better means of accomplishing that end. The report also spoke of the connection between Tariff and Trusts, citing two American authorities, one the President of the American Sugar Trust, to show that the mother of all Trusts is the Tariff, though the Commission regarded that statement as too we sweeping. Nevertheless, the Commission did admit that it must be apparent that an unnecessarily high import duty, unless it is stringently safeguarded, by tending to eliminate internal competition, renders the formation of Trusts more easy, and their despotic control very effective and enduring. It did not for a moment declare that there was a Trust of the class established as a result of the bounties in Australia, as had been suggested before the inquiry of the Commission. I am not, however, going toenter into that question at all. I am merely giving the evidence of an American author it y , cited by that Commission, as to the effect of the policy that had operated in Australia, as well as in America, up to that date. The Commission also suggested that there should be a standard price fixed for both raw and refined sugar. It said that the standard price for Australian refined sugar should be fixed on a basis of not less than Â£21 10s. per ton, adding that, on account of the Australian cost of the price of raw sugar should be fixed on a sliding scale by the Inter-State mission. I am not going to defend or to criticise that policy. I am only referring to it now because it is the occasion of correspondence between the Premier of Queensland and the Prime Minister of Australia. Luckily, at the time Fisher was not led into any arrangement with the State which would have had the effect of binding the hands of the Commonwealth as regards what the rate of duty should be. I notice that in one telegram sent between 6th December and 11th December, 1912, the then of Queensland asked, ""Will Statute, fix the minimum Â£21 10s. ?- If so, it will be necessary for you to secure such power under the Tariff as will preclude foreign sugar being sold in Australia under that price."" extent, at least, a State speaks with a continuous desire, if not on a continuous policy. Governments change, but there - is generally a fairly well-marked tion existing from year to year as to what the State's view is, and I am merely referring to this matter now by way of caution, because I think it is only fair that we should beforehand, to some exteat, indicate the trend of our desires in this matter, which is, at present, in an unsettled condition as between the two Governments. I do not know exactly what direct interest in the sugar question, apart from this matter of purchase, which I am not dealing with, the Government Queensland have. At the time Dr Maxwell reported a return was which stated that the Queensland Government had an indirect, if not direct, relation with the mills established in that State under the Sugar Works Act of 1893-5. I notice that an estimate was given of the obligations due to the Government in respect of thirteen aud one tramway, which amounted about Â£584,000. That is a pretty large sum, and I should be only too glad if the 'Government would give us a statement of Mr Glynn. the exact financial relations between the Queensland Government and the sugar producing industries in Queensland at the present time. They are all factors which must infiuenoe the Ministry when they are asked to enter into an arrangement with a particular State on the basis of the purchase of all the sugar available. I am only throwing production, out a few words of caution, but I do say that, considering the enormous sacrifices Com- of revenue that we are making, and the tremendous burden upon the consumerthe big sacrifices that we have made to attain a good end regarding the kanakaswhich have by no means given the large benefits that were anticipated, the MinMr istry should be particularly cautious as regards the terms of any contract or undertaking that they may enter into or make with the Government of Queensland. At the beginning of the war Mr . MCKenna made a large purchase of sugar for the United Kingdom. Premier you, by Mr AKCHIBALD - What was the effect price at on the English market?",27
331,Mr GLYNN,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"The result was that there was a tremendous slump. Nothing that he anticipated actually resulted. To some That shows how very careful Ministers ought to be. Estimates were submitted of the loss that would be incurred on that purchase amounting to some hundreds inclina- of thousands of pounds. I have seen very high figures quoted, but as some are rather contradictory, I do not propose to put them before the House. I hone that what I have said will have some effect upon the Ministry, and help them in the consideration of this matter, which is of vital importance to the consumers of Australia.",29

In a subsequent mills issue of the Times, however, he to rather modified his previous statement, and commended the Liberal Government for having invited Lord Kitchener to come to Australia to inquire into and report upon a system of military defence for the Commonwealth. The question of which party was responsible for the Militar y and Naval defence systenfof Australia was revived a few days ago by the Attorney-General, who, when speaking to the 'motion for leave to introduce one of the Referenda Bills, said I wish to show clearly that this party and the Government are not only keenly alive to our present danger, and their duty to prosecute the war witli all its energy, but foresaw this war and took steps to prepare for it, when the voices of honourable gentlemen opposite were dumb-whe n there was neither enthusiasm nor prudence, not even common sense, displayed by them. That was a straight-out declaration that the Liberal party, in the early history of this Parliament, had been recreant to its duty in failing to provide for Australia an adequate scheme of defence. I proscheme-i pose this afternoon to place on record militia. the facts as disclosed by authoritative historical documents, with the object of proving that the Liberal party, whom the Attorney-General said failed to make provision for the defence of Australia, were, in reality, actually responsible for giving effect to the present system. 1 of shall go back to the genesis of this matter aweeks feeling that the time has come wnen we should have placed on record, by a reone cital from authoritative sources, the hisin tory of the development of the defence movement in Australia in order that or credit may be given to whom credit is due.

I think that the proposal that has been made that every man should be compelled to make self perfect in the use of the rifle, as a of preliminary to his right to vote, is a very good one. . . . There is one matter that should be provided for in the Bill, and that is that the cadet system should be compulsory. I would make it compulsory for every boy between the ages of thirteen and eighteen to join a cadet corps. This speech by Colonel Crouch, who is"" now commanding a battalion serving at the front, was the first to be made in this House in support of a system of compulsory military training for Australia. The present Attorney-General, in the course of the same debate, said, as reported in Hansard, page 3297I t appears to me that the responsibility of citizenship carries with it the right of defending one's country. It is in return for the privileges we enjoy in a free country that we should do something-d o everything in our power-to defend it in the hour of need. . . . It appears to me that the only remedy, the only sure and certain method of defence, is a f you like to call it so-of a national A fte r referring to the sytem in force in Switzerland, he went on to sayWhat I propose is simply this: that every adult male in this country from the age of eighteen to sixty should undergo a period of training. I propose that from eighteen years age to twenty-one, every man should put in period of six weeks' training, of which three should be continuous, and three weeks' isolated drill; that from the age of twentyyears to thirty years each man should put a period of six weeks, of which ten days should be continuous, and the rest isolated drill; that from the age of thirty-one to forty forty-five, every man should put in a period of six weeks' training, of which seven days should be continuous, and the rest spread over It will thus be seen that the present At torney-General then advocated a system three years' compulsory drill commencing with youths eighteen years of age* His remaining proposals were founded chiefly oh the system prevailing in Switzerland. I could, if necessary, quote a number of statements made in 1903 by in the present Prime Minister and by Mr . Watson, which show very clearly that, at are that time, there was not, on the part of the Labour party, any concrete proposal in for a system of compulsory military So- Sir JOHN FORREST - In those days the arguLabour party did not believe in the mili",30
335,Mr SAMPSON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"It was the right himhonorable member for Swan who introsort duced in this House the Defence Bill of 1903. When the House went into Committee on that Bill, the present Attorney General moved, as reported in Hansard, page 3093, the following amendment:Tliat all the words after the word "" officers,"" line 1, be omitted, with a view to insert lieu thereof the words "" duly appointed all male inhabitants (excepting those who are exempted as hereinafter provided) who have resided in the Commonwealth for six months and arc British subjects, and are between the statementages of eighteen and twenty-one years.

(6) present themselves for detached drills on such other days as may be prescribed; provided that it shall not be compulsory to attend more than thirty-two of such detached drills, aggregating a period of 112 hours. The period for any one detached drill shall not exceed eight hours, nor be less than two hours. Speaking to that amendment, he said, as reported in Hansard, page 3094I propose that they shall present themselves at such places as may be determined upon, not all at once, but in such numbers as be considered convenient. Colonel MCCay, another memher of the held Liberal party, who is now serving at the front, interjected, "" Are they to be paid To which the present Attorney-General replied, ""Most emphatically no."" ther on Mr Hughes said I merely propose to make compulsory, in reference to the male population between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one years, attendance at certain detached drills, and the undergoing of fourteen days' continuous training each year, which has been regarded both here and in England as sufficient for the Volunteer Forces. That was the original proposal made by the present Attorney-General. Crouch, a member of the Liberal party, was the first to propose in this House a system of compulsory training for cadets, but the first member of this Parliament to put into concrete form a proposal for the compulsory military training of junior and senior cadets was ex-Senator Dobson, another member of the Liberal party. On 5th September, 1907, he introduced in the Senate a Bill which provided thatAll boys and youths over twelve and under nineteen years of age shall join, and continue to be members of a naval or military cadet Mr Sampson. corps, and shall receive such instruction in naval or military drill as may be prescribed. That Bill lapsed at the second-reading stage. As we are all aware, Mr Deakin, in the course of a brilliant speech in this in House on 13th December, 1907, outlined and the proposal of his Government with regard to defence. As reported in Hansard, page 7528, he said, in the course of that We propose a system of universal training in order to form a National Guard of Defence in which every young man in the Commonwealth shall be required to serve during his twentieth, and twenty-first years. In that celebrated speech Mr Deakin laid down a comprehensive scheme of defence for Australia, and his proposal for a National Guard of Defence was the first of a comprehensive character to be made. It has since become law, and today leads the whole Empire on the important subject of citizen defence. In July, 190S-twelv e months after the introduction of Senator Dobson's Bill, and several months after Mr Deakin had placed before this House the comprehensive defence policy of which his Governmay ment approved-the question of defence was considered at a Labour Conference in Brisbane, when, for the first time, the policy of a "" Citizens Defence Force "" ?"" was embodied in the fighting platform of the party; while in its general platform Furthe following plank was inserted:Citizen Defence Force, with compulsory military training, and Australian-owned and controlled Navy. On 29th September, 1908, Sir Thomas Ewing, a member of the Liberal Government of that day, introduced in this House a Bill providing for the compulsory training of cadets between the ages Colonel of twelve and eighteen years, and for the compulsory training of all males between eighteen years and twenty-six years of age. That measure, however, lapsed at the second-reading stage. The present Prime Minister came into office on 13th November, 1908, but did little in the matter of defence until 30th March, 1909, or eighteen months after the defence policy of the Deakin Government had been enunciated. On that date Mr. Fisher enunciated the policy of his Government, which made provision only for three years' compulsory training. In June, 1909, the Fisher Government were defeated, and the Deakin-Cook Government came into office. During the sestion of 1909 the right honourable member for Parramatta, aa Minister of Defence in that Administration, introduced and placed upon the statute-book of the Commonwealth the first measure to provide for compulsory military training of junior and senior cadets. The whole groundwork of the scheme, as we have it today, was placed on the statute-book in 1909 by the present Leader of the Opposition, as Minister of Defence. The Government, however, were not satisfied; and it was decided to invite Lord K it chener, the greatest living soldier in the world, to come to Australia. ",30
336,Mr SAMPSON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Well . we thought so, and rightly. Lord Kitchener was invited here in the following terms, in a cable sent to him at Simla, in India, by the Prime Minister on the 9th July, 1909Tlie Government of the Commonwealth is now proposing to Parliament large and costly schemes for the defence of Australia by land and sea. In respect to Naval Defence, the consultative conference in London this month, at which we shall be represented, is certain to bo most valuable. It would be a very great advantage to the Commonwealth were this supplemented on the military side. If , in the course of your projected tour this year, we can bo honoured by a visit of sufficient duration to enable you to inspect our forces and fixed defences, in order to advise this Government upon the best means of developing and perfecting the land defence of the country, we should have much more confidence in completing our schemes. That meant the completion of the scheme which had already been passed into law.  nineteen years was the maximum age.",32
337,Mr SAMPSON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"That is so; but we had the whole scheme in operation as the law of the' land before Lord Kitchener came. The Bill did not become law until after the invitation had been sent to Lord Kitchener, but it was law before he made his visitA visit from you will .be particularly welcome to Australia on personal grounds, and we trust you will consent to be our guest during your stay. As a Government, we venture to urge your acceptance, not only in the public interests of the Commonwealth, but also for Imperial reasons, as, for instance, the recent arrangements regarding the General Staff, so as to associate the military forces of all the Dominions with tliose of the Mother Country. The following was the cable sent by Lord Kitchener to the Prime MinisterWith reference to your telegram 9th July, after attending foreign manceuvres, Japan, early in November, it will give me pleasure to accept your kind invitation to visit Australia. I will be glad of this opportunity of meeting again the men who served so well under me in South Africa, and to help the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia with any advice that I - can give. Then the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth cabled to Lord Kitchener on the same dateGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia extremely gratified your cordial acceptance, which is warmly appreciated throughout Australia. At your convenience, would be glad to learn probable date of and place arrival, probable duration of stay, and of any preparations that can be made in advance to facilitate your inspection. It is a matter of history now that Lord Kitchener came here, and reported on the whole military system, suggesting i m provements and extensions of the scheme that has become law. In his report, dated 12th Februarv, 1910, he says, in paragraph 12- I desire to place the facts before honourable members with as little comment as possibleThe new Defence Act will give sufficient numbers to defend the country effectively if the force provided under it is efficiently trained, organized, and equipped. He is speaking there of the law of the land-of the Defence Act that had been passed by both Houses of Parliament, and had received the Royal assentI t must, however, be distinctly recognised that a national force, maintained at a high standard of efficiency, can only be produced by the work of years, and that such work must be steady and continuous; any divergence from the policy decided on may, and probably will, lead to chaos and useless expenditure of money. On page 5 of his report, in paragraph 6, he says The Defence Bill 1909, which has just been passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, gives effect to the principle that every citizen should be trained to defend his country, and I therefore propose to base the following advice as to the manner in which the force of 80,000 fighting men should be enrolled, organized, and trained on the principle embodied in that Act, which is designed to call into existence a National Citizen Force. It will be noted that he did not make any alteration in the fundamental principle of the Act, b ut simply presented a scheme of organization based on those principles which had received his endorsement and approval. I tliink that the only substantial alteration he did make was an extension of the period of training from twenty to twenty-five years of age. All these facts show that it was a Liberal member who first, in this House, suggested compulsory cadet training.  present Attorney-General was the first.",32
338,Mr SAMPSON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Colone l Crouch was the first member in this House to propose the system of compulsory cadet training. My time is limited, and if honourable members dispute the facts, they must do so at the proper time. Then Senator Dobson introduced the first P ill in the Senate providing for compulsorv training of that kind. Mr Deakin. in 1907, unfoldedthe Liberal defence nolicy in this House, and this was embodied in a Bill by Sir Thomas Ewing in 1908, though the first Government to give effect to the policy of that Bill was the Liberal Government of 1909. The policy then adopted was that in operation today, and that which was endorsed by Lord Kitchener without alteration, except in the way of organization. I think that the facts do not require further comment. I have not time to go into auy comparison of the schemes, or even refer to that laid down by the present Prime Minister in March, 1909. That scheme provided for only three years' training ; but, however that may be, I desire now to refer, as rapidly as I may, to one or two documents which have reference to the Naval U n it . It has been claimed by the Labour party that they have to be credited, not only with the scheme of military defence, but also with the scheme of naval defence. The present Prime Minister, in his Gympie speech, on the 29th March, 1909, a few months after the Imperial Naval Conference, detailed the proposals of the Labour party. H is scheme, however, was quite different from that proposed at the Imperial Conference. The unit was to consist of twenty-four vessels-fou r ocean destroyers, with a speed of ten knots, and with twenty-six knots in an emergency; nineteen destroyers of the River class; and one armed vessel for police duties. That would have been an insufficient defence for Australia. I am afraid that we should have found ourselves very insecure if that had - been recently the only naval defence in the Pacific. In response to the invitation of the Imperial Government, the Liberal Government sent Colonel. Poxton to England as the representative of the Commonwealth. At that Conference the lines for the Naval U n it of the Commonwealth were laid down- a scheme which would fit in with the Imperial system of defence.",33
339,Mr SPENCE,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I notice that the honour the able member is not going back to the days when Mr Watson was here, and first suggested a Navy.",33
340,Mr SAMPSON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I have some of Mr . Watson's proposals or statements amongst my notes, but do not wish to detract from the Labour party's advocacy of an Australian Navy in the early, years of Federation. All I am endeavouring to show now is that the crystallized .efforts of the Labour party for years and years meant this proposal by the present Prime Min- ister in 1909. I guarantee that the two vessels which were sunk at Falkland Islands would have blown such a unit out of the water in an hour. As against that scheme, we had the one enunciated when our representative was present at the Colonial Conference in 1909. It was decided that the Commonwealth should construct one armoured cruiser, the Australia; three second-class protected cruisers, Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane; six destroyers, Parramatta, Warrego, Yarra, Torrens, Ber went, and Swan; and two submarines. A certain number of these have already been sent out, and one of our second-class cruisers is almost ready for launching, although it should have been launched long ago. The Australia, in my opinion, was really a substitute for the proposal of the Liberal party to present a Dreadnought toGreat Britain- a step which would have been more effective than halfa-dozen fleets such as those suggested by the present Prime Minister in March, 1909. I think I have shown very .clearly that the first member within this House who suggested compulsory military training was Colonel Crouch. Subsequent debates on the subject took place here in which members on both sides spoke, the views being of a more or less declaratory character, affirming in some form or another a citizen soldiery responsibility. Resolutions were moved by Senator Dobson on the one side, and afterwards by the present At torney-General on the other side. These were individual and preliminary views on a subject which was occupying much public attention in the press, and in the thoughts of the people. The first real authoritative responsible pronouncement was the unfolding of a comprehensive compulsory system of cadet and citizen soldiery, also an Australian Naval policy, by Mr Deakin, in 1907. This was followed by a Bill embodying that policy by - Sir Thomas Ewing, then Minister of Defence, in September, 1908. however, did not pass the second reading. It was not until after Mr Deakin's declaration, in 1907, that the citizen defence scheme found its way into the Labour party's programme. Soon after Sir Thomas Ewing's Bill of the 29th September, 1908, the Labour party gave the Deakin Government notice that it withdrew its support, and the Fisher Labour Government came into power in December of the same year, and held office until June, 1909, during which period it did nothing. Then the DcakinCook Government came into power, and Mr Cook, as Minister of Defence j n that Government, carried through the House, and passed into law, amidst the stormiest scenes and fiercest opposition from the Labour party yet experienced in ' this House, the great scheme of citizen and compulsory training, which provided for the training of our youths from twelve to 'twenty years of age. . That system is now in force. The same Minister, in the same session, gave us the proposals for the Australian Naval Unit, of which we are so proud, and which has done such valuable service to Australia and to the Empire; and, not satisfied with tbese two monumental, colossal pieces of achieved statesmanship, he also advised that Lord Kitchener, the greatest active soldier of the Empire and the world, be invited to Australia. This was agreed to by Cabinet, and an invitation, in the terms already read to the House, was extended to Lord Kitchener by Mr Deakin. Lord Kitchener accepted the invitation in 1909, and in February, 1910, finished his notable and comprehensive report, which, while endorsing in to to the Australian law of 1909 then, in force, proposed complete scheme of extended torial organization to enable general effect to be given to the Cook military law, and advised that the age, as already contemplated, should be increased to twenty-five years. It was in A p r i l , 1910, two months after Lord Kitchener reported, that the Deakin-Cook Government were defeated and the Labour party proceeded to extend the existing Defence Act on the lines he had recommended. In the case of the Naval U n it , the representative at the I m perial Conference in 1909 was a Liberal Minister, and the U n it agreed upon, in cluding the Australia, was ordered by Mr . Cook, the Minister of Defence. This That Bill , U n it superseded the obsolete, low-speed, River class destroyers, which were the policy of the' Labour party, as enunciated by Mr Fisher at Gympie in 1909. Whatever may have been the nature of the preliminary discussions and suggestions on the question of defence by land or sea, and whatever may be the ultimate achievement of our system, these facts from the history of the Defence schemes of Australia prove irrefragably that, whilst a substantial majority of the House has endorsed the policy laid down in the Deakin-Cook law of 1909, the authors of the two schemes-the military scheme, which is attracting world-wide attention and approval, and the existing Naval scheme, which satisfies Australian aspirations, and forms a substantial addition to the Imperial Naval defence strength-ca n rightly be claimed to be the Liberal party.",33
341,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Maribyrnong) [5.40]. - It is due that we should give to one honourable member of this House the merit of having a considerable and early hand in the formation of our defence system. I refer to the present Attorney-General, the honourable member for West Sydney. Very early in the history of this Parliament, when Sir John Forrest, the then Minister of Defence, introduced the first Defence Bill , the honourable member for West Sydney had some words to say upon the subject which indicated the trend of his mind at that time, and those of us who knew what he had been saying on public platforms in regard to Defence matters knew that he was heartily in favour of an Australian-owned and controlled Navy, and of what is known as our compulsory training system. I quote a from the first volume of the Commonterri- wealth Hansard, at page 744, 5th June, 1901, the following: DEFENCE BILL. Motion (by Sir JOHN FORREST) proposed - That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide for the defences of the Commonwealth.",34
342,Mr HUGHES,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS," Will the Minister make the order of leave of such an elastic character as to permit of the insertion of an amendment, if the House should think fit, to provide for any system of defence? I do not think it would be a good thing to be tied down to the honourable gentleman's idea of defence, though I do not know whether that idea be good or bad.",34
343,Mr BARTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,The order of leave could not be made wider than it is.,35
344,Mr HUGHES,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"The House should have an opportunity of discussing the question fairly without being compelled to vote against the Bill, and I want, if the occasion should arise, to insert an amendment providing for a system of defence which I believe to be reasonable.",35
345,Mr BARTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,I can assure the honourable member the order of leave could not be made wider than it is.,35
346,Mr HUGHES,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,I mention the matter because the order of leave would be held to restrict the terms of the Bill.,35
347,Mr SPEAKER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I may point out that the title of the Bill must agree with the wording of the resolution. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a first time. That was but a short discussion, but the system which the honourable member for West Sydney had in mind at the time, as indicated by . him on public platforms, was a system of compulsory training and an Australian-owned and controlled Navy. He had given expression to these views sometimes in the face of much opposition, and, at that time, at considerable risk to his political reputation. If I had gone to the same trouble as that taken by the honourable member for Wimmera, I could, no doubt, bring forward convincing proof as to who was the first to take a stand in regard to our present defence system. I am open to correction in regard to the quotation that I shall now read from page 2960 of Hansard of the first session of the Commonwealth Parliament. On the 24th July, 1901, Colonel Crouch, the then member for Corio, was speaking on the second reading of the Defence Bill , introduced by Sir John Forrest: but I shall not make from it the same deduction that was made from it by the honourable member for Wimmera. Colonel Crouch saidAlthough we cannot adopt the principle of conscription, because of labour and sentimental difficulties, in regard to able-bodied men, boy should be in a position, on reaching the age of eighteen, to join some militia or volunteer corps, and take a part, if necessary, in the defence of his country. This cadet system is one of the cheapest forms of military training that has yet been designed. At the present time the metropolitan corps of senior cadets, consisting of SOO youths, costs only Â£400 a year; and when we remember the extravagance that military organization usually involves, I Mr Fenton. think that that is a very creditable result. The cadet movement should be very largely extended and encouraged, and I would suggest to the Minister that the system should be made compulsory to the extent I have indicated. The words "" to the extent I have indicated "" qualify Colonel Crouch's claim that the system should be made compulsory.",35
348,Mr SAMPSON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,I merely quoted Colonel Crouch in order to show that he was the first man who gave expression to the principle of compulsory training.,35
349,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"At that time Colonel Crouch did not have in mind the compulsory training we now have, and I say so with considerable knowledge of that gentleman. On the 31st July, 1901, the honourable member for West Sydney, speaking to the same Bill , and dealing with naval matters, saidNow, since our chief danger to Australia must take the form of a bombardment, we have a right to demand that the first feature of our defence scheme should be to provide complete and satisfactory means for protecting us from that possible and even probable contingency. I want honourable members to realise that this question of a bombardment, or of an attack from a marauding expedition, or whatever you may please to term it, is by no means a chimerical idea, but it is the one thing which has made Federation possible in these States. As a matter of fact, does any man believe that Australia-sinc e she has elected to take the part, for good or for ill, of standing by the Motherland-wil l over be permitted to stand out as though she were an indifferent factor, entirely unconnected with the great British Empire?. I do not think so. For good or for evil, she has allied herself to the fortunes of Great Britain, and she must share alike in her glories and in her defeats. Whenever the time to which I refer comes, whether it be soon or late, we shall have to rely upon ourselves. There he indicates, in respect of the Navy, that we would have to rely upon ourselves. From the public journals of Victoria and New South Wales I could. quote speeches delivered by the honourable member for West Sydney, in which he laid before the public, and someevery times before meetings almost exclusively Labour, his ideas in respect to the defence of Australia- 1 Well, "" a volunteer,"" the maxim goes, "" is worth a dozen pressed men."" Yet the volunteer is very like snow in the summer. He melts away when the glamour and the novelty of the thing has worn off, when he realizes that after all there is in military tactics and preparation a good deal of hard work to be done. The volunteer, unless he be an enthusiast, such as these shores do not contain a large proportion of, melts away in such circumstances. Take the case of the men who volunteered for service in South Africa. They were largely composed of men who never belonged to any volunteer force at all. If any man can sit easily down under the volunteer forces of this country, and believe that, with all tlieir virtues and enthusiasm, they constitute a sufficient force to repel an invasion from a European or Asiatic source, he is easily content. Honourable members would do well to read that speech.",35
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"The honourable member himself will not read it all. He is merely selecting portions of it . Let him tell us what was the scheme of the honourable member for ""West Sydney. It is set out in that very speech.",36
351,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,I have not the time at my disposal.,36
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,Le t the honourable member tell us what was the scheme of the honourable member for West Sydney.,36
353,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that I have not made a particular selection from that speech with a view to suiting my own argument. I have not gone right through the speech. I will leave that task to the honourable member. I will be very glad if he can quote anything from the speech in question which will refute my argument. I say that one of the cardinal principles laid down by the honourable member for West Sydney in that utterance was the establishment of an Australian Navy.,36
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I am not talking about the Navy, but about the Army.",36
355,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,I can hardly conceive of a logical man like the Attorney General adducing mutually destructive arguments in the course of the same speech.,36
356,Mr SAMPSON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Tell us what he said in his speech in March, 1909-afte r nine years of thought.",36
357,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"The honourable member for Wimmera, and most other honourable members on the Opposition side of the Chamber, got the verdict of the people on their defence policy when the elections took place in 1910. The Fusion policy was irrevocably turned down. Honourable members opposite, who belong to the procrastinating party, would never have been in a position to meet the present crisis [165] but for the three years' tenure of a Labour Government from 1910 to 1913.",36
358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,The moralit y of everything is to be decided by a vote?,36
359,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,The honourable member is a good judge of political morality.,36
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,The honourable member should let morality alone.,36
361,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,So also should the honourable member. He himself introduced it .,36
362,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,I decline to submit everything to the test of a vote. That is all. That is the difference between the honourable member and myself.,36
363,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,I have no desire to introduce into this debate anything of a personal character.,36
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Vox populi, vox Dei.",36
365,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,If the honourable member will go out and pronounce that dictum in connection with the referenda proposals I shall be very glad.,36
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"It is the honourable member's standard, and I do not agree with it .",36
367,The CHAIRMAN,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,Will the honourable member refrai n from interjecting?,36
368,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"The Leader of the Opposition is an adept in the art of sidetracking any speaker, who, like myself, is inexperienced in public life. In a very brief way I have attempted to put the real facts connected with our defence policy before honourable members, and to contrast them with the facts presented by the honourable member for Wimmera. I have given h im more facts than he can refute between the present time and the end of December next.",36
369,Mr SAMPSON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,The honourable member has not told us,36
370,The CHAIRMAN,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,Will the. honourable member for Wimmera cease interjecting?,36
371,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I will now leave defence matters, because I desire to say a few words in reference to the Postal Department.",36
372,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,Surely there is notliing wrong with that Department now. The honourable member's party is in office. What can be wrong with it?,36
373,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I would remind, honourable members that yesterday we passed an exceptionally pleasant day. The Leader of the Opposition was rusticating at Wangaratta, and as a result harmony prevailed. To-day his presence provides the disturbing factor in our deliberations. I believe that the Postmaster-General is sympathetic with many of the views expressed by honourable members in this Chamber. My own opinion is that we ought to'do more work in our postal workshops, instead of sending out of Australia for many of our requirements. I am in formed that there is in progress a "" wetblanketing "" process in connection with some schemes recently evolved for providing the equipment and material necessary in the carrying out of telephonic and postal work. I understand that the Department is waiting u n t i l the more commodious workshop at the corner of Spencer and Bourke streets. Melbourne, is in a position to turn out the articles that we need. In this connection I have received numerous complaints, not merely from workmen, but from contractors. The latter complain that some of the articles which we require are being imported fro m other countries. For instance, there are telephone boxes the manufacture of which is very simple. I am sure that the Postmaster-General will admit that Australia can turn out woodwork equal to that turned out in auy part of the world.",36
374,Mr SPENCE,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,It is all made in Australia.,37
375,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"The Postmaster-General will find that, while some officers are very desirous of manufacturing our own materials, others wish to throw cold water upon any such scheme.",37
376,Mr SPENCE,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,That is merely .supposition on the part of the honourable member.,37
377,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I wish to see all the activities of this Department confined to our own workshops. When that is done, we shall be able to manufacture articles for our own requirements cheaper than contractors can supply them.",37
378,Dr CARTY SALMON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,But we shall employ fewer men..,37
379,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"No . When once we have provided the machinery and plant, we shall be able to do work cheaper than contractors can do it . This has been well illustrated at the Newport Workshops, which are turning out a particular class of engine for Â£1,000 less than it can be manufactured by the Baldwin works in America.",37
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,The .member is an apostle of cheapness.,37
381,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"No . . I am commending the good qualities of our Australian workmen. I say that their superiors cannot be found in any part of the world. I would counsel the Postmaster-General not to defer action in this connection until the completion of the new building at the corner of Bourke and Spencer streets. The requisite plant might easily be transferred to that building when it is completed. I believe that private contractors are doing well out of the Postal and other Departments, just as they are doing well out of other Departments. The sooner we eliminate them from the manufacture of our reouirements, the sooner we shall be in a position to pay our employees better wages, and to oive them better conditions generally. I presume that this year's Estimates will make provision for giving effect to the award of the Arbitration Court in the case of the letter sorters. That award will come into operation on the 1st August. In the Postal Department I find that there are 17,322 permanent employees and 12,969 non-official or temporary employees, making a total of approximately 30,000. It will be seen, therefore, that the Postmaster-General is a very large employer of labour. Amongst that large body of employees there must be some who are in a position to give the Department the benefit of new ideas, and I hope that the honourable gentleman will lend a willing ear to any representations of this character. There must be men in the Department who are capable of making valuable suggestions.",37
382,Mr SPENCE,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Quite a number of them have already made suggestions, and have been rewarded for so doing.",37
383,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"That is as it should be. The leading firms of the world recognise the worth of employees who aid ' them by making valuable suggestions. I would like to see the same plan operative in connection with most of our Departments. As an old public servant, I know that it sometimes happens that when a junior places a brilliant idea before his superior officer, it is either turned down or some months later is suddenly evolved in quite another quarter, and the superior officer very often obtains credit for the invention or improvement. I hope that the Postmaster-General will honourable confer with the Minister of Home Affairs and the Minister of Defence, in connection with the matter to which I have referred, aud that, as a result, we shall have workshops established in which it will be possible for us to manufacture much of the material we require more cheaply than we are now getting it from contractors.",37
384,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Perth) [ 6 . 6 ] - I have never been much of a party man during my political career, and, at the present time, I cannot help congratulating myself that, throughout the British Empire, party considerations are receding very much into the back-ground. I have noticed with much satisfaction that my ideal of a Ministry has recently been carried into effect in London, namely, a Ministry of all the talents in the Parliament, irrespective of the political party to which they belong. I welcome that innovation as an indication of what can be done under the stress of urgent necessity, and a step which will probably lead in the near future to what I regard as a very great reform in parliamentary government. I regret that members of the present Government, and those who are behind them, cry out to the Opposition to cease party warfare, especially when we happen to be offering some useful and necessary criticism, and yet, when they get outside this chamber, they are ready to claim for their party, and in relation to the war, a credit to which they have no right whatever, unless they are prepared to give equal credit to their political opponents. I refer to the claim made time and again that it is to the Labour party, and to that party alone, that our present defence system should be credited.",38
385,Mr HANNAN,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Hear , hear !",38
386,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I say that that statement is absolutely without foundation, and I speak as one who knows, perhaps, more about this matter than does any other member of the Committee. ",38
387,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"In this way, that I have a fairly good knowledge of the position of both parties in this connection. I wish to endorse what has been said here this afternoon with regard to the magnificent work done by the honourable member for West Sydney, the present Attorney General. There is no doubt whatever that the honourable gentleman has done great work in educating the members of his parliamentary party, and also the supporters of that party outside. There has been, and still is, a section of the Labour party very strongly antagonistic to any [165]- 2 kind of war preparation whatever. The honourable member for Maranoa will agree with me when I say that, at one time, the members of the Labour party holding the views which the honourable member for West Sydney has so ably and forcibly expressed inside and outside of this House, were not particularly numerous. ",38
388,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"They had a very hard row to hoe for years, but in view of the developments taking place in the world the conviction gradually grew in the Labour party that Australia should do something definite, and do it soon, in order to prepare for the evil day that was coming on the Empire. There was an essential difference between the attitude taken ug by the Labour party as a whole, or at least by a large majority of its members, and that taken up by the members of the opposite political party. The ideal of a majority of the Labour party was preparation solely for local defence in connection with both our Naval and M i l i tary Forces. Our Naval Force, according to their idea, was to be a purely local fighting unit.",38
389,Sir JOHN FOBREST,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,They would not permit our vessels to leave Australian waters.,38
390,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"That was undoubtedly their position. There were members of the Labour party who did not take that view, but they were in a hopeless minority. The attitude of the party, as a whole, was that we had really nothing to do with the affairs of the Empire, and were concerned only with our local defences. Again the present Attorney-General came to the rescue with his magnificent enthusiasm, - and made the supporters of Labour outside Parliament realise that we are vitally associated with the interests of the Empire in all respects, for good or for evil; that the cause of the Motherland is our cause, and that we have to stand or f all with the people of the Old Country. Again I deprecate the claim that the Labour party should be credited with the defence system of Australia.  nated it , so long as we have it?",38
391,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I agree with the honourable member. It is most deplorable that these claims should be made. It is not more than three weeks since I read in the newspapers that a member of another place, on a public platform, declared that we should have had no naval or military system in Australia if it had not been for the Labour party.  is bosh.",38
392,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"We do know that it is bosh, but the trouble is that if a statement of that kind is repeated loudly enough and often enough, the bulk of the people come to believe it . That preposterous claim has actually been recognised in the Old Country. Again, I say that these questions should be altogether above party considerations. I feel sure that where the welfare of Australia or of the Empire as a whole is concerned, there are sufficient men in both political parties to take the true, broad, national, and patriotic view that will iusure the establishment of a condition of affairs which will make for the security of Australia and of the Empire at the same time. I was interrupted earlier in the day when making a reference to the necessity for vigorous action by the Defence Department. I want to repeat my statement that the present Minister of Defence is a very estimable man in all respects, but that he does lack the initiative we have a right to look for from the head of his Department at the present time. This has been proved in no way more conclusively than by his action in regard to the Small Arms Factory. Our whole difficulty in connection with the Expeditionary Forces begins and ends there. It is because of the insufficient output of the Small Arms Factory that we have not been able to take all the recruits that have offered. It is because of it that we have not been able to arm our men in sufficient time. We are now told, after several months have elapsed, that steps are to.be taken to institute a double shift at the Factory. We had two reports from Parliamentary Com. mittses, but, not content with them, the Minister of Defence called for a third report, and he has since received that report. In my opinion, that third report should not have been called for at all. It was practically an insult to Parliament that the Minister should have waited for that third report in view of the opinions expressed by both the Parliamentary Committees that investigated this matter. They said in no hesitating words that the introduction of a second shift at the Factory was both desirable and practicable. I say that if a Liberal Minister had permitted matters to slide for so long as Senator Pearce has done, the Liberals in this country would not for a long time have heard the last of it. We should have had the neglect and delay discussed morning, noon, and night, as not so long ago a mistake made by a Liberal Minister was dinned into our ears in .similar fashion. I have already said in this Chamber today, and now repeat the statement, that Senator Pearce is almost the last man of the party opposite who should occupy the position of Minister of Defence at the present time. I can imagine the honourable member for Maranoa in the chair of the Minister of Defence, asking why a second shift was not going at the Small Arms Factory, and being told that it was not practicable at the present time. Would the honourable member have given the same instructions as Senator Pearce gave, "" If it is not practicable at present, do it as soon as you can?"" I can imagine the honourable member for Maranoa saying, "" I will give you a month, and if it is not going then you will have to get out."" That is what Senator Pearce should have said at least six months ago. If a Liberal Minister had made the mistake that has been made with regard to the cruiser Brisbane, I wonder whether we would have heard so little about it as we have heard. Just imagine a ship of that kind being constructed high and dry at a place where no preparation was made to launch her. Imagine, too, the time that has been lost in the building of the vessel, the unnecessary additional expense that has been incurred, and, above all, the deplorable fact that if she had been built as the Liberal Government proposed, she would be afloat and fighting the battles of Australia and the Empire today.",39
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,And enough money saved to build another boat.,39
394,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"And this sacrosanct and omniscient Minister, whom no one should criticise at all, has allowed the matter to drift on in the way it has been doing up to the present time. Let me remind honourable members of what happened under the Labour regime in the Defence Department with regard to the rifle clubs. Honourable members opposite know, as we all do, that the present Minister of Defence permitted the rifle clubs to be almost starved out of existence, deliberately and intentionally, by the permanent officers responsible for the management of defence affairs. Tbey did not want to be bothered with rifle clubs. They wanted all the f r ill s and furbelows for military style and swagger, and, as the rifle clubs did not fit in with that sort of thing, they had to go to the wall. present Minister of Defence has got off very lightly in connection with this matter.",39
395,Mr JENSEN,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,We are spending thousands of pounds on rifle butts now.,40
396,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"The Minister of Defence now realizes the mistake he made i u allowing his officers to influence him in that direction. My complaint is that Senator Pearce has left himself almost unreservedly in the hands of his subordinate officers. Unfortunately, he had to do it , because, until he took the position of Minister of Defence, he was a man who by natural bent and inclination kept as far away from military matters, soldiers, rifles, and bayonets, as he could possibly get. That was his disposition, and he found himself in charge of a Department to which he had previously given very little attentiou. He had to leave himself in the hands of his permanent officers, who, of course, exercised the influence they had under those conditions, as they thought, for the benefit of the country, but sometimes to their own advantage as well. Consequently, the present Minister of Defence has had his reputation created for him by those same gentlemen who will , one and all, tell you that he is the best Minister they eyer had. If you ask them why, they will tell you, "" He has done just as we wanted him to do, including the multiplication of well-paid positions and the increase of salaries where any kind of excuse was offered for it . , """,40
397,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"They used to "" We will get no money t ill Pearce comes back.""",40
398,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"On e great regret that 1I have always had in regard to our Defence Forces concerns the manufacture of our own rifles. At thÂ© time it was first mooted I did my level best to get the Defence people to consider the question of adopting the Ross rifle. It is a notorious fact that the rifle we are manufacturing today, in common with the rifle manufactured by the British Government, is the worse-shooting military rifle in Europe. I can bring competent authorities to prove that the rifle that we and the British Army are using is absolutely the worse-shooting rifle in Europe.",40
399,Mr JENSEN,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,On whose authority?  mans with them.,40
400,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"There is no doubt they are doing very well with them, but if they had had better rifles we should The have had even better shooting results. I would remind the honourable member for Maranoa that in international matches in which Canadian teams have competed the Bisley authorities have found it necessary to handicap the Ross rifles. It is a better rifle in all respects than ours, and I feel sure that, in stead of the trouble we have had i u equipping the Small Arms Factory and getting it to work, with its excessive initial cost, if we had made a business-likÂ© arrange^ ment with the Ross Company of Canada we could have had the best military rifle in the world, as the Ross rifle undoubtedly is, at half the cost of the present one, so far at any rate as regards equipping and getting the Factory to work.",40
401,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,Has there not been some trouble about the Ross rifle quite recently ?,40
402,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"No . A contract has been given only recently by the Imperial authorities to the Ross Rifle Company of Canada for 170,000 rifles. It may be that some of these have not been quite up to the mark on account of the haste with which they have been turned out. But I have gone into the matter very thoroughly, and I know that thÂ© Ross rifle, up to quitÂ© lately, was recognised as the best military rifle in existence.",40
403,Mr FENTON,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"They have recently had to recall soine of them, in order to refix some of-the sights/",40
404,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I do not think the-ve say, is anything of consequence in that inatter, any more than there has been in regard to our own rifle. There is not the slightest doubt that the Australian rifle, within the limitations-of the pattern, is as well made as possible, and any minor defect is of no material consequence. But my trouble in regard to the Defence Department is that it persists in proceeding on the old-fashioned jog-trot lines. Sir I a n Hamilton, in his valuable report, pointed out time and again that the organization of the Department would probably go to pieces in a few weeks if it were actually face to face with war, and I believe it has done so. He also said that it badly needed a business head to deal with business matters in a business-like way, and we have not got that yet either. There is no doubt that at a time like the present a little more energy and common sense than we have seen up to the present needs to be shown by some individual in a responsible position in the Department; and we cannot but hold the political head of the Department responsible. That.is what constitutional government means. I do not regard the present Minister of Defence as by any means sacrosanct, and if I do not see more activity and common sense at work in the Department than has so far been in evidence, the Minister will hear from me not infrequently in the future.",40
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,Do you mean Archibald's brand of common sense?,41
406,Mr FOWLER,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I have not had much occasion to complain of the Minister of Home Affairs, who, I have no doubt, welcomes criticism-unlik e the present occupant of the chair in the Defence Department, who is very impatient under criticism of any kind. No one should resent criticism offered, as it is offered, in my case, in all good faith, and with no peraonal meaning or application, and I hope that, following those lines, we shall long be able to stir up any inactive Minister or Government, whichever side they may represent.",41
407,Unknown,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 745 p.m.  not have had anything to say on this Bill but for the remarks made by the honourable member for Wimmera.,41
408,Mr MANIFOLD,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Are you going to quote the cruiser Brisbane?  them over the cruiser Brisbane if I had my way. The honourable member for Wimmera went to a good deal of trouble bo let the Committee and the country know who originated the defence system, both naval and military, in Australia. It appeared to me that he searched Hansard ever since the inception of Federation to find out who did anything in connection with our defence scheme. He quoted just - as much as suited his book, and I suppose he thought he was going to sneak it into Hansard without any reply whatever. But, having been a member of this House from the beginning of Federation, and having taken a very lively interest in defence matters myself, I know a little about the subject; and it is only right that I should give the Committee the benefit of the knowledge I possess. I am pleased to know that I had something to do in the framing of the first Defence Bill in this House; but I want to say that, at that particular time, the man who was most consistent and persistent over the whole business of soldiering and compulsory drill for the juniors of Australia was the Honourable William Morris Hughes, member for West Sydney, and our present Attorney-General. At that time, too, it was a most unpopular thing for a Labour member to advocate soldiering; and I might tell the honourable member for Wimmera that, after the experience we had in the 1891 strike, with what we called the ""scab"" protectors, or the Military Forces of Queensland, I came into this House with the fixed determination to singe the wings and cut the spurs of the ""gold-spurred roosters'-' as the honourable member for Darwin would call them. But, after I listened to the several debates, I came to the conclusion that the time had arrived when something should be done to protect this young nation from the peril which we then thought confronted it - I refer to the Japanese. That was the consideration which induced me, and several other members of the Labour party, to advocate compulsory training, and I was very pleased indeed to hear the honourable member for Perth give a small meed of praise to the Attorney-General for his consistency at that time in regard to the compulsory training system. But, after all, what does it matter to us today who was the father of, or who was the sponsor for, our system of continuous military training and the establishment of. the Naval Unit? What does it matter to Australia, so long as we have it? I give the Opposition credit for being just as anxious as we were to introduce compulsory training, only I want to make it clear that if the Labour party had not been in favour of it, we would not have had it in Australia today. I take that much credit for our party. Had we opposed it as a party, the system, would not have been in force today, and the honourable member for Wimmera would have had some other tale to chronicle. Let us get down to. the facte. We know very well that the then honourable member for Richmond, Sir Thomas Ewing. introduced compulsory training in this House; and we all know the fate of that Bill. Sir Thomas Ewing, who was then Minister of Defence, was enthusiastically in favour of the system. I am not saying this in a carping spirit, but I think that was about the only time in my l if e that I saw Sir Thomas Ewing serious about anything.",41
409,Mr TTJDOK,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"He was pretty serious one day in, his criticism of the Opposition.  when he was taking the seven skins off the present Leader of the Opposition. Thomas Ewing was Minister of Defence in the Deakin M in is try - I mean the old Liberal Ministry, not the Fusion moband he moved the second reading of the Defence Bill on the 29th September, 1908. On that occasion, he saidThe main principle remained the same as in the scheme outlined by the Prime Minister in December, 1907, in almost every detail. . It provided for compulsory military training. Now, the honourable member for Wimmera this afternoon sought to lead honourable members of this House and the country to believe that the Liberals, as he called them, were then whole-heartedly in favour of compulsory training ; but Mr , now Sir George, Reid, then member for East Sydney, as Leader of the Opposition, saidBut all I want to say is that within the next ten years no such training, beyond the training of our Militia, and Volunteer Forces, is necessary. I am speaking of the land forces. I look to the training'of the British Ifavy as good enough for us for many years ahead. . . . Our present forces, developed, expanded, and properly equipped, are good enough for the next ten years; believing that, I am not going to drag all the young men who may be eighteen years next year in Australia out of the industries into cajnps. That would be a criminal, cruel wrong to them. . . . In my opinion, the only justification - for compulsion in the matter of service is a national emergency within a reasonable prospect of time. . . . Do not let us forget that Great Britain, the Dominion of Canada, - South Africa, and every other British Dominion have been able from time immemorial to solve their difficulties in even darker hours than these without resort to this foreign method of compulsory training. . . . I sum up my attitude upon this subject by. stating that I regard these projects as wild and impracticable, as being not founded on necessity, - or even in prudence, but arising either from hysteria, fear, or from a craze for militarism that is foreign to the history and the spirit of the British race. That' was a statement of Sir GeorgeReid's views, and well we remember the day he spoke, for we cheered him to the echo.",42
410,Mr KELLY,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Senato r Pearce said some""thing very much the same in 1910. What is the use of it all?  can tell the country what Senator Pearce said. I am telling him what his leader said on that occasion.",42
411,Mr KELLY,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"But what is the use of it all ?  for Wimmera has been trying to fix things on to this party, and, as I said before, it Sir is not my wish to have any quarrel as to who started the movement. We are in it now, and I believe every honourable member on both sides of the House is eager to do the best he can for Australia, and to do it as quickly as possible. But the honourable member for Wimmera went out of his way to launch a tirade against the Labour party, simply because one or - two members of the party talked bosh on the platform. But what does it matter who inaugurated the scheme? All honourable members of this House glory in the results of our compulsory training as' disclosed in the recent operations at the Dardanelles, and in the achievements of the Naval U n it , and surely the time has come when we should cease to use these arguments as to who was responsible for the defence scheme for political purposes. Members should cease trying to get these into Hansard to be used against one another at the earliest possible opportunity. Y e t that is what the honourable member for Wimmera has done. His whole object was to use the facts, as he presented them, against us for party purposes, and "" paste"" us over the referenda.",42
412,Mr MCGRATH,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,It might be put in the Warracknabeal paper. That is what it is for.  a paper like that up my way. At the time of which I speak the present At torney-General supported the Bill .,42

But, after all , it was only a question of time, for this, like all other great movements, had to spring from a mustard seed. What I dislike about the whole business is that the honourable member for Wimmera should try to belittle our Attorney-General over this subject, because, if there is one man deserving of credit for consistency in connection with compulsory training ever since the inception of Federation, it is the present Attorney-General.",42
414,Mr TUDOR,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,That is the method of non-party warfare adopted by the honQueensland. orable member for Wimmera.,43

I give the Liberals credit for introducing the Bill ; but no one knows better than the honourable member for Angas that, i Australian politics, there was no greater ""whale"" than Mr Alfred Deakin senting memoranda to the House; that is how far they went. Mr Deakin would come down every day for a week with memoranda as to what should be done, but with the good old Liberal rally, "" The time is not yet r i p e .

418,Mr GLYNN,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"He spoke on the subject in England, I remember.  torney-General spoke on the subject at every opportunity, and no one knows ing. better than the honourable member for Angas how unpopular the movement was witl i supporters, of the Labour party outside. Most of the Labour party's supporters outside of Parliament absomething, horred the sight of a military uniform , just as I did particularly after the action taken in the 1891 strike in If there was anything I detested more than a rat on earth at that particular time it was a soldier in uniform . Having experienced what we the did in 1891, no one can blame us for having that feeling. Yet, despite that, amend the honourable member for West Sydney was persistent, and in the Labour ranks the de- - I do not say in the whole of the of country-hi s persistency was'the means of the bringing compulsory training to what it in a posiis today. Here is what the honourable the member for Echuca said at that timeA scheme which, in the first place, is unnecessary, and in the second is likely to be n ineffective and inequitable in its operation. You, sir, know the sway the honourable for premember wields in the House, and the and attention with which his ideas and opinions are listened to, and that is what that giant of a statesman had t.o say then about compulsory training. Again, here is what the right honourable member for Why should we, ih this offhand and hurried be called upon to subscribe to the principle of compulsory service or training as put and forward by the Prime Minister? The right honourable gentleman, I might Sir explain, was sitting in opposition to the Mr Alfred Who has asked for its application to Australia? . . . Let us stand firm and selffollowing the well-known paths of ex' the Then we find some remarks by the honourable member for Lang, another b i g I do not see any need to go to the extent by this - Bill, and, as I think the amendment expresses the true position, I shall support it. I ' am sure that in time of need Australians will be found ready and willing enough to offer voluntary service in defence The Bill was not proceeded with ; the Budget was introduced, and the Government was defeated on the 10th November, 1908. That was the end of the first Det - fence Bill introduced by Sir Thomas Ewing, providing for compulsory trainThe next stage was the introduction of a Bill by that famous Coalition known as the Deakin-Cook Fusion, and God knows they were hurrying to destruction. They thought that they should dp and do something quickly, and so they brought in a Defence Bill, also providing for compulsory training. The honourable member for Parramatta, who was Minister of Defence at the time, saidWe propose also to recruit the fighting line to war strength from the reserves of the young manhood of Australia-that is to say, we propose to train young men compulsorily up to twenty years of age, and from those we hope to get enough to make the Militia the first fighting force, equipped at war strength, ready to meet any emergency that may arise. The honourable member for Gippsland, who was sitting in opposition, said, ""Another Liberal plank given away."" Continuing, the honourable member for Parramatta saidWe begin, then, with the cadets at twelve years of age, training them chiefly by physical exercise. After they attain the age of fourteen years they will enter upon more advanced military training, and from the to eighteen a number amounting in the aggregate to 75,000 will be organized uniformly. Then he apologized for going beyond that, and saidWe propose to brigade him in the higher formations, and take him into the field and camp 'and compel him to train for another two years. Mr Hall, the present Attorney-General of New South Wales, interjected, ""The honourable member alludes to those between eighteen and twenty years of age,"" and the honourable member for Parramatta saidThat number includes the cadets, and represents all that we can hope to grapple with for the purposes of compulsory training at the present time. He told us next that the Government had invited Lord Kitchener to come to Australia. The Bill introduced by Sir Thomas Ewing for the Deakin Government provided that f*r the first three years the trainees must put in every year eighteen working days. The honourable member for Parramatta, when he was Minister of Defence, proposed to have only one muster parade per year. Mr. Hutchison, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, moved this amendment That the words "" on registration of one mus- to. ter parade"" be left out, with a view to insert "" seven whole days in camp of continuous training."" The - amendment was lost by thirty-two votes to seventeen, Sir Thomas Ewing and the old Liberals in the Fusion voting against it. The honourable member for Wimmera has a lot to take credit for, indeed. With regard to the Naval Unit, it is not five years since a battle raged here over the Naval Loan Bill introduced by the right honourable member for Swan, as Treasurer for the Deakin-Cook Fusion party, to raise a loan of Â£3,500,000. For what purpose? Not to start an Australian Navy, but to present a Dreadnought to the Old Country. We all know how that memorable division was taken. After a good deal of fighting in the House, we got an amendment made to the effect that the loan was not to be proceeded with until after the elections.",43
419,Mr GLYNN,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"That was a loan to provide a Fleet, not to present a Dreadnought to the Old Country. The question at issue was whether the Fleet should be provided out of loan money or age of fourteen out of revenue.  is right, and I am right. You, sir, recollect very well what took place when the Fusion, party wanted to present the Old Country with a Dreadnought, and continue the subsidy. Mi\ GLYNN - It was not the DeakinCook Government. They, .never decided on giving a Dreadnought. ",44
420,Mr GLYNN,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"It was individual members who talked on the platform about it.  for Swan talked about giving an increased subsidy to the Old Country, and presenting it with a Dreadnought. You, sir, remember as well as I do that we went to the country with that proposal fresh in our minds, and you recollect, too, the fiasco that occurred. You know well what took place in Sydney. There were bands playing in the streets, .with much flag-wagging, and a great dinner was given in the Town Hall. Patriotic speeches were made. Men went round with a subscription list, and said that they would show the Old Country and the Imperial Government what the sentiments of the Labour party in Australia amounted They declared that they would present the Old Country with a Dreadnought raised by public subscriptions. They had a great bean-feast that night in the Town Hall, and while the champagne was flowing a pad was taken round the room for the banqueters to put down the amount which they would subscribe. Some of them put their names down for several thousand pounds; one of them went so far as to put his name down for many thousands of pounds, and when the list was totted up it was found that about Â£2,500,000 had been promised. On the following morning, when the mayor and his secretary went round the city to collect the money to present it to the Old Country, many of the banqueters were found with a bandage round their heads, or sitting in their office with elbows on the table and chin in their hands: while some of them did not even recollect putting their names on the pad, and when the entries were shown to them, they did not recognise their signatures. You, sir, remember the trouble which was experienced in collecting the money. It was announced in the press in Melbourne by the Fusionists that they were going to show the loyalty of the citizens of Sydney and the loyalty of the people of New South Wales by subscribing the money for a Dreadnought. It is a matter of history now how much money they raised. I think Â£46,000 was collected from this great wealth-producing centre-the Chicago of Australia. Their loyalty was worth Â£46,000!",44
421,Mr BURNS,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"What did they do with the money?  .member directly. On the night the banqueters had the "" shicker "" in them, and did not know what they were doing with the pad, they subscribed Â£2,500,000; but when the mayor went to collect the actual cash, after several weeks or months, the great patriots who had done the flag-wagging and set the bands playing, had to part up to the tune of Â£46,000. They offered that sum to the Old Country to purchase a Dreadnought, and the Imperial Government said, "" No, thanks; we are not that hard up. We do not want your money. You had better do something with it in Australia."" The Fusionists put the money in a bank at fixed deposit, and found that nobody would have anything to do with it. They were like the kid in the advertisement for Pears' soap. They were not happy till they got it, and when they got it they did not know what they were going to do with it . After all the "" flapdoodle "" and flag-wagging, the Fusionists had Â£46,000, and they wanted to present the Minister of Defence with the money to furnish the Naval College on condition that it was to be built within so many miles of Sydney. The Minister could not accept the offer conditionally, and the consequence was that the money was handed over unconditionally to the Federal Government to buy furniture with which to furnish the Naval College now being built at Jervis Bay. It is of no use for honourable members on the Opposition side to think that the public have such a short memory that they do not remember these tilings. I , for one, have never claimed, either on the platform or in this House, that the Labour party did anything more than its just share, and it should only get its just Teward, in connection with the starting of compulsory military training and the establishment of the Naval Unit of Australia. We know very well what the honourable member for Parramatta said, or was reported to have said, in Adelaide about the "" R i v e r "" boats. He wanted to know what rivers there were in Australia for the "" River "" boats to go up.",45
422,Mr GROOM,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,That has been explained over and over again.  If the honourable member does not believe it,45

The speech was an extraordinary mixture of half-facts and whole nonsense; but I must congratulate the honourable member on his imagination in referring to a banquet which he should have known did not take place, because, had it been held, he would have contrived to be at it .  tended it .",46
431,Mr KELLY,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I have not attended a banquet such as the honourable member referred to. He seems not to think that any one could do a generous thing unless as the result of a good dinner. As a matter of strict fact, a considerable sum was raised in Sydney, and has been used by the Department of Home Affairs in the construction of the Naval College at Jervis Bay. Although the honourable member threw gibes' at the donors, other honourable members are thankful for their generosity.  the acceptance of the money.",46
432,Mr KELLY,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"The honourable member would not have done so had it been offered to himself. The inventivegenius of the honourable member is considerable, but it is playing it low down to cast ridicule upon the generosity of others; and I do not think that the Committee wishes to hear anything more about the matter. I do not propose to quarrel about how the dreadnought Australia came into being; about how our Citizen Forces came to be created; or about the party, or set of persons, to whom credit is due for what has been done in the past for the defence of this country. Our business now is to do the best we can at the present time, and to put past squabbles behind us. It is not as if we were facing an election, and had to be constantly taking liberties with the truth ; we are confronted by a serious national crisis; and, unless we concentrate our attention upon the problem of making our offensive abroad efficient, we shall be false to the trust which the people have reposed in us. I regret the absence of the Assistant Minister of Defence, because there are one or two matters to which I wish to direct his attent i o n ; but I have no doubt that he will read the Hansard report of my speech. I cannot help thinking that there is something wrong with the Central A d ministration of the Defence Department, though whether the faul t is in its organization or in the allocation of duties I am not in a position to say. I strongly sug-. gest that Ministers should look into this matter, and wipe away the corroding dust which is clogging wheels that should revolve silently and expeditiously. I will take a few matters which have come within my own notice. It should not be impossible for the Department to pay witH reasonable expedition; yet the overtime payments of the ordnance storemen in Sydney are about ten months overdue. These men have waited for their money month after month, and a week or so ago they had not been paid overtime since last September ;. and, so far as I know, have not yet received it . My last question to the Minister on the subject drew forth the reply that one must expect delays during a time of considerable stress. But these are delays which should not occur after the initial stress. The Department ought to have expanded, and if it has not yet expanded, ought immediately to expand sufficiently to enable all questions of payment to be settled with expedition, and facility. Let me give another instanceof departmental demoralization: I hold in my hand papers relating to a matter which, was plaoed in my charge in Sydney last week by the representative of two ladies who had given money to provide a motor ambulance for the F i r s t Australian L i g h t Horse Brigade, and had reoently received a cablegram from the officer in charge at the front, sayingMotor ambulance not arrived. No advice. Urgently needed. Make inquiries. They made inquiries in Sydney, and found that their draft, which was dated 8th February last, was forwarded by the New South Wales Commandant to the Minister at Melbourne on the 8th or 9th of that month. But, according to a letter which I have received from the Secretary to the Defence Department, it was not u n t i l the 30th March-seve n weeks after the money had been received in Melbournethat a cablegram was sent to the High Commissioner in London advising him that this donation, with others, had been received, and asking him to make the necessary arrangements for the purchase of the ambulance, and to inform the Department here what action had been taken in the matter. The letter added that this advice, which it was expected would come by mail, had not yet been received. A donation is given to provide a vehicle which is urgently needed for the use of our wounded soldiers, and yet the money is kept unused in Melbourne for seven weeks. Something must be radically wrong for that to have been possible. bringing forward these matters to give offence to honourable members opposite.",46
433,Mr WEST,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,It looks as if the honourable member was trying to make political capital out of them.,47
434,Mr KELLY,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"I am not actuated by the paltry motive suggested by the honourable member; my concern is to get matters of urgency dealt with speedily. Why should our wounded men have to: suffer needless misery because of the inaction of some one in Melbourne, or for the want of some one here to take action ? A few days ago another instance of the same sort of slackness was brought under my notice, but in this case there was some excuse for the Department. Some time ago a friend came to see me on behalf of a contractor in Sydney who was the lowest tenderer for a Defence contract for the manufacture in Australia of signalling lamps. Certain parts of the signalling lamps could not be obtained in Australia. I went to the Department, and suggested to the officer in charge of contracts that, in the circumstances, the best thing to do would be fco cable at the contractor's cost to the High Commissioner to obtain quotations, and arrange for the immediate shipping of the goods, and then the contract could proceed with facility. The officer in charge of that sub-department recognised the suggestion as a sane one, and I thought there would be no further trouble. To my astonishment, however, about a week ago my friend, together with the contractor, who had been obliged to come across from Sydney, interviewed me and asked me to see the Department about the matter. There I found that the cable, which ought to have gone to the H i gh Commissioner the day after my previous visit, because the matter was allegedly one of urgency, had been delayed for some reason for three weeks, and was then sent, not as an urgent cable at the cost of the contractor, but as a week-end letter at the cost of the Department. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Red-tape .",47
435,Mr KELLY,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"It was an instance of most absurd red-tapism, but in this case there was the excuse, which did not exist in regard to the more serious instance I previously mentioned, that the Defence Department has never had a rough-andready method of solving a difficulty of this kind. The Department had never preI am not viously had to inquire at the contractor's cost for some essential of his contract. Apparently, the practice would be to call for tenders afresh, or to start negotiations with one of the unsuccessful tenderers. I had suggested a rough-and-ready method hitherto unknown in the Department of overcoming the difficulty and of bringing the lamps into existence a couple of months earlier than they will now be available. Stories of the wildest character are in circulation as to happenings in the Department, and I have no wish to foist any of those stories on the Committee, but I shall mention one incident which has been related to me, of the truth of which I know nothing. I heard in Sydney, about ten days ago, that a telegram had some time previously been received from Melbourne asking for twenty-eight bakers for a field bakery. The men were needed urgently, the wire said. The twenty-eight bakers were engaged the next day, and the Sydney office, for the following two or three weeks, was telegraphing to Melbourne without result to ascertain what to do with them ! I have another instance in mind. A number of guards were appointed to accompany convalescents from Alexandria to Malta, and Base Becords at Cairo notified Australia that the men had embarked at Alexandria, and had been struck off the strength. the pay of the dependants in Australia was also struck off. One lady who intertime viewed me in Sydney was in the greatest difficulty owing to the pay of her son being denied her, as though he had been dismissed, although she was able to produce letters from her son at Malta brain of every honourable member. which showed that he was still in the monwealth service. I went to the pay officer in Sydney, and he produced his automatically without a hitch. file. He said, "" Yes, I have been Melbourne for authority to regard this ing man and others similarly situated as not having been struck off the strength."" The officer desired to pay, but the file showed that he could not get an answer from Melbourne.",47
436,Mr KING OMALLEY,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,No doubt Department sent the answer by bullock waggon.,48
437,Mr KELLY,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"If there is one portion of the Defence Department that ought to be efficiently conducted, it is the tral Office in Melbourne.

I lieve ' that a great number of"" the disapthroughout Australia. pointments in the Department are due to the fact that the Central Administration is utterly clogged. I heard of instance in relation to Colonel Byrie's Ligh t Horse Brigade. Heel pegs were quired so that the horses could be approximately near the men, but will honourable members believe that it was necessary to requisition Melbourne for those heel pegs? An y one of us would have taken an axe and gone out into bush and cut the pegs; but it was sary in this case to requisition Melbourne, and I understand that the pegs were received until a week or two before the Brigade embarked for the front. there is some laxity in the administraof tion is obvious, and I am mentioning these matters in the hope that the Ministry take the matter in hand. If there is much work for one man, let it be divided amongst others. I do not suggest honourable members opposite ought to divide up the .r salaries with any honor: able member on this side of the House. There are plenty of private members on the Government side, and if there is too much work on one Minister's shoulders, Promptly let the work be distributed so that it can be. done expeditiously.

I shall not touch upon the obvious failure of the Department in connection with the camps of training; that is knowledge within the I Comdirect attention solely to those branches of the Department which ought to work The asking authorization of pay and the sendon of accounts are things in themselves of the utmost simplicity, and the failure to properly attend to them is proof of serious demoralization in the Department.

The right honourable member for Parramatta, during the Defence debates in this Parliament in 1903, saidhe objected to the proposals for a Citizen Army compulsorily trained. The old volunteer system was sufficient, and compulsory training contrary to the genius of our race. Then there was the attitude of the present Leader of the Opposition on the subject of the Australian Navy so recently as 1909. At a meeting held in the Sydney Town H all in that year, he saidT nail my flag once and for all to an increased subsidy to Great Britain.

The Liberal party came into office in 1913, had charge of the reins of government I am going to quote what the Conservative press of Australia had to say about their administration of Defence matters durinvestigation ingthat time, for it was upon this that the people of Australia turned them out of office, if it was upon anything. The Sydney Morning Herald, which is well known as an anti-Labour paper, on saidthe 12th August, 1914, said this about Senator Pearce's administration for 1910this * 1913Senator Pearce, as Minister of Defence, left the Defence Department after the 1913 tions a wonderfully compact and orderly of machinery.

457,Mr FLEMING,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,They are not facts; they are statements.,50
458,Mr JH CATTS,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"They are statements from witnesses belonging to the honourable member's own side. The Age newspaper, on the 18th June, 1914, discussing the Cook-Millen administration of the Navy Office, saidPrime Minister seeks excuses for Senator Millen's naval disaster. Melbourne Punch, which supports honourable friends o opposite, and has ways opposed the Labour party, said, on the 18th June, 1914Waste and inefficiency characterized Senator Millen's administration of naval defence. The Age, on the 18th June, 1914, said^Senator Millen sacked Captain Hughes Onslow and i l r . Manisty (Admiralty officers) before their work in Australia was completed. Asked Admiralty to appoint successors. Admiralty refused. British Admiralty resents Senator Millen's conduct. The British Admiralt y resented Senator Millen's conduct of the Defence Department and the manner in which he had treated British officers sent out here. It was so incensed that it refused to nominate officers to act in the place of the men whom Senator Millen , presuming to know more about the conduct of these matters than the British Admiralty, had sacked, although they had been sent to Australia far a special purpose. A special committee was appointed by my honourable friends opposite to make an as to their own administration in regard to the Easter Encampment of 1914, and in its report, which was printed on 6th Jime, 19.14, and is one of the official records of this House, it So far as the 14tli Infantry are concerned, camp was a waste of time and money. It is well known that the greatest elecsecrecy was necessary to prevent the piece enemy from obtaining information regarding our wireless stations round the coast of Australia, but the honourable member for Flinders, Sir Willia m Irvine, held a retainer from the Marconi Company, and that company obtained from the High Court an order to inspect the whole of our wireless internal arrangement.",50

460,Mr JH CATTS,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,It is a statement of fact.,50
461,Mr MASSYGREENE,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,But it is not a fair statement.,50
462,Mr JH CATTS,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"It is. The honori n able member knows very well that a motion of censure on the Cook Administration was moved in this House because the Attorney-General, Sir Will i a m I r vine, at the time . that the Marconi my Company was fighting the Commonalwealth, and thousands of pounds were in volved in that litigation, refused to give up his retainer from the company, or his position as the legal adviser of the Gommonwealth.",50
463,Mr GROOM,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,A very complete answer was given to that motion.,50
464,Mr JH CATTS,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"My honourable friend may have regarded it as satisfactory; but the fact remains that the Marconi Company had retained the services of Sir Will i a m Irvine, who was then Attorney-General to the Commonwealth, and that it obtained an order from the High Court to inspect our wireless stations; that it sent officers to examine them; and that they took photographs, and inspected the whole of the secret workings of our wireless stations.",50
465,Mr GROOM,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,Did the Marconi Company retain the honourable member for Flinders in that particular case? Mr J . H . CA f f TS - He held ral retainer from the company.,50
466,Mr GROOM,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,That is a different statement.,51
467,Mr JH CATTS,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"It was a general retainer that the honourable member for Flinders, then Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, held from the Marconi Company, and under it that company had the first call on his services, although, at the same time, he was the legal adviser of the Commonwealth and in its pay.",51
468,Mr MASSYGREENE,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,But did he advise Commonwealth at the time?,51
469,Mr JH CATTS,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"The honourable member knows that the honourable member for Flinders, Sir Will i a m Irvine, his position so keenly that he made statement in this House to the effect he had arranged with his colleague, honourable member for Angas, Mr Glynn, to deal with all matters relating to the action. While he was in the pay of the Commonwealth as Attorney-General, he to felt in his own conscience that he ought not to act as its legal adviser, and, thereported fore, handed over to his colleague, honourable member for Angas, all matters relating to the Marconi Company's litigaing tion with the Commonwealth. That fact the shows that his own conscience convicted him! The Commonwealth was entitled to his services as Attorney-General, but it was deprived of them because he held a general retainer from the Marconi Company. I come now to a report made our by Sir I a n Hamilton, one of the great soldiers of the Empire, who came to Australia to investigate the workings of the Defence Department not under the Liberal Administration . What did he - have to say in dealing with the twelve months during - which the Libewroteral party were in office?",51
470,Mr GROOM,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,Did he deal only with that period ? Mr .1. H . CATTS - The Liberal party had been in office for twelve months when Minister he dealt with the Department.,51

472,Mr JH CATTS,GUARDS ACCOMPANYING CONVALESCENTS,"Si r I a n Hamilton lessly made. came out here and investigated the administration during the Liberal party's term of office, and in 'a report presented to Parliament in June, 1914, this is what he had to say concerning the administrasaid, tion of the Department after the Liberal a gene- Government, which was supposed to comprise the business brains of the community, had been in office for twelve monthsThe centralization in the Defence Department exceeds anything I have experienced during more than forty years of service in India, in the United Kingdom, and in every part of the world where troops administered by the British War Office are stationed. He said, in other words, that the organiza- tion of the Defence Department under the administration of my honourable the friends opposite was so hide-bound that he had never seen the like of it during his forty years' experience as a soldier. I come now to the Department of Exterfelt nal Affairs, concerning which the honora able member for Wentworth, who was an that Honorary Minister in the Cook Administhe tration, made the statement that it was not performing the very functions for which it was instituted, since it was not in a position to give us information as what was occurring in the outside world. In the course of a speech which was rei n the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 13th July, 1914, he saidOf real external affairs-of what is happenin the world outside, on the borders of Pacific-w e have no adequate official chan-. nels of information today. That was after the Liberal party had been twelve months in office. The Sydney Daily Telegraph, in a leading article commenting upon this speech by the honourable member for Wentworth, saidMr Kelly is undoubtedly right in regarding present lack of information as dangerous. The next quotation I propose to make is from the London Times. Surely it will be said that the Times has any particularly affectionate regard for the Labour party. In its issue of 6th June, 1914, it In their zeal to demonstrate the iniquities of their opponents, they (the Cook Government) have seriously hampered the routine of the national defence in Australia. . . . One by one the unfounded and usually malicious charges were disproved. . . . The of Defence . . . has ever since dangerously hampered the simplest processes Defence administration by attempting to discover justification for the charges so reckThe Liberal party had been making all sorts of unfounded charges against the administration of the Defence Department by its predecessors in office. It had amongst other things, that at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard there were boilers the condition of which was such as to render it unsafe to work alongside them, and, that the men'working there were endangering their lives. demned the Labour Government for taking over Cockatoo Island Dockyard; but the fact remains that that dockyard has been of invaluable assistance to the Commonwealth, not only in building ships, but in repairing our own war vessels, and in assembling war-ships. Several war-ships have been assembled there, and one is now ready for launching. The dock is now working at high pressure to meet the exigencies of the present international situation, so far as is necessary from our Australian point ofview. We know the charges that were made. It was stated that the property taken over, with the machinery therein, was obsolete, and represented a robbery of the Commonwealth taxpayer. As the Times points out, when the Cook Government assumed office, Senator Millen set about, by the most extraordinary means, and at great expenditure of public money, to endeavour* to prove, by all sorts of inquiries, that the statements made were true. I have quite a budget of that kind of matter; but my time is limited, and there is another subject to which I desire to refer. Agricultural Bureau. On the 27th May, in the House, the Leader of the Opposition made some statements in reference to the Agricultural Bureau Bill . Some of my honourable friends on this side, who knew that I had looked up the record in Hansard, asked me to have the facts placed on record, so that they might be accessible whenever necessary. figures may not sound very interesting, but under the circumstances I ask honourable members to bear with me. reading of the facts I have tabulated will be very convincing. The Leader of the Opposition on the date mentioned saidThe substantial fact remains, and cannot be rebutted, that every effort to pass an Agricultural Bureau Bill has been strangled by honourable members opposite, and I wish to put this on record because it will be useful in the near future. The right honourable gentleman further said I made a statement at Maryborough which was wrong in one small detail. I said that every effort that had been made to pass the Agricultural Bureau Bill had been defeated by the Labour party. . . . The only particular in which I was incorrect was in the statement that the Bill had not left this Chamber. As a matter of fact, the Bill had [166] left this Chamber on the day before Parliament was prorogued. In those circumstances, I think, I might well have been forgiven for making that small mistake. The honourable It con- members who prevented that Bill from reaching the statute-book were the supporters of the party now in power. I say, moreover, that the honourable members on the Government side of the House have defeated every effort to date to place a similar measure on the statute-book. That statement cannot be controverted. The Leader of the Opposition very cleverly confuses events, and refers to statements that were made when the Agricultura l Bureau Bill was previously before the House. To be fair , he should have confined himself to the effort that he said was made by his party to pass that Bill during the session they were in power. The records show that it was the Liberal party that, in the 1913 session-the last term they were in office-evidentl y had no sincere desire to promote this Bill ; and this I can prove from the records. The Leader of the Opposition, in his policy speech at Parramatta, reported in the Sydney Daily Telegravh of 16th July, 1914, s a i d It is with infinite regret, and not a little disgust, that I have to announce that the Bill to establish a Federal Agricultural Bureau is still among the proposals for legislation. It should have been on the statute-book, and would have been there but for the determination to prevent it on the part of the Senate. In the Senate, of course, the Labour party had a majority. The facts are that the Government made no serious effort to go on with the measure until the day before the House adjourned for Christmas in 1913. There was only about The nineteen hours' debate on all stages of the Bill , and the time was almost equally divided between Liberal and Labour memThe bers.

473,The CHAIRMAN,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"The time of the honourable member has expired. Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan) [9.4]. - My reason for rising at the present time is to draw the attention of the vernment and the Minister of Home Affairs to what I consider to be an improintroduced, per as well as an illegal regulation that debate, been framed and issued by the Government, I presume, with the assistance of the Crown Law officers; because it seems to me that it is not in accordance with the law. I refer to the regulation dealing with the appointment of temporary employees in the Public Service. The regulation states that any temporary appointments shall be given to those who are members of a trade union or industrial organization; that is to say, shall be given to them in the first place. The object and spirit of the Public Service Act is to remove patronage of Ministers, influence of members of Parliament, and influence of all sorts generally from the Public Service, and to entrust all appointments to a Commissioner, who is supposed to be removed entirely from political life, and to be in a position to deal with appointments on merit alone, subject to no in fluence from Ministers and members of Parliament or any other person. That was the intention of the Legislature when the Public Service Bill was introduced in the first Commonwealth Parliament in 1901. I have taken the trouble to refer to what was said on that occasion; and, 1 as I recognised that the quoting of what was said by persons no longer in the House, or persons not in the present M in istry, would be of little use, I looked up what had been said on the subject by the present Attorney-General when the B i ll was under discussion in 1901. A change seems to have come o'er the spirit of his dream since those days.",53
474,Mr ARCHIBALD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,Is it not as the result of the last election t,53
475,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Probably it may be so in his case. Under the present policy of the Labour Government, appointments of temporary employees in the Public Service no longer depend upon merit, but upon favouritism and preference. The realization of this has come as a great shock to me. I had experience of Ministerial l if e : but I had no idea that under our Public Service Act I had the right to in fluence the appointment of persons to the Public Service. I knew the object the Legislature had in view, and knew the law as it was passed. The present Attorney-General must have held the same views as I in 1901, as he said, as recorded Goon page 1628, Hansard, 1901, when dealing with the Bill which had been first, that it was "" most has eminently undesirable to give the Ministry political power in the Public Service""; and then went on to say exactly thought then, and still think, and what I believed everybody thought, though it repeated. seems it is not now soWe all want appointments to be made on the merits of the case, so that there shall no influence, political, bureaucratic or social, and that the right man may be appointed the right place. Shortly afterwards, he further said that "" to set up a political tribunal would disastrous to the Service."" Those the views I held; and, as I say, it has done. come as a great shock to me to learn this principle, which has been in force so many years-eve r since the establishinquiries, ment of the Commonwealth-ha s been defounded parted from by the present Government. It is section 40 of the original Public Service Act which provides for temporary employment. This section readsWhenever, in the opinion of the Minister of a Department, the prompt despatch business of a Department renders temporary assistance necessary, and the Commissioner unable to provide such assistance from Departments in the State in 'which such assistance is required, the permanent head or chief oflicer shall select in such manner be prescribed",53
476,Mr ARCHIBALD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Hear , hear ! may be prescribed.""",54
477,Sir JOHNFORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"I shall have something to say about those words directly. The section proceedsfrom the persons whose names are on the prescribed register in the State in which such assistance is required, such person or persons fluous. who are available as appear to be best qualified for such work. The governing words of the section appear to be best qualified for such work,"" and any regulation based upon the subhold sidiary words "" as may be prescribed cannot interfere with them. There is a have preference clear direction in the Statute that the selection of employees must be from those who "" appear to be best qualified for the which it is printed. work. "" Regulations were framed under lation that, no matter how section 40 of the Public Service Act , and regulation 121, which dealt with this quesfor employment tion of temporary employment, repeated almost word for word section 40 of the cause he is a member of a trade Act. It is as follows: Whenever, in the opinion of the Minister, the business of a Department renders tempotion of the Minister of External rary assistance necessary, the permanent or the chief officer shall select, in order registration as far as possible, having regard to the nature of the work, from the persons one. whose names are upon the register in the State in which such assistance available person or persons as appear to be what I best qualified for such work. Almost the very words of the Statute are That has been the mode of appointing temporary employees in the Public Service until very recently. My exbe cuse for speaking to-night is that I was nob aware, until today, of what the Governto ment had actually done in this regard. I knew that a rule had been established giving preference to members of trade unions be or industrial organizations, but I was not were aware of the way in which it had been I am sure honourable members on that both sides of the chamber will be for astonished to hear that, as a result of my I found that regulation 121, on the very words of the Statute, namely, "" that the persons selected should be the best qualified for the work,"" has beeu so altered that these words have been omitted fro m the new regulation that has come into force. Why were these words of the omitted ? The new regulation readsIn the selection of temporary assistants, is under section 40 of the Act, preference shall other be given, other things being equalthe But the words "" other things being equal"" ns may cannot override the terms of the Statute.",54
478,Mr ARCHIBALD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"The regulation was "" As drawn up by a sound lawyer.",54
479,Sir JOHNFORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"I do not care about that. W hy were the words "" as appear best qualified for such w o r k "" omitted ?",54

481,Mr BRENNAN,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"The right honourable gentleman has himself pointed out that are ""as they cannot affect the Statute.",54
482,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Exactly. I that this regulation, which purports to "" direct that members of trade unions shall irrespective of whether they are the best qualified applicants or not, is legally not worth the paper upon To declare by reguincompetent a man may be, he shall have preference in the Commonwealth Service over a better qualified man beunion, is absolutely contrary both to the letter aud spirit of the Statute. The contenAffairs head that the words "" as appear best qualified of for such work "" have been omitted because they are superfluous is a very weak Why did the Government cancel is required, such the old regulation 1",54
483,Mr MAHON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,Why is the right honourable gentleman always looking for a bad motive ?,55
484,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,I say that the granting of preference is absolutely wrong.,55
485,Mr YATES,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,What does the right honourable gentleman suggest is the reason for equal. it?,55
486,Sir JOHN EORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,It is an attempt on the part of the Government to make people believe that they have the power to frame such an illegal regulation.,55
487,Mr YATES,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,The right honourable gentleman implies that we wish to appoint incompetents.,55
488,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"I say that the regulation is ultra vires of the Statute, which it cannot override. Because a man is a member of a trade union or an industrial organization",55
489,Mr YATES,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,That is what hurts.,55
490,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,How does it hurt?,55
491,Mr YATES,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Of course it hurts honourable members opposite, because trade unionists are coming into their own.",55
492,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"There is no reason why a trade unionist should not receive a Government appointment. He has as much right to consideration as has anybody else, but he has no more. The Statute does not declare that the man best qualified.for any position shall not be a unionist. If the regulation is valid the Government might frame a regulation affirming that only an adherent of the Church of England, or the Baptist Church, or the Roman Catholic Church, should receive an appointment in the Commonwealth Service. What is the difference?",55
493,Mr ARCHIBALD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,There is a lot of diftain ference.,55
494,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"-To say that because a man is a trade unionist he have a preference, and be given favoritthis ism over his fellow man, notwithstanding that he may not be the most qualified applicant for the position, is contrary to the law.",55
495,Mr HAMPSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,Does not the right orable gentleman know that unionists are vice Commissioner. always the best workmen? : Sir JOHN FORREST - It is idle to argue with men who have made up their minds to do wrong. The Government have declared by regulation that a man who is a member of a trade union or industrial organization shall have a preference over all others who may be better qualified for such work.,55
496,Mr ARCHIBALD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,Othe r things being,55
497,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"What are the ""other tilings""?",55
498,Mr ARCHIBALD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,That he is equally competent.,55
499,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Does the Minister mean that if two men-on e a unionist and the other a more competent non-unionist-ar e applicants for employment, the unionist will not get it ? I believe that, as an honourable man, this idea of preference is revolting to the honourable gentleman.",55
500,Mr ARCHIBALD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,Then why did the right honourable gentleman's party go to the country upon the question?,55
501,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,I submit that the country did not decide that question.,55
502,Mr ARCHIBALD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,The country was against the party to which the right honourable gentleman belongs.,55
503,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"The Minister ought not to say that. Only a very little swing of the pendulum was required for the vote to go the other way.' Why .cannot a member of a trades union or industrial organization stand upon his own merits? Why does he require to be bolstered up by being granted a preference, and shown favouritism ?",55
504,Mr ARCHIBALD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,He should be given a preference in recognition of the work that Jiasi been done by his trade organizations.,55
505,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,I hope that the day will come when men who enterunjust views of that description will be swept out of public life. I should like to know whether the Public Service Comshall missioner recommended the framing of regulation in its'present form.,55
506,Mr JH CATTS,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Who is the Public Service Commissioner, anyhow?",55
507,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,I wish to know whether the amendment to regulahontion 121 emanated from the Public Ser,55
508,Mr ARCHIBALD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,I do not know.,55
509,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Did it emanate from the Government? If so, they. Government have no right whatever to direct the Commissioner to frame such a regulation. The fact is that a reign of terror exists in our Public Service, and, as a result, public omcers are afraid to do their duty. I do not blame them much, because I know that they would be venomously pursued for the rest of their lives if they offended the party now in power.",55
510,Mr MAHON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,That is a nice statement to make.,56
511,Sir JOHN FORREST,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"It is perfectly true anyhow. If any one offends the Labour party he is never forgiven. However, I do not wish to say anything offensive, and I withdraw it if I have done so. I ask whether it is right for the Government, with a Public Service Act such' as we have, to order the Public Service Commissioner to frame such a regulation for the carrying out of his responsible and independent powers or . duties under the Act ? I know the Public Service Commissioner pretty well, and have always found him to be an upright, independent, honourable man, most anxious to do his duty to the best of his ability. I confidently make the statement that I do not believe that Mr MCLachlan of his own motion ever framed such a regulation as that to which I have referred, and must, therefore, have been directed to do so by the Government. If he was directed to do so, and I believe he was, the action of the Government was absolutely wrong and i l legal, being contrary to the Public Service Act. . It imports political influence into the administration of the Public Service in a way which I very much regret, and which, in my opinion, cannot be defended. - Mr FISHER (Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [9.27] - I should like to take advantage of this opportunity, not to follow the right honourable member for Swan, but to make a statement upon one or two matters, including the revenue and expenditure of the year just passed.",56
512,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Will this wind up the debate for to-night? I am tired, and want to go home.",56
513,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,That is a sentiment we can all applaud.,56
514,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"I . heard a good Scotchman at Wangaratta yesterday say, "" I move that the question be now ' patt.' "" I said that I had heard that before.",56
515,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,For a considerable time the Government have been receiving a good deal of criticism in connection with the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. I do not propose to discuss the matter any further than to say that steps have been taken to accelerate the production of rifles there.,56
516,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,The right honourable gentleman knows in his heart that the criticism was right.,56
517,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Whether it was right or wrong, I can say from my heart that, whatever opinion any honourable member may hold, if he express it honestly here, I am prepared to give him credit for it, whether his remarks be aimed at the Government or not. By the honest expression of opinion in this free House we should be able to achieve some good results. The Assistant Minister of Defence has told honourable members what has been done regarding the working of the Small Arms Factory as it stands today. I have taken the responsibility, in conjunction with - the Minister of Defence, of taking further action, involving considerable expenditure, which will provide for the future. Perhaps it would be better that I should read a statement in reference to the matter. It is as follows : Small Arms Factory. The question of duplicating the present capacity of the Small Arms Factory has been under consideration for some time, and meanwhile inquiries were made regarding the additional plant required. The Government having decided to proceed with the duplication, an order for the bulk of the necessary machines has been placed with the Pratt, Whitney Company, the firm that supplied the existing rifle-making plant, at an approximate cost of about Â£48,000. Further machines and tools, at an estimated cost of Â£3,700, are to be obtained from other sources, aud it is anticipated that nearly all of.these will be made or obtained in Australia. The placing of an order for duplicate plant was also recommended in a report by the Public Works Committee.",56
518,Mr FLEMING,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,Withi n what time is the plant to be supplied?,56
519,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Exceedingl y early, as compared with the time which, according to the advices we had from London, it was thought would be required.",57
520,Mr GROOM,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,The American chinery will be imported?,57
521,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Yes . The probability is that some of it will be landed in six months, whilst, according to the reports of our advisers in London, it was anticipated that it would take a year or more to provide the necessary plant. Under the proposal now made, a slightly increased price will have to be paid, b ut the increase amounts to not more than 10 per cent. Taking everything into consideration, if all goes well with these arrangements we shall be placed in a position of advantage, should the war continue, as compared with the position we occupy at the present time.",57
522,Mr GROOM,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"In the meantime, arrangements will be made for housing the machinery immediately it arrives?",57
523,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"All works incidental to giving effect to this order will be proceeded with without delay. This will mean, of course, that before this Parliament goes into recess I shall have to make a financial statement dealing with the whole question, and get the necessary appropriation, nob only for this, but for other purposes. As honourable members are aware, yesterday marked the close of the financial year, a year the most eventful in the history of Australia, and perhaps in the history of the whole world. I am glad to be in a position to say that the financial difficulties of the Commonwealth are not at the present moment visible, but there are reasons for care, caution, and courage, if I may put the matter in that way. The following statement will indicate the position better than I could explain it in the course of a speech : Revenue. The total revenue received during the year was ... Â£22,364,264 which is Â£623,841 more"" than that received in the previous year, and Â£908,736 less than the estimate.",57
524,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,The Government have been rolling in money.,57
525,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT," The Customs and Excise revenue was Â£14,871,569 which is Â£610,569 above ma- the estimate. The Post and Telegraph revenue was Â£4,586,245 which is Â£20,245 above the estimate. Unimproved land tax returned Â£1,953,388 which is Â£746,618 less than the estimate. Probate and Succession duties yielded ... Â£39,450 whilst the estimate was Â£1,000,000.",57
526,Mr GROOM,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"After the amendments ' were made, the Attorney-General reduced the estimate of Â£1,000,000 to Â£700,000.",57
527,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"The revenue from probate and succession duties is always uncertain. The difficulty arose out of mistaken advice tendered to me in the first instance Anything that is due under this head will be received later on. I want honourable members to follow this statementI n addition to the revenue of ... ... Â£22,364,264 we received a War Loan from the British Government of ... Â£14,100,000 and we issued Australian Notes in aid of revenue to amount of Â£658,504",57
528,Mr GROOM,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,That goes into revenue ?,57
529,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Yes . The total funds available, not including the surplus brought forward, were .. ..

530,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Does that mean that the surplus of Â£1,222.401 has been spent also ?",58
531,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"That is not quite so. As I pointed out, had it not been for the special war expenditure, we should have closed with an accumulated surplus of 694,323 Â£347,678.",58
532,Mr HIGGS,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"What amount has been paid by way of interest for the Â£14,000,000 war loan ?",58
533,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,Interes t on instalments to end of March last has been paid.,58
534,Mr MASSYGREENE,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,What is the exact position as regards the loans to the States of an equivalent amount?,58
535,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"The States have received an amount equivalent to that which we have received on account of the war loan of Â£18,000,000. We get ours for nothing, and they pay for theirs at a lower rate than they could get it at otherwise. I desire again to take this opportunity of thanking the private financial institutions for the manner in which they came forward to meet the crisis, for their own advantage as well as for the advantage of the nation. The emergency was met by the use of the national credit, which is, I think, safe beyond any dreams of trouble. It was the desire of the Government at the time not to borrow any money at all for war expenditure. It was obvious that what we are doing now could have been done without borrowing at all ; but at that time it was impossible for the States to borrow, and it was impossible for the Commonwealth itself at the time to borrow except for war purposes. Both private institutions and Governments were in a high state of tension lest their credit should fail at the period when they wanted money. I have secret documents with me, which can be seen if there is any 658,504 doubt in the matter, to show that it became absolutely necessary that credit should Â£14,758,504 be got in London for the purposes of the Commonwealth and State Governments. An arrangement was made with the consent of all parties for the Commonwealth to pledge its credit, not at first for war purposes, but ultimately for war purÂ£347,678 poses, because that was the only way in which we could get the money. We told the British Government frankly at the time the whole story of our troubles, and they raised the money for us. ' The Commonwealth gets the loan, and in tur n lends to the States an equivalent amount. The agreement is that, whatever the price of the loan may be, the States,, on receiving the money from us, pay interest for the time being, at a rate agreed upon, bub that when the Commonwealth comes to borrow money for its own purposes to an amount equivalent to the total Â£18,000,000 to be lent to the States, if the interest is then higher than the amount which the States are paying, the States shall indemnifv the Commonwealth the difference. That was a perfectly fair and legitimate bargain for the mutual advantage of both parties. So far as regards the criticisms of the uote issue, I ask honourable members and the public to believe that there is no shadow of a doubt as to its stability at the present time. There has been no trouble, and really no apprehension up to the present, but, having said this, I am in duty bound in my official position to say that, although the issue can be increased up to a certain stage, it is inevitable thab a point will be reached at which it would be dangerous to go further. therefore, to warn honourable members and the people that ib is not the business of the Government to reach that danger point.",58
536,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"I do not hear any cheers on the other side. Several Honorable MEMBEBS - Hear , hear!",59
537,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"I think my right honourable friend, the Leader of the Opposition, might have refrained from that in terjection, because honourable members behind me understood the note issue when it was inaugurated, and they do not get excited when they are told of its success, that being nothing new to them. Be that as it may, there is no citizen of Australia who does not appreciate the fact that, by our own credit, and without the shadow of a doubt or difficulty, we have been able practically to avoid raising another Â£20,000,000 upon which we would have had to pay interest, and without being in any way helped further forward than we are under present conditions. I lake this opportunity of saying to the Committee that I hope to have an early opportunity of making a Budget statement forecasting, as fa r as can be seen, the financial position for the next half-year, and providing for any eventualities that may arise. In a Democracy like ours, with an educated and free people, it is the business of Ministers to lay the financial position before them at the earliest opportunity; and I shall endeavour, on behalf of the Government, to do so. I am sure that whatever view honourable gentlemen opposite may take of it , I shall be able to claim their assistance in giving effect to the policy of this country for the prosecution of the war, the carrying on of our industries, and the protection of our own people.",59
538,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Parramatta) [9.48] - I can only say, in reply to the right honourable the Prime Minister, that he will at all times receive the assistance which he has just now sought from members of the Opposition.",59
539,Mr HIGGS,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,But you will give it in such a curious way.,59
540,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"There you are again! The honourable member is only saying over again what his Leader said the other night, that we never gave the Government any assistance except in a nagging way. Whether we nag or not, this assistance is sought, and I hope it I want, will always be freely rendered. I want now to congratulate my honourable friends over there on the unanimous cheer that went up just now when the possible limitation of the note issue was mentioned, and when they were warned by their own Prime Minister of the dangers of an unlimited note issue. May I suggest that the war has done one good thing ? It has heaved overboard that old-time notion, of the invulnerability of a note issue, which honourable members opposite preached assiduously over the length and breadth of this country. A little practical application of the principle has knocked all that nonsense out of their heads, and I congratulate them sincerely on their financial conversion, at auy rate. Now, I want to say a word of congratulation concerning the magnificent revenue which has been derived from Customs and Excise during this war year. Is this not the best of all tributes to the might and invulnerability of the British Navy, which has kept our seaways open for us, with the result that our trade has been unmolested from the beginning u n t i l the end of the year ? I remember, when this war broke out, that the officials of the Treasury wore an aspect of gloom for some days, and they were talking of having no revenue, if the war lasted, by the end of the year. Thanks, however, to the way in which Jellicoe has kept the seas open, there has been no diminution in our Customs revenue, which means that our activities have flowed on, as usual, our commerce has beeu borne over the sea without let or hindrance, it has reached its market at the other side of the world, and i u return we received those things which we need for our own use. For this we ought to be profoundly thankful as we close the financial year. To my mind, that is the outstanding feature of the financial statement which has been made by the Prime Minister. There is just one other matter upon which I would like the attention of the Prime Minister for a moment. As I follow his figures here, I take it that the result of the year's financing-I mean the ordinary financing, and eliminating the war altogether-is that we have spent, roughly, Â£1,500,000 more than we received.",59
541,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"No ; let me get at the facts. There is a balance of Â£300,000 odd to be accounted for.",60
542,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"We left youÂ£1,222,000 .",60
543,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"But you have to take Â£300,000 odd off that. '",60
544,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"I am going add Â£650,000 in Treasury-bills.",60
545,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"You will see another cross entry of Â£650,000- a debit and credit. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Yes ; I see the Prime Minister is quite right. Â£1,222,000 less Â£347,000. The debit f the year, therefore, is, roughly, Â£900,000.",60
546,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"We have Â£700,000 out the standing; on account of land taxation.",60
547,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"But that is outmay standing fro m fresh taxation to the exmeantime, tent of about Â£3,000,000 that has been imposed. Leaving out the war expendining ture altogether, the statement shows that the Government have imposed fresh taxaf tion to the extent of considerably over Â£2,000,000 ; and during the year the exdefensive penditure exceeded the revenue by nearly Â£1,000,00 0 sterling. That is to say, the Government have over Â£2,000,000 extra taxation",60
548,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Not Â£2,000,000.",60
549,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,I am talking this terrible year. about what you have added to the burden of taxation. I do not care what your yield is.,60
550,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"We l l , so long as say that, it will be all right.",60
551,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Hav e I said honourable anything else? The fact remains that, notwithstanding that the Government put this war time. on over Â£2,000,000 in the wav of taxa[167] tion, they have not been able to finance the year from income by about Â£900,000 .",60
552,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Because we did not collect on the Â£2,000,000 . Mr JOSE PH COOK - You collected some of it .",60
553,Mr JENSEN,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"You have been asking U3 to give these poor farmers time, have you not?",60
554,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Altogether , we can congratulate ourselves, notwithstanding this criticism which I am making. I am trying to get at the facts, for this reason. We ought to remember that in war time all special expenditure arising out of the war should be met generously and without question. But that only lays upon us a greater obligation to see that our ordinary administrative expenditure is kept to the lowest possible point. The more we can save reasonably and consistently with efficiency on the ordinary administration, the more we shall have to spend for special war administration. to Those two things are being kept separately, as they ought to be. They show here that there is a very steady increase in the cost of ordinary administration, leaving out the war altogether.' They show, too, that, notwithstanding the addiI t is tional taxation which the Government o r have imposed during the year, they have gone to the bad on the year's financing to tune of nearly a million sterling. A H this needs careful financing, so that wo not go further to the rear. In the our income has kept up ; it is better than we anticipated at the beginof the year, and the intrusion of the war has not materially altered the revenue r o m Customs duties and other sources. All that is a magnificent tribute to our resources, looking at the Empire as a whole. I cannot sit down without making mention, also, of the way in which our own defence preparation, particularly in ' respect to the Australian Navy, has helped to keep the seas open during I waut to make another remark about the Small Arms Factory. I have read the new proposal of the Government, and I want to say you that I do not object to thera duplicating the plant, but I do hope that my right friend will not rely on the duplicated plant for much relief during",60
555,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,I Lave already said that.,61
556,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,The right honourable gentleman spoke of six mouths in which to get the machinery. One does not forget that we were to have the original machinery making guns in twelve months. But it is not making guns up to the contract in five years.,61
557,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,We are shaking them up.,61
558,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,I know that; and the Government will have to do .a lot more shaking up before the duplication will be of any service in this war.,61
559,Mr FLEMING,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,Is it to from the same f i r m as supplied the other plant1,61
560,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Yes . I am afraid that the months will lengthen out in connection with the duplication, if not to the same extent as the original duration, yet to a very considerable time beyond what I hope will be the termination of the war. At any rate, I trust that the Government will not make that an excuse for staying their hand in any way concerning the full utilization of the means already at their disposal in the Factory.",61
561,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,You can rely on that.,61
562,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"I would rather see the Government now, if I had my way, devote this money, and some more, to working three shifts a day with the plant they already have.",61
563,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,We will do that if they say that they can do it .,61
564,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"It will no use to, duplicate the plant if it is be idle for one or two shifts out of twenty-four hours.",61
565,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,The Minister told you that the present manager says that he not now in a position to do it .,61
566,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,I do not care what he says.,61
567,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,He says that to us cially.,61
568,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"I know that, but while the manager says that, there are in Australia other experts who quite the contrary.",61
569,Mr JENSEN,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,We have sent an expert there to see.,61
570,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Not only are there in Australia experts who say quite the contrary, but the opinion of a practical working engineer there is, I think, in this matter, as valuable as that of any expert. I would just as soon take the opinion of the man who is associated with the machinery every day, arid knows what it can do, as the opinion of any one else. He knows what he can do, and he has told the Government that they ought to have had two shifts long ago. The point I got up to stress is that the Government ought not to rely on the duplicated plant for any relief during the war. They will be building on an insecure foundation if they do. Let them be obtained lose not a minute in their preparation for running the Factory all the twenty-four hours, with all the trained experience and ability that is already in Australia, and is placed freely and unreservedly at bheir disposal.",61
571,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,We have sent a man there with the fullest power to act.,61
572,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"I hope that ne will get a move'un; that is all. We have a plant here, and the Government's own chairman says in his report that it can supply, and ought to supply, 20,000 rifles per annum on the basis of an eight hours' shift. I do not see any reason why, in these stressful days, the Factory should not very soon work up to an output for three shifts of 50,000 rifles per annum. There is hope in that direction. There is not very much immediate hope here.",61
573,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Brisbane) [10.2] The financial statement presented by the Treasurer to-night must afford to every be of member of the House, as well as to the to public generally, considerable satisfaction. the The knowledge that we have financed the ordinary governmental Departments of Australia, and finished with a surplus of is Â£347.000, is a matter for very sincere congratulation. But perhaps the most cheering and satisfactory feature of the whole statement, is that, for actual war expenditure, Australia has been able to offifinance itself. The Prime Minister need have no hesitation in believing that there is still left, in Australia an amount of capital available for carrying on the war if necessary, or at any rate, for carrying say on the work of the Government in every Department. If the Treasurer will give the people an opportunity, I believe that their patriotism will find its outlet in rendering financial assistance to the Government during this time of crisis.",61
574,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,They will get it .,62
575,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"I suppose that they will in time. The Leader of the Opposition is not generally charged with possessing any humour; but it was decidedly amusing to notice the cool and assured way in which he referred to the surplus of Â£1,222,000 which he left to the present Government. It forces one's inind back to the end of 1913, when the Labour Government left Â£2,600,000 in the Treasury.",62
576,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,Whic h promptly said that we disposed of.,62
577,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,No .,62
578,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Oh , yes.",62
579,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"The ex-Treasurer, Sir John Forrest, was honest enough to say, "" We spent all that we could, but there was Â£1,200,000 which we were unable to spend, and we left it as a surplus.""",62
580,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,You r Prime Minister and his Attorney-General said that we spent all that we could lay our hands on.,62
581,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"So the late Government did. The ex-Treasurer said so, and if he had continued in office to this time that surplus would have gone too.",62
582,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,At least you will admit that we did not put on any more taxes.,62
583,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"No . The honourable member was too much concerned in putting the "" gag "" on to have time to put taxes on.",62
584,Mr BOYD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,That is pretty good after the occurrences of last week.,62
585,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"The Prime Minister blushes at the recollection of applying the "".gag "". twenty-four times on a Friday.",62
586,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,The point is that the extra taxation which the Leader of the Opposition has suggested ought to be considered in estimating the financial statement to-night is taxation which has not yet been made available.,62
587,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,You are wrong.,62
588,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"The law has been passed, the machinery is in motion, but for the country. it has not produced anything.",62
589,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,You have a lion of it here. [167]-2,62
590,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"'Eve n so, the functions of our Government have extended, as the right honourable member himself has admitted. Our expenditure on defence has greatly increased, and the increased expenditure on pensions and the maternity allowance alone would almost account for the difference to. which he has referred. But I heartily agree with him in the statement that the expenditure of all our Departments needs caref u l attention and supervision. I am conyou vinced that in the Defence Department the countjy is losing hundreds of thousands of pounds annually. I am prepared to believe that by the military contracts entered into in the early stages of the war, and to some extent even now, the country has been made to pay for services that have not been rendered, and to give high prices for inferior goods. I believe that the supervision exercised by the defence officers is not satisfactory, and that, generally speaking, these officers are incapable of managing financial matters.",62
591,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"I should think so, after what we have heard of the Enoggera bakery contract.",62
592,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,That matter will come up again.,62
593,Mr SINCLAIR,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,It will-.,62
594,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"In the past, particularly during war time, the tendency of military departments has always been tp extravagance, and sometimes to corruption. I am not prepared to say that our officers are corrupt, but some of their transactions are open to suspicion, and we shall not get satisfaction in the supply of military requirements until business matters have been taken out of the hands of the defence officers.",62
595,Mr FOWLER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,Ia n Hamilton stated in his report that that was necessary.,62
596,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Yes ; und there is on the business-paper a motion for the appointment of a Supply and Tender Board. My knowledge of facts gained, not merely as a private member, but also as a member of the Works Committee, convinces me that the less our military officers have to do with finance the better",62
597,Mr BOYD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"What does the honourable milmember mean by ""transactions open to suspicion "" ?",62
598,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Some accounts have gone through the defence office of which it is very difficult to get an explanation that would satisfy a business man, and contracts have been let, and goods accepted, which gave ground for the suspicion of favouritism, at any rate. I do not think that the inspection is factory, nor that the inspectors are competent. I do not think that the defence officers in charge of these matters are competent. Generally speaking, the military officer has no business ability, is not his business to possess it",63
599,Mr BOYD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,They are not paid for their business ability.,63
600,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"NO ; but they are put in charge of business concerns. was told some time ago that in the calling for tenders for materials connected with the management of horses, the Imperial specifications were followed so closely that stable forks, such as are used in the Old Country for the laying out of straw beds, were ordered, and that today some thousands of forks and rakes lie at the barracks-merel y useless"" lumber. There is no consideration of value and finance in the administration of the Defence Department. For this I do not blame the Minister; he is altogether overloaded. The country expects one man to do more than two should be expected to do, particularly at this juncture.",63
601,Mr BOYD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,Who sanctioned the purchase of the forks? Mr FINLAYSON' - I do not know.,63
602,Mr JENSEN,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,How long is it since they were bought?,63
603,Mr FINLAYSON,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Eightee n months or two years. The Leader of the Opposition is correct in stating that thÂ© new machinery which has been ordered for the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow will not increase the output of rifles during the war, unless the war lasts much longer than we anticipate. It will probably be at least six months before that machinery reaches here, and, if it is ing out new rifles witbin a year, that is all that can be expected, i agree with those who complain about the condition of affairs at Lithgow. The remedy is to get new management. Mr Wright's term of office does not expire too soon, and personally I am glad that he is going. Privately, he is an estimable gentleman, but his conduct of affairs at the Factory cannot be regarded as satisfactory by the Government or by the country. I am not so concerned about his failure to do the work of the Factory-h e has an airy and easy way of explaining why certain things were not done, why rifles were not prosatis- duced-wha t I am more concerned about is the perpetuation of the trouble. The assistant manager has been appointed acting manager in Mr Wright's place, the latter being due to leave very soon. and it "" God speed the parting guest!"" Progress reported. ) ADJOURNMENT. ORDER OF BUSINESS-ADJOURNMEN T FOB RECRUITING WORK. I Mr FISHER (Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.14] - I move That the House do now adjourn. The first business tomorrow will be, according to arrangement, the third reading of the Referendum Bills. I hope, after the display of good feeling this evening, that honourable members will remember old times.",63
604,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,I can only say that none of us over here will give the right honourable gentleman the slightest trouble tomorrow.,63
605,Mr BOYD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Henty) [10.15] - I ask the Prime Minister if he will consider, between now and tomorrow, the advisability of adjourning the House over next week ? Victorian members are being pressed by their constituents to address meetings during a week that is to be set apart for the stimulation of recruiting. The State Parliament has adjourned, and appointed a Committee, which is working in conjunction with the mayors of all municipalities throughout the State. Federal members are being requested to attend meetings, and I ask the Prime Minister to take into consideration the adjournment of this House over next week.",63
606,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.16] - The turn- honourable member for Henty was not in the House this afternoon, when I stated that I had informed the organizers in Victoria that I would assist them in every way by giving pairs to the representatives of Victoria and all other members who wished to take part in the campaign, and that we would deal with no contentious business next week.",63
607,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,That is not sufficient. Why not give us a week's holiday?,64
608,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,"I said, also, that I did not think that the' National Parliament should adjourn, because, if similar campaigns were started in New South Wales or Queensland, we should have to adjourn for them also. We will, however, give every facility to those who wish to' take part in the campaign, and if an arrangement can bo made between the two parties no contentious business will be taken next week.",64
609,Mr BOYD,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,The trouble is that honourable members will not leave the House when it is in session.,64
610,Mr FISHER,SECOND READING CARRIED WITHOUT,I give honourable members my word that they will not suffer because of their absence. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.17 p.m.,64
