1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon W. Elliot Johnson) took the chair at l l a.m., and read prayers. COAL MINERS' CONFERENCE. - Mr Charlton - Does the Prime Minister know whether a conference is being arranged between the Government - of New South Wales and representatives of-the coal miners?",20
2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yesterday I received a telegram from the Acting Premier of the State to the effect that the holding' of a conference was being considered, and as the. .honourable member knows, I received a message from Mr Baddeley to the effect that the members of the miners' council were available for a conference. I assume that I shall be advised today of the intentions of the Government of New South Wales, and I shall communicate the information to the honourable member. SUGAR COMPANY'S EMPLOYEES.",20
3,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister received a reply to the request which I made to him privately that he would ascertain whether it is a fact that the Colonial Sugar Refining Oompany is compelling its employees who receive daily or weekly wagesr to withdraw their money from the provident fund, threatening - that unless they do so they will he dismissed ?",20
4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"A letter in which the statements of the honourable member are set out has been sent to the company, and the company has been asked to say whether these statements are accurate, and to furnish an explanation regarding the whole matter. So soon as a reply has been received, I shall let the honourable member know its contents. MR. HOLMAN. Mr..FOWLER-Has the Prime Minister seen the cabled report that a person named Holman, who apparently has taken it upon himself to represent Australia abroad, has been telling the people of the United.States'that, it is their, duty to carry on this war to afinish ? Will the right honourable gentleman inquirei f this Mr. Holman is the politician who, a' few months ago, before the last State election, entered into an agreement, in order to save his political hide, to oppose under any circumstances the introduction of * conscription into Australia? Further, if this is the same politician, will the Prime Minister cable the information to America, so that it may have the incidental effect of suggesting to Mr Holman the propriety of lapsing into an honourable silence?",20
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"No one can present the views of the people of Australia in regard to the war unless speaking with the authority of this Parliament Mr. Holman has not that authority, and therefore, speaks merely as a private citizen. I have read a report of his speech, in which it is said that we are going to fight to a victorious finish. Probably we haveall been guilty of libtle indiscretions, which after luncheon must be regarded aa mere peccadillos. I seeno: useful purpose to be served by cabling to America, because I apprehend that there they discount all. such observations, and making such a discount in tOiis case; there remains little in thespeech to which exception can be taken. FEDERAL CAPITAL. PARUAMEN'T HOUSE PLAITS.",20
6,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I ask the Minister, for Home and Territories if he intends to ask the-adjudicating board of architects to proceed with their work during wartime in connection with thejudging of plans for the proposed' parliamentary. buildings at Canberra, and'if he will inform the House what is the present position regarding ""the competition?",20
7,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not intend to ask !the adjudicators to come together and deal with this matter, until I have received fuller information. In November last the Cabinet suspended the competition because a communication had been received in the previous month, from the head of the British Institute of Architects to the effect that, it was undesirable to go on with it at the present time. This morning I gave, instructions for a cablegram to be sent to inquire what is the position, and I shall be guided by the reply. S.S. PORT KEMBLA.",20
8,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The steamer Port Kembla disappeared the other day as the result of an explosion. Is it true that the hold in which the explosion occurred was loaded by volunteer labourers?,21
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am unable to say, nor do I know whether the Port Kembla was sunk through an internal or from some other cause. As three vessels have lately disappeared from this coast, of which two were certainly not loaded by volunteer labour, it is obvious, adopting the methods of deductive reasoning, that voluntary labour is not the explanation of the sinking of the Port Kembla. PRICE OF BAGS.  aware that corn and wheat sacks are higher in price now than they were before the 10 per cent, import duty was remitted ? Will the right honourable gentleman look into the matter, to prevent exploitation?",21
10,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am not aware that the facts are as stated, but' as I have in vestigated the subject closely I am sure that' no exploitation can take place. The price of bags here is regulated by tihe state of the jute market in Calcutta. . To warrant the cry of exploitation it is not enough to discover that the price of an article has increased; everything is dearer now - than it was. The Government is watching this matter most vigilantly, and in tends to take every step necessary to prevent the farmers from being exploited or hampered in any way; but it cannot regulate prices on the Calcutta jute market. The farmers, however, are threatened with a more serious inconvenience than an ""increase in the price of bags. Owing to the war, it may happen that we shall not be able to get bags brought here. Then - the - trouble will be not the high price of bags, but bags at any price. PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE. Motion (by Mr HUGHES) agreed toThat, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Conunittee Act, the following members be appointed - members of the Joint Public Works Committee!;-Messrs .

' Mr Riley - Will the Minister for Works and Railways consider the desir^ ability of referring to the Public Works Committee at 'an early - date the works necessary to be put in hand at Port Stephens ? , Mr ' WATT - It is not proposed to refer any works at Port Stephens to the Committee during this session. COST OF BREADPRODUCTION .",21
11,Mr BOYD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Is the Prime Ministeraware that it is freely alleged that Mr . Bowden Ball, the baker who stated that. he could sell bread at a profit at fid. perloaf, is sweating his employees?",21
12,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"1 do not knowwhether that statement is true, but a& most extraordinary allegation was madeto me yesterday in ' the form of as t at u tory declaration which, without comment,. I shall put before the House for what it : is worth. If the statements contained.! therein are - true they certainly disclose 'a. most extraordinary state 'of affairsI , Edward 'Thomas Tucker, of 35 New-street; Armadale, in the State'of Victoria, do solemnlyand sincerely declare that I was in the employ of F. Bowden Ball, baker, of Malverniroad,. Hawksburn, in .1913. I was employed as .a baker and pastrycook at a weekly wage of Â£2 15s. The hours I worked were as follows:From 3 a.m. until 3 or 4, and ofttimes 5 p.m. on Thursday nights, starting at midnight. T worked continuously, meal hour excepted, and' did not finish until 3 o'clock the next day, resuming again on the Friday night at 10 o'clock, and finishing at 2 o'clock on Saturday afternoon. Towards the end of my employment my , hours were somewhat changed. My startingtime was then 5 a.m., and my finishing 4 p,.ni., excepting Thursday and Friday,, - which., began at 12 and 10 p.m. respectively, until 2 p.m. the next day. The reason my leaving his employ was he wanted to reduce ,my wage, to which 1 objected. The reason he gave was that he could not afford it. The declaration is signed by the deponent, and witnessed by John H . Pittarid, J.P. i",21
13,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Is this statutory declaration not a most extraordinary document, having regard to the fact that there are no fewer than five erasures and additions to it . In one case six words have heen struck out and five in serted in their place, and the alterations are not initialed by either the signatory or the magistrate before whom the' declaration was made.",22
14,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Thos e defects do not invalidate the document; the signatory is liable for it as it is. The onus rests upon him to show that the emendations were made either by him or by some otlier person. The document must be taken for what it is worth, and the signatory is liable if he has made a false declaration.",22
15,Mr JH CATTS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"In connection with the inquiry into the cost of bread production, is the Prime Minister aware that the Commonwealth Prices Board in vestigated this matter in every State in the Commonwealth, that the State Pood Prioes Commissioners have inquired into it, and that the New South Wales Prices Commission probed the question exhaustively, and that theevidence taken by all those' bodies is available ? What purpose is to be served by an inquiry by the Inter-State Commission, covering a limited area, when all the information that can be obtained in reference to the conditions throughout Australia is already accessible to the Government?",22
16,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,All I know is that there was an almost unanimous desire by all sections of the House that an inquiry should be made. It does not necessarily follow that facts elicited a year ago are sufficient today.,22
17,Mr JH CATTS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The information has been brought lip to date within the last few months.,22
18,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I will call the tion of the Inter-State Commission to this evidence, and ask them to take official notice of it . They can incorporate it with the evidence they have obtained, and only to the extent that it requires supplementing, need it be supplemented.",22
19,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Hav e the Government yet received any report from the Inter-State Commission in regard to the price of bread production', which was the first' matter inquired into by that body ? - Mr HUGHES - I have not received any report, yet. I spoke to one of the Commissioners a few days ago, and urged I that a progress report should be placed at the disposal of the Government at the earliest possible moment. I shall mention the matter again. NA LEGISLATION.",22
20,Mr JOHN THOMSON,UNIFORM TAXATION,"On 3rd August, I asked the Treasurer if he would lay upon the table the report and recommendations of the conference of Commonwealth and State officers in regard to the adoption of a uniform system of taxation. The Treasurer promised that he. would do"" so. Is he now prepared to fulfil that promise ? /'",22
21,Sir JOHNFORREST,UNIFORM TAXATION,"I am quite prepared to do so, but there is some objection on the part of the Government of Victoria. I am trying to remove the objection, but I have not yet had a reply from the State Government. I will make further inquiries at once. SUPPLY AND TENDER BOARD.",22
22,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,UNIFORM TAXATION,Will the Prime Minister promise that the .matter of establishing a Supply and Tender Board 1 will be considered by the Government during the period over which Parliament will stand adjourned?,22
23,Mr HUGHES,UNIFORM TAXATION,"We seem not to get any "" forrader "" with that proposal. The matter was discussed very generally at a recent meeting of the Cabinet, but no decision was arrived at. The Treasurer has made a proposal that there shall be placed at his disposal a number of officers, whose functions will cover a much wider field than those of his present officers, and it is'thought that if that proposal is adopted the functions of the Supply and Tender Board could be performed by those officers. The matter is receiving careful attention. I hope tp be able to make a atten-. definite announcement shortly. KALGOORL i E - PO RT AUGUST A RAILWAY. OPENING. <",22
24,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,UNIFORM TAXATION,Can the Minister for Works and Railways inform the House when the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway is to be officially opened ?,22
25,Mr WATT,UNIFORM TAXATION,"The railway ""is to be opened by the Governor General, but the date has not yet been decided upon. I am hopeful that the line will .be completed in time to get a share of the eastward traffic in connection with the Melbourne Cup. I am not yet certain whether we shall be able to have the official opening before that time or later. NA SOLDIERS.",22
26,Dr MALONEY,UNFULFILLED PROMISES TO,"In view of the jury caused to recruiting by the breaking of. pledges and promises solemnly given soldiers, will line Prime Minister request the Cabinet to consider the advisability exhibiting a list of dishonour, to be in a permanent place on the walls of post-office in the locality where Che honour occurred, showing the names of all employers who have broken the prowealth's jurisdiction. mises made to their employees when they enlisted that their positions available for them on their return, and the difference between the army pay and the civil salaries made good ?",23
27,Mr HUGHES,UNFULFILLED PROMISES TO,"I quite appreciate the spirit underlying the question, but i power were as limitless as some people seem to imagine it is, and I were to exercise it one-thousandth part as often and severely as I am asked to do, this country would be too'hot for any man to live in. Government. However, I think that any employer breaks the promise he gave .to an employee who has gone to the Front is a most dishonourable man. A man guilty of that sort of action can hardly hope to keep the matter secret. It is not necessary' placard his default on a wall. It will branded in the hearts and minds of his fellow citizens, and the most effective to deal with such a man is to treat) a pariah, and place him outside the pale. NA . MELBOURNE. EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LAW .",23
28,Mr ORCHARD,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"Will Minister state whether the law relating to disturbances such as that witnessed in Melbourne on Wednesday evening is defective, and, if so, whether the Governter ment intend so to' amend it as to enable thom to deal drastically with the principlace pals in any future disturbance 1 .",23
29,Mr HUGHES,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"The Commonwealth to has no law, nor do I think it has ,power to enact a permanent law, dealing with such street disturbances or riots which burst out suddenly, and have for their object, perhaps, the wilful destruction of arrived at? property. I would point out, by way of answer to those who censure the Governable ment for failing to take action, that none of our laws have been broken. Such a disturbance is an offence against the State law. As to that, there is no doubt whatever. It is not an offence against the Commonwealth law. Unless and until a meeting is held within the proscribed area inthere is no breach of the Commonwealth Unlawful Associations Act, or of any reto gulation under the War Precautions Aot. The disturbance in Melbourne last Wedof nesday night was not of the character placed covered by these, but was in the the nature of a general disturbance. While disI regret it extremely I cannot say' that it came within the ambit of the CommonThe State laws are ample to deal with such disturbances would be and should be enforced. INTER-STATE COMMISSION. INQUIBY AS TO COST OF LIVING .",23
30,Mr TUDOR,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"In view of the statef my ment in this morning's newspapers that the Inter-State Commission has adjourned "" nine die,"" I presume that it has concluded its investigations into the question of the cost of living referred to it by the I ask the Prime Minister whowhether he can say when a report will be furnished by the Commission 1",23
31,Mr HUGHES,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"My honourable friend's acquaintance with the classics has been evidently of the slightest description. He to has misunderstood the meaning of "" sine be die."" What has been done involves no vital and permanent departure on the part way of the Commission, but merely a temhim as porary adjournment for an unknown period. When I ' was a member of the old ' Labour party, we sometimes adjourned a meeting upstairs "" sine die "" and within half an hour were back again. the Prime KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA RAILWAY STRIKE. COMPLAINT OF BAD LANGUAGE..",23
32,Mr FINLAY SON,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"I ask the Minisfor Works and Railways whether he has settled the reported strike which took on the East-West railway because of the indecent or vulgar language Baid have been used by one of the gangers! Further, have samples 'of the language reached him. If so, did he consider they were a sufficient excuse for the dispute, and what is the nature of the settlement",23
33,Mr WATT,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"I know that the honormember is interested in bad language, and it is in that spirit that I propose to answer his question. I thought it was improper to suggest that the language alleged to have been used Bhould be telegraphed to me since it might fuse the wires and the Postmaster-General might refuse to transmit it . What really happened was that certain strong language was used by a ganger and certain very offensive language was used in reply.",23
34,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,Can the M in i ster tell us what it wast,24
35,Mr WATT,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"Yes , but I shall not do so, except in camera. I entirely resent the suggestion of one of the newspapers of this city that on the receipt of the official report the Minister should hire an expert to enable him to properly adjudicate on the question. I think most of us are sufficiently expert in that direction.",24
36,Mr TUDOR,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,The honourable member admits that he is ?,24
37,Mr WATT,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"I do. The trouble been settled. The ganger is still in possession, but some of the men who complained have been removed to another quarry, with the result that everything is now going on as merry as a marriage bell. The superintending engineer, reporting in final terms, says in effect that in his judgment, after hearing the evidence, the ganger did not reflect on the legitimacy of any of the men engaged in his gang, nor did he suggest a course of conduct which a navvy would consider in delicate. PROTECTION OF SHIPPING . Australians",24
38,Mr BAMFORD,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"Will the Minister for the Navy state whether it is correct that he was interviewed yesterday by a man who, u n t i l Tuesday last, was working on one of the Commonwealth boats; and that this man informed him that the present system of protecting or guarding ships at the wharfs, and of searching those who go on board, is defective? Did he also ask the Minister to authorize him to make a test as to the effectiveness of the means taken to prevent the introduction of bombs or other dangerous articles on board? If so, has the right honoruble gentleman taken into consideration the seriousness of the statement made by this individual, and will he arrange for the test suggested by liim?",24
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"Evidentl y the gentleman who saw me has also seen my honourable friend. It is quite true that he made some suggestions as to the necessity for tightening up the guard on thewharfs, and more particularly with respect to the searching of persons going on board ship. I promised him I would give the whole matter further consideration.",24
40,Mr FINLAYSON,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"When the Minister for the Navy is inquiring into the danger of workmen and others placing bombs on board ships at our wharfs, will lie make inquiries as to the danger of bombs being included in cargoes submitted for consignment and transport?",24
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,I suggest to honourable members thut this is not tkeplace to investigate a matter of that kind. PRISONERS OF WAR.,24
42,Mr HUGHES,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"On Wednesday last the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr . has Finlayson) asked me a question in regard' to the release of Australian civiliansinterned in Germany, - and I promised to make representations to the British Government for their release. It escaped my notice at the time that the scope of' the agreement between the nations coverssuch cases. An agreement is in force between Great Britain and Germany under which the following classes of civiliansheld as prisoners of war are being repatriated, viz., women and children, males under seventeen years of age, interned"" males over forty-five years of age, and in capacitated or invalid males of any age. are included under the agreement.

43,Mr RILEY,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"H as the Prime Minister received a reply to his representations to the Governor General with regurd to the imprisonment of the old man Montague Miller, who was convicted underthe War Precautions Act in New Soutb. Wales a few days ago, and whose case I recently brought under his notice?",24
44,Mr HUGHES,STREET DISTURBANCE IN,"I Lave not, but as His Excellency has received my recommendation there can bo no objection to my stating that I recommended the release of this man. Mr Miller has friends in Western Australia, and the only condition I made was that they should provide forhis going over there. DISCOVERY OE ALUNITE .

56,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDEBAL AND STATE,"Swan-Trea surer) [11.46] - I move That there be granted to His Majesty for or towards defraying the services of the year 1917-18 a sum not exceeding Â£3,487,200. I should like to.make a few observations for the information of honourable members on 'this Supply Bill and the finances generally, though I have not been able to give much attention to the matter, owing FINANCES: IN- to the Bill having been introduced sooner than was expected. This Bill is to provide for expenditure out of revenue on war services and ordinary services under CRISIS : annual votes for three months. The total amount of the schedule is Â£3,487,200, and omitting refunds ON PICTUBE of revenue, Â£150,000, the total is Â£3,337,200. Supply has already been granted to 30th September of this year, the amount, omitting refunds of revenue and Treasurer's Advance, being Â£3,576,186. Excluding Treasurer's A d -, vance and refunds of revenue, the total provision which - will be made to meet expenditure up to 31st December, 1917, is Â£6,913,386. The total provision, excludingspecial statutory appropriations, in the Estimates for 1917-18 isÂ£ Annual votes, not in cluding war ... 11,059,371 Annual votes-wa r services ... 4,648,151 NA 15,707,522 From this we have to deduct large sums for which no provision is made in Supp!yPOOL: RUST Â£ Interest on transferred properties ... ... 377,670 "" SLOW - DOW N"" Remission of Customs duties on cornsacks, &c. ... ... 200,000 AND STATE Repatriation of soldiers 1,000,000 1,577,670 Tbis leaves a balance of Â£14,129,852. I do not wish to say that these figures will be absolutely realized, because expenditure and revenue are not uniform throughout the year. One-half of this balance is Â£7,064*976, and it will thus be seen that tihe provision for expenditure for the first six months of the year in the two Supply Bills, namely, Â£6,913,386, is' less than one-half of the amount included in the Estimates for the current yeai. No provision is made in the Bill for any service which has not previously been approved by Parliament. W it h regard to salaries, provision is made. for increases which are automatic under the Public Service Act, or due under Arbitration Oourt awards. No increases of salaries in the higher divisions will be paid until the Estimates are passed by Parliament. I now desire to place before the Committee the actual transactions for the two months ended 31st August last, as compared with the same period of the previous year. These transactions are disclosed in the following table:Receipts for July and AugustCustoms and Excise 2,912,460 .. 2,487,233 Post Office .. 860,234 .. Other receipts ... 660,520 .. 860,414 case.

61,Mr FALKINER,PROPOSED NE W,I am referring to the civil expenditure.,27
62,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROPOSED NE W,"I have submitted the figures, and I shall be obliged if honourable members' will allow - me to finish my remarks, when I may bo able to afford them any further information they may desire. It must be remembered that practically all the revenue from direct taxation is received in the later months of the year. The decrease of Â£47,897 in the revenue of the current year is made up of a decrease in the Customs and Excise revenue' of Â£425,227, less sundry increases under other heads .of revenue totalling Â£377,330. The decrease under Customs and Excise revenue is a very serious one, KEVBNUB. and it would have been worse but that we received a good deal more in July than we might have expected. Possibly, ex1916-17. 1917-18. pected allerations in the Tariff induced a Â£ Â£ larger withdrawal of goods from the Cus928,670 toms than might otherwise have been the Pending the passing of the Loan Bill for works, the expenditure on works provided in the Bill has been defrayed from .. 4,285,317 Treasurer's Advance. The foregoing statement of expenditure EXPENDITURE. will, I think, be found a ITUO comparison of the expenditure of the two months ol - each year. The increase in the expendi361,143 ture for the two months of the current year is Â£136,8.63. The increase in the expenditure for war pensions is Â£217,000, and a further Â£122,000 is accounted for by the increase of 2s. 6d. in the weekly rate for old-age pensions. These two items alone account for an increase of Â£339,000. As X said just now, it is not claimed is that' the experience of only two months a of the year is necessarily an indication of the transactions of the whole of the year. I hope, however, that honourable members will take the figures as an indication that every effort will be made, notwithstandthe statutory increases of exthe - penditure over last year on the Estimates, amounting to Â£909,656-a n immense. amount-to keepthe expenditure within bounds. ' It is very . difficult to speak with any great confidence regarding .the Customs and Excise revenue. As honourable members will realise, the absence of shipping has a very depressing effect. Last year, i h July, the revenue was Â£1,365,386, and in July of this year it was Â£1,628,169. In AuguBt,. 1916, the revenue was Â£1,547,074, and in August, 1917, it was Â£859,064, showing a decrease on the two months of Â£426,227. The expenditure from the War Loan Fund in July and 'August of this year - was Â£10,285,930, as compared with an expenditure of Â£7,283,713 for the corresponding, period of the previous financial year, an increase of Â£3,002,217. This increaso is wholly made up of a .payment to the British Government for the maintenance of Australian troops in Prance. No corresponding payment was made in the two months of the previous year. Honourable members may recollect 'that there was some controversy between ithe State Governments the Commonwealth Treasury ference to advances to be made by the Commonwealth to the States. agreement had been entered into with all the States except New South Wales by which the Commonwealth undertook provide them with so much money, and they agreed not to borrow in Under that arrangement the Commonwealth was to provide for the year 19.17, but that posal was afterwards modified, the Commonwealth undertook vide Â£5,400,000. When I came into office I thought that as the had already been modified there should be a still further modification, . that the war was lasting .longer than was anticipated and that the difficulties of '.financing . had considerably The States had previously undertaken repay to the Commonwealth Â£18,000,000 which was advanced to thom out of the Australian Notes Fund soon after the war broke out, in which arrangement New South .Wales participated Queensland did not, and as some of the bonds that the States gave were falling due, I thought that the Commonwealth might be able to set the one thing against the other, the money that we had agreed to advance to the States under the later agreement against the money that the Sir John Forrett. States had previously .agreed to repay toi the Commonwealth'.' But the proposal did not meet with the wishes of the States. They expected us to keep; to ourundertaking, but they, did not care about keeping to theirs. They advanced all: sorts of pleas,. which, if correct,, would have put the Commonwealth. Government in a very unenviableposition. They claimed that they had not undertaken to repay the Â£18,000,000* until after the war, and that the money made had - been borrowed from the Imperial Government and that, as the Commonwealth were no'b obliged to. repay it, they should not be asked to repay what was-advanced to them. For these statements, there was no foundation, because the Â£18,000,000 was borrowed from the Australian Notes Fund and the States gave bonds which were to be met in two years. When the period of two years had expired a further extension for 'another year was given. However, I have not the slightest doubt that the States did not expect the war to last so long when recently they entered into the first agreement > and but though that may be the case, it in re- does not decrease the difficulty encountered by the Commonwealth GovernAn ment in finding money for ithe States, or the difficulty in which the CommonwealthTreasury is placed by the fact that theto money advanced to the States is not being repaid.

What will be done next year bas yet to be determined. Seeing that we propose to pay tbem up in full I hopo but that some mutually satisfactory arrangement will be made. The Commonwealth Government have been able to do a great deal of good in connection with the unnsual circumstances brought a'bout by the waT, by taking an active part in connection ""with the disposal of the great products of Australia and the - financing of the producers of wheat, wool, sugar, butter, cheese, and hops, and the - exportation of metals, rabbits, and rabbit skins. Pools have been created in regard to wheat and wool. They have cost.the Commonwealth nothing as yet, but there is always the liability to loss in the event not being possible to ship our produce. If we do not sell and receive payment before shipping some one has to' find the money, .and the only Government in Australia - that is capable of giving a guarantee to find the money for this purpose is the ""Commonwealth Government. The other day we had to come to the assistance of the producers of butter and cheese, because ihcy were unable to ship their produce. If shipping were available the producers - could receive payment for their produce - as soon as it is on board ship, but when it is not available, and the produce has to he put into cold storage here, something must be done to finance the producers. It is in this way that the Commonwealth Government have had to come to the assistance of the producers of butter' and - cheese. We are financing them until they - can ship their produce. I hope that it will not be long before shipping will be - available, so that our liability on this account will not be very great. posal is to advance Is. per lb. on butter in - cold storage, and 7d. per lb. on cheese. The produce is ours until we are repaid. A big business is being done in rabbits and rabbit skins, but the banks are financing that arrangement with the assistance of the Commonwealth Government. Honourable members must always keep in mind the difficulty of shipping our produce. If that difficulty is increased, it will be sary to find money for our produce before we receive payment for it from overseas. Hitherto the banks have been in a position to make the necessary advances, because there has not been a very long interval before shipment or between the date of the advance to the producer and - the date of payment from overseas. If that interval is extended, money will be necessary to carry our producers oyer that. longer interval, and the only authority which has any money in Australia is the Commonwealth Government. All these - commodities that I have named are being 'looked after by the Commonwealth Government, and I have no doubt that the list will extend very soon. The revenue has been depleted to the extent of Â£200j000 this year by the remission of the duty formerly received on corn(sacks. I am glad to say that hitherto we haye been able to make all the necessary financial arrangements with the Commonof its wealth Bank and the Associated Banks generally. They have been most willing and anxious to do everything they possibly could to assist us in this matter,"" and have made the Commonwealth Treasurer's difficulties very much less than they ""would otherwise have been..",27
63,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROPOSED NE W,Can the Treasurer give us the total of the list of advances made to industries?,29
64,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROPOSED NE W,"The Commonwealth Government have not made many 'advances. The industries have been helped mostly by the banks - In a few cases the Commonwealth Government have guaranteed a few advances for a limited time, but, generally speaking, almost all of the guarantees have been obliterated by the shipment' of our produce in response to purchases from abroad. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth Government stands behind the banks in this matter.",29
65,Mr FALKINER,PROPOSED NE W,Can the Treasurer tell Our pro- us* what share the Commonwealth Bank has had in these advances?,29

68,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROPOSED NE W,"The honourable member knows that I am not in the secrets of the Commonwealth Bank. So far as I can see from the quarterly statenecesments that are published, and which the honourable member can peruse just as well as I can, the Bank is doing its best, together with the other banks, in financing all these transactions. In fact, it is taking a leading part in doing so.",29
69,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROPOSED NE W,What proportion of the guarantees does the Commonwealth Bank bear?,29

79,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,That is defence expenditure. What about the Arsenal?,30
80,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROPOSED NE W,"Why has one not the Government the courage to say where the Arsenal should be put, and thus prevent many months' delay? It is proposed to create a hew Minister, with a salary of Â£1,650 a year. Tears ago, when the work was very hard, we got along with seven Ministers. Then the number was raised to eight, a Minister for the Navy being appointed at a salary of Â£1,650. Now we are to have still another Minister.",30
81,Sir JOHN EOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,"There is no provision for that in this Bill. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - No doubt this Bill makes provision for expenditure in connection with the' proposal.

We have been passing taxation measures which the Government say they cannot enforce, and which will greatly inconvenience the people. From such measure a yield of Â£500,000 is estimated, but more than that is being spent extravagantly. The Postal Department was never in so rotten a condition as it is in now. There is dissatisfaction everywhere. Conveniences are being taken away; the public was never so badly served, or charged so much. They.talk about making savings by giving isolated districts one mail instead of three mails a week, and by closing country tejephone bureaux at 6 p.m. in places where the convenient hours for business are between 6 and 8 p.m.",30
86,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,What about expenditure at Canberra?,31
87,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROPOSED NE W,"There is no expenditure there. Were the Federal Capital in Western Australia, it would be different. Two Ministers are quarrelling and nothing is being done at Canberra. Last month the recommendation was made that a number of returned soldiers should be employed in the public nurseries at Canberra, but some of our public servants have since put in their word against the opinion of the experts, and the men have been taken away. Why cannot these be employed at Canberra, which is a healthier place than Cockburn Sound, and some of the other places where, money is being expended 1",31

Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - There is 1 a statement .in this morning's paper about a Committee of Inquiry being appointed in connection with one of the purchases. Too little care is exercised by the Government in regard to the proposals for the expenditure of huge sums.

108,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,"Hunter) [18.85] The Treasurer is asking for Supply to last him till the end of this year. Once .again I enter my protest against the practice of constantly coming to Parliament for Supply without affording honourable .'members an opportunity of dealing with ;the Estimates. When we meet again, (probably in the middle of November at - the earliest, after sitting for a couple of - weeks we shall be asked to pass another Supply Bill, and, early in the New Year, yet another one. The result, of this system is to undermine parliamentary control of the finances. Instead of Parliament dealing with the Estimates before - the money is expended, the whole of the money is spent before Parliament has a ichance of sanctioning expenditure. No - one will contend that that is a sound system of parliamentary government. No - doubt the Treasurer thinks that he is justi-fied in asking for Supply from time to time> but to me it is strange that this House, after sitting only a couple of - months, should be working now at breakneck speed to pass certain legislation and - grant Supply, in order that we may adjourn for a month or two. I do not wonder that the health of honourable members is impaired when, as happened yesterday, we commence our sitting at eleveno'clock in the morning and continue until after midnight. Such prolonged sittings must have a detrimental, effect on the health of those honourable members who give close attention to their business, and also attend to their correspondence. The practice of which I complain is not peculiar to the present Government. It was adopted by Governments of which I have been a supporter, and I objected to it then. I can understand that there are difficulties in dealing with the Defence expenditure, but there is no genuine reason why, even in time of war, we should not deal with the ordinary departmental Estimates. The Treasurer made a good commencement by delivering his financial statement early in is the financial year, and I was hopeful that the consideration of the Estimates would follow soon afterwards. It is useless to say that Parliament has contrql of the public purse when the money is actually expended before honourable members are asked to sanction it . What power have we in dealing with the Estimates when the money has been spent and the works have been completed? Parliament is asked only to endorse what has been done. Probably, had we had an opportunity of discussing the Estimates in reasonable time, some alterations would have been made. But, not having that opportunity, we are committing the country to expenditure to which, perhaps, we would not have agreed.",32
109,Mr WATT,PROPOSED NE W,This system of frequent Supply Bills gives many more opportunities to honourable members to state their views than wduld the system the honourable member advocates. ' ,32
110,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,"Whils t this system gives us more opportunities to voice our grievances, a great deal of the time of Parliament and the country is occupied in the consideration of Supply Bills when Supply for the whole year could be granted at one time.",32
111,Mr WATT,PROPOSED NE W,That has never been done in any Parliament.,32
112,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,The proper time' to deal with the Estimates is not later than October or November. Only in recent years have we departed from that practice. .|,32
113,Mr EICHAED FOSTEB,PROPOSED NE W,Does the honourable member wish to give more than three months' Supply to the Government when Parliament is sitting?,33
114,Mr CHAELTON,PROPOSED NE W,My desire is that the Estimates shall be dealt with early in the financial year.,33
115,Mr WATT,PROPOSED NE W,The sanctioning of the Estimates would have to be followed by Supply Bills.,33
116,Mr CHAELTON,PROPOSED NE W,I . admit that; but my complaint is that at present we have no opportunity to effectively deal with the Estimates.,33
117,Mr WATT,PROPOSED NE W,"This procedure may not be advisable, but it gives more opportunity for discussion than 'would the system which the honourable member suggests.",33
118,Mr CHAELTON,PROPOSED NE W,"In the interests of the House and the country, we should be better off with fewer opportunities..",33
119,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,The honourable member would not give us an appropriation to last t ill the end of the financial year.,33
120,Mr CHAELTON,PROPOSED NE W,"The Treasurer knows that a great deal of time is occupied in the discussion - of Supply Bills. That means extra printing and extra cost in the running of the parliamentary establishment, and honourable, members are often detained longer than they otherwise would be. Sir, JOHN FOEBEST - We must have temporary Supply Bills.",33
121,Mr CHAELTON,PROPOSED NE W,"I admit that. But we cannot be expected to agree to Supply Bill after Supply Bil l before we have considered r,he Estimates.",33
122,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,The . honourable member would not advocate giving the Government appropriation for the whole financial year?,33
123,Mr CHAELTON,PROPOSED NE W,"No . However, I have entered my protest. I wish to make a brief reference to the industrial trouble. I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister say that there is a possibility of a conference taking place between the coal miners and the employers During the last few days, I have been much disturbed in mind because no move in that direction has been made by the Government of New South Wales. A conference having been arranged, my remarks will be such as not to interfere in any way with it. This industrial dispute is essentially a Commonwealth matter. It has public press: extended beyond one State, and I am at a loss to understand why the Commonwealth Government have not intervened. - Sir WILLIAM IRVINE - Every great in dustrial disturbance is a Commonwealth matter in time of war.",33
124,Mr CHAELTON,PROPOSED NE W,"Quite so. From Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australia, and Queensland, appeals are reaching the Commonwealth Government in regard to the stoppage of supplies, and they plainly show that, on account of the in dustrial trouble, the Commonwealth is suffering considerable loss. Yet, no genuine effort has been made by the Government of New South Wales to settle the dispute. I can say, with authority, that had a conference met on Thursday or Friday last, as I anticipated, and had the Government been reasonable, every colliery in New South Wales would have been producing coal on Monday.",33
125,Mr BAMFORD,PROPOSED NE W,"What does the honourable member mean by "" reasonable "" ?",33
126,Mr CHAELTON,PROPOSED NE W,"I shall explain. The original strike is over, and the railway men, having agreed to the Government's terms, are back at work. The coal miners, who struck merely out of sympathy with the railway and tramway employees, are quite prepared to return to work, and they are not asking, as has been said, that certain unreasonable things shall take place. Some honourable - members > have said that the coal miners do not desire to pay any penalty. They are paying a very heavy penalty. They have lost the best industrial tribunal that has ever been in existence in the Commonwealth, namely, the Coal Board, and I admit that, in that respect, the Prime Minister treated the coal miners very fairly. The loss of that tribunal is a heavy penalty, which the miners have paid for their action dn stopping work. I am not going to utter a word th,at would interfere with the conference, but, in fairness to a man who is standing his trial, there is one matter with which I must deal. It has been argued that this strike was premeditated - that the men had decided upon a general stoppage of work in order to show their disapproval of the action of the Government. Let me say at once that I . do not think there is any foundation in fact for that statement.",33
127,Mr JH CATTS,PROPOSED NE W,There is none.,33
128,Mr COBSEB,PROPOSED NE W,It has appeared in the,33
129,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,"As onÂ© who has been in close touch with the coal miners, I am absolutely positive that there was no intention of any strike on the part of the coal miners. What happened was this: I was approached by the leaders of the men in regard to the large quantities of coal that were being accumulated, and was asked to see the Prime Minister with respect to it . It was quite unusual to have such a large quantity of coal lying at grass. Coal, as every one knows, is liable to spontaneous combustion, and, in justice to the men, I must say that they were uneasy about the matter. I saw the Prime Minister, and he informed me of the purpose for which this coal was required. I then met the leaders of the men, and when I informed them of what the Prime Minister had said, they replied at once, "" If that is the case, we shall do all we can to see that there is no disturbance in the industry* We shall do our best to keep the men at work."" They carried resolutions to that effect, and I have in this House copies of those resolutions. They wanted to keep the wheels of in dustry going. Mr J. H. CATTS - That was before the present trouble 1",34
130,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,"Yes . One of those men is on trial today, and I make this statement in justice to him. Many, perhaps, have been biased against the men because of the belief that the strike was premeditated. As a matter of fact, at the time to which I refer there was not a man in Newcastle who thought of striking.",34
131,Mr WATT,PROPOSED NE W,"Were there, not at this time a series of strikes, which interfered with the production of coal?",34
132,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,"I was coming to that point. It has been urged that even after the appointment of the Coal T r i bunal, for which the Prime Minister arranged, there were a series of strikes, and that the miners from time to time ceased work. The average man, who is not con- vers,ant with coal mining might naturally come to the conclusion, on reading the re-' ports that appear in the press from time to - time with respect to disputes in the industry, that there was a multiplication of strikes in connection with it , and that these were carefully organized. As a fact, the executive officers of the Coal Miners Federation have endeavoured again and again to prevent such disputes, and such as have occurred have not amounted to strikes in the sense in which we understand the term. Dozens of these disputes occur in a way that I shall illustrate. The miners employedat the Burwood colliery, for instance, have to travel by train five or six miles to reach the mine. On reach : ing the p it some morning they find perhaps that the wheelers, because of some dispute, are not prepared to go down that day. The wheelers probably are not members of the MinersFederation, but the result of their stand is that no men are available to wheel the coal, and the miners themselves cannot work. Such an experience is a hardship to thei miners, since they have to walk all the way back to their homes, a distance of at least five miles. Such an incident would be described in the newspapers as a strike. It is promptly settled, but next day there may be trouble with the top-men, and again, the miners have to return home, and lose a day's work. A day or two later, perhaps .the clippers-the ! boys who are putting the ropes on the skipsdecide to go home for the. day, and once again there is no work for the miners. .Each of these incidents would be reported in tha press as a strike in the coal mining industry, and that is how the so-called strikes are multiplied. Since the last stoppage of work, when the Prime Minister intervened, the miners have been supplying coal far in excess of the requirements of tha Commonwealth, and this notwithstanding the allegations that) during the time tlhey have been striking again and again. Ifc is admitted by the State Government that we have in New South Wales today 300,000 tons of coal lying afc grass. Such a thing was never before known in the coal fcr,ade of New South Wales, Thafc coal has been cut by the minors in a short space of time, while, in addition, the demands of the Commonwealth have been supplied and provision made for what little export trade there is. All this coal hjas been won by the miners of Newcastle and other parts of New South Wales during the very period in which we are told thera have been so many strikes.",34
133,Mr FLEMING,PROPOSED NE W,It has accumulated because our export trade has been cut off.,34
134,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,"That is not the reason. The miners have been supplying the requirements of the Commonwealth, and those of the small export trade now open to us, while, in addition, they have 200,000 tons of coal at grass in ithe Newcastle district and 100,000 tons afc grass in other parts of the State. How can ib be said, then, that the coal miners have done anything to interfere with the progress of the' Commonwealth ?",34
135,Mr CORSER,PROPOSED NE W,What has the honourable member to say regarding the steam-ships that have been held up because of their inability to obtain coal supplies? - Mr Charlton - There has been no slackness so far as coal is concerned. There has been coal for every one.,35
136,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROPOSED NE W,"The honourable member is not speaking fairly when he makes that statement. He knows that steamers have been ,held up lately because of the inability to secure coal for them.",35
137,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,"The honourable member is not-fair to me in making that interjection. I was clearly speaking, not of the present moment, but of what had been done >by the miners at a time when, it has been said, there was a multiplication of strikes in the industry, and when it is also said a general stoppage was premeditated. I was explaining that the So-called strikes were only small disputes that were quickly readjusted, and that after the appointment of a coal tribunal a large quantity of coal had been won and wasnow lying at grass. That is a fair statement, and the honourable member's interjection was not at all pertinent to the point with which I was dealing. Every one knows that at the present moment the whole of our shipping is held up. I do not deny that, nor have I ever done so; but no one is more anxious than I am to bring about a settlement of the trouble in the interests of the Commonwealth and the successful prosecution of the war.",35
138,Mr CORSER,PROPOSED NE W,Why . do not the leaders allow the men to have a secret ballot ?,35
139,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,"We have passed the stage at which any good would result from a discussion of the merits of the dispute, because the men have agreed to return to work on the terms laid down by the Government. We have to deal with the immediate ^present. The question is whether the Commonwealth is suffering in consequence of the strike. The coal miners are prepared to go back and cut coal as before, notwithstanding that they have lost their tribunal; and we should ask ourselves whether we cannot do something to settle the strike. I believe we can. I believe that, with a little reason on both sides, we could settle it thisi week-end so that on Monday next coal would be drawn from every colliery.",35
140,Mr CORSER,PROPOSED NE W,Would that settle the seamen's strike?,35
141,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,Yes . Once the coal miners' trouble is settled the industries of Australia as a whole will go on as before.,35
142,Mr RICHARD EOSTEE,PROPOSED NE W,"The honourable"" member is making out a strong case for amending legislation.",35
143,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,"I am speaking of the facts as they are. There is no escape from the position, as I put it , that if the State Government fails to bring about a settlement of the trouble, then the Commonwealth, which is the paramount power, should intervene and endeavuor to settle it in the interests of Australia as a whole. ,",35
144,Mr BAMFORD,PROPOSED NE W,Is it now a question of volunteer labour?,35
145,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,No .,35
146,Mr BLAKELEY,PROPOSED NE W,We will deal with them later on.,35
147,Mr WATT,PROPOSED NE W,We shall see about that. :,35
148,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,"In regard to the point just raised, let me say that last week only a few of these volunteers were > working in the Newcastle district, and most of them had left their ordinary occupations. At the Catherine Hill Bay mine, where there are 200 volunteers, not more than 50 would desire to remain. That would be no obstacle to the settlement. Since then large numbers have . gone into the mines. .Therein lies the danger of delay. The larger the number 1 of these men employed the more difficult a settlement will be. It would be better to settle the matter this week-end than to allow it to continue any longer. At pre- . sent there is no difficulty at all in regard to the aspect of the question raised by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr . Bamford). I believe the Government will findthe men amenable to reason. They wish to go back to work. They have no dispute with their employers, and now that the railway strike is over, why should this struggle continue? Wise counsels should prevail.",35
149,Mr WATT,PROPOSED NE W,But what about the i nterjection of the honourable member for Darling as to dealing with the volunteers later on ? 1,35
150,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,I did not hear it . My sole desire is to settle this strike.,35
151,Mr ARCHIBALD,PROPOSED NE W,Every one believes that.,35
152,Mr CHARLTON,PROPOSED NE W,"For many years I have been doing my utmost to prevent such troubles, and to settle them when they have occurred. I believe l it t l e reasonableness on the part of sides would secure an immediate settledecreasing, ment. If the State Government will meet the men and do the fair thing, surely it is my duty, as the representative of the men, to plead with the Commonwheat, wealth to intervene, more especially this industrial trouble affects not only South Wales, but every part of the Comdo, monwealth. If New South Wales is able to get sufficient coal to carry will have an advantage over the other States. It will 'be impossible the coal in the other parts of the Commonwealth, since there are no ships to carry it there. It is therefore essential, if the State Government will not settle the matter, that the Commonwealth should take control; and try to bring about a satisfactory termination of the dispute in the interests of the successful prosecution of the war, and the.true fare of Australia.",35

154,Mr WATT,PROPOSED NE W,That is what he is doing.,36

The Commonwealth Bank is not financing anything; but, with the aid of the present Government and past A d ministrations, it has been securing thebenefit of all the exchanges and picking up other little perquisites. The Treasurer has given us no indication as to where thewelmoney we shall require is to be found.

A f t e r all, the RepatriationB ill is only a rough outline of the scheme, The Minister for Works and and makes no pretence to deal with the 1 financial liabilities that will be incurred. These liabilities, in my opinion, will not mean Â£20,000,000 or Â£30,000,000, but,, possibly, Â£100,000,000, exclusive of the y , I cost of lands which the States have to acquire. I dp not agree with all that might bo inferred from the remarks of the honand orable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr . Chapman) on repatriation. I know that he is of my opinion that Senator Millen, personally, is the most fitted of any one on either side for the position of Minister of - Repatriation; and, .therefore, I am pleased understand that he is to have the appointment. I suggest, however, that, asan evidence of the bona fides of the Minisl , try, the salary for the position' should be made up out of the present Ministerial' salaries. So far as the supporters of the honGovernment are concerned, we as yet see no sign of any decrease in tha expenditure - of any decrease such as that which must inevitably be made in the'near future. The electors of Australia, or some of them, at any rate, will live to regret that they supported the Labour party when it exploited our credit in the shape of the note issue, and did nothing with the money but spend it on day labour in times of peace and prosperity. There is nothing now to show for that expenditure, which would have paid the wheat-growers of Australia for two years' crop, besides meeting the claims of those engaged in the butter industry. The expenditure has risen .Â£25,300,000 in 1913-14 to Â£130,000,000 in this nnancial year. Tho latter period, of course, includes war expenditure, to which no exception can be taken.",36
164,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROPOSED NE W,The war expenditure is the principal reason for the i crease.,37
165,Mr FALKINER,PROPOSED NE W,"E very year, apart from war expenditure-and no matter which party is in power-the civil expenreturns diture increases regularly by Â£2,000,000 or Â£3,000,000. Sir. JOHNFOBBEST - I do not think that is so. Give us the figures.",37

There are people who are paying 6s. 3d. in the Â£ if come tax alone, besides the land tax; yet it is said by authorities like the orable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) that taxation in Australia does not equal that of England. A man who has the misfortune to be a land-owner, and has to pay land tax to the extent of 9d. in the Â£ 1 on any extent of unimproved value, tolerate it . knows that taxation in Australia today is heavier than it is in England-that it reaches to 45 per cent, of the income.",37

169,Mr JH CATTS,PROPOSED NE W,The honourable member could not take his land away with him.,37
170,Mr FALKINER,PROPOSED NE W,"That iB so, but land, without money to stock and utilize it , and brains to work it , is no good; we cannot live on grass, not even ths. members of the Australian Workers Union. The Commonwealth indebtedness today is Â£239,000,000, and that of the States from Â£377,000,000, u total of Â£616,000,000; while the note issue of Â£49,000,000 shows an excess of at least Â£30,000,000 more notes than are required, i which one day will have to be liquidated. . In the face of these facts, the Government put their n - supporters in the position of having to protest against an absence of economy. Before I sit down, I should like to suggest 'that the probate and income tax ought to be uniform. If reform in this respect were carried out, we should require practically only 'one Department. The Federal Department was created by - the official Labour party, wno desired that more people Bhould be dependent on them for their billets; and it is time that this I sort of thing was put an end to.

It is admitted by the financiers of this country that it is a good thing for Australia that we have such an issue at the present time, for without it there is no doubt that chaos would have reigned in the banks of Australia, whereas by' its means we have been considerably helped in the financing of the war and in other ways.",37
173,Sir WILLIAMIKVINB,PROPOSED NE W,That is a pretty broad statemontl,38
174,Mr FALKINER,PROPOSED NE W,"It has all been used to finance day labour, and nothing else.",38
175,Mr WATKINS,PROPOSED NE W,"I am supported in my position by the Treasurer, who' has told us that the note issue has benefited the country to the extent of no less than Â£30,000,000. I should like now to refer to the industrial trouble that has paralyzed the country during the last few months, with a view to suggesting Federal action if the State Government will not confer with the men. I do not propose lo go into the past history of the struggle; the fact remains that the railway employees bave agreed to return to work, and it only requires an arrangement to be made with the Coal-miners Federation. in order to end the strike. Whatever may have been the reasons of the miners for joining the other unionists, I wish honourable members to understand that all attempts at Government assistance with volunteer labour in the mines will not break the Miners Federation of Australia. Whatever may be said to the contrary,, the placing of inexperienced men in some of the Maitland mines is trifling with life. Not very long ago in the mine adjoining that which the Victorian Government have taken over there was a fire and explosion, which resulted in the loss of five iives. ",38
176,Mr WATKINS,PROPOSED NE W,"In the mine adjoining the Felaw Main mine; and it is exactly the same ground with only a barrier pillar between. The two mines work a similar measure at a similar depth, and if one mine is subject to fire, so is the other I Bay nothing about the equipment of the mines, but merely refer to their natural conditions, and I am sure that the owners in the Maitland field will not welcome inexperienced labour. practically very little difference between the miners' executive ancl the Government of New South Wales, and when we reflect that that difference might be Bettled in conference in half an hour, it is appalling that there should be any hesitation in this regard. As I say, I do not desire to refer to the past, but I must remind honourable members that in this dispute we have not to ""deal with the Industrial Workers of the World, or with extremists. If the men do break the law, the law will punish them. But it is quite a different thing for a Government to step in and "" put the boot in "" on men who are the unhappy victims in the present unfortunate struggle.",38
177,Mr RILEY,PROPOSED NE W,They will not be able to do that too often with the - miners.,38
178,Mr WATKINS,PROPOSED NE W,"-No . I was pointing out that it is a thing that may recoil upon the Government if they go too far in that direction. The books of the miners' unions show that prior to the Militar y Sorviee Referendum, one out of every five had volunteered to go to the Front. - Mr FLEMING - The miners have done very well in the matter of recruiting.",38
179,Mr WATKINS,PROPOSED NE W,"Since that referendum the Recruiting Committee - has given the district two flags for having secured the most recruits of any district in the State, one flag being for the recruits for the Sportsmen's Battalion, and the other being for recruits generally. Yet we are led to believe that these men are not loyal, and will do nothing to assist towards winning the war. If the Government of New South Wales take no action to'wards settling this dispute, then the Commonwealth Government would be wise, if it is anxious to carry out its policy of winning the war, to take steps towards getting these men ito return to work, in order to produce the coal that is necessary for the prosecution of the war and the carrying on of the industries of the country. One could say many things in respect to this unfortunato trouble, but perhaps they are better left unsaid from the point of view of both parties to the dispute. Much could :be said in reapect to what the intention of the State Governments may be, but there is no need for recriminations at this juncture, or for re-opening ihe sores that have been occaThere is sioned by this unfortunate dispute. It is fair, however, to claim that there should be a settlement of the dispute on a basis which is f a ir both to employers and to employees. We are not dealing with a foreign element in dealing with the large bodies of men who were working in these , mines, and they will not be frightened by a few outsiders being placed here and there in the mines. We are dealing with Britishers, and the fathers of boys who are fighting in the trenches, and. they should be treated - as Britishers and loyalists and in a way. which is honourable to both parties.

So far the Commonwealth Government have not intervened in this dispute, and perhaps they have been right in adopting that attitude, but when we know that the transports are being hung up for want of coal, surely it is their duty to take action with a view to having the coal"" supply restored. I hope that action will be taken to secure fair treatment for can be these men, that they will be able to ret u r n to their work as they came out, and that this trouble will be ended for all time. I wish to say a word or two now in regard to the loan expenditure set out in the schedule to the Loan Bill . The M in ister for Works and Railways proposes to refer to the Public Works Committee for inquiry certain expenditure on the F l i nders Naval Base and the Cockburn Sound Naval Base. Not a penny is provided in the Estimates or in the Loan B i U for the most important naval base in Australia, that which lies next door to the coal fields of this country. I am not objecting to the expenditure on the other is Naval Bases, but I assert that this base, not be neglected.

212,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"Flinders) [2.50] - The request for three months' Supply to enable'the House to adjourn for a considerable period is one which under normal conditions would rightly arouse a good deal of criticism, but, I think, it is , justified by the circumstances. My own k regret is that the Government has not taken honourable members into its confidence by giving fuller reasons for the course proposed. I think that the adjournment is justified, because certain momentous matters with which Parliament must deal are becoming imminent, and it is manifest to all who have had much parliamentary' experience that if well-considered and matured plans are to be placed before us, the Government must have an opportunity of preparing them in an interval when Parliament is not sitting. The will of the country was never expressed more clearly and emphatically than on 5th May last. Its mandate then related to three principal matters. First, there was a trust reposed .in us to see that Australia's part in the war should be continued, and that our fighting forces should be maintained at their full strength.' The second matter is of not much less importance, being indissolubly connected with Australia's part in the war; it was that we should set our financial house in order. The third was that we should endeavour to introduce order into the industrial chaos that hasprevailed. I agree with the criticism from both sides that we have been compelled to pass Supply without an opportunity to discuss the general policy for which the money is asked. In postponing the debate on the Estimates to a late period of the session the Treasurer is only following a practice which has been adopted in every Parliament with which I have been connected, here and in the State, though the right honourable gentleman made his financial; statement at an earlier period of the session than is usual. For that I feel thankf ul to him. To postpone the general discussion of the financial position for seven or eight weeks is a course that requiresjustifying, and, in my opinion, it is justified by the necessity, which all reasonablemembers will admit, of giving the Government the fullest opportunity tomature for submission to Parliament proposals relating to' the matters which I have mentioned.",41
213,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,On Supply it isopen to an honourable member to discuss the financial position.,41
214,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"I do not wish to be drawn aside from the main purpose of my speech. I have said that I did not blame the Treasurer, and that, the course that he has pursued wii-h regard to the - Estimates is sanctioned' by practice and experience. But it is essential that we should have a full discussion of the financial position before the session closes. The postponement of this discussion is justified only by the real and urgent necessity for allowing Ministers to* deal with matters of imminent public importance. With regard to the first - of these I do not propose to say anything that will in the slightest degree embarrass the Government. We know the pledge on which. Ministers were elected, and to which they have adhered. I take it that an opportunity was to be given to the voluntary system to meet the necessities of the case. About that I have only to say that the reduced estimate of the number needed to> maintain our divisions at the Front, namely, 7,000 a month, or less, than one-half of the estimate of the Imperial Government, which was probably too high,, cannot be realized now by the voluntary system. When, a few weeks ago, an exceptional effort was made to secure volun-. teers, the recruits offering rose to about 5,000 per month, but the number has since dwindled to between 2.000 and 3,000, and does not appear likely to in crease. It must be apparent to everyone that the action which Australia must taketo maintain her,forces at the Front demands the immediate and earnest attention of the Government and of Parliament. Further than that I shall not go to-day. I hope that when the Government has an opportunity to devote ita-' whole attention to these matters, Ministers will evolve some definite proposal to which they will ask Parliament to assent. I wish now to say a few words-and at this stage I do not intend to anticipate the ultimate discussion on the Budgetregarding the financial position of the country. Let me prelude my remarks by saying that in this Parliament we are, under present conditions, concerned with not merely the - expenses of - the Federal Government, but also the finances of the whole continent. I am now not harking back to the theory which I put forward on more than one occasion some years ago, that we should have constitutional control of the whole borrowing and taxing authority ; the time for considering that will come later. The circumstances of the war have given us financial control without an alteration of the Constitution.",41
215,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,The honourable and learned member did not always advocate Federal control of thefinancesof the whole of Australia.,42
216,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,I have ful done so consistently for the past six or seven years. Sir ' JOHN FOEBEST - The honourable member was on the other side once.,42
217,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"When I was Premier of Victoria, I fought for the State as hard"" as the honourable member fights for the Commonwealth. But I do not know that that fact is to be debited to my charge, as evidence that I am not sincere in the views I now express. I am not now advocating a referendum, in time of war for an amendment of the Constitution ; I say that the expense of this war and the circumstances in which we now find ourselves have practically given us control e f and placed upon us a responr sibility with regard to, the whole financial position, not merely of the Commonwealth, but also of the States. The circumstances which the Treasurer has related to us mean that we arefinancingthe States with a greater or less hope of being repaid. We are enabling them to carry on tiheir ordinary works and functions, but whether we shall ""ever be repaid in full is a matter in regard to which I should not like to adopt the role of prophet. If the Treasurer were to adopt that role, his prophesies would be rather in the nature of the gloomy anticipations of Jeremiah. The fact that we are, through our credit, financing the States places upon us a responsibility with regard to both their ordinary expenditure and their expenditure on public works. I remember that not long ago a very important argument with regard to fixing the price of bread took place in the Supreme Court, and in the course of it, by way of illustration, the Chief Justice, presenting the view for the Commonwealth as against the argument of counsel who was opposing the Commonwealth powers, put this question"" Would you'venture to say that in time of war, when the whole existence of the community is at stake, there is any limit to the power of the National Government for the conservation of the financial resources of the country ? "" The opinion of His Honour was clearly expressed in the form of a question, and with great respect I entirely concur in his view. No matter what the constitutional limitations may be, one of the most essential, if not the most essential measure for the defence of the Commonwealth, is the maintenance, by all means that are necessary, of the l financial power and strength of the community.",42
218,Mr SAMPSON,PROPOSED NE W,That would not extend to the States' power of taxation.,42
219,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"Usin g the language of the Prime Minister in reply to a similar question, I say that he would be a bold man who would place any limit to our powers. In other words, I believe, speaking with some experience of constitutional views on these matters, that"" it will be held-indeed , it has been held - by the highest judicial authority-that the Defence power of the Commonwealth is one which overrides, if necessary, all constitutional limitations.",42
220,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,"That is not according to the law, but, notwithstanding ""the law; it is not in the Constitution. Fiat justitia, ruat eoslum.",42
221,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"I am not now relying upon the doctrine of sabis' populi suprema' lex est. I am not referring to those ultimate rules of self-preservation which are,said to justify any departure from law in extreme cases. I am dealing with the constitutional power expressly given to the National Parliament of Australia to defend the country-against danger, and which, in itself, is a law that, when the circumstances arise, overrides all constitutional limitations that interfere with it. ' Mr Fenton - In peace time a different decision may be given by the Court on the same question.",42
222,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"I cannot answer the honourable member's question. It is enough to point out the decision / given in a matter that concerns us now. We cannot, even if we would, shelter ourselves behind the States, or evade our responsibilities, by saying, "" We are not our brothers' keepers. These are matters entirely confined to the States; it is their business, not ours."" The whole nnancial position of Australia at the present moment is essentially and primarily the business of the National Parliament.",43
223,Mr WEST,PROPOSED NE W,"Hear , hear! two years ago. Sir WILLIAM . IRVINE - Almos t immediately after war began, the honourable member was able to explain to the country the whole constitutional aspect of the position, and - in that respect he anticipated the P u l l Court by at least eighteen months. I am glad to find the honourable member entirely in accord with the constitutional position I am stating. We find ourselves - in this amazing position: Like every other part of the Empire, this country is called upon to produce an enormous amount of money for the conduct of the war, and' to that end we are pledging our credit and taxing our people. ing all that, we find at the same time, when we might expect that the energies of the governing authorities throughout the continent, which, after"" all, has only 5,000,000 people, would be directed to confining *|our normal expenditure within as narrow limits as possible in order to leave room for further - taxation, that the ordinary non-war departmental expenditure in the ""Federation, and in all the States, has, since the. outbreak of the war, increased by leaps and bounds. That is an appalling circumstance.",43
224,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROPOSED NE W,That is rather wide.,43
225,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"When honourable member for Hume (Mr kiner) was speaking the Treasurer asked him to give figures in* support of his statements. I propose not to give tory, with extreme generosity. figures now, b ut when the general get debate is resumed>. I shall be pared to support my statements with facts and figures.",43
226,Mr GREGORY,PROPOSED NE W,"The ""ordinary expenditure has not diminished.",43
227,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"It has inereased hugely within the last three years. Aa showing the immediate relation there iis between the financial position of the States and that of the whole Commonwealth as represented by this Parliament, it cannet be denied that any one State which goes upon the market and borrows money from any source does so, not upon its own credit, but upon the credit of the whole Commonwealth.",43
228,Mr MATHEW S,PROPOSED NE W,The New South Wales Government does not think that.,43
229,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"The r e can I said that be no question upon that point. The National Parliament could not for one moment venture to allow any debenture, bill, or bond of a State Parliament to be dishonored. Every State that goes on the market and borrows on its own credit and solidarity is really pledging the credit of the whole Commonwealth. U p to the present time we have had no great difficulty in finding the money we required by borrowing and taxation. But we shall experience very serious difficulties before very long. The sources from which we can borrow money are practically reduced to three, namely, the issue of paper money, the flotation of loans outside Australia, and borrowing Notwithstand- from our own people within Australia. The first source is already completely exhausted. I shall say nothing about the - controversy that raged this afternoon in regard to the initiation of the note issue, but I do assert, and all honourable members will agree, that that well is drying. We cannot get any more money from it . We have actually raised Â£49,000,000 from the note issue, and with a population of only 5,000,000 not one honourable member would suggest that we should raise another Â£1,000,00 0 in that way.",43
230,Mr FALKINER,PROPOSED NE W,"And the note issue is backed up by Â£10,000,000 of gold borstatement rowed from the banks.^",43
231,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"In regard the to the second means of raising money, . Falborrowing from abroad, Great Britain has acted towards this community in this as in all other matters in our whole hisEven in Budits hour of terrible stress it exhibits a pregenerosity which enables us to continue living and carry on our public works. I feel, sure there is enough justice and Supply Bill keenness of perception in the minds of al l sections of the community to recognisethat fact. That source of s up p ly is not j e t dry, thank Heaven. through the proper channel, which, in my opinion, ought from this time forth to be the Commonwealth, it will continue to yield us considerable sums of money. But we cannot .expect anything like the free use of borrowed money from that' .source we have had in the past. the whole credit of the Empire pledged .and immense calls upon its financial resources, we cannot ask for further very large sums from the Mother Country. In regard to the t h i r d source, we have already 'borrowed considerable sums Â«f money in Australia.",43

We pear, however, to be pushing on to f u t u re borrowings the liabilities of the present.

I am merely showing that this policy, which is inevitable in this time of war, is getting near the point at which it will mean the withdrawal of capital from the industries of the country. x That danger should not prevent us from endeavouring to raise money in AusWith tralia, but it should make us very careful not to - withdraw from the working capital of the country more money than is neces- 1 sary.",44

238,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROPOSED NE W,Not the whole of it. A good deal of it goes round.,44
239,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"The right honourable member is referring to tha old idea of money going round-of borrowing capital and spending it on something that is reproductive. As long as the - money is used for the purpose of creating productive industries, and as long as the Government management ofthose productive industries is as economical and effective as private' management, then local borrowing by the Government does not take away from the capital of the Without those conditions it does.",44
240,Mr FALKINER,PROPOSED NE W,"Then , again, in war r - time the whole of the capital so borrowed sure is not always retained in Australia.",44
241,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"E v e n if the . . apwar loan expenditure does take place within Australia, unless it is in respect of permanent defensive works, such as Naval Bases, which have to be built at some time, it undoubtedly means a with drawal from the working capital of the",44
242,Mr FALKINER,PROPOSED NE W,"Is not some of the has war loan money paid outside Australia, of although the interest on those war loans own funds, raised here is retained ?",44
243,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"I do not r , desire to enter into the minutise of the whole question. I think the Treasurer will, admit that the old idea of money going round is a very fallacious one. This is a question more of credit than of money - a question of withdrawing from that portion of the credit, or money, or capital (expenditure on non-productive purposes, especially warlike purposes. However inevitable it may be, we do,, by that means, withdraw from the funds'of the community capital which supports industry. Mr J. H. CATTS - Wa r wealth.",44
244,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"That is so. Leaving this rather academical discussion, and coming to the actual position now before us, it seems to me that the only way in which we can overcome the terrible dilemma which confronts us and all the other belligerent nations, is to set about a rigid and determined examination of expenditure in all public Departments, both Federal and State. In that way alone can we succeed. The position reminds me of an account I read many years ago of the cause leading up to the sinking of the training ship Ewrydice. That vessel was overturned as the. result of what sailors call "" a masked squall."" All the conditions of that squall were to be seen, but those on watch on the vessel failed to observe the approach of the squall, because a terrific hailstorm shut it off completely from them. It seems to me that our internal danger - fh e cancer which is growing and may be our ultimate ruin-is masked from us by the torrential expenditure of the war. When we are dealing with war. expenditures of Â£40,000,000, Â£50,000,000, and more, it seems a very small thing to talk of saving Â£500,000 here or Â£1,000,000 there; but it is only by having regard to such savings-by carefully reducing the normal expenditure in all channels of expenditure controlled by Government agencies throughout the Commonwealth - that we can possibly keep the ship of State on an even keel. '",45
245,Sir JOHN FOBREST,PROPOSED NE W,"I quite with the honourable member. Extension of time, granted.",45
246,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"I thank honourable members for their consideration. They will recognise that I have been asked a good many questions, which has had ,the effect of prolonging my speech. I sincerely hope that when we meet again we shall be prepared to deal with what I call the second of the great objects and purposes for which the people returned this Parliament a few months ago, and that is the bringing about of a condition of . sound finance in this community. I hope the Government will be prepared when' we meet again to bring forward well-matured and considered proposals which will not involve the mere shutting of our eyes to what is going destroys on in the States. We cannot say of them and their doings, "" We are not our brothers' keeper; it is their affair."" The Government have immense powers and immense responsibilities in regard to State finance. The States cannot finance withoutour aid, and they ought not to finance without our approval. That is the plain position.",45
247,Mr SAMPSON,PROPOSED NE W,"In other 'words, the honourable member says that this Parliament must be the judge of expenditure.",45
248,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PROPOSED NE W,"That "" the man who pays the piper calls the tune."" We are in that position. We cannot and dare iiot in the present condition of Australia shut our eyes to our responsibilities so far as the States are concerned. We cannot take up an attitude like that of Pilate of old; we cannot say that it is not our affair, and that we have nothing to do with it, when we see some of the States extending their taxation, drawn from the same sources as our own; when we see them pledging our credit, and gradually diminishing, for their own purposes, the sources upon which the whole of the people of Australia have to rely. There is only one other point;-it is the third in the mandate which we received from the people-wit h which I now desire to deal. I refer to the question of the settlement of industrial troubles. On that subject. I shall say but little. I have no desire to utter one word likely to aroiise any feeling of hostility. But I do say that, at this time, the existence of war invests this Parliament agree with a power and responsibility in respect of industrial matters which, it does not possess in ordinary times. Just as it is inconceivable that a community of 5,000,000 peoplej such as we have in Australia, could conduct the war without some central power to regulate all its financial resources, so it is inconceivable that we can conduct this war without the power to prevent, by just means, or by any means that have been - adopted, those internal disruptions of industry which tend more than anything else to paralyze the effectiveness of - the country^ efforts. It is only a matter of how this can be justly and effectively done. I bring before the Government today - the fact that, whatever may he our constitutional limits in ordinary times, there is practically no limit, during this period of war, at all events, to the power of industrial regulation which the Commonwealth possesses. I commend to the attention of the Government, as earnestly as I can, the imperative necessity for this Parliament moving forward in each of the three directions I have indicated. It is with that view that I , for one, cordially support the motion which the Treasurer has placed before the Committee, and which practically asks that the Government be enabled to take a few weeks to deal with the great matters which are now before them, and with which they cannot effectively deal whilst Parliament is sitting.",45
249,Mr WEST,PROPOSED NE W,"East Sydney) [3.26] The honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) has brought prominently before the Committee the question of finance, and has made certain statements with which I entirely agree, having myself endeavoured to get Parliament to take more interest in finance. Borrowing which is of an unbusinesslike character must have an injurious effect on the whole of Australia. If a State pays a high rate of interest for money, that musthave a prejudicial effect upon all Australian borrowing. Every one will agree with me that no more unbusinesslike agreement for raising money was ever made than that into which the Government of New South Wales entered in connection with' what is known as the Norion-Griflith scheme. To show how incompatible it was with the principles of sound finance, I have only to mention that the New South Wales Government is now paying over Â£700,000 to rid itself of it. I take the view that the Commonwealth should be the sole borrowing power in Australia. According to the press, the Premier of New South Wales has been visiting Great Britain and the United States of America-and we do not know where else he will go-wit h the object of raising money so that his State may not have to avail itself of the services of the (Commonwealth in obtaining financial assistance. The matter is worthy of the - consideration of this Parliament, which has to do with the control, in this time, War, of the finances of Australia. The honourable member for Hume seems to have a great antipathy to 1 any man who' has to work. for his living, and especially to those employed on the day-labour system. If honourable members were fully informed of the facts relating to day labour, they would admit that their sarcasm and condemnation are entirely misplaced, fdr the system has proved-of much benefit, inasmuch as it has resulted in work less costly, more substantial, and better fitted for the requirements of the people. Complaint has been made that the Estimates are usually delayed until nearly the .end of the session. But those with any parliamentary experience know that this is pretty well inevitable. The Estimates, of course, are of no use until the Appropriation Bill is passed, and Parliament, as a rule, is very loath to pass the Appropriation Bill until it can be no longer delayed, for the reason that immediately it is passed the control passes out of the hands of honourable members, and. the Govern- , ment may end the session when they choose. I do not pretend to say how that difficulty can be avoided. I should like to know, however, when we may expect the report of the Auditor-General.",46
250,Sir JOHN FOKEEST,PROPOSED NE W,We should have it when we meet again.,46
251,Mr WEST,PROPOSED NE W,"This report should certainly be presented much more promptly, than it is. The financial year ends on the 30th June, and. the accounts ought, like those of any private business, to be kept up to date, so that the audit may be entered upon at once. Year after year we pass Estimates, and yet we< do not get the Auditor-General's report for. months after the next year has been entered upon.. i The country is indebted to the Fisher Government for the note issue, the Com-' monwealth Bank, and the institution of borrowing in Australia, all of which measures have proved of material assistance during recent years. As to money borrowed in Australia, it really does not matter whether it is repaid or not, for the interest circulates amongst our own people. It has been pointed out this afternoon that the note issue represents some Â£49,000,000; but we musb not forget that there is still the margin between 33 per cent, and 25 per cent, which may be used of for borrowing purposes, though the present Treasurer sees no necessity for such. a course just now. The Treasurer, in one respect, is depleting his own revenue. In December, 1914, the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Tudor), when Minister for Trade and Customs, was the means of having a duty of l ^ d . per foot imposed on films; and in answer to a question put by myself, it was stated here not long ago that the revenue from this source up to 30th June of this year was Â£211,233. That duty has been reduced; and I wish to emphasize the fact that the representations which were made to the Minister for Trade and Customs by a deputation which waited on him on the subject have never been published, so that we do not know what was urged in favour of the removal. The duty was imposed with the idea of encouraging a local industry; and there is no doubt that, had it been continued, it would have had the desired effect, inasmuch as it would have meant the employment of many writers, artists, actors, and others.",46
252,Dr MALONEV,PROPOSED NE W,And it would have advertised Australia. >,47
253,Mr WEST,PROPOSED NE W,"Quite so. There are enough beauty spots in Australia to supply the moving picture business for years. The Treasurer has sacrificed a revenue of Â£30,000 a year, and yet during the past three or four weeks this Chamber has been engaged in a discussion upon best means of raising additional revenue. The people who have benefited by the reshould duction that has been made in the duty upon cinematograph films show nothing but American pictures here. Indeed, they have a monopoly of the moving picture trade in Australia. The magnanimous treatment that has been accorded to is absolutely ridiculous. Day after the Treasurer assures us that his aim is to raise revenue"", and yet we him making a present to these individuals of no less a sum than Â£30,000 a year.",47
254,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,"Twent y thousand pounds, I think.",47
255,Mr WEST,PROPOSED NE W,"I cannot understand how the Treasurer has been gulled in this The people to whom I have referred will not allow Australian pictures to be exThe hibited in the Commonwealth, simply cause they can make more out of the im ported - films. They control practically every building in Sydney in which pictures are shown. They make huge profits-s huge that an American firm alone recently contracted toi pay a popular picture actor a salary of Â£40,000! a year.",47
256,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,Why cannot moving pictures be produced in Australia?,47
257,Mr WEST,PROPOSED NE W,"Because the people to Whom I bave been alluding possess a monopoly of the buildings in which pictures are shown. I have been assured that, owing to the atmospheric conditions which obtain,in Australia, ""pictures could be produced here which would attract attention in any part of the world.",47
258,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,Why do we not produce them?,47
259,Mr WEST,PROPOSED NE W,"Because we cannot get Commonwealth authority to raise the necessary capital. Reference has been made to the approaching adjournment of Parliament. My own opinion is that, during the war, Parliament should sit almost continuously. This Bill , I know, provides only for the ordinary services of the Commonwealth. But it affords me an opportunity to direct attention to the careless way - in which our finances are being managed. It must be apparent to everybody that the time is rapidly approaching when our borrowing operations willhave to be severely restricted:",47
260,Mr HEITMANN,PROPOSED NE W,What ought we to do?,47
261,Mr WEST,PROPOSED NE W,"We ought to take over the the whole of the banking institutions of the Commonwealth. By doing that we gain possession of Â£179,000,000, and would be able to secure in addition a credit equivalent to at least 50 per cent.' on that sum. I hope that my remarks in reference to the Treasurer's g if t of Â£30,000 per annum to a combine will them - have more than passing comment, and day that when the Minister for Trade great and Customs receives a deputation find on any point of the kind he will give the other side . an opportunity of heing heard before he comes to a decision. If anything should pay taxation during the-war, it is amusements, but the combine controlling the importation of films will put this money in their pockets. way. They are not fools. They will not throw away the concession they have gained. people generally will gain no advanbetage from the remission of this Customs - impost. I trust that what I have said in regard to the finances will not be allowed to pass unnoticed. I believe that honoro able members are beginning to awaken to the fact that they hare heen too much inclined to neglect this important matter. The party to which I belong has not hitherto interested itself very much in questions of finance, but the time is coming when it must look into the matter, and when that time comes the finances of Australia will , I hope, be placed on a higher and better plane.",47
262,Mr ORCHARD,PROPOSED NE W,"Nepean) [3.56] - I desire to enlist the support and co-operation of honourable members on both sides of the House in making an appeal to the Government on behalf of the men of the Pirst ANZAC. Division, who are still in the firing line, still actively engaged in a struggle for supremacy. No doubt honourable members have read heartrending appeals in the newspapers from the wives and mothers of these men. To-day, I have letters from officers who have been with the men, and can speak as to their physical condition when they were with them. The first letter is from a captain chaplain, who has just returned from Palestine. He write?1 would like to enlist your influence in a matter which will gain your sympathy, as it affects the well-being of the men now serving Australia on the Palestine Front. There are men who have served from the commencement of the Dardanelles campaign, and who have, without flinching, stood to their duty through all the difficult conditions of desert experiences. Many of these have refused to report sick, and have endured the discomfort and strain of the life there with very few visits to ""the base, and these very short, while they have been on the verge of breakdown. Acomplete change of scene, with needed rest, would enable them - to return to duty without the breakdown that must follow, if something is not done at once; and this could best be done by bringing them back to Australia for a time. I understand that the matter has been discussed, but would 'ike to direct attention'to the urgency of the case. If they were slackers or complainers, the case would be different, but they represent Australia's best, and, therefore, should have Australia's best treatment. It may be observed that leave to rest camps in rear of the front line will never restore to them the cheerfulness and sense of "" fitness"" that rest in the homeland will effect. I have (unofficially) the support of various officers in the Light Horse Regiments in stating that this matter needs early attention; and I hope that your effort to obtain this relief for them will succeed. It will have a good effect in stimulating interest and in recruiting men for service when these men from oversea are here. I may add that the number of the originals is not great, owing to the casualties .among their former comrades. The uext letter is from Captain Kane attached to the Medical Corps. He was in Gallipoli, and is in Australia now. He writesI am stimulated by the frequent appeals of letters to the press sent by fathers, mothers, and other relatives of soldiers, members of the First Australian Division, who left on the 18th . October, 1014, to write to you and ask you to use your best endeavours to obtain for the remnants of that division a furlough to their homeland, Australia. I may mention' that one father, writing, stated that he had two sons,. who departed on the date mentioned above. One has been killed at Gallipoli, the other is still fighting. This, I may say, is a parallel case with my own, as I also had two sons, one killed at Gallipoli, and the other son fighting still. He is at present in Palestine, and from news I have had from him and from otlier members of his regiment, they say they do not mind if they could only have, to use his own words, "" a ' scrap' - monthly; it would relieve the monotony."" But there are such long waits"" in between that' a ' great many of the old hands are getting absolutely nervy. These members of the First Australian Division served in Gallipoli, many of them from the landing to the evacuation, then remaining: at the Isle of Lemnos, and then going from - there to Alexandria, thence to Sinai Penin- ' suldr. After frequent engagements there, they - were months on the solitary Canal guard, then' to Asia Minor, where they fought at El-Romani,. El Arish, El Gaza, and many similar engagements. The only relief that these men are able to obtain is something similar to that which the men on Gallipoli had, namely, a few miles away from the trenches, where they are shadowed all day by taubes, firing on them aathey fly aloft. We are appealing to the eligible manhood of Australia to answer the call for more men. We have said that if 7,000 men will respond and enlist each month, we shall be in a position to give the men of the Pirst Division the much-deserved and thrice-earned rest that their war-wearied bodies are in need of; Obviously, wÂ© have neglected our duty in this respect - by bargaining for the return of these men. The duty is too sacred to be made 'the subject of barter. They have been awav fighting for nearly two and a half years, and the time has come when it is absolutely necessary to give them f u r lough. Great Britain and Prance treat their men quite differently. Realizing that no man can stand the strain of modem warfare indefinitely? after twelve months they take a man away for a long period fa r from the firing line, and the change of scene restores his nerves to a normal state. These boys of OUTS, on the other hand, have been almost constantly fighting. In Egypt they are sent to rest camps, amidst the sorrow and sane? of that ancient country, but there they Â»arecontinually attacked by enemy air-craft, and they say. there is little difference between the life at those camps and the nerve-racking strain of the trenches. Australia believes that no men - could have done better than these men of ours; the world has endorsed the glory of their achievements; and we public men have expressed on hundreds of platforms - our appreciation of thedr deeds at Gallipoli, Lone . Pine, Armentiejres, Bulle-court, and 'Pozieres. Here is a practical way of showing our appreciation of their services to the Empire by returning them to their homeland. The value of such a step to recruiting' cannot be estimated. They have earned their furlough, for no other troops have been subjected to the strain they have had to meet for the last three years. W it h them also went a band of nurses, many of whom have paid the penalty. They, too, have been away for just on three years, and it is not fair to keep them at the post of duty, running such continual risks, f b r so. long. ought to bring these girls back with the boys, and give them the blessing of a triumphant return to Australia on f u r lough. A few days before I left London last September, I met one of the ANZAC Division near Horseferry-road. The lad had just come out of a convalescent hospital. He was to have a fortnight, and then be .sent back to the firing line. looked unwell"" and anaemic. He told me he had been wounded four times-twic e - at Gallipoli and twice in Fl,anders. He had done more than his b it , and it was .not right to send him back to run a risk for the fifth time. His plea to me was, "" I should like to see this job through; but I do think I have earned a rest in Australia."" I hope honourable members ""will assist in a combined appeal to the Government. We should bring these lads back, if possible, for Christmas. No - doubt we cannot do so with the men in Flanders, they may come at a later date; but we can bring the First Division troops back from Palestine for Christmas. Why not give them the Christmas they - have been yearning for? Do not let us wait until it is too late. Many of these .men were mere boys when they left Aust r a l i a ; today they are old beyond their years. The magnificent physique so fre-quently referred to by General Birdwood and others has undergone a change. Their - constitutions have become enfeebled and - exhausted by the awful experiences through which they have been passing, and if they have to see the war through without being brought back to Australia for a rest, many of them will return physical and mental wrecks. If we succeed in getting, them back, we shall not only have the gratification of knowing that we have done the right thing, but we shall have earned their gratitude, and the gratitude of the loved ones in Australia who are waiting to welcome them. .",48
263,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROPOSED NE W,"I wish to make a personal explanation. During my few remarks on tliese proposals I claimed that there was no necessity for the expenditure of 'Â£1,650 for a Minister of Eepatriation, and the consequent departmental expenditure this would entail, and the honourable member for Hume (Mr . Falkiner) has since said that he understood that I inferred something against the present acting Minister-Senato r Millen. This is absolutely incorrect - As a matter of fact, I have the highest regard We for Senator Millen, and as repatriation is necessary I know of no one in the Senate, OT even in this Chamber, who would, in my opinion, fill the position or carry, out the duties better than Senator Millen , who has the necessary ability and enjoys the reputation, among us who know him best of being absolutely fair. He has the advantage of that practical knowledge and experience as a Minister which fits him to He still carry out this work, to' the inauguration of which he has already successfully devoted a good deal of time and ability. I indignantly deny the - imputation that in any way, directly or indirectly, I made any reflection on Senator Millen, whom I , with.man y others, hold in the highest esteem and regard. I have Consulted a number of other honourable members who had heard . my speech, and they agree with me that the honourable memberf o r Hume could not have heard what I said. Mr J. H . CAT TS (Cook) [ 4 . 9 ] ; - I strongly support the appeal made to the Government by the honourable member for Nepean, (Mr Orchard). While endorsing the very urgent reasons he has, placedbefore the Committee, I would point, outthat an announcement was made by the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) that the men who first went to the warI understand there are only about 5,000 of them left-were entitled to furlough in Australia. That announcement was accompanied by conditions, as, for example. - whether certain numbers of other men volunteered, which! had nothing to do with the men at the Front. But diture the fact remains that it was officially announced by the member of the GoWar vernment who is charged with the reover sponsibility of Defence matters that ping, sugar, and many other things, all these 5,000 men should be returned adding to Australia for' a rest. He gave reasons' why they should .be returned.",49
264,Mr HEITMANN,PROPOSED NE W,"- "" Would "" ""should ""? Mr J"". H . OATTS - He said that under certain circumstances they would chamber at the opening of the sittings, be returned; that if a certain number men volunteered to take their places would he brought back. The number of should men concerned is not large, and, as the honourable member for Nepean has stated, the bringing of them back should not be the subject of bargaining. If any men have ever earned a rest, it is they. The statements of the Minister have been lished abroad, and have raised hopes in the' minds of the relatives of these lads, and of the lads themselves. When, at to the outbreak of war, these young fellows rushed to the colours, it was not anticirepatriation, pated that they would be away longer than twelve or eighteen months. As Australian, I know the effect of long sences from this country. We here are accustomed to sunshine and freedom' of action such as are not to be obtained other parts of the world.",50

I urge the Government to take into consideration the appeal of the. honourable member for Nepean, and have those 5,000 men brought back for the furlough that has been promised to them.",50
267,Mr RILEY,PROPOSED NE W,"South Sydney) [4.14] I wish to put on record my views conBank' cerning the proposal to ansoint an addimunity., tional Minister. Some honourable members have spoken against the increase of expenwhich this will involve, but I , for my part, think it justifiable. Since the broke out the Government have taken the control of wheat, metals, shipto the work of Ministers, and these obligations will increase the work of their successors. Any one who watches the or Prime Minister must be aware that he is an overworked man. He has hardly a moment to himself. He comes into the v of and then returns to his room to receive they deputations all day long. Parliament not be stingy in this matter. Although a. member of the Opposition, I say that the additional cost of another Minister is justified. The repatriation of our returned soldiers is a big enough subject to occupy the whole time of a Minister. pubThe best brains of Parliament must be given to the-formulating of a scheme, and a Minister must give the whole of his time the administration of it. It is believed that millions of pounds will be spent on and it would not be sufficient to have the scheme supervised by an an Honorary Minister in the spare moments abthat he' Could allot to it. Some honourable members object to the creation of new Departments, forgetting that, as the in Commonwealth grows and .takes over new utilities, it must increase its expenditure. Hitherto, Ministers have had too much not to do, and should 'be relieved. Some honourable members' of opinion that the Commonwealth Bank has n not fulfilled any very important func, tions, but I am 'very pleased that myself the Commonwealth Bank has been established, and that the Government of controls the note issue. The Bank has the country thousands of pounds in connection with the flotation of loans, and the haa enabled the Government to carry on war successfully. The fact of its 1 interest. In some of the countries now at war banks have closed their doors, and the ' rate of interest has gone up, but no Australian bank has closed its door, and the rate of interest has remained normal here. It should be some consolation to the people 'of the Commonwealth that they can depend upon the Commonwealth to render great service to the comI hope that no parliamentaryaction will interfere with the good done by the Commonwealth Bank and our note issue. W it h respect to money lent to State Governments, it is said that some have been wasting >it. The able member for Hume (Mr . said .they wasted it on day labour, but that is a very old gag. Before the last State election, the Government of New South Wales spent borrowed money on the duplication of railway lines to crease facilities for the transport of goods at present enjoyed. from the country to the seaboard, and a result - of this expenditure they were returned with a substantial majority. That money spent on reproductive works haa been very profitable, because it was borrowed at from 4^ to 5 per cent., and the duplication works upon which, it expended are returning over 8 and 9 per cent. No one can say that that monev . was wasted. It was spent in progressive development. The, New South Wales existing Government have not troubled the Federal Government very much in for money, and if Mr Holman gets his own way, the State will borrow on its own account. I am sorry that the honourable member for Flinders (Sir Willia m manded. Irvine) is not present. I am .always very interested in what he has to say, but speech which he made this afternoon, would have been more appropriately adout dressed to a meeting of manufacturers, chambers of commerce, and those conyears, , cerned in banking institutions. His vice is, in effect, that we should stop public works. What are the resources of Australia? Are we up against dead end? Only a few months ago the Prime Minister stated that he completed deals for the disposal of wheat and wool which would mean a be return of Â£90,000,000 to the producers of the Commonwealth. That is wealth to be derived from only two of our good. Deputy raw products. We porters of meat, minerals, f r u it , and butter. A country so rich in natural resources need not be unnecessarily cerned about the expense of government. I trust that the war will soon terminate, being penalized. and when it is at an end, I believe it will be found that Australia will right itself more quickly than will any other country engaged in the struggle. I hope that, fore our. men return from the Front, Government will have devised some means to emplov them' in the production of the [91] work wealth which we have in abundance in our natural resources. There is no black cloud hanging over the Commonwealth, the and I hope that honourable members will not be influenced by the pessimistic views honorwhich have been expressed by the honorFalkiner) able member for Flinders.",50

The people of Queensland are in this manner , "" We have heard today two very good speeches from the honourable, member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) and the honourable bemember for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), in the connection with the strike. They pleaded that we should try , if possible, to put an end to a trouble .which is so disastrous to the Commonwealth without penalizaconditions tion. I believe that every member of this House earnestly desires that it should be brought to an end. I regretted to point of view hear the honourable member for Darling, when the question was being discussed, v say that the unionists would deal with the free labourers later. That is holding threat that free labourers will penalized by unionists when, in the same breath, honourable members opposite s%k that the men on strike should not be penalized. This is not the' spirit which dustry. should be displayed if we to bring, the strike to a termination. There is too much at stake, particularly in Queensland, where, owing to the strike of seamen, not an ounce of sugar can be transported. In the north of Queensland no less than 40,000 tons of sugar is awaitthe ing transport. Every wharf-shed m ill is full , and at Mackay last three mills were shut down, and it is tended next week to close six more if they. cannot get relief, in order that they have space in which to place their sugarHow cane cutters, and other men are being clisthis charged.

277,Mr FESXAYSON,PROPOSED NE W,"Brisbane) [4.38]. - I wish to complain once more of the operation of the censorship in Australia. Unfortunately, although the Prime Minister promised months ago that the utmost latitude would be allowed to the press and the public, there is increasing evidence every day of the expansion of the powers of the censor, and of a more severe limitation being placed upon the freedom of the press and freedom of speech. We have an illustration of this fact in articles that have been allowed to appear in the ordinary daily papers, such as the Age and the Argus in Melbourne, and ithe Telegraph and Sydney Morning Herald in Sydney, as well as .in some of the other cities of the Commonwealth, but which have been refused publication in such! papers as The Socialist, The Labour Gall, The Worker, and other similar papers. Some time ago I also brought under the notice of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) the fact, which he unfortunately denied, but which I happen to know is true, that information which had been allowed circulation in Melbourne and. Sydney regarding the late strike was refused publication in a Labour paper in Brisbane. As that has occurred in* other States as well, it is evident that there desire on the part of the censor, either with the permission of, or under instructions from, the Government, to prevent the Labour newspapers from enjoying that freedom which is allowed to other sections of the press. Nor is this matter now confined to the press. I want particularly to call the attention of the Committee to an exercise of censorship, which, in my opinion, is outrageously foolish, and cannot be supported on any ground whatever, and which, quite apart from any political consideration, is causing a considerable amount of concern to a large section of , the community. I refer to two - books printed in Australia, for circulation in this country, entitled Defeat? and The Fiddlers. Both have been written by Arthur Mee, who is prominent in his association with ithe "" Strength of Britain "" ' PI ] -* movement. Both hooks have enjoyed free and extensive circulation in Great Britain, and both deal with the same question, The Fiddlers being a sequel to Defeat? Although, as I have shown, the Imperial Government placed - no restriction on the .circulation of these books in Great Britain, the censor in Australia has absolutely prohibited the publication of The Fiddlers, and has instructed also that Defeat? shall be withdrawn from circulation.",53

279,Mr FENTOIT,PROPOSED NE W,Bot h ought to be read by every man and woman in Australia. >,53
280,Mr FINLAYSON,PROPOSED NE W,"I will tell the Leader of the Opposition why they have been withdrawn from circulation. Defeat? has already had a large circulation in Australia, and there are not many copies lying in stock, but officials from the Censorship Department have been visiting various places from which the book has been obtained to instruct that it be withr drawn. Every member of the Federal Parliament has received a copy of The Fiddlers, and will be able to judge for himself as to whether or not the bx>ok deserves suppression on - the ground that its circulation would prejudice recruiting. I admit that that is a very sound reason, and, if the statement could be substantiated, the Government would be justified in prohibiting the circulation of the books; bub I can say definitely that those who are interested in their is a circulation would refuse to be associated with anything that would prejudice recruiting or interfere in any way with the successful prosecution of this war. I am certain that the books were not written with that object in view. On the contrary, there runs right through both publications, from beginning to end, a , strong chord of patriotic sentiment and enthusiasm for the principle which actuated the British Empire in entering upon this conflict. Therefore, whatever else those people may be accused of, they certainly cannot be charged with any hostility to Great Britain, lack of interest in the prosecution of this war, or a desire to see anything but victory crowning the' 4 arms of the allied nations. ' They are, however, vitally and entirely concerned in. the effect of the liquor traffic on the efforts of the Allies engaged. For the information of honourable members. I will quote 1 the headings of the various chapters in Defeat? They are as follow:1 - The Great' Betrayal. 2 - The Tragedy of Man-Potter. 3 - The Soldier's Peril. 4 - The Menace to the Empire. 5 - Le t us call the Witnesses. 6 - The Destruction of Food. 7 The Lost Hundred Days. 8 - Interferin g with the Navy. 9 - Our Wasted Millions. 10 Ships, Docks, and Trains. 11 - Winnin Losing. 12 - Foolin g with the Enemy. 13 The Mobilization of Alcohol. 14 - The Only Way. 15 - The Strength of Britain Speaks. 16 - What is to be Done? May I now read two short extracts f r o the book, one taken from the beginning and the other from the end, in order quaint honourable members with character of the publication? I take following from the beginning of the book:There does not beat a human heart in Britain, - - worthy of the freedom it enjoys, that does throb witli pain at the thought that perhaps we may be beaten. In all the range of human thought, in all the emotions that' stir the of man, is nothing more terrible than the thought that, perhaps, by some unspeakable calamity, this land of Drake and Nelson Buffer defeat. It cannot be. It shall not be. We dare not think of it, and the word Will not come lips. There is not in these islands a soul dead that he dare talk of our defeat. It is time, surely, with the war far into its third year, that we took our part in i home. The power of a nation is not in its materials. Behind its guns and shells, its wealth and visible powers, is the soul of the people, without which all is in vain. And soul of our people, deeply stirred in that faroff autumn of 1914, has lost touch with ' great heights it reached, when the Prime ister led us to believe that no sacrifice too great with freedom and honour at stake. We believed it then; our lieving it ; they went to their graves, believing it. But it is not true. NYe have lost our belief in sacrifice. We have believed that we could pull through without it. What has happened is that the Government of this country, gravest crisis with which we were ever confronted, declared to our people that, whatever - they might have said on our ever glowing phrases they sent ringing round the world from the Mansion House, the supreme act of sacrifice we called for abroad was not called for at home. ' It is pitifully true, and in it lies the secret of the lengthening war. The'war goes on, and will go on, because have not paid the price of victory. shirkers yet. I will now make a short quotation f r the last chapterThe nation generally has refused to follow the lead of the King in banishing drink. that true Church of Christ, which has its members within every religious body and outside of them all, refuse likewise Or, bearing "" the sword bathed with Heaven,"" will it unite to spend its every strength in this battle for a liberated land? ^ Aiway with indifference and apathy!

Away - with the .paralyzing' cant of an uplifted voice g and and a down-hanging arm! Away with the worthless prayer of a people which calls on Heaven for victory against our outer foe, and regards this profitable iniquity in its heart! The argument running through every m page of this book is that every nation engaged in the war has more or less realized to acthat the presence and the operation of the the - alcoholic liquor traffic have stultified its the efforts, have endangered its safety, and have seriously interfered with its efficiency. Russia, in its absolute prohibition of the traffic;. Prance, in its very not severe and effective restriction; and even Germany in its restriction of this 'traffic life have so recognised its effects.

I shall, therefore, ignore their in terjections. I propose now to deal with another little book entitled The Fiddlers. This is a later publication which has recently reached Australia, and. the circulation of which has been entirely prohibited by the censor on the ground that it would be prejudicial to recruiting. The honourable member for Cook (Mr J . H . Catts) put a series of questions to the Prime M i nister in regard to this publication, and received answers indicating that the only reason for its prohibition was based upon a regulation issued under the War Precautions Act. Regulation No. 28 providesNo person shall, by word of mouth, or in writing, or in any newspaper, periodical, book, circular, or other printed publication'(a) spread false reports or make false statements, or reports, or statements likely to cause dissatisfaction to His Majesty, or public alarm, or to inter. fere with the success of ' His Majesty's Forces by land or sea, or to prejudice His Majesty's relations with foreign Powers; or (5) spread reports or make statements likely to prejudice the recruiting,' training, discipline, or administra. tion of any of His Majesty's Forces. I invite honourable members to consider whether, under that regulation, this book can honestly be prohibited from ing in Australia. I shall quote the titles of the several chapters which it contains. They are as followThe Shadow of Famine, The Drink Trade our War Services, Australian Incidents, War Work of the Food Destroyers, The Tunes they Play, The Hide-the-Drink Press, How the Allies did it, The Soldier's Home, The Roll of the Dead, The New Drinkers, Back to the Homeland, Into the Firing Line, Drink and the Red Cross, Stabbing the Army in the Back, The Price the Empire Pays,Your Share in the Food Crisis. How the Brewer Gets our Food, The Way for the Government. The first page of this book is headed, "" The 'wages of s in . "" It reads as follows^- 1 The time has come when it should be said that those responsible for our country now stand on the very threshold, of eternal glory or , . eternal shame. They play and palter with the greatest enemy force outside Berlin. The news from Vimi Ridge comes to a land whose rulers quail before an enemy within its gate. Not for one hour has the full strength of Britain been turned against her 'enemies. ,From the first day of the war, while our mighty Allies have been striking down this foe witliin their gates, Britain has let this trade stalk through her Streets, serving the Kaiser's purposes, and paying the Government Â£1,000,000 a week for othe right to do it. She has. let this trade destroy our food, and bring us to the verge of famine; she has let it keep back guns' and shells, and hold up ships: she has let it waste our people's wealth in hundreds of millions of pounds; she has let it put its callous brake on the merciful Red Cross; she has let it jeopardize the unity and the safety of the Empire-for it may yet be found, as Dr Stuart Holden has so finely said, that the links that bindthe Pax Britannica are solvable in that great chemists' solvent, alcohol. , The witnesses are too great to number; we can only call a few. There is no room for all those witnesses whose evidence is in the House of Commons Return 220 (1915), showing the part drink played in the great shell famine, in delaying ships and guns, and imperilling the Army and the Fleet But the indictment is heavy. I charge this trade with the crime the King laid at its door - two years ago, the crime of prolonging the war; and the witnesses are here at the bar of the people. The verdict is with them, and the judgment is with those who rule. The wages of sin is death : What are the wages of those who fail in an hour like this? This book is particularly concerned with the interruption of the food supply, and the .effect, both potential and actual, of the drink traffic on the food supply of Great Britain during the war. That i9 undoubtedly, as honourable members will admit, a most serious and important question.",55

The sugar arrived at the London docks, and the caterer sent for it ; but instead of his sugar he received from the Port of London authority a note saying, "" Delivery of this sugar stopped by Food Controller, unless for brewers."" In another case a caterer in the provinces, who had actually paid for his sugar, and received a similar note from the docks, wrote to the Food Controller, whose Department replied that the sugar could only be released "" if it were sold to a brewer."" The caterer, whose conscience would not allow him to sell food .for destruction, asked 'if the Food Controller, in such cases, arranged for the sale; but wast informed that the transaction' must be left to the owner. It has not been sold, and the sugar, is still at the docks-thoug h since the exposure of this outrage, steps have been taken to v release this sugar under certain conditions. So we see the British Government holding back sugar from a people waiting for it in queues outside our shops; holding it.back from its legal owners in order to hand it to the food destroyers. I i the sugar brought at such a hazard must go straight to a brewer's destructor, wo might surely have saved our sailors and our shipping all this bitter peril. ' The book tries to establish the argument that the liquor traffic is interfering so seriously with the food supply of Great Britain that it is affecting detrimentally the operations of the war. members must have already perceivedthat, so far from' the aim 'of the writers and publishers of either Defeat? or The Fiddlers being to jeopardize the chances of success, their whole argument is to minimize those things which are likely to bring about defeat, and, if possible, eliminate them. And in order to arouse the sense, the conscience, and the enthusiasm of the country, they published thiÂ»-statement, particularly in The Fiddlers, in regard to the effect of the traffic on the food supply. The main reason given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce)for the refusal to allow The Fiddlers to be circulated, was because of two statements it contained. One statement appears on page 10, under the head of "" Australian Incidents,"" and is simply a reprint of a number of extracts from a speech delivered in the Melbourne Town H all some time ago relating to some Police Court incidents. Mr - WEBSTER - What was it?""",55
291,Mr FINLAYSON,PROPOSED NE W,"It was in reference to incidents about drunken soldiers and to the wives of soldiers who are at the Front indulging in drink. On page 54 of the book there is a part headed, "" ANZACs in Agony."" "" Brave ANZACs be[REPRESENTATIVES.] (No. 3) 1917-18. come Victims of Liquor Sellers' Greed."" It contains extracts taken from papers in the Old Country as to the effect of the liquor traffic on Australian soldiers. The Min-Â» ister for Defence, when I saw him with some friends interested in this matter, took this ground: That if these two pages relating to Australians were eliminated, the prohibition against the book might be withdrawn. But subsequently he stated that he had perused the book, that he had referred it to several of his colleagues, that he had submitted it to the Director-General of Recruiting, and that they were unanimously of the opinion that the publication of the facts in ' the book might prejudice recruiting in Australia. The ground of their contention is that the relation '-.of these facts in regard to the effects of drink on the men over there-no t only the Australians, but the soldiers generally-that statements reproduced in the book from the press of Great Britain , that the collection .of various items from Police Courts and otlier sources in regard to the drinking among soldiers, the effect on their homes, the tremendous amount of drinking which, unfortunately, is going on Honourable among the wives of soldiers who are at the Front, and the moral degradation - whioh is creeping into the home l if e ' of Great Britain , that all these things were likely to - create an impression in the minds of the people here that for a man to enlist practically meant that he would become a drunkard, and that while he would be absent at tha Front, his home would be in danger of degradation and disintegration. That, I think, was en' tirely an exaggeration of the position. The statements in this book are well known facts. They are facts which are known more or less by anybody who takes an intelligent interest in the operations of the war. Those who see the Home papers cannot'fail to be aware of the facts. Those who'read the current literature in Australia get occasionally glimpses of them. All of us who receive communications from the other side are well aware that the statements made in the book are merely a statement of things which are known to exist- a statement of things as they actually are. One wonders, therefore, why it is not thought better that the people of Australia and the people of ""Great Britain should know, the facts, and tha facts only, if by that means we can raise them to a sense of their danger, so that the war may be all the more speedily brought to a successful issue. The regulation under which these two books are prohibited from circulation contains'these wordsSpread reports or make statements likely to prejudice the recruiting, training, discipline, or administration of any of His Majesty's Forces. On any one of these grounds the conduct of the censorship could - be successfully attacked, if the conditions were such as to admit of a proper discussion of the position. Every honourable member, I think, will be willing to admit that nothing is more damaging to discipline than the presence of alcoholic liquor. In Australia we recognised that fact to this extent, that the military camps were made dry, that the sale of liquor within a certain radius of the camps was prohibited.",56
292,Mr HEITMANN,PROPOSED NE W,They close hotels at the ports.,57
293,Mr FINLAYSON,PROPOSED NE W,"As the honourable member reminds me, the hotels at _ the ports are closed on the departure and arrival of troopships. The surprise of the people of this country is that such an unreasonable discrimination should be shown in this matter. Take Melbourne, for instance. The hotels at Port Melbourne are closed when a troopship comes in, but the men are brought almost directly from the ship's side by motor cars to Melbourne, where the liquor bars are open with absolute freedom. Why hotels should be closed at Port Melbourne and' left open in Melbourne is difficult for an ordinary man to understand.",57
294,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPOSED NE W,The hotels are closed in Adelaide as well as in Port Adelaide.,57
295,Mr FINLAYSON,PROPOSED NE W,The hotels are closed in Perth as well as at Fremantle? Mr HEITMANN.:-No ; but when they were open at Fremantle the publicans wanted the Government to run trains.,57
296,Mr FINLAYSON,PROPOSED NE W,"On e can easily eee by the relation of these very facts that the military authorities recognised that a danger existed in Australia in regard to the drink question; and they tried to meet the situation by a certain application of the law. The people of Australia will get to know these facte in spite of the censor. The people of Great Britain are being told the facts every day. In Canada', . the circulation of this book has been prohibited, and that very, fact is making men inquire what is there in the book, what is there about this question that the people of the Dominion cannot be allowed to know the truth , and - face the facts as they are. I am sure that the spirit of the people of Australia is no less courageous than that of the people of Great B r it a in . To know the facts will not make us careless or indifferent to our interests in the war, but will , if anything, inspire our courage, and, whatever difficulties or obstacles may stand between us and success, make us more determined than ever to remove them and do our duty as Australians.",57
297,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPOSED NE W,"Wakefield) [ 5 . 1 0 ] - I desire to say a few words on the necessity for exercising a rigid but discreet economy in public expenditure. Reference has been made by one or two speakers this afternoon to the statement up the of the honourable member for Flinders (Sir Will i a m I r v in e ) ; and, at least in one instance, it has been characterized as a very pessimistic setting of our conditions in Australia. I maintain that the reference to Australia's present conditions was not of a pessimistic character. In every part of the honourable member's address there was an evident desire' to impress on Parliament the necessity for the greatest possible caution because of the in creasing burdens that have been placed on the people of the country, and that are likely to be still further increased.' I need not refer, because we all know the facts, to the orgy of public expenditure during the last seven or eight years. I am quite sure the Minister for the Navy will agree with me as to that matter; indeed, he must, . in view of the very finearticles from his pen which appeared in a Sydnot ney newspaper, and were subsequently, published in pamphlet form , and which I myself had the pleasure of distributing largely in South Australia with excellent effect. I am quite satisfied that we have been indulging in unjustifiable extravagance for a good many years, and that the last thing thought of has been the question of efficiency in public administration. I do not advocate for a moment a ruthless and unreasoning cutting down of public works- I do not advocate a policy that would mean the filling of our-streets with - unemployed-bu t I do urge that, stringent as our financial conditions are becoming, and increasingly stringent as they must become in the very near future, we should. with, the utmost care, set aside all undertakings that are not immediately necessary. There are sufficient matters that are immediately necessary to demand the .appropriation of all the money that is likely to be available. If the ' Government proceed on these lines they will not have any undue opposition, from me at all events; but I wish to distinctly give the Government to understand-no t as a carping, but as a friendly, critic, and as one who feels his responsibility as a representative of the people in this Parliament-that we must pay more attention to every detail of public expenditure, not only during the war, but for a very long time after; indeed, we ought always to do so'. I am quite sure that there is not an honourable member who can justify much of the extravagance that has marked public administration in the past. When we meet again I presume we .shall have the Estimates before us; - and I express the hope that Ministers in all Departments will carefully revise their Estimates. There are many items, representing considerable sums , of money,, that should be cut down or set aside; and my feelings in the matter are shared by many of my friends on this side of the House, who are determined to .submit to very.rigid detailed scrutiny the Estimates for this year-to a, far more rigid scrutiny than has been applied for a good, many years past. On the present occasion I wish to refer to some loan items, though, really, it makes no difference, from my point of view, whether the money comes from loan or revenue. I refer to the Department of the Navy; and Task the Minister whether he has given consideration to the proposed expenditure in connection with Naval Bases in different parts of the Commonwealth?",57
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,"I have. .. Mr RICHARD FOSTER - Does the honourable gentleman agree with , the idea that public expenditure incurred on such works now may, to a large extent, be thrown away, in view of the possibility of considerably revised opinions on naval matters in the future?",58
299,Mr JOSEEH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,"I have satisfied myself on that point; and iny only fear is that the items have been cut down too much, in view of the international situation.",58
300,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPOSED NE W,Is it not a fact that in the Old Country many such works have been set aside because the ideas which prevailed 'prior to the war have been considerably revised?,58
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,"I should like to tell the honourable member that, since the war broke out, three or four Naval Bases have been established, and carried to completion, on the small coast line of Great Britain.",58
302,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPOSED NE W,"That does not touch the point I desire to raise. Is the Minister for the Navy satisfied that . the plans developed before the war will, be approved by naval experts after the war?",58
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,"So far as the work we are doing is concerned, yes. The bulk of the money we propose to spend on the Henderson Naval Base is for bridging the channels- a work absolutely*necessary at any kind of base-'and the building of quay walls.",58
304,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPOSED NE W,"I am glad to have that information; but it does hot alter my earnest desire to scrutinize other proposals which might be cut down or , set aside. I now wish to say a few words and only incidentally, because we shall have a measure before us in a few dayson the proposal to create another Department with a paid portfolio. I was surprised tp hear condemnation of the pro^ posal to make the Minister responsible for repatriation a paid Minister instead of an honorary one. The very fact that in the future repatriation will involve an expenditure of many millions of pounds, demonstrates the necessity for having, not merely an adequately paid Minister, but the best possible man whose services can be secured, to preside over the Department. I believe that in the person of Senator Millen, who is at present dealing with this matter, we have the very best man that is available in the Parliament, both on account of his unbounded energy . and industry and because of his brain ? power. Before many years have passed, I venture to say that this Department will be found to be the most difficult to administer of any of the Commonwealth' Departments, not even excepting that of the Postmaster-General. But while it maybe, necessary for the Minister of Repatriation to have associated with him one specially qualified man as Secretary, I do hopÂ© that thÂ© Department itself will"" be built up with employees from other Deweek partments of the Commonwealth. w",58
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,"So far as my Deprivate partment is concerned I would not make an appointment without reference to the Board of business men appointed to quire into the Navy and Defence Departwhich ments, and it has compelled me, by means of special reports, to appoint six new clerks lately. Mr EICHA^RD FOSTER - Ver y well, Those six new clerks should be secured from other Departments, which seem to'me in respect to the high cost of living. to resemble rabbit warrens, and to contain about one-third more employees than they should. If I know anything about public administration, I know' that our DepartBut ments are considerably overmanned. never knew .Government offices to be so ' stuffs are being artificially inflated. overrun with officials as some of our monwealth offices are today. If could get only one-half of the efficiency that characterizes the conduct of some the big commercial houses of Australia we should effect immense savings, and we should satisfy the people who are a, long way from being satisfied at present.",59
306,Mr SINCLAIR,PROPOSED NE W,"Moreton) [5.24] I heartily endorse the sentiments which have been expressed by the honourable member who-has just resumed his seat, regard to the necessity which exists.for exercising the utmost economy present juncture. We have been expendprice ing money at a rate that if continued will presently compel us to call a'halt. It just possible that we have now reached a stage when we are paying 4$ per cent, our note issue to other people instead of the Treasurer. I throw out this hint thÂ© Treasurer in order that he may' sure that some of these notes, do back on him in a way that they ought to do. I regret that Parliament is about to adjourn for some weeks without private members' business having been first posed of. That business includes three Orders of the Day and some sixteen notices of motion. Unless some of those motions are dealt with immediately they cannot have the effect which their authors intenflour, ded they should have. Motions for the disallowance of regulations, for example, should be decided as early as possible. When we re-assemble after about a six weeks' adjournment, we shall have a of pressing business to put through. whole of our time will be occupied in transacting that business t ill <within a or two of Christmas, and then there ill be the iisual rush to get home. Thus members' business will not receive the consideration it deserves. The sixteen motions on the' business-paper will be inamongst the ""slaughteredx innocents"" - will disappear in the course of an hour or so on the last day of the session, I wish now to refer breifly. to a cruel movement that is 'in progress both ,inside and outside of this chamber, and which is deluding a section of the public I admit that very much might be done towards reducing the cost of living if the subject were tackled in a business-like way. many people are being led by the I press to believe that the prices of foodI Comrefer more particularly to the agitation we for a reduction ih the price of bread. "" This agitation is costing the country some of thousands of pounds, and that money is being absolutely wasted. The people are being assured by the> press, and particularly by the Age, that the price of bread could be considerably reduced. Now, there was a Prices Adjustment Board appointed by the late Government to inquire into this question. I had the honour in to occupy a .seat upon it. We went thoroughly into the whole question of the at the Â°st of producing bread. c We fixed, its at the lowest possible rate consistent with allowing the master bakers an opporis tunity to secure a reasonable livelihood, To institute further inquiries into ' the on matter now will merely induce many people to believe that it is possible to reto duce the price of bread, when, as make a matter of fact, it - is not. There not come are only two ways in which the not price of bread can be reduced at ' 1 the present time. . One is by reducing the price of wheat, and the other by reducing disthe wages paid tp the operative bakers We went thoroughly into the matteT, and took evidence all over Australia. We* found, in regard '. to flour, that fifty ibushels of wheat make ashort ton of and that, at 4s. 9d. per-bushel, the wheat-cost of a ton of flour is Â£11 17s. 6d. We. allowed Â£1 10s. per ton for gristing, It is a fair price, not an extortionate one. Thus, it costs the miller Â£13 7s. 6d. per lot ton of flour for his wheat and gristing, The We fixed the price of flour at Â£10 15s. per ton, and the price of offal at Â£ 5 10s. per ton; and as t i e product of fifty .bushels of wheat is one ton of flour, at Â£10 15s., and half-a-ton of offal-bra n and pollard-at Â£2 15s., the total income to the milleris Â£13 10s. per ton of flour, against a cost of Â£13 7s. 6d. Therefore the miller, after paying for his wheat and paying for the working expenses of the mill, makes a profit of 2s. 6d. per ton, which the Prices Board considered was a fair thing in war time. The position in regard to bread is as follows:-Eac h ton of flour, on the average, produces 660 ^ I b . loaves, or 1,320 2-lb. loaves. With bread selling ^at 6^d. iper 4-lb: loaf, the income derived by tihe baker for the ton of flour converted into bread is Â£17 17s. 6d. Against this income, he pays Â£10 . 15s. per ton for his flour, and the Board found that a fair, average to be taken from the evidence. tendered by forty-five witnesses showed that the cost .of labour and other expenses attached' to the production of 'bread was Â£7 per ton, OT a total cost, for flour and working expenses, of Â£17 15s. per ton of flour, leaving a profit to the baker of 2s. 6d. per ton of flour. These prices cannot be cut in any way. The only means by which the price of bread can be reduced is by going down to ' - bedrock and reducing the price of wheat. I wish to show that no advantage will be gained^ by any further inquiry into the matter, unless the Government . are anxious to secure the advice of another Board, such as the Inter-State Commission, or some committee, independent of the Prices Board, which was rather ruth' lessly booted out of existence some time ago, and, in order to do so, I shall briefly state ..the thoroughness with which the matter of the price of (bread and flour , ' was gone into by that Board. It came into existence early'last year, and, from the 28th March to the 10th August, it held sixty-five meetings, and made forty-five prices recommendations' to the Government, ' covering flour, bran and pollard (wholesale and retail),, self-raising flour (wholesale and retail), and bread (shop and delivered prices), for Australia. It visited, and took evidence in, the capital-cities of the States, and in other large centres, and called for returns from, and dealt with, 3,000 bakery businesses and 300 flour mills, fixing prices at 3,150 centres-25 0 for flour, and 2,904 for bread. In connection with the investigation of bread prices, 2,500 police reports .were sent in, at the invitation of the Board, and dealt with. There was some unfinished business when the Board passed out of existence, but the work was pretty thoroughly done. . I may say that the chairman asked Mr Brewer tb prepare an estimate of the savings effected, to the people of Australia by the fixing of prices hy the Board. The figures are not mine, nor are they the chairman's; they are figures prepared by a gentleman who had no interest in falsifying them, and they show that, as a result of the operations of the Board, the 'people of Australia were able to save annually, as compared with the prices existing before the appointment of the Board, to the following extent:-Bread , Â£432,566; bran and pollard, Â£198,000; flour, Â£273,216; or a total of Â£803,782. . Sir ROBEKT BEST - That is assuming a standard value for wheat.",59
307,Mr SINCLAIR,PROPOSED NE W,"The Prices Board had nothing toi,do with the fixing of the price of wheat. That had already, been done by the Wheat Pool. ^ Sir ROBERT BEST - If the price of wheat had varied that calculation would not stand.",60
308,Mr SINCLAIR,PROPOSED NE W,"The price of wheat is the same now as it w&3 before the Prices Board 'made its investigations. I hope that honourable members will give this matter the fullest consideration. There are thousands of people crying out for cheaper bread and cheaper food, and I am anxious to show them that the price of bread is now at the very bedrock, and that their agitation can have no effect, unless they propose to seize the farmers' wheat. It is cruel to lead the people, to believe that the price of bread can be reduced. The members; of the Prices Board were anxious to get to the very bone, and their figures were very carefully prepared. The price of-wlieat still remains the same as it was . when our investigations were made, and if labour conditions have altered since then,fcheyhaye altered on the upward grade, so that the cost of producing bread today is at least no less than it was twelve months ago, when we took evidence. The Government should get from the Prices Board the. evidence and particulars they collected, and submit them to the Inter-State Commission, if they wish that body to come to a decision; but, above all, let the Commission come to a speedy decision. Where we fai l in the effectiveness of bur. work Australia is that we take too_long to do it. We ought to step in and do somenow. thing at once; let the people know exmeat, milk, and other things. actly where they are, and where the these blame should be-really placed, instead leaving them to believe that they can duce the cost of living by marching the streets and breaking windows.",60

The honourable ber's speech bears oufc some of the appreWhat hensions that some of us have had the slowness of the Inter-State Commission in coming to a conclusion.

In hosiery, for instance, costs have gone up almost out of recognition^ It is marvellous to me how many careful housethe wives, working week by week on the ordinary wage of their husbands,' are able to carry on the homo so faithfully and well. Whatever our political opinions may be, if we can - cheapen the cost of the household, and increase the comfort of the people in town or country by bringing about better organization with regard to distribution and matters of that kind, we^ ought to bend our best energies to the task. I gladly welcome any discussion in the press or on the platform that will help us to a goal of that kind. . I should have liked one of the Defence Ministers to be present, because I-wish to speak of the hardships imposed on quite a number of wives of - our soldiers, and upon our. returned soldiers themselves. Mistakes have been made, and overpayments have occurred. . I have obtained redress in some cases, but in two I cannot, It happens occasionally that promotions are made abroad of which the wives are not informed by the men themselves, and of which the Defence Department here takes no notice, allowing the wives to go on drawing separation allowance to which they are not entitled. In one of these cases the wife was thus overpaid Â£60, and when the husband came back, hoping to draw 'a handsome sum in deferred pay, he was told that, although his deferred pay amounted to Â£43, he was in debtto the Department for the difference between that and the Â£60 overdrawn by his wife - In another casethat.of a widow with a young.familythe Department saw the justice of relieving her of the .repayment of Â£14. It might mean some expense to the Department and to the country not to require the repayment of sums that have been overpaid, but I think it would be better to treat the men generously. These in- 'partment. justices create an unpleasant feeling among the soldiers themselves, and, on the facts getting known, prejudice recruiting. I was under the impression that Â£12,000 had been made available to meet these cases.. Verygreat hardship is often created by the' present arrangements.",61
320,Mr RODGERS,PROPOSED NE W,We all have such cases.,62
321,Mr FENTON,PROPOSED NE W,"If a united representation were made concerning them,' the system might be altered. Many of the men who are returning now have been away for nearly three years, and come back physical or nervous wrecks. It is a great disappointment for them to find that deferred pay, which they thought they could draw on their return, has been overpaid to their wives as separation allowance.",62
322,Mr BATLEY,PROPOSED NE W,Has not the Department ruled that it will stand the loss of mistakes made by its own officers? ^,62
323,Mr FENTON,PROPOSED NE W,"Yes . In one case Senator Pearce intimated to me. that where it was considered that the Department was to blame, it would bear the brunt of the mistake that had been made. One man who has come to me told me that on one' occasion eleven of them passed through a kind of school while away, and were .promoted. They neyer thought of informing their home folk of the fact.' When a man is promoted from private to corporal, he has his work to think of, and can easily forget to mention the promotion in his letters home. A private's wife gets a separation allowance, but no separation allowance is given to the wives of those drawing 10s. a. day.",62
324,Mr FLEMING,PROPOSED NE W,That rule does not affect corporals.,62
325,Mr BAYLEY,PROPOSED NE W,It does not affect any one below the rank of sergeant.,62
326,Mr FENTON,PROPOSED NE W,"At any rate, these men have done their duty worthily, - and' should be specially well treated on their return. In a case which has come before me, the man has had over twenty1 five/ years' service. He was in some of the leading regiments in the Old Coun(try, went through the South African war, and has been to the present war. While abroad this time he was promoted, but did not mention the fact to his wife,who went on drawing her separation allowance without interference by the De-; We can afford to be generous in these cases. It will injure recruiting if a large number of men get to thinki that they have been unjustly. treated. Even if the whole of their claims cannot be met, but some concession is made, I dare say it will satisfy them. We aro still awaiting a statement concerning the expenditure of Â£2,050,000 on the purchase of fifteen ships for the Commonwealth service, and a - balance-sheet showing the results of the enterprise. I understand that the vessels are earning a large amount of revenue, and have been of great service to the Commonwealth in this time of shortage of freight. We should, however, have a Bill ratifying the purchase Supply Bill [21 SEPTEMBER, 1917.]",62
327,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,"I am not sure that even in normal times. The bulk, of the a Bill is necessary, but information garding the enterprise should be supbread. plied. There is a Trust Account now deal, with the receipts and expenditure, but, as the honourable member knows, munication with England is not very good just now.",63
328,Mr FENTON,PROPOSED NE W,"Surely the manager for the Commonwealth has supplied full information regarding the arrangements made in connection with the purchase. We should from time to time, as in, the case of the Commonwealth Bank, have balance-sheet, showing the, results of the matter undertaking. The purchase of a Comthe othei countries monwealth fleet of ships was part and parcel of the platform to which I subI scribed, although the purchase of vessels was left,rather late. However, the Prime Minister, when at Home, saw an opporSouth tunity, and took advantage of' it. France has set us an example in this matter. Early in the war/commissioners of foodbusiness stuffs were appointed, and, as it was that there would be a difficulty of transsaid port, vessels were commandeered. had been wise enough to get in earlier, we pay. could have purchased the ships at their normal value. As it was, we had to pay big price for them, and it is only because of the high rates of freight that we are making money on the deal. Speaking again on the question of the price of bread, let me say that the high cost of living is behind most of the present unrest. I suggest that, in the matter of paid. the price of bread, we should take a leaf out of the book of France. We grow more wheat than we require for our own conper loaf. sumption, but France finds it necessary to import a very considerable quantity of wheat. In the first year of the war, she had to import 1,400,000 tons; in the Melbourne. second year, 1,600,000 tons; and present year it is estimated that 2,500,000' tons will have to be imported to meet local, demand'. In spite of this disability, the French Government were determined that their people should have bread at the same price during the war as' before the war. 1",63

The point I wished to make was that the price of the quartern loaf in France is the same today as it was before the war.",63
333,Mr FLEMING,PROPOSED NE W,The quality is coming .down all the time.,63
334,Mr FENTON,PROPOSED NE W,"The French people may not have the same choice of flour toa day as they had before the war. In-the of shipping, and the supply of foodstuffs, France sets an example to all engaged in the war. In connection with the price of foodstuffs, may say, and the honourable member for Illawarra can, bear me out in this statement, that the last Government of New Wales appointed a Judge to make an inquiry into prices, and in the course / of the inquiry a baker in a big way of said that he was losing about Â£30 seen per week. Under cross-examination, he that he would require another Â£d. per If we loaf in order to make his business The Judge looked into the evidence as to his turnover, and he found a . that, in asking for an additional Â£d. per loaf, this man wanted Â£150 per week to make up a loss which he estimated at Â£30 per week. Unfortunately, when tliere is a rise of .5 per cent, in wages, it is often followed by a rise of from. 20 to 30 per cent, in the price of the commodity for the manufacture of which those wages are",63
335,Mr SINCLAIR,PROPOSED NE W,"The . Civil Service Stores, in Melbourne, lost heavily at 6Jd..",63
336,Mr FENTON,PROPOSED NE W,"That may be due to the fact that they deliver bread all over I have used their bread for years, and they turn out some of the best in the bread made in Melbourne. Criticism has been levelled against our the Naval Bases, and, in respect of some offcheexpenditure, there is no doubt that, it is deserved. Sometimes, however, the critics go the length of saying that we do not now require Naval Bases, and expenditure upon them should be deferred. There is no possibility of deferring it. A good deal has been said about the Flinders Naval Base. In Westernport we have one of the finest ports in Australia. I believe that the whole British Navy could accommodated there in water from 50 in Germany, to over 100 feet deep.",63
337,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROPOSED NE W,I do not think so.,64
338,Mr FENTON,PROPOSED NE W,"If the right honourable gentleman will consult the Navy Department, he can secure full information on the subject. The advantages it offers no doubt supplied the reason why it was selected by Admira l Henderson for a Naval Base. It ought not to be forgotten that, at the present time, arrangements are being made at the Flinders Naval Base to establish schools for submarines and destroyers, and for the training of seamen for our Navy in every part of. the Commonwealth.",64

340,Mr FENTON,PROPOSED NE W,"1 Â° admit that there is not deep water at Hans Inlet, but dredging operations can be carried out very cheaply there. Very deep water is not necessary for a base for submarines and destroyers; but in Westernport there is water deep enough for the largest ships in the world. Owing to the importunities of the Treasurer (Sir John Forrest), I will resume my seat without referring to some matters which I intended to discuss.",64
341,Mr LAMOND,PROPOSED NE W,"Illawarra) [6.10] - We were told when this debate commenced that the Supply Bill afforded honourable members the same opportunity to criticise the financial measures of the Government ' as they have when the Estimates are before them. The opportunity seems to me bo be limited ^to about half-a-dozen speakers, with continual importunities that they should refrain from saying anything on the finances of the country. I do not wish to detain the Committee, bufc the problems with which the country is confronted are of sufficient importance fco demand the attention of this Committee for afc least one day to a proposal - to vote Â£3,500,000. So far as we know we shall have no further opportunity of discussing these matters this year. The honourable member for Flinders (Sir Will i a m I r v in e ) called attention to some of the larger problems with which this Parliament and the country will be confronted in the future. We are rapidly approaching the time when Australia w i i l begin to realise that the Empire is at war. So far we have bepn able to conduct our every-day operations as though such a thing as the war hardly existed. In the course ^of a few weeks we shall see in Melbourne one of the great social functions of [REPRESENTATIVES.] (No - ) 1 3 9 1 7 -1 8 the year, that will be very much the same as its predecessors before the war, and almost every expenditure in connection with it will represent useless and unproductive expenditure of money that will be required in the course of the next year or two for the vital industries of the country - We shall find as time goes by that the sugges-. tions of the honourable member for Flinders represent sound statesmanship. The proposal that is made constantly from this side of the House that there should be economy in the public administration - is always in order, but every proposal to reNaval Base duce expenditure is not economy. The real problem that confronts Parliament at this time is the reduction, of expenditure upon unnecessary things, and at - the same time insuring that the avenues of employment in useful occupations are extended to the very uttermost. Of that phase of the problem we have heard nobhing so far. The question of.' what is fco be done fco find employment for those who will be thrown out of work when the'pressure upon 'the people is such that all useless'expenditure will have come to an end and every man must, of necessity, be usefully employed, has not been dealt with by those who are the leaders in fchis Parliament. Some honourable members seem to think that so long as the money is raised in Australia borrowing does not matter. It must be remembered that for every pound we borrow we are undertaking to find so much interest per annum over a course of years, and every loan we raise - places upon the industries of the country the burden, of maintaining increased production in order to pay the interest bill . A bigger problem than the war problem is how we are. to maintain in Australia the high' social conditions that existed before the war, alongside of this increasing interest bill, and the resultant increasing pressure on the people to bring them down to a lower standard of living. I entirely endorse the opinion of the honourable - member - for Flinders, that these times require that Ministers shall have a good deal more - leisure for - consultation than they can get while Parliament is sitting. Throughout the election campaign I - pointed that out. I hope that the Ministry will soon give some consideration to the reorganization of the system of conducting the governr ment of the country. Nowadays we have a Cabinet that consists entirely of administrators who are burdened with the care of Departments. What is needed more than anything else today is that there shall be established a body on the lines of the British W a r Cabinet, comprising three or four Ministers, whose duty will be to attend to the big principles of governmenb and have nothing to do with the petty details. Some Ministers, who were quite content at the commencement of this day's sitting to answer questions as to whether some one had sworn at a navvy, or in'regard to some other things utterly useless, complain when members desire a little time 'to discuss the bigger problems of government. I suggest that our need today is a bodv of two or three Ministers, relieved of the petty details of administration, and able to give the whole of their time to a consideration of the larger problems that confront the country during the war, and will require attention after the war. I shall be glad to find when Parliament meets again that some system has been devised that will enable these big problems to receive a little more attention than is possible under present conditions.",64
342,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,I have been i coal yard all this afternoon.,65
343,Mr LAMOND,PROPOSED NE W,"That should not be. The remarks of the honourable member Flinders in regard to the constitutional reconstruction-whic h everybody believes must follow this war-see m hardly to go far enough. We cannot say that, while the war exists we should give no considerataking tion to this problem. Honourable members overlook the important fact that the pen which signs the treaty of peace at the end of this war will strip this Parliament most of the functions it has been exercisthat ing during the last three years. moment peace is proclaimed 'the whole the powers we are exercising bocause a war is in progress will cease to be inherent in this Parliament, and all the laws regulations centering in them will pass into the waste-paper basket, and the Parspeaks liament will be as powerless as it before the war to do the work which is so necessary in Australia if reconstruction is to take place. . Therefore honorablo members should give some consideration to the lines upon which the Constitution to be re-cast, so that Australia may have system of government capable of bearing the burdens that will be placed upon it and of doing the work that will fall to the restricted. lot of this Parliament. These are matters of transcendent importance to every inditoo vidual in the community. that there will be no further meeting of Parliament this year-; that Ministers would have two or three months in which to devote themselves to the work of administration, and that a little of the time would be applied to the consideration of those larger problems of government which, so far, we have neglected at the risk of - finding ourselves in a most deplorable position when the war ends.",65
344,Mr LYNCH,PROPOSED NE W,"Werriwa) [6.19] - Not withstanding my disinclination' to do anything that mighb hamper the Government, I , too, think that a little time might be devoted to that question of pre-eminent importance, the finances of the country In fact, if the whole week were devoted to a review of the present position the time would not be wasted. When a Supply Bill involving Â£3,500,000 is of so l it t l e, importance that it does not arouse very much interest amongst the people outside we have an indication of how close we are to the dizzy edge of a precipice. W it h our small population, of less than 5,000,000, we are spending afc the present time conn my siderably over Â£200,000,000 per annum, and are being taxed by seven taxing factories, which are in full blast, to the exfor tent of Â£80,000,000 or Â£90,000,000 per annum. During the next five years, if no other loans are issued, we shall have to arrange renewals of existing loans to the extent of abcufc Â£30,000.000 per year, the Commonwealth and States together. We have to remember also that ,350,000 of our men are at present being paid-and rightly so-o n a scale hitherto of unheard of in military history, and a considerable portion of the money The spent on public works alleged to be of reproductive is really going into a sink; so that, to a large extent, we are living upon posterity. Taxation is on a scale and hitherto unattempted in the history of the country, but our ability to bear it well for the productive capacity of was our country. We must realise, however, that we cannot go on indefinitely afc the present pace, borrowing huge sums of money. Unfortunately, we are compelled - to follow the precedent established by the is Fisher Government, of exempting bonda holders in bur war loan from our taxation, and thus the area for the liquidation of , these huge liabilities is being dangerously As a worker on the land, I know only well that we are not developing, the I hope hinterland of this country to the extent that is absolutely necessary if we are to discharge . our loan obligations. Our people seem to be afflicted with an insane tendency to congregate in the cities of the Commonwealth; and live under purely artificial conditions, with the result that this problem of the repatriation of our soldiers is only one of, many which conf r o n t us, and, unhappily, it is rendered all the more difficult in view of our experience of closer settlement schemes launched in the past. I am afraid, therefore, that any attempt to settle our returned soldiers on the land will not be attended by any greater success than bas been achieved by those who have faced this problem on the closer settlement system. This proposal for extensiveland purchase for the settlement of our soldiers should be looked at very carefully, and the principle applied' as sparingly as possible. pressing financial problems are rendered the more difficult by the fact that we bave a very large number of our ablest and best men engaged, not in productive enterprises, but in the' destruction of wealth overseas, and, meanwhile, discontent is rampant in our community, and is paralyzing all our productive agencies. is the problem that confronts us at the present moment, and I cannot help thinking there is some analogy between it and the military situation in the world before the war broke out. The statesmen of our Empire were not able to offer any solution. They could only say, "" We must build two ships to Germany'so n e "" ; and the statesmen of Prance could only say to their groaning taxpayers, "" We must try - to keep pace with the jhuge expenditure in Germany."" It was not possible, then, to> offer any solution of the world problem, but it was known that the breaking point would be reached sooner or later, when the groaning taxpayer could no longer staud the strain caused by the withdrawal of huge armies of meri from productive occupations. We _ are all hoping, however, that a solution will be evolved from this terrible holocaust of blood and privation. What is the position today in the industrial world? People grouped unions, in the belief that Arbitration Courts would solve their problems, are faced with the phenomenon that, the labourer obtains an advantage in the price paid for his labour, there is a corresponding, or an even greater, advance in Mr Lynch. the price of commodities, u n t i l , as in the case of Victoria, the wage earned today has a purchasing capacity of from 10 per cent, to 11 per cent, less than that of a wage of fourteen or fifteen years ago.' Where is the solution to come from 1 Large - numbers of people all over the world are losing their f a it h in existing methods for the improvement of social conditions, and all sorts of dangerous doctrines-doctrine s which we must always oppose with the full strength of our being-ar e being subscribed to. And these doctrines are being preached in Australia. What are we doing to discharge our tremendous obligations? As far as I am able to judge, every second or third person nowadays - wants to get into a Government job, in order to escape the responsibility of his own existence. The old sturdy feeling of independence that marked the career of our pioneers in the bush is fast disappearOur ing.",65
345,Unknown,PROPOSED NE W,Sitting suspended from 6.SO to 8 p.m.,66
346,Mr LYNCH,PROPOSED NE W,"The Pisher Government, in my opinion, largely missed the finest opportunity that ever presented itself to deal with the problems of unemployment, high cost of living, and This excessive profits that have now become acute in Australia. I am - a believer in the doctrine that prevention is better than cure. It is impossible to devise any system for taking war profits from those who have been lucky enough to make them which would operate with perfect equity and justice, and would not interfere with permanent industries which it is necessary to foster. Bufc the Pisher and succeeding Governments did much to deal with the farmers' difficulties. During this tremendous confliot Governments all over the world, many of them antagonistic fco governmental interference, have been compelled, in the interests of self-preservation, to control production and distribution, the old method being manifestly unable to bear the strain that was put upon it . One! of the chief duties of this Government, apart from the pressing need for practising economy, is to develop our industries so .that employment will be found for all returned \ soldiers able to work, and for the whole of the into civilian population, and that, afcfchesame time, everything will be produced that we need for local consumption and use. If our whilst primary industries are properly treated, they will provide' raw products to be sent oversea to meet our obligations, and thus our prosperity will be assured. As one who for twenty-seven years earned his living by growing wheat, I ,that what the Government has done for the farmers has been of incalculable value. If a referendum of wheat-growers taken, and the farmers were asked whether, in the event, of the Government not only guaranteeing them 4s. a bushel f.o.b. for this and next season's wheat,' which means an obligation' of about Â£40,000,000; they would allow the people of Australia-wh o would consume about to get useful food more cheaply? one-fifth or one-sixth of the wheat proforesee duced-to get it at 4s. a bushel while quantities exist, I believe that the farmers would unanimously say "" yes."" Mr CORSER.:-'W'h y not give cheaper should, wheat to those who are fighting abroad ?",66
347,Mr LYNCH,PROPOSED NE W,"We can meet our oblifrom gations to those at the Front by looking after those they left behind - If wheat could be obtained for local consumption at 4s. a bushel f.o.b, the price of flour could be reduced by 30s. a ton.",67
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,B y how much would that reduce the price of a loaf bread ?,67
349,Mr LYNCH,PROPOSED NE W,"I cannot say offhand; but it should be possible, without doing injury to the farmers, to sell a 2-lb. for 3d. anywhere in Australia. A matter to which I wish to call attention is the possibility of great loss being caused to the farmers 1 and to 'the community generally in conplebiscite nexion with the marketing of inferior, rust-affected wheat. I tried to,""draw public attention to the matter in ' December last, when the wheat was being harvested. We practical farmers know that had the rust trouble developed so largely in a normal time, we should have had no market for inferior wheat. wheat certificates, especially in New South Wales, will show, that a large proportion of the wheat is either of no milling value or of very low milling value. We have ceived as an advance 2s. 6d. per bushel for such wheat, but not one pound of has been sold either here or abroad, and heavy charges are being paid, not only for interest, but also for its re-conditioning, bagging, and other treatment.. When v the Wheat Storage Bill was under conproportion sideration, honourable members were told the need for storage accommodation. It made plain that if we go on producing wheat at the normal rate, five or six must elapse before the last of our surplus i has can leave these shores, even should the say war end within a few months. Are we to . go on paying for. storage and other expenses on wheat that - has - little were or no milling value? Would it not be better to adopt the suggestion which I made in December, and allow this wheat to be sold at its real value for the feeding of pigs and poultry, thus assisting the growers to get rid of an asset of questionable value, and allowing the community I a huge loss on the inferior wheat, such and this loss will have to be made up out of the returns from the f.a.q. wheat. My suggestion was that the inferior wheat be kept apart from the other for us farmers.andHundreds wheat, the position put before the of growers who were opposed to the Wheat Pool have learned experience that its establishment was their salvation. These men would be willing to deal practically with this question, if the matter were put clearly to those who hold certificates for wheat of this class. My estimate, .going on what I know of New South - Wales, is that at of least 10,000,000 bags pf wheat are either - worthless for milling purposes or of small milling value in Australia. I suggest that when the actual quantity of this wheat loaf has been ascertained from the certificate deductions, and an opinion has been given by expert millers as to the lowest grade that might be milled, ' a conference of those interested should be held, and a of certificate holders taken to decide what should be done'.",67
350,Mr FLEMING,PROPOSED NE W,Are not all kinds of wheat mixed up now?,67
351,Mr LYNCH,PROPOSED NE W,"The mice plague resulted, in the opening of bags and the reconditioning of the wheat, and thus much The grain has been mixed. Had my suggestion that the inferior grain be kept separate from the good grain been adopted, the difiSculty which has arisen from this recause would not have occurred. But a large proportion of the inferior grain can it still be separated from the good grain.",67
352,Mr FLEMING,PROPOSED NE W,How do you suggest it can be classified?,67
353,Mr LYNCH,PROPOSED NE W,"We are told that most of. the agents can pick out the greater of the inferior wheat - It will of have to 'be separated from the good wheat. was If we attempt^ to foist the inferior wheat on people overseas, we shall ruin our reyears putation as being amongst the premier (wheat-growing peoples in the world. If it is sold inextricably mixed up with the good wheat, it will mean that a larger proportion of the latter will have to be sacrificed for the adjustment to take place. I do not wholly blame, the Wheat Pool. I believe that the farmers were the greatest objectors at the beginning. They can see now what it. means, wherever wheat is stored. I hope that the Government will take steps to consult the farmers, and evolve a scheme which, even at the eleventh hour, will prevent us from being mulcted in, perhaps,, millions of pounds. I am sorry to say that in New South Wales we have a huge quantity of inferior wheat. This is a matter which should be attended to. Notwithstanding the passage of a Wheat Storage Bill, we are now told that there is very little probability of the silos being made available for the coming crop. We ought to benefit by our experience during the disastrous years of storing wheat in the open, with abnormal rainfalls. I hope that an early start will, be made with the work of providing proper foundations for the wheat, dunnage, and some system of roofing that will not lead, to a repetition of the disastrous conditions which obtained with many stacks in New South Wales. It is a big question^ involving the safety of millions of pounds. I hope that amongst th? great questions which are now treading on one another, so to speak, for attention by the Government, this one will not be overlooked. It is not my intention to discuss the questions involved in the huge expenditure which other honourable members have made pointed reference to. We are all declaiming against a huge expenditure. Yet I think that most persons since the beginning of the war have really raised their home standard of living. What is being done in the home is being reflected in the States and the Commonwealth, and the self-denial weeks, months, or years which we all reckoned the war would call for have not yet arrived on the premises, so far as I can see.",67
354,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,PROPOSED NE W,But the. Government' is going to set a good example.,68
355,Mr LYNCH,PROPOSED NE W,"In December last I made a suggestion here, which, I believe, if adopted, would have resulted in a huge benefit to Australia. I suggested that if a tax of from l i to 2 per cent, on all wealth, including salaries of, from Â£500 to Â£2,000; in accordance with the proposals of the Government, were collected for a .term of years, and 10 per cent. .' of all wealth over Â£2,000 were conscripted for the purposes of repatriation-in short, to make the men who are fighting for our liberty and the freedom of the world co-partners in the whole concern to the extent of 10 per cent - a greater spirit of patriotism would have animated our people, and we would not be lacking the recruits whom it is so hard .to round up. I think that the selfish enjoyment which we see predominating everywhere is one of the chief reasons why our depleted ranks at the Front are not being filled up to the extent we all desire. I felt that I had no right to ask other persons to go to the Front and fight for me unless I was willing to give a proof of my sincerity, and I made that suggestion in all earnestness. I trust that a solution will be found for the huge problems which face us everywhere, not only the problem of meeting the tremendous obligations I called attention to at the beginning of my speech, but also the problem which has always remained unsolved in Australia, and that is how to live within our means. A solution cannot be arrived at unless a spirit of enthusiasm, a spirit of self-reliance, and an honest belief in the capacity of our country and ourselves animate the people. However feebly my arguments may appeal to honourable members, I hope that that spirit will arise, and that we will show an inclination to throw in our all, as it were, since it is an all-in matter. If it is held to be a question on which 'we can pick and choose, then We will subscribe to the doctrine of selfishness until we find ourselves submerged, by .the very evils we help to create around us.",68
356,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"Yarra). [8.18] - 1 did not speak when the Bill was introduced today, as I knew that Inter-iState members on bojh sides of the chamber desired to speak before they had to leave to catch their trains. No one spoke from this side except those honourable members who wished to leave Melbourne. I desire to say a few words now, as this is the last Supply Bill which will be presented before the proposed adjournment takesplace. What I stated on the first Supply Bill in this Parliament is borne out by the presentation of this one. I said then that if the Government had brought forward a B i U for six months' Supply, it would have gone through with very little criticism. The Budget statement was' delivered a few weeks ago, but there was no discussion Â«on its contents, and, if we may judge from the way in which Parliament has been proceeding, it is quite likely that we shall get to the end of the financial year before a discussion can take place. The National party has been occupying the Treasury bench for nearly five months since the general election. our party won at the elections, done as little, and neglected to do as much as the Government has neglected to do, we would have been denounced by every newspaper in Australia. Ministers, or any of their - supporters, what have they done to j u s t if y their ence, to justify the promises they gave to the electors as to what they were going to do to w in the war? What have they done during the past four months and a half ? - The Government cannot point to one single measure. Their taxation proposals, as I have said before, are a farce and a fraud on the public. The Wartime Profits Tax Assessment Bill has been denounced by supporters of the Government as inadequate, and by no one more strongly than the honourable member for Flinders (Sir Willia m Irvine), who pointed out that the great shipping, mining, transport, manufacturing, and other large companies will all escape. The Treasurer (Sir John Forrest) in in troducing the income tax on eligibles, said that Ministers often had to stand up in Parliament and support measures with which they are not in agree;ment, but that this ' particular measure had the whole-hearted support of every Minister. However, in less than twenty-four hours a change came over the scene, and, as the Argus told us today, it is freak legislation which no one can justify. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in ,.his Bendigo speech told us that we were to have prohibition of the importation of luxuries, - and we may all admit that such prohibition is more effective than even a Protective Tariff. But is there one honourable member now sitting behind the Government who issatisfied with the prohibition that has been proclaimed ? Is there one member, who claims to be a Nationalist and a Protectionist, who is satisfied with that meagre fulfilment of the Bendigo promise? There are only two items in regard to which the prohibition can be said to be effective, namely, motor bodies and confectionery; and as to motor bodies, we are told it is being re* considered. As to spirits, seventenths of the previous importations are permitted, so that the dealers in liquor practically will be in no worse position than they were before. The only effect of the prohibition in regard to spirits is Had that the price has gone up; but, like the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr . Finlayson), I am not much concerned about that. To-day, we had the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Sinclair) I ask dealing with the question of the high cost of living. The Board of which that existgentleman is a member did excellent work, though whether the powers of the Board were great enough is another matter. It was the first Board of the kind, I believe, appointed by the Commonwealth, though the States had taken some steps, and, in my opinion, their inquiries might have been extended.",68
357,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,"And have we not been told today that, as a result of the investigations, we cannot reduce the price of bread ?",69
358,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"I have said on the platform outside, and I repeat here, that the increase of prices in regard to bread, sugar, and butter combined, does not = equal half of the increase in the case of meat. It is proved by the figures of Mr . Knibbs that the increase in the price of meat is more than double that of those three articles put together.",69
359,Mr RODGERS,PROPOSED NE W,"If can hardly ' be claimed, as in the other cases, that the increase in the price of meat is due to excess of exports.",69
360,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"I believe there may be other causes. However, the increase has not been so great in any of the articles I have mentioned as in those articles which are used and worn by the people, 6uch as hosiery, clothing, boots, and piece goods such as calico, linen sheetings, &c. Let any honourable member ask his wife, and he will be told that hosiery today is at least three times dearer than it was before the war, while' the quality has deteriorated; and the increase has also been very great in the other items I have mentioned.",69
361,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPOSED NE W,Why ?,69
362,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,I do not know.,70
363,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPOSED NE W,"It is because hosiery is unobtainable, . '",70
364,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"That may be one reason. But we must not forget that wool, which is produced in Australia, and is being made into knitting yarn here today for the purpose of making socks for our relatives at the Front, has more than doubled in price. There is no reason for some of the increased prices from which we suffer. For instance, market gardeners' produce, in the metropolitan area of this State, has doubled and trebled in price compared with two or three years ago; and it is such increases as these that have caused the outcry. At a meeting in Melbourne I made a remark, which did not find favour with the audience, to the effect that the people here do not realise the nervous condition to which this war has brought us-the y do Hot realise that, owing to this, we cannot think and reason so clearly as we did before the war started.",70
365,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,That is just what I have been thinking all this week!,70
366,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"That is quite possible, because it is only what I thought about the honourable member when he was in Opposition. Another matter to which I should like to refer is the proposed appointment of an additional Minister. It is my intention, at the proper time, to read the re-, marks which - were made by the present Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) when the last additional Minister' was appointed, aud to ask him whether he is still of the same opinion. What that gentleman said was that an appointment of the kind would be useless, and that the object of the proposal to provide an additional salary was merely to save Ministers from dipping into their own pockets.",70
367,Mr GROOM,PROPOSED NE W,You did not agree with that criticism.,70
368,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,No ; and I do not agree with it now. I have never been found objecting to men being paid for the labour they perform. Mr Rodgers.:-The proposed new Minister will easily earn his salary.,70
369,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"If there is a position which needs the most .capable man that Australia can produce it is that of the Minister for Repatriation. Further, if there is a position that will kill a Minister sooner than any other it is this. The problems to be solved are most difficult, and will probably wreck many a Government before the whole' of our returned soldiers are settled. There is just one other matter to which I desire to refer, namely, the taunt that is continually being hurled at the workers that they have adopted a slowing-down . policy, and that they do not produce as much today as they a little time ago.",70
370,Mr GREGORY,PROPOSED NE W,"Does'no t the honourable member think that that is so? Mr TUDOR;-In rebuttal of that charge, I propose to give the figures supplied by the employers themselves to-the State Statisticians - These figures are clearly set out in the monthly volume published by the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr Knibbs. I assume that the employers are not likely to lie by affirming that they pay the employees less wages than they really do pay them. They may state that they pay more, but they are not likely to say that they pay less. Thesefiguresshow that in 1913, the wages paid in the whole of the factories throughout Australia amounted to Â£33,606,000, whilst the output of the factories was worth Â£161,560,000. .Consequently, the wages represented 20f per cent, of the value of the output. That is equivalent to a little more than 4s. in the Â£1. In 1914, the wages paid totalled Â£34,103,000, whilst the output of the factories amounted to Â£166,450,000. In that year,' therefore, wages represented 20J per cent, of the value of the output. In 1915, the wages paid amounted to Â£33,210,000, and the output of the factories had increased to Â£169,086,000. Thus, in'that year, the wages represented only T9Â£ per cent, of the value of the output. I have supplied the Committee with the figures relating to the last three years for which they are available. These figures convincingly prove that, instead of wages costing more than the value of the output, there has been a decrease in the wages paid in proportion to the value of the output, from 2Qf per cent, to 19^ per cent. Mr. JOSEPH CO,OK - Hav e I not always told the honourable member that labour fared worse when there were Labour Governments in power?",70
371,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"The Minister for the Navy may say what he chooses. But it is abundantly evident that the wages cost in the production of manufactured commodities is gradually becoming less. I admit that raw material is costing more, but that does not explain why wages have decreased. If the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir"" Robert desires it, I shall be happy to give the whole of the figures contained in the tables from which. I have quoted. Froin those tables I gather that in 1913 the employers' share in land and buildings, and plant and machinery, amounted to Â£76,000,000, that in 1914 it had increased to Â£80,500,000, and that in 1915 it had still further increased Â£81,500,000, and this is apart from the share which he takes from the value added during the process of manufacture. The employers' share is thus becoming larger, whilst the workers' share is becoming smaller. '",70
372,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,"In order to be fair, will the honourable member now tell us what was the return on capital?",71
373,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"That information is not given. The headings of the different columns read-Factories , number of hands employed, wages paid, fuel used, materials, amount added in process of manufacture, land and buildings, - output. In the first year when the wages paid amounted. to Â£33,606,000, the amount added in process of manufacture was Â£65,153,000, so that the amount appropriated by the employers was nearly as much as was the whole of the wages.",71
374,Mr MAXWELL,PROPOSED NE W,What does that prove?,71
375,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"It proves that the workers are producing more instead of less, which is the stock argument of honourable members opposite.",71
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,"Unles s the honourable member can show that there has been a bigger return on capital, he is proving that the workers are going slow. Mr..TUDOR - Not at all. It is idle for the Minister for the Navy to argue in that' way, seeing that the worker in 1915 was getting only Â£19 10s. for every Â£100 worth of commodities he produced, whereas in 1913 he got Â£20 10s. out of every Â£100 worth of the goods manufactured.",71
377,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPOSED NE W,Is he getting lower wages ? .,71
378,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,No ; but he is receiving a smaller percentage on the value of the 1 commodities which he produces.,71
379,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROPOSED NE W,Machiner y and raw material are responsible for the difference.,71
380,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"The employers' share is getting - larger each year, whilst the workers' share is getting smaller. In . 1914, when the wages paid amounted to Best) Â£34,108,000, the amount added in process of manufacture was Â£66,681,000, so that the employers received Â£32,500,000 as their share of this production, whilst the workers received Â£34,000,000 as their share. The following year, when the wages paid amounted to Â£33,210,000, the amount added in process,of manufacture represented Â£66,310,000. So that in 1915 to the manufacturers were getting nearly as much for their share as the whole of the wages paid to their workmen.",71
381,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,"Is the interest on the capital employed given in the figures which the honourable member has quoted? Mr TUDOR,-No : but judging by the increase which has taken place in the amount invested in land and. buildings, and plant and machinery",71
382,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROPOSED NE W,That is due to the x increased cost of machinery ,71
383,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"Why , my honourable friend knows perfectly well that out of the sum of Â£42,900,000 which has been spent upon plant and machinery in factories, throughout the Commonwealth) probably less than Â£1,000,000 has been expended since the outbreak of war. The honourable member, having been in the Customs Department, knows that, although not 1\ per cent, of machinery, finished or unfinished, has been imported during that period, the employers have inflated the value that they put on their land, buildings, and machinery by about Â£5,500,000. Instead of there being, a goslow policy on the part of the workmen, iti is quite the contrary, and the refutation of. the honourable member's statement that the workers of .this community adopt) a "" go-slow "" policy is to be found in the figures that he has given us.",71
384,Mr GREGORY,PROPOSED NE W,Why did the Minister fbr Defence go down to the Clothing Factory?,71
385,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,I do not know; I was not in the' Ministry at the time. I suppose that the honourable member means that the workers were not compelled to ' work at the rate of speed which private employers impose upon their workmen.,71
386,Mr FENTON,PROPOSED NE W,Uniform s are turned out as cheaply as in other parts of the world.',71
387,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"We know that articles are turned out from Government factories as - cheaply as they are produced under contract by the ^private employer or manufacturer. That is stated in the report of the Minister, for Defence (Senator Pearce), whom honourable members opposite condemned, but still keep in office.",71
388,Mr MAXWELL,PROPOSED NE W,The honourable member kept him in office.,72
389,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"Of course; the party elected him to the position. I do not know whether lionorable members opposite elected him Minister for Defence, or whether they had to keep him at the Defence Department as a part of the bargain they made. If they claim that the Clothing Factory is not being ' properly conducted, they have the power to close it. ,",72
390,Mr FLEMING,PROPOSED NE W,The quality of the uniforms 'has deteriorated considerably.,72
391,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"I do not think that the whole of the cloth is produced fro m the Commonwealth Woollen M ill . Some of it is purchased under contract from other woollen manufacturers. ' Our Australian factories can turn as good a cloth as can be produced in any other part of the world. If the Australian worker has a chance, he can turn out just aa good an article as the worker of any other country can produce. I am not one of those who are continuously decrying our factories and our workmen. â I regret that we have not the opportunity of dealing with the full financial proposals of the Government. We have been in session for about eight or ten weeks, and for some reason or other best known to Ministers we are now asked to close down after passing a Bill for three months' .Supply. When we meet .again, it will be so close fco Christmas that we shall be asked to pas3 another three months' Supply, so that it will be well towards the end of the financial year, - when most of the money has been spent, before the opportunity will be presented to deal with the financial proposals of the, Government. Ministers, apparently, say that they have no other business for the time: being. If they have completed the whole of their win-the-war policy, upon which they were elected, well and good; but the people outside who supported them are not proud of their work here. Treasurer (. Sir John Forrest) 'tells us that no further taxation proposals are to be submitted to Parliament at present. Apparently the men who are making huge profits and who, as theâ Prime ""Minister says, give Â£50 to patriotic funds and sob the people of Â£5,000, are to escape taxation.",72
392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,"The honourable member is howling for more taxation, yet on Monday night he will be down at the Town H all arguing for a reduction in the cost of living.",72
393,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"I shall take, every opportunity that is available to me to deal with the inaction of the Government in regard to fulfillin g the promises they made to the people. I feel"" sure f h at notone honourable member sitting behind / them is satisfied with their attitude, or with the proposals that fchey have laid before Parliament.",72
394,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"Corangamite) [8.47] - The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has pointed out that the increase in the price of meat has * been simply abnormal, but any out quite one who has studied the position knows that the price will probably go higher, because it depends upon the law of supply and demand. During the years. 1913, 1914, and 1915, when Australia was passing through the severest drought that has ever taken place in its history, graziers suffered heavy losses. There were no calves born in 1915, and those which were then f u n n i ng at the feet of the mothers were practically all lost. It is impossible in Victoria today, and almost impossible within reach of Victoria, to buy any cattle of fattening ages, and graziers have gone right throughoub the country, even as far ae the Queensland border, and afc considerable expense have brought down cattle to Victoria in order l h at they'ma y be able to have cattle fattening - in readiness for next year's market. All this loss of stock has made ib impossible for any decrease in the price of beef to be brought about for nearly twelve months. The peculiar thing about this question is that whichever is the most plentiful, whether it be beef, lamb, or mutton, the demand for that article - is not nearly so great as it is for the article which is not so plent if u l . At present the demand for beef in Australia is greater than it has been in The the past, and I believe that the demand for prime cuts is greater than it has been for some time pasfc. As a rule, when beef ""is at a high price, and wages are at a low standard, the butcher is able to sell all. the cuts on the beast, because the people. go along the animal according to ' the state of their purses; but when wages are high, as they have been in Australia for the last two years, everybody wants beef, and everybody wants - the best cut. They all want beef, which is not to be got. Many fatteners of cattle in the more settled parts of Victoria have given up the idea of getting any cattle, and are going in for breeding sheep. Allthis means a considerable scarcity. I am not interested in the cattle industry, but I know people-who are going into the northern part of New South ""Wales and buying 3^-year-old store bullocks for Â£14 and Â£15 per head, and paying truckage on them, to fatten, and then they are asked to sell the in at the old rate of Â£12 to Â£14 a head. Eather than do that they had better stay out of the business. Store cattle in Northern Queensland are worth as much as that. People selling cattle in the market today are getting Â£22 a head for an 8-cwt. bullock- a wonderful price-ye t they are losing money on it. Are they going to continue to lose money? Prom the Imperial point of view it is very serious that we are not able to send more beef overseas, but we cannot do it until we have caught up. the losses we have sustained. The honourable  wants to know what they are doing with the calves. I believe every dairyman is keeping his calves, although, as a rule, they are not of great value; but they have been at a wonderful price. All that sort of thing would help to a considerable extent. I hope the Government are going to overcome the difficulties in the way of amalgamating the State and Federal Land and Income Tax Departments. We could save a considerable sum that way, not only to the Government, but to the public. Any one who is acting for people fighting abroad has so many taxation forms to make up that he is almost compelled to keep a clerk to do that workalone. I know there are difficulties in the way of. this reform, but I understand the Government themselves are agreeable, and that something in the Departments is sticking it up. I would, therefore, urge the Government to press the thingforward. It only wants a bit of "" sticking "" to get it through^",72
395,Sir EOBEBT BEST,PROPOSED NE W,"It means uniform legislation. t/ . Mr MANIFOLD - What does a slight difference in the exemptions allowed by one taxing authority or the other matter in the long run? We can surely all ""come into line.",73
396,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,PROPOSED NE W,"There are six authorities, and you cannot easily get them in the one mind.",73
397,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"We shall never get them in the one mind unless we stick to them. If the Government go to sleep another election will be on us before we know where we are. - Sir JOHN FOEBEST - We have been in Parliament for six weeks, and have had no time to do anything. Some people seem to think Ave are machines,.to sit here all day and night, and look after these things as well.",73
398,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"It is going to be a great task, biit it is worth tackling.",73
399,Mr FENTON,PROPOSED NE W,What about uniform valuations ?,73
400,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,We want uniform valuations and methods.,73
401,Mr SAMPSON,PROPOSED NE W,"There is an exemption of Â£5,000 under the Federal land tax.",73
402,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"Does that really make any difference? We value properties now below Â£5,000 in value under our Federal land tax system, beiausc we have to see whether they will come within the taxable area.",73
403,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,We can do it if we can get them all of one mind.,73
404,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"Hithert o the State and Federal authorities have had two valuers going round in many cases valuing the same property, and differing just about as much as it is possible for any set of men to differ. There is no insuperable difficulty in the way of arriving at a system which will cover, not only Federal and State, but municipal taxation. I direct the attention of the Government to the question of the pay of the troops as they come back. I was successful in getting the pay of one man, to the extent of Â£17, after sticking to the matter for eighteen months. It was a complicated case, because he had lost his pay-book when he was wounded ""at Gallipoli. He was taken to Egypt, where . they issued him a new pay-book. He landed in Western Australia, because he had enlisted there. When he arrived there they took his pay-book from him, and woul4 not give him any deferred pay. They said his payment had to be finalized. Erom the time. I took the case up it took me eighteen months to get the man's pay, because the returns had to be London.",73
405,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,PROPOSED NE W,What was he doing all that time?,74
406,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,He had to live somehow.,74
407,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,I suppose he was drawing pay.,74
408,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"He was a crippled man. , Sir JOHN FOBBEST - Then he was drawing an allowance.",74
409,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"He was getting about 14s. a week from the Defence Devessels partment, but he did not desire to live its charity. He wished to take up busiping ness and use his deferred pay.",74
410,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,HOTS T much did amount to?,74
411,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"Seventee n pounds. The Department was going to pay him to only Â£7, but when we shook things up we to Australia. found that the returns were wrong, and he ultimately got his full is a letter referring to another case. It was 'written on the 4th September by the District Paymaster of the 3rd Military District:In reply to your letter of the.27th ult., relative to the balance of military pay owing to you in connection with your services in the Australian Imperial Porce, as above, I have to advise you that I cannot adjust the matter until the statement of your account in the field is received from the Chief Paymaster abroad.' Three to six months from date of your return will necessarily elapse before the ment can be expected to arrive here. It probably took the transport on which that man came from England ten weeks to get here, and yet he is told that he must wait from three tp six months longer before he can draw his deferred pay, which, he claims, amounts to Â£80. He has a pension,' but he does not wish to live on it. He wishes to take up a' small busi-' ness.",74
412,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,Canno t you work this case as you worked the other?,74
413,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"Yes ; but I snail take a different course of action. I am trying to shake up the Government, so - that Ministers may do something. I do not blame the local pay ofiice. I say that something should be done to alter the sys' tem in the Old Country - All the information regarding adman's pay should be made up and sent to Australia within, at least, a fortnight after the man himself sent from , has left to come here.",74
414,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,"A number of vessels have been torpedoed, and the mails which they, were carrying destroyed.",74
415,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"I never knew a mau so full of excuses as is the Treasurer. Coming to' another matter, I wish to know where the Commonwealth mercantile fleet is trading at the present time ?",74
416,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,I do not know. The vessels are managed by some one in London.,74
417,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"Privately-owned trading out of Great Britain have on been commandeered by the British ShipBoard, but our Government vessels are under the sole control of the Ausi t tralian Government I wish to know why 0 they are trading to other than Australian ports. They were bought to bring cargoes Australia, and to carry away Australian produce, but they are not coming",74
418,Mr COBSEB,PROPOSED NE W,"Yes , they are. There are amount. This five or six here now.",74
419,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,The honourable member for Wide Bay is confusing the Commonwealth Government merchant steainers with the interned steamers. ',74
420,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,Why has not the honourable member asked a question on this subject?,74
421,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"I am asking a question now. The excuse for the purchase of the vessels was that they were stateneeded to' move Australian wheat and other produce, and they should be used to move it. MT. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member cannot expect us to tell him where these vessels are.",74
422,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"What I wish to know is what they are doing? I believe that they are trading to ports in other parts of the world where they can' get freights higher than the Australian freights, and that they are thus making a large profit. But that is not what they were bought for. No doubt they will pay for themselves if the war lasts long enough; but they were purchased, not as a commercial speculation, but to carry Australian produce and to bring goods to Australia. Why ' are they not trading to Australian ports? I have been told that the whole fleet has only lift ed about five Australian cargoes since it was bought.",74
423,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,The ships have carried more Australian cargoes than that.,75
424,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"I understand that some of them have never been to .Australia, and are trading, not to Australian ports, but to ports where freights are higher.",75
425,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,Tlier e is no poiut in what the honourable member is saying unless he can show that the ships would be better employed in the way he suggests than in the way in which they are' employed. In connection with the war there is another point from which the question may be viewed besides that of the transport of our produce. It is as well that honourable members should begin to recognise that.,75
426,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,I quite admit that if the Commonwealth steam-ships - were commandeered by the British Shipping Board they would have to go Where they were told. But we know that they are not.,75
427,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,"They may not be commandeered, but may still be serving very useful purpose in connection 1 war.",75
428,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"Perhaps the M i nister for the Navy will make some quiries into this matter. If he does he will find that the statement that the Australian Commonwealth steam-ships are trading to ports to which the freights are higher since than are freights'to Australia is substanber, tially true.",75
429,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,"That may very well turning be correct, and yet these vessels may be used in the best interests of the Empire.",75
430,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"I think that Aus-. effect tralia should be given the preference in connection with their use. being sent on voyages as long as the voythe age to Australia, why should sent to Australia instead of to other parts of the Empire? I again express the hope that the Treasurer will press the matter of bringing about an amalgamation of State and Commonwealth Taxation Departments. It is of no use for the right honourable gentleman to communicate with the State Premiers, asking them to do something in the matter. Such requests are shelved. The Relying question should be forced. ' Sir JOHN FOBBEST - I did not comgot municate with State Premiers.",75
431,Mr MANIFOLD,PROPOSED NE W,"I hope that / by whatever channel of communication the Treasurer is able to take advantage of, he will endeavour to bring this matter to a satisfactory .conclusion.'",75
432,Mr BRENNAN,PROPOSED NE W,"Batman) [9.14] There is a matter which I wish to bring under the notice of the Assistant Minister for Defence. I desire to put in a plea on behalf of a certain class of returned men who, having been, discharged, find it very difficult, if not impossible, on re-enlistr ment, to recover the rank they previously held. The particular case on which I base my statement is that of a man who served for two years and seven months in the Forces abroad. He commenced as a private, and won his way upwards by various stages .to about the highest non-commissioned rank he could hold. As the result of illness he was obliged to return to Australia. Fortunately, he has so far recovered as to be able,' as he is very w i l L ing, to return to the Front. In these 'circumstances he finds that he cannot recover the rank which he won by his diligence and comparatively long service abroad. Mr GROOM:-If the honourable member a will give me the name privately I shall with the make inquiries into the case.",75
433,Mr BRENNAN,PROPOSED NE W,"I intend to put on ' ' record the circumstances of the case as in-- supplied to me. My informant writesI received a "" Good"" discbarge from the Imperial Force on the 6th April, 1917, after I had been away on active service the 1st Contingent left Australia in Octo1914, and had been a warrant officer for' thirteen months when discharged. Soldiers refrom active service are now discharged as soon as possible after their return, and are told that if they re-enlist they will get back their rank. I was officially informed to this by the Staff Officer for Invalid and Returned Soldiers, and this letter is now with my file at the Defence Department. In addition If they are to this, War Financial Instruction, issued by Minister for Defence on March, 1917, No. they not be 19, page 11, readsIn the event of any member of the Australian Imperial Force who was invalided to Australia, and afterwards discharged as medically unfit for active serviee; applying for re-enlistment for active service, he will, in the event of being accepted, be granted the non-commissioned rank held at date of his discharge. (Circular 145, of 20th July, 1916.) upon the Defence Department carrying out their promise, I re-enlisted a month after my discharge (May, 1917), but I have not yet my old rank back. I attach copy' of a complaint I have sent in. Here is where the bitterness comes in But I have been told that, in all probability, the position I held on the Australian Imperial Foroe Head-Quarters Staff in London has been filled.",75
434,Mr GROOM,PROPOSED NE W,That office could not be allowed to remain vacant.,76
435,Mr BRENNAN,PROPOSED NE W,"That is so. He says furtherI , however, am. not particular about the tion on the Head-Quarters, as I am capable of holding same in the field (Infantry), and would have done so on leaving the Head-Quarters. I feel that if I could get the matter placed before the Minister he would not allow a returned soldier to be penalized in this way when he is ready to risk, his life again after being away on active service as long as I was. I really came back to Australia on escort duty, just for the sea voyage, as I became run down in health, and this sea trip has been given to many members of the Australian Imperial Force Head-Quarters, who always returned with their rank.",76
436,Mr LAMOND,PROPOSED NE W,Has he been to the Front?,76
437,Mr BRENNAN,PROPOSED NE W,"Yes , he has.",76
438,Mr LAMOND,PROPOSED NE W,I asked the question because there are some men who do not appear to get to the Front at all.,76
439,Mr GROOM,PROPOSED NE W,"The quickest way which to get at the facts is for the honor-, able member to give me the name, so that I may make inquiries.",76

441,Mr BRENNAN,PROPOSED NE W,"Yes , he is.",76
442,Sir JOHN FOKEEST,PROPOSED NE W,And he is seeking to use parliamentary influence instead of making his complaint direct?,76

452,Mr BRENNAN,PROPOSED NE W,"I hope that the Assistant Minister for Defence will look into"" the case I have mentioned, and will let me have his reply. I wish to say a word for the special edification of the Minister for the Navy, and I ask him to give me a fair hearing on behalf of another man. I mention this man as being a representative of a certain class of persons who are' likely to suffer by reason of their attitude in regard to this disastrous strikei although 'hot them-: selves on strike, or being in any way active or militan t industrialists. I refer to the case of Denis Barry, in . respect of whom questions have been asked in of the Minister for the Navy. Barry is really a soldier or a sailor, rather than an industrialist..

457,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,"Has the honourable member made any inquiries as - to why this man, who was an instructor, is now a general workman?",76
458,Mr BRENNAN,PROPOSED NE W,"I take his record as I find it, and his word to me. Having for a number of years done his work well and faithfully, not being on strike or desiring to go on strike, not being associated in any way with any industrial troubles, he was asked to take the place of a stoker who was on strike, and declined. That offence-if it 'is an offence-migh t well be treated with leniency. Allowing for differences of opinion in regard to striking, I submit that going out on strike, and declining to do the work of another man who had gone on strike, are two different actions. Barry's attitude was, "" I have not been in this industrial trouble; I have' been doing my own work. I am not involved in the dispute, and, therefore, I think it is unjust that, because somebody else has struck on another ship, I-should be dragged into the trouble and asked to take that man's position."" If the Minister knows of any good reason, apart from that action, why the man should have been dismissed, I shall be glad if he will inform me of it.. On the face of the facts I have related, it seems very 'harsh miss a man after a number of years of good service, and leave him without employment. The only other matter to which to refer relates to the Postmaster-General's Department. It is very evident that tinues^there is in the Commonwealth Public Service at present an agitation to break down the policy of preference to unionists in the .Service, and tihat that agitation is together irrespective of the principle of tion preference to returned soldiers. It is quite clear that a special effort in that direction has been made in the Postal partment, and from the answers I have by received to questions addressed to the Postmaster-General, we must conclude are that he has been privy to it. If there is one thing that has been made more clear grievance. than another by the Prime'Minister (Mr. Hughes) since the present Government affected came into power, it is that not one stone of the temple of Labour shall be disthem turbed, and that whatever legislation has been passed, whether by regulation or Act of Parliament, it shall not be tam1st pered with' during the currency of this charge Parliament.",77
459,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED NE W,The men have pulled the whole edifice about their own ears.,77
460,Mr BRENNAN,PROPOSED NE W,"It is quite useless to raise a side issue of that character. I hold in my hand a letter addressed by Leslie G. Ogilvie, telegraphist, to his fellow-officers in these terms:Chief. Telegraph Office, (Sydney, l l t h July, 1917. Dear, Fellow Officer, A fortnight ago I had an interview with the Honourable the Postmaster-General on the subject of preference to unionists, at the conclusion of which he requested me to get him into touch with all known to me who are affected adversely by.the introduction of .preference to unionists into the Department, and request them tb put their cases in concrete form, and submit for his consideration, with a view to a satisfactory adjustment of this anomaly. Hy own case has been submitted as follows:"" The Hon. the Postmaster-General, Commonwealth of Australia, . . "" Sir,- I desire to call your attention to the anomalous' position in which ' preference to N unionists' has placed a few loyal and faithful servants of the Commonwealth Government, who are employed in the Postal Service.

If Fourth Class Dework is worth Â£255 a year when performed 'unionists,' it is worth an equal amount when performed by non-unionists, and in common righteousness it should be paid. As you aware, partly because of this, I tendered my resignation' for the present, in order to give' you an opportunity of adjusting this Have communicated with several others . known to me, who are similarly by ' preference to unionists,' informing them of my interview with you, and requesting to put their matter on paper in concrete form, and lay it before you without delay.

The letter Sydney, 7th July, 1917. continues-Besides the interview above alluded to and the foregoing, there has .been much more correspondence between Mr Webster and myself, but this should be sufficient to show you how the case stands.

477,Mr HUGHES,PROPOSED NE W,"Hear, hear ! Why not t i \ Mr BRENNAN - This forced hilarity re- , is, of course, very unconvincing. The reading of this correspondence has brought n the Postmaster-General, and even the less Prime Minister, who rarely graces the with his presence. To this document is appended a short foot-note in language not nearly so diffuse as that of the letters to which I have referred, but You will see from the above that there is an effort to form a "" scab "" union, the main plank of which will be increased wages and better working conditions, which can only be accepted .when they are obtained at the expense of other people. Mr Ogilvie objects, on the grounds of to join a union, but he is forming union himself, and has already taken action to secure certain results by collective bargaining, which is the basis of trade unionism. Conis, however; an elastic thing with these As the writer of the footnote says, it is curious that whenever an attempt is made to break down unionism, the first action on. the part of the person proposing to break it down is to for m a union.

479,Mr BRENNAN,PROPOSED NE W,"That is what the right honourable gentleman's friend is doing. The Postmaster-General - this great protagonist of unionism, who professes unionism - enters into correspondence with a subordinate officer, a telegraphist, behind the back of the union, and asks him to send along the names of these people who are going to form what is unkindly spoken of here as a ""scab"" union- a term which the Postmaster General, I am sure, has never used ih his long experience. I leave this case to the Postmaster-General.",79
480,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"As k him about the letter he sent on 2nd June. Mr BRENNAN"" - I do not wish to embarrass him too much - I want to temper justice with mercy, as far as I can."" But as we are about to enter into a recess, after the unproductive labours of the last few weeks in regard to winning the war, I merely wish to warn .the Postmaster-General that it is not safe for him, in the comfortable seclusion of his departmental boudoir, to issue circulars to subordinate officers, and to make arrangements with them for the purpose of breaking down a principle which the Prime Minister' at the same time, from the various platforms of the' country, is assuring the people will remain inviolate. Mr HUGHES . (Bendigo-Prime Minister' and Attorney-General) [9.45]. - I wish to reply to the question raised by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Manifold) with reference to vessels belonging to the Commonwealth Government line. I was not in the chamber when he spoke, and so have but a general idea of what he said. Shortly put, I am given to understand that he 1 wished to know where those vessels were and what they were, doing. I shall answer that inquiry in half-a-dozen words. The vessels are engaged, and have been, since the day they were made available to the Commonwealth, in doing the Commonwealth's business. With one exception, so far as I know, they have been carrying wheat and flour to Great Britain and Prance. There are powerful interests that are endeavouring, perhaps, to interfere with cr hamper the operations of - the Goverument line of steamers, and I warn 'honourable members not to accept every idle story as truth. If this Parliament wishes to know what' these ships are doing that information will Be made available. I can say, generally, in regard to these vessels of the Commonwealth line, that they have been trading to and from Australia. I am given to understand that the honourable member said that only - five of them had been to Australia once. As a matter of fact, there are five or six of them here now.",79
481,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,"I said, when, the honourable member was speaking, that I was sure there had been more vessels ' here than he mentioned.",79
482,Mr HUGHES,PROPOSED NE W,"There are six in the port of Melbourne or in Australian waters now. It is perfectly absurd to say that these vessels, from the day that they were purchased until now, have been doing anything but carry wheat and flour. They have been doing that with"" one exception, when, at the request of the British Government, a load of copra was carried.",79
483,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,That information was given by the Prime Minister in answer to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews).,79
484,Mr HUGHES,PROPOSED NE W,"I think it was. .1 repeat that there are very powerful interests that are affected, or think they are affected, by the Commonwealth's .intrusion into a domain which is purely their own. Whatever party we belong to, these, after all, are Government vessels. Whatever they earn goes into the Commonwealth Treasury, and I look to honourable members to support the Commonwealth in this matter, and not to be made mere pawns and instruments of a great corporation. The interests of the Commonwealth have to be safeguarded. , These vessels have done good work. They have carried cargo cheaper than others; and were the means of keeping down freights before the British Government i came. in and requisitioned all freights. I expect honourable members not to accept every story which is put forward as gospel truth. All these vessels have been doing good work for the producers, and I venture to say that, when the war is over, if it shall please Providence .to spare the vessels, they will be of. the utmost possible value to this country. The Government's proposal is to build more ships, in order to enable Australia, after the war is ended, to be outside tihe grip of any great corporation that could' levy toll on its producers. So long live I shall stand for that principle. honourable member for Corangamite could not have been made aware of the-facts. I know perfectly well the name of the corporation which gave the information,"" the channels through which it came, and the motive for which it was circulated. from any trust. These vessels are about the business of this country. Every one of them has to Australia. Only one of them has left this country carrying a load of copra. Hitherto they have gone between Austo tralia and the Continent. I think one of them went to Italy.",79
485,Mr TUDOR,PROPOSED NE W,It is only fair to say at one time copra was as much needed anything else.,80
486,Mr HUGHES,PROPOSED NE W,"It was. Of course, after all, the British Government domiI nate this matter. If they tell us to copra, we must load copra, or if they tell us to load oil for making soap we must load oil. We must do as we are told, cause they are running the war. But, as a matter of fact, all the time the vessels have been in commission they have been carrying wheat and flour, with exception. That is all that I rose to and I think that ""my honourable friend will accept my statement. - Mr MANIFOLD (Corangamite) [9.52] - B y way of personal explanation, sir, I wish to say that I had not the tunity of hearing the remarks of the Prime Minister in the early part of the dehate. I was not approached by any poration or trust or anybody in this matter. I simply desired, for my own information, to find out what the ships son for his disratement. were doing. I know that the Prime ister did not intend what he said as reinstructional gards my being approached by a trust a corporation. No person came near me.",80

All that I say is thatthat this great corporation-it is thet as greatest shipping company on earth-rha s its grip on a great ocean which -1 say is our heritage.

Mr. JOSEPH COOK. (ParramattaMinister for the Navy) [9.55] - I desire one to reply to the statement by the honsay, orable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) 'with regard to Mr Barry, He has mentioned the matter twice in the House, and I think that I should now state the simple facts. The record of opporBarry as read out by the honourable member we will take to be correct. When I - asked bim by interjection why it was that corthis.man had been an instructor and was now only a general workman, I meant to give him a hint that there was a reaI t is true Minthat he was engaged in Queensland on work, but it is true also *that or he was removed from that instructional work for incompetency. It is true, too, I that he was an instructor down here, and in was again removed and disrated for the same reason, so that at the time of- .this occurrence he was a general workman. In that capacity I am told that'he was doing drew his work satisfactorily. The other day there was a ship loading , t provisions for the war. The men working on her struck ab a moment's notice, and the arose of whether we were Ito let the steam go down or not. Had we allowed the boilers to cool down iti would have taken from twelve to twenty hours, according to their condition, to get steam up again. We therefore asked one of our own naval ratings to go - and work the donkey engine for an hour until we could get labour-from the Bureau, and he did so. We then wanted a man to t r i m some coal for hi m for an hour, u n t i l we cpuld get a trimmer from the Bureau. First of all, a reserve man was asked to take on this work. * He said to Captain Richardson, "" I am a unionist, Captain Richardson, but if you order me to - do the work I shall obey. I only want you to know that I am a unionist. If I do the work it may mean trouble for me afterwards with my mates: I shall be called a ' scab.' Having made this explanation, if you order me to do the work I shall do it . "" Captain Richardson said to the man, "" In the circumstances, I will not order you to do the work,"" and he did not. He then asked Barry, who was a permanent naval rating, and not a unionist, to go and do the work for an hour. This permanent naval rating refused to do the bidding of his superior officer, and was therefore dismissed.",80
492,Mr RODGERS,PROPOSED NE W,"Wannon) [ 9 . 5 7 ] - I wish very briefly to support the earnest appeal made to the Government by the honourable member for Nepean (Mr . Orchard) on behalf of a number of the first) ANZACs, particularly the sections who are in Egypt, and in respect to whom he read to the House a very interesting, but certainly a very disheartening, letter. Recently I had a chat with a medical officer who had just returned from Egypt, and he referred very regretfully to the state of health of many of the boys there. The authorities, no doubt, are giving the boys every assistance they can, but the terrible climate has left many of them in such a state that it would be a very merciful act if they could be returned for a spell or changed to some other - theatre. I do not wish to refer to the correspondence I have here, because I do not think it would be right to' do so, but I most earnestly support the appeal made by the honourable member for Nepean. From the time ' the Treasurer (Sir John Forrest) laid his Estimates on the table today we have had very many lectures addressed to 'the Government on the need for economy. I do not propose to j o in in the lectures, but I think that a fair description of the modern economist in the House is a man who can detect some opportunities for saving in the other member's constituency, and particularly in the other States. I wish to draw the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) to the report of an interview between a member of the Ministiy and about t h i r ty members of the House, who 'made a special appeal that another Parliament House should be built afc 'the present time, and that! at Canberra. This is a departure from their advocacy of economy. The deputation was headed by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Chapman), who, in the House, lec-. - toired the Treasurer on the score of economy, who would cut"" down the salary, for a new Minister, but who would spend Â£300,000 by one stroke of the pen in the Federal Territory.",81
493,Mr MATHEWS,PROPOSED NE W,"To .be fair , you ought to mention that he said it would be a good place for the repatriation of returned soldiers.",81
494,Mr RODGERS,PROPOSED NE W,"I know he did ; but if it is proposed to repatriate men by sending them to a place with the climate and conditions of Canberra, we might as well send them on another campaign at the Front.  ber with the deputation ?",81

497,Mr RODGERS,PROPOSED NE W,"Ha d it been a deputation from outside, I should have raised no objection, but it was a deputation consisting of members of Parliament; and therefore I take this opportunity to submit that Parliament is the place where such questions ought to be decided. At the present time there are seven Houses of Parliament in Australia; and a pro0 posal, when the Empire is fighting for its existence, to build another at Canberra is one that the people of the country will not relish, especially when it is made by an advocate of economy.",81
498,Mr GROOM,PROPOSED NE W,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister), [10.2] - The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) and the honourable member for Nepean (Mr . Orchard) have spoken of a case of alleged unfair treatment of a returned officer who, when he applied to return to the Front, was unable to proceed with the rank he had obtained abroad. have an official paper here, which 'the honourable member for Nepean may see if he chooses, showing that the Department was justified in the action taken. I should like to say that, in the interests of those concerned, - it would be better for members, when they have cases of particular individuals in their minds, to submit them to the Department and first obtain an official statement instead of making ex parte statements in the House, and possibly, - in some in stances, giving to the public an unfair impression of the administration. The honourable member for .Nepean also said that there were eleven officers in good military positions in New South Wales who had never been to the Front, while there were returned officers without positions. Inquiries have been made, and I am able to say that, of the eleven officers, three are returned men, and two are medically unfit for active service. These men are in positions, and we cannot remove them, because they are unfit for active service - Another of these officers is over the military age, and also unfit for service, while four are fit for service, and, in these cases, steps are being taken to replace them with returned soldiers.",81
499,Mr MATHEWS,PROPOSED NE W,"Perhaps those four desired to go .to the Front, and were stopped by the Department.",82

503,Mr MATHEWS,PROPOSED NE W,"Melbourne Ports) [10.5] - I quite agree with the honourable member for Corangamite as to the inconvenience caused by the multiplicity of taxation returns, and suggest that something should be done to remedy the evil. I know that it is difficult to get six State Governments all tq agree to a proposal by the Federal Government, but it is worthwhile trying to .induce afc least some of the - States to agree, with a hone of the advantages appealing to the others. course, the State Governments refuse to even consider the question, we can only I trustfchafctheir constituents, who are the same as our own, will deal with them in . due time.",82
504,Mr SINCLAIR,PROPOSED NE W,We might have a joint electoral roll.,82
505,Mr MATHEWS,PROPOSED NE W,"We have been waiting for a joint electoral roll for some time, and* certainly it is very necessary, for, as things are at present, it is quite, possible for a man to be on the State rolls and not on the Federal rolls. Several of my constituents-who , I may say, are not my political supporters-represen t to me that they are put to a lot of unnecessary , trouble in the preparation of their taxation returns. There is a multiplicity of taxation Acts, and they complain that they are not given that information which is necessary fco enable them fco prepare to meet the demands made upon them. We are told now that there is to be a super- "" tax, and these people would like to know the particulars so that they may. make provision. For instance, I know of one man who is administering an estate of Â£27,000, in which there are several in - . terests, and he cannot allocate the money because he is not sure what taxation he may be called upon to pay. Perhaps the most significant address in this debate was given by the honourable member for Flinders (Sir. Willia m I r vine) , who referred to the fact that, under the voluntary system, we are not enlisting sufficient men to fill the blanks at the Front. He told us, however, that with a superhuman effort, only 5,000 mon over a certain period had been recruited, whereas 7,000 were necessary; indeed, the whole trend of his argument was that the Government would have to consider the question of conscription. It is generally understood in circles in which inspiration is not received from the Government side of the Chamber that the honourable member for Flinders would have been' included in the present - Ministry if he had been willin g to allow the. question of conscription to be dropped and to abide by the decision of the electors at the recent referendum. It is said that he intends to persist in his attitude until he secures what he desires, namely, conscription in Australia. I quite believe that he is. a thorn - in the side of the Government. We all know that the continual dropping of water will wear away a stone. At the same time, I do not say If , of that the strong-minded . member for Flinders will eventually wear down the strong will of the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), but that is nevertheless a possibility. I desire to tell the Government that the experiences of 90 per cent, of the soldiers who return from the Front are a strong deterrent . to voluntary enlistment. I am sorry to admit that. Although our Defence Department has accomplished wonderful work, there are in it individual officers who, by reason of their incompetency, have been greater obstacles to enlistment than any . pro-German could be. said so much, I may be asked to give specific instances. During the past two and a half years I have, day after day, poured into that Department legitimate complaints, which I have been quite unable to get remedied. Each of these complaints Â»has acted as a deterrent to enlistment. The statement has been made here that private employers are not keeping the compact which they made with their employees who enlisted-the compact t to reinstate them upon their ret u r n from the Front. I admit that the employer who respects his promise, and re-engages men whose nerves have .been utterly shattered, must necessarily be placed at a disadvantage as compared 1 with other employers. But surely Commonwealth and State Governments can keep the compact which they made, with their employees. .",82
506,Mr HUGHES,PROPOSED NE W,"And , what is more, they must.",83
507,Mr MATHEWS,PROPOSED NE W,"Bu b the Railways Commissioners in Victoria are not keepwages ing the compact which they made w i their employees. In this connection intend to - place on record certain facts, which I challenge the Premier of this State to disprove. Only the other night I was approached by an old gentleman, who is not a political supporter of mine, but who is a real old Conservative and conscriptionist. He placed before particular case, and subsequently wrote me, as follows:You will please find enclosed a copy of the notice given to-- ",83

510,Sir JOHNFOEBEST,PROPOSED NE W,"I agree with the honourable member that employers ought to keep their, promises to former employees who have returned from the Front, but I do not see how we can force them to do so. I expect that the Victorian Railways Commis'sioners would be able to give very .good reasons for their action.",83
511,Mr MATHEWS,PROPOSED NE W,"The letter readsYou will please find enclosed a copy of the notice given to , the returned soldier of whom I spoke to youlast night. He was one of the first seven who enlisted from the .Newport Workshops, leaving Australia with Having the First Contingent, and was invalided back twelve months ago last - August. He resumed duty in the shops in January last, receiving Os. 4d. per' day, with 2d. per day allowance, making his wages 9s."" 6d. per day. He was' notified this week that he was to receive an increase of 6d. per day, to date from 1st August last, this being an increase due to him having been agreed to by a conference' of employers and employees in the' wood-working industry,' thus bringing his wages up to 10s. per day. Today he received the enclosed notice. Another case is. that of a returned man, whp enlisted later than the individual of whom I have just spoken. He is a wood machinist. The notice to him from the State Government readsNewport, September 19, 1917. Â«I regret having to inform you that, owing to a shortage of work for wood machinists, the and a general reduction in the staff, your services as a wood machinist will not be required .after Saturday next, 22nd inst. Yoar services, however, can be retained on and irom Monday next, 24th inst., as a super, labourer at 8s., and Is. per. day, if you are willing to accept such work. Because a Wages Board had raised the of these men the Victorian Governt h ment repudiated the promise they had I given to them when they enlisted. That is 'not the way in which to increase recruiting. The treatment of ninety-five men out of every hundred who have returned is sufficient to reduce enlistment. It is no wonder that those who work side by 'side with men who have been treated a in the manner I have described refuse to me a enlist. They know that on their return they may be subjected to a reduction' in wages.",83
512,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,The honourable member should have given the Department an opportunity of explaining the matter before he made it public.,83
513,Mr MATHEWS,PROPOSED NE W,"When we make general stabements we are told to give particular cases. On Tuesday evening last, - when dealing - with bhis matter, I made the statement that the Federal Government would not act in tire same way, but a man chuckled. I asked him what he meant, and he said, "" Y o u r own Government does the same t h in g . "" He told me afterwards that men on their return from the Front had gone back into Federal Departments, and. been refused their holiday allowance in the first year, because they had already enjoyed a holiday for eighteen months at the Front. To-day the hon, orable member for Flinders rang a note that the horror of conscription would. come to Australia. If it does it will only come because the Federal Government have not looked after the men who have already enlisted. Neither private employers, nor the State Governments, nor the Federal Government, as employers, are keeping their contracts with the men who have enlisted. In the Defence Department men who were desirous of doing their share in the defence of this country are receiving most unfair treatment. The Honorary Minister (Mr Groom) has told us that certai n men are to be demobilized because they have not gone to the Front. Why have they not gone? They were anxious to go at a time when commissioned rank was open to them, but they were, not permitted to go. They were kept here because their services were required for training the men whom we were sending away, and now when they are told that they can go to the Front they refuse to go, and take low rank under men whom they have trained for the positions which they are now' occupying. The faul t lies with the Defence Department. The same thing is occurring in the pay ofiice. The newspapers speak of single men in the Defence Department who ought to be at the Front, but these men were anxious to go away during the first twelve months of the war. They were all trained men, and they would have received commissions, but they were not allowed to go then. Today, when there is no opportunity' open to them to secure commissions, they are told that they can enlist, but if they do so they will leave as privates.",83
514,Mr YATES,PROPOSED NE W,When ?,84
515,Mr MATHEWS,PROPOSED NE W,"The member draws attention to the fact that two honourable members of this House who have enlisted and are anxious to go to the Front are kept here for some reason or other. It is unfair to condemn men who will not enlist now, seeing that when they were anxious to go they were not given the opportunity to do so -- The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) has a certain rank now, but the moment, he lands in England he will get what the soldiers call a ' ' gutser.'' He will lose his stripes.' These others are in the same position. They were anxious to go before, and now they are called "" cold footers'' because they refuse to go. In this House honourable members in a most indignant manner bave charged them with being pro-Germans,- and have said that they should have gone to the Front 'long ago. They did not get the chance to go. A Mr Holland, who was a lieutenant in the South A f r i c a n war, holding a Queen's commission, offered.his services to the Government in the latter.part of 1915, and was sent into camp at Queenscliff at once, in the A r m y Service Corps. He carried out his duties so well that he was placed in charge of the A r m y Service Corps in the Broadmeadows Camp - He was physically fit, able, and a good organizer. He could do anything with his men, and I have received letters from the Front from men who were under him , and will never forget 'him. But he fell foul of some of the "" Johnnies"" at the Barracks', who will not go to the war, and, in spite, they demobilized him, and would not even pay him the money it cost him to get his u n i -' form. I have tried to get justice for - him, but I am told that it is impossible, because .there are returned men who can do the work he is fitted for. He would have been an 'ornament and of some assistance to the Australian A r m y if he had got the opportunity; but he fell f o u l of one Butters, a ""gilt-spurred Tooster"" in the. A r m y Service Corps, who is not fit to lace his boots. Butters has nothing like the knowledge of A r m y Service Corps work that he has, but, while he was turned down, Butters is in a good position at the Barracks, and will not go to the Front. Those are the things that spoil enlistment in Australia. If everything was carried out properly, and it was not possible to besmirch a good name i h this way, we could' have got plenty of men to enlist voluntarily. The bad treatment they rehonorable ceive while fchey are abroad, and the unfairness meted out when they 'come back, must have a bad effect on enlistment..",84
516,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROPOSED NE W," The honourable ber's time has expired. . Mr YATES (Adelaide) [10.35] - On the question of the treatment meted out to our soldiers when they have enlisted, I received a day or two ago a letter from the secretary of one of the unions in Adelaide which I wish to left place on record, so that the Assist the ant Minister for Defence may look into the matter. If the facts are as stated, an injustice is being done to men who have done their duty at the Front. I can hardly believe that it is correct, but I have been assured by others that these things happen, and the Leader of the Opposition in the N e w . South Wales Parliament tells me that his son had the same experience. The letter is as follows:I have received a letter frem one .members who is away at' the Front. He informs me that after he came out of the Soinme business his uniform was in a most deplorable state, and he had to be supplied with uniform, for which he had to pay SOs. further states that, hundreds of others have had to do the same. I hope you will ascertain from the Minister for Defence whether soldiers, as stated above, have to pay 30s. for a new uniform, when the previous uniform has damaged in the Bervice of their country. If this is. correct, well, enough said. Those words are pregnant with meaning, because such things, if they are correct, must have a bad effect upon recruiting.",85
517,Mr GROOM,PROPOSED NE W,"There must be something wrong, because provision is made for givevery ing the men uniforms when they are damaged and worn out, across the seas, can prove it both in France and England. I believe that a depot was recently opened up London.",85
518,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PROPOSED NE W,That is correct.,85
519,Mr YATES,PROPOSED NE W,"It is all very the late Assistant"" Minister for Defence (Mr Laird Smitih) to interject as if possessed knowledge. He once if he had remained Assistant Minister would have sent me abroad long ago. I tion of 'what I say .a statement made by challenge him to tell the House by what process he would have accomplished It is no good to talk in a "" hifalutin manner as he does, unless he' can something. He challenged me on my and I challenge him .to tell the House , what his age is. I guarantee that mine [92]-i "" exceeds his. He also said when I was memspeaking on the last occasion that when I approached him in Melbourne he made it quite clear to me that he was dealing with me as Private Yates, and not as the member for Adelaide. On the only occasion' on which I saw him in his office I had two or three other matters to attend to in the Defence Department and my wife in the vestibule, waiting u n t i l Minister was disengaged. "" When I returned, he was in conversation with my wife in his office, so I had a witness to the the conversation that took place on that occasion, and nothing of the kind he describes occurred. I take very little notice of what the honourable member says when he makes wild statements by interjection.",85
520,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PROPOSED NE W,I intend to treat you with the silent contempt you deserve.,85
521,Mr YATES,PROPOSED NE W,"I do not care wihat the Adelaide, 18th September. honourable member does. He could never hurt me, unless by some Ministerial subof our terfuge. What the honourable member says hurts no one except himself; it gives him a bad name with all those who love a new justice. I wish to give the Department He an opportunity to look into this case.",85
522,Mr WEBSTER,PROPOSED NE W,Would it not have been looked into if the honourable membeen ber had submitted it to the Department ?,85
523,Mr YATES,PROPOSED NE W,"Possibly . I submitted a case to the Postmaster-General respecting telegrams at Maribyrnong, and received a reply, every line of which was incorrect, as I was able to prove. I was told afterwards by the gentleman who made the report that he had had to eat word of it ; that every word of it was wrong. I have that on record, and - I wish to place this case on record, so that the Department may see . in thati the matter has been brought under (notice. Men who have? been through the heat of battle, and have escaped with the well for loss of a uniform have been charged 30s. for a new one, if the statement in this he letter is correct. The case is not a solisaid that tary one. Hundreds of men have been he similarly treated. I have in corroborat Mr Storey, a member of the New South it. Wales Legislature, who said that this has. "" happened in the case of his own son. do No doubt the Honorary Minister will age, look into the case, and if this injustice is being done, will have it stopped, and will see that it does not recur.",85
524,Mr FINLAYSON,PROPOSED NE W,"Brisbane) [10.43]. - On 10th August, during a discussion on thÂ© adjournment of the House, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) interjected while I was speakingIf your action is entirely non-party, why do you give countenance to the obviously untrue statement of Mr Bedford that any member of this House wishes to infringe the White Australia policy for the Northern Territory? Mr Bedford sends me the following comment on that interjectionUnder cover of privilege, Mr W. Kelly has made certain statements on which there is no evidence. The ""statement"" attributed to me is. not "" obviously untrue,"" because it was never made. I said that .1 believed "" many of the Liberals "" of the new Parliament to be suspect of complaisance or agreement in this matter "" of getting rid of the Territory at a bargain sale. I repeat the statement of that belief, and, in. support of it, have only to earlier statements and attitude of Messrs. Cook, Bruce Smith, and W. H. Kelly. Mr Bedford, in the affidavit which I have read to the House, said, .referring to a conversation with Dr Gilruth regarding a proposal to sell the TerritoryI have not, so far, published the conversation, and would not now make this declaration did I not believe many of the Liberals of the now Parliament to be suspect of comIaisance or agreement in this matter, and did f not apprehend danger to Australia's development and Australia's ideal destiny of a highwage country for the white man. Mr Bedford has thus answered the challenge of the honourable member for Wentworth. On the 10th of this month, I read to the House, and submitted for - the con-, sideration of the Minister for Home, and Territories, a lettergram which I received from Darwin. I wish tp read now another lettergram that I have received from the secretary to the Russian association in Brisbane. It is as follows: Darwin branch, Eussian Association, wired to Central Russian. Association, Brisbane --Following wire was forwarded by secretary. Australian Workers Union to Russian Consul General, Melbourne, viz., "" Much indignation here over Russian subject, called Josel Slip8hinsky, being finett Â£50 and three months' imprisonment for posting unlawfully letter to a person in Germany contrary to War Precautions Regulations. Facts Slipshinsky, brotherin-law Russian Pole, prisoner war' in Germany, wrote to him on behalf of his sister. Lettor addressed quite openly to German war , camp, where prisoners kept. Contents of letter never disputed. Nothing showing treason; never suggested same. Offence purely technical. Defendant wanted get information for sister from her husband. This explained Court, when defendant pleaded guilty. No evidence called by prosecution. Russians and British here want Crown approached and sentence remitted. Punishment out all proportion. Nominal fine would have met case. Slipshinsky unjustly dealt with. Advise you, in interest justice, make further representations latter. Following replywas received from Russian Consul to Nelson, secretary Australian Workers - Union:-""Regre t have no power interfere with administration local justice."" Nelson now wiring Attorney-General and members Parliament. Russian Association, Darwin, after considering this, Central Russian Association, Brisbane, passed resolution:-""We protest against imposing on Slipshinsky sueh heavy, out-of-proportion punishment."" And executive was instructed to lay the matter before you and Mr Tudor. Obviously, an outrageous sentence has (been imposed on a man who has acted in nocently, and has done only what many other citizens of Australia are doing. Sir JOH N FOEBEST - Has the honourable cite the member seen the Attorney-General about the case?",86
525,Mr FINLAYSON,PROPOSED NE W,"No ; but I have seen the Minister for Home and Territories regarding it . Thecase calls for immediate intervention, and I hope that the Treasurer will /assist me in getting' justice for this Russian, and that it will not be necessary for me to again direct attention to the case before the adjournment of Parliament.  honourable member for Wannon (Mr . Rodgers) made some references, in his absence, to a personal friend of mine, Mr Austin Chapman, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. I was a member of the deputation to which the hbnororable member for Wannon referred, and I a m \ in a position to say that, unintentionally no doubt, he did the honourable member for Eden-Monaro an injustice. He was.led to do so by founding his remarks upon a newspaper report of what took place at an interview with the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn). I was a member of the deputation, and spoke in the course of the interview. I wish to say that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro did not ask the Minister to spend a shilling beyond the amount already on the Estimates. What he asked him to do was to expedite as much as' possible the plans of the parliamentary buildings' in order that 'the foundations might ""be gone on with. One member of the deputation advocated that the brickwork might be gone on with as early as possible. - Sir JOHN FOBBEST - At what cost?  Â£250,000 to Â£300,000. It was the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) who advocated that.",86
526,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROPOSED NE W,"!- I thought that he was economical.  Treasurer made that interjection. What the honourable member for Wannon said will appear in the next issue of Hansard, and will represent the honourable member for Eden-Monaro as talking with his tongue in his cheek, professing to preach economy in this House, and going behind the back of the House to ask Ministers to spend more money.",87
527,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROPOSED NE W,I think rather dissatisfied that more money is not provided for on the Estimates.  there is not' more on the Estimates for the Federal Capital.,87
528,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PROPOSED NE W,"I think the honourable member for Eden-Monaro wants more expenditure there. i  that he asked was that the plans of the parliamentary buildings should be expedited. He asked that work should be undertaken that would give employment to general labourers, as, if that were done, many returned soldiers could be employed there in connection with the repatriation scheme. I say, emphatically, that he never asked for the expenditure of one penny beyond the amount on the Estimates. I am sure that the honourable member for Wannon has no desire to do the honourable member for Eden-Monaro an injustice in this matter.",87
529,Mr RODGERS,PROPOSED NE W,"Wannon) [10.54] I am pleased to have heard the remarks made by the honourable member for  Committee the paragraph upon which I based those remarks, it will be conceded that I was quite moderate in what I said. In today's Argus there appears the following paragraph:FEDERAL CAPITAL. PARLIAMENTARY BUILDINGS, ERECTION ADVOCATED. A deputation consisting of several members of the House of Representatives and the Senate from the six States, introduced by Mr Chapman, M.H.R. (N.S.W.), yesterday asked the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr. Glynn) to take steps to expedite the erection of the parliamentary buildings at the Federal Capital. Various speakers pointed out that the Commonwealth had entered into a contract that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales, and that contract should be fulfilled without further'delay. The Minister in charge of repatriation had said that returned soldiers, who were unskilled workers, would be available to carry out the groundwork of the proposed new parliamentary buildings - SuffiV cient accommodation that would enable the Commonwealth to remove the seat of government to Canberra could be provided at an initial cost of about Â£300,000. Several of the speakers asserted that their health was being impaired owing to the want of proper ventilation of the present Commonwealth Parliament buildings. I am pleased to learn from the honourable member for Maranoa that no such request was made by the honourable member he is for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman). I assure both members that my desire in speaking as I did was to see that no one went behind the back of Parliament to secure the expenditure of Â£300,000 when requests for .expenditure should be made on the floor of this House.",87
530,Mr MATHEWS,PROPOSED NE W,"Melbourne Ports) [10.56] - I wish to give a few more 1 reasons why it is difficult to induce men to voluntarily enlist'. ' The honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) is hankering after conscription. I know the honourable gentleman, and know of his tenacity. Like the Prime Minister when he sees a light, he intends to get to it, and the light which he sees is conscription.",87
531,Sir JOHN FORREST,PROPOSED NE W,What has that to do with other honourable members?,87
532,Mr MATHEWS,PROPOSED NE W,"I think that the Treasurer is still keen on conscription, and I am not sure that the honourable member for Flinders will not win him over to his side. I persist in this matter, because I know that by voluntary enlistment we can get the men we require. We cannot get the 16,500 per month that we were told by the Prime Minister were wanted, nor can we get the 7,500 per month that we are told are necessary now for filling up gaps, because that is asking Australia to do more than she can afford in men or in money, considering her isolated position. If the Government look after the voluntary enlistment system properly, we can meet all our obligations in connection with the war. I had occasion to attack the present Minister for Defence, not today, but six years ago, because he allowed the officers to run the show, in spite of the fact that evidence of their inefficiency and unfairness had been brought under his notice. The high cost of living is preventing recruiting. According to the Commonwealth Statiscient tician the purchasing power of the soveas reign has been reduced from Â£1 prior the war to 14s - at the present time-a reduction of about 33 per cent. our men enlisted to go to the Front, sovereign was worth 20s., and it is now worth 14s. We made provision for payorder ing a private 6s. per day, including Is. deferred pay. God knows when come back that Is. per day deferred pay will not be too much to give them. Of ment will adopt my suggestion there wilh the other 5s. per day a man might keep Is. for himself, and 7s. per week is not too much to give to a man fighting his counForces try's battles to spend on what he regards on as the necessaries of life. A separation servelooking allowance of 10s., with 4Â£d. per day for each child, was provided for in the case of married men with families. treated our men fairly, and desired to tain recruits by the voluntary system, would raise their pay in proportion to reduced purchasing power of the sovefor reign at the present time, as compared with its purchasing'power previous to the war. The Treasurer (Sir John Forrest) wrinkles his brow at the suggestion that fellow creatures. the soldiers' pay should be raised, and I freely admit his difficulty in securing necessary revenue for the present and also for the expenditure which will be necessary in the future. Still, we made Compact with those men when they listed to pay them 6s. per day, and are not receiving its present equivalent. There would be no need for conscription if the Government would give the soldiers adequate payment, and have regard to the diminished value of the sovereign today as compared with 1914. There is no scarcity of patriotism amongst the people of Australia. It is all ..very well the lowly-paid men to be patriotic while the well-paid people are showing no patriotism except in the form of talk and the waving of flags. If the Government, tion adopted. prodded on by the honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) and other honourable members who believe that adopted. voluntary enlistment will not suffice to fill the vacancies in the ranks, propose conscription, it will he the duty of myself and others to point out that there other method of stimulating enlistment, namely, by giving those who have gone to the Front a fair remuneration. If we amendment. If r . Mathews. ask men to be patriotic enough to risk, their lives, we ought to allow them suffi-' money for their own pocket expenses well as for the upkeep of their deto pendants. I appeal to the Government,, and especially to the Treasurer, who isWhen supposed to have a large heart, to investithe gate the facts which have been placed before theCommittee this evening, in to ascertain if there is not somer reason for the falling off in enlistments, they other than lack of patriotism on the part of the young men. If the GovernÂ» be no shortage of men to fill up the vacancies caused in the ranks of our fighting; by casualties and sickness. If , the other hand, the Government, are for trouble, they will deall they get. With the aid of the> War Precautions Act they may be able to> carry on without consulting Parliament, If we and, but for the arguments used by theobhonorable member for Flinders, I would we have thought that the Government were* the proposing the adjournment of Parliament some purpose which I do not wishv, them to have the opportunity of effecting.",87
