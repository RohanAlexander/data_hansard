1,Mr FISHER,ANCES TO WIVES AND WIDOWED,"WideBay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [2.31] - Wit h the permission of the House, I desire to make a brief statement. Some days ago the bands. Australian War Expeditionary Torces were transferred from jigyp t to the Dardanelles. They have since landed, have been in action on the Gallipoli Peninsula. News reachos us that action is proceeding satisfactorily. am pleased to be able to read the followallowance ing cablegram received today from the Secretary of State for the Colonies: His Majesty's Government desire me to offer you their warmest congratulations splendid gallantry and magnificent achievement of your contingent in the successful progress of the operations at the Dardanelles. To this the following reply has been despatched through H is Excellency the Governor General: The Government and people of Australia are deeply gratified to learn that their troops have won distinction in their first encounter with the enemy. Wo are confident that will carry the King's colours to further victory.'",4
2,Mr MASSYGREENE,ANCES TO WIVES AND WIDOWED,"Is the Prime Minispapers. ter in a position to inform the public what units have been transferred from Egypt to the Dardanelles? If that in - Hansard. formation could be given without detriment to the action now being taken, might relieve the minds of many persons here of anxiety ",5
3,Mr FISHER,ANCES TO WIVES AND WIDOWED,"W o are not in possesU sion of tbo information asked for , have not yet been relieved from a quest not to make public the detailed information sent to us.. That request was inado before the commendatory cablehas gram 'which I have read was sent.",5
4,Sir ROBERT BEST,ANCES TO WIVES AND WIDOWED,The news that the Australian troops have been landed at the Dardanelles is posted in front newspaper offices.,5
5,Mr FISHER,ANCES TO WIVES AND WIDOWED,"We are not in posseswhich sion of information relating to the actual foroe that has been transferred which would be of any value to relatives here. ceedingly small. We cannot say what part of the Australian Forces has been sent, and what not. We have twice witbin the last forty-eigut hours asked for this information, and we have asked, too, to be allowed to make public the whole of the information of which we are possessed.",5
6,Mr RILEY,ANCES TO WIVES AND WIDOWED,I ask the Assistant Minister of Defence if ho has read in newspapers statements to the effect that women whose husbands bave gone to the war bave not sufficient means to provide for the maintenance of themselves and families during the absence of their husmeadows? Does the Government intend to do anything to' relieve these women ?,5
7,Mr JENSEN,ANCES TO WIVES AND WIDOWED,"I am pleased to inform and the House that the Government bas determined that, from the 1st May next, the the wives of privates who have gone to I the war shall be paid an extra separation of 10s. a week, with an allowance of 2s. Gd. per week for every child under the age of sixteen years.",5
8,Mr CHARLTON,ANCES TO WIVES AND WIDOWED,"Will similar conon the sideration be given .to widows, many of them with families, who are dependent on sons who have been sent to the war?",5
9,Mr JENSEN,ANCES TO WIVES AND WIDOWED,Their case has not been considered. The allowance of which I have spoken is to be paid only to wives of privates who are at the front.,5
10,Mr MCGRATH,ANCES TO WIVES AND WIDOWED,"It was stated yesterday that the censor refuses to allow a they reply to a question given in Parliament by the Minister to appear in the newsI ask you, Mr Speaker, if the censor has taken action to prevent the publication of the question and reply in",5

12,Mr GROOM,ANCES TO WIVES AND WIDOWED,"I would like to ask the Assistant Minister of Defence whether he given consideration to a complaint that, in case of death, the payments to the children of widowers who have gone to the front is only very small. My attenof the tion has been drawn to the fact that a widow left behind receives an allowance gives some compensation to the family as a whole, but in the case' of a widower's family t'he sum payable is ex",5
13,Mr JENSEN,ANCES TO WIVES AND WIDOWED,That aspect of the has case has not been considered. NA NOTICE. BROADMEADOWS CAMP. .,5
14,Mr FENTON,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"I desire to ask the - Minister of Defence, in reference to a the matter which I mentioned some days ago, if he will make a full statement regarding the provision for medical attendance, and the general arrangements for the comfort of the troops, at the camp at BroadThere has been much commerit on the subject, and an official statement would be of great value.",5
15,Mr JENSEN,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,The honourable member was good enough to intimate to me about two hours ago that it was his i ntention to ask this question.,6
16,Sir ROBERT BEST,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,There is already a similar question on the notice-paper.,6
17,Mr JENSEN,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,The Defence Department has built at Broadmeadows six huts. Two of these will be for isolated cases.,6
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"Is it in order for a member to ask without notice a question similar to one of which notice has been given, and may a Minister answer such a question ?",6
19,Mr SPEAKER,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"It is not in order to anticipate a question of which notice has been given. Honourable members will see that there is quite a number of questions on the notice-paper, and that it is impossible for me to be aware immediately a question is asked without notice that it anticipates one of which notice has been given. I ask the Minister to reserve his reply for the question on the notice-paper.",6
20,Mr FENTON,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"B y way of explanation, I wish to say that I had not read the questions on the notice-paper for today, and that for more than a week past I have been making inquiries regarding the condition of affairs at the Broadmeadows Camp, which is situated within my constituency. The question that I asked was in renewal of a question that I had already submitted privately. There was no intention to forestall the honourable member for Kooyong. I was oblivious of the fact that he had given notice of a similar question. NAVIGATION ACT.",6
21,Mr GROOM,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,Can the Minister of Trade and Customs tell us when the Navigation Act is likely to be proclaimed ?,6
22,Mr TUDOR,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"There is an amending Navigation Bill before the House which I thought would have been dealt with before now. The Government desires that both the original Act and the amending Act shall be proclaimed together, and the Bill to which I refer will have to go to England to receive the King's assent. The honourable gentleman probably knows as much about these matters as does any honourable member in the House. Regulations to carry out the Act are now being framed, but this is a long proceeding. We are, however, pushing on with the work as quickly as we can. NEWSPAPER POSTAGE TO EGYPT .",6
23,Mr FOWLER,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"I would like to ask the Postmaster-General whether he has noticed that many of the weekly papers published in Australia can be sent to the Old Country for a penny postage, but that it costs threepence to send such newspapers to Egypt? Will the Minister endeavour to rectify what seems to be an anomaly ?",6
24,Mr SPENCE,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,The matter will be looked into in connection with any change of rates. PREFERENCE TO UNIONIST S.,6
25,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"It was circumstantially stated in the press yesterday that no one could obtain a position of clerk in connection with the Defence Department until he had joined a union. I should like to ask the Assistant M in istsr of Defence if we may take it that no employment will be given to anybody, even in matters of defence, unless he belongs to a union ?",6
26,Mr JENSEN,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"In reply to the honourable gentleman, I may say that the Minister has issued instructions that all persons who desire to get into the Defence Department with a view to obtaining a clerkship there must be in a union. That is distinct.",6
27,Mr GROOM,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"I should like to ask the Assistant Minister of Defence if that part of the Executive minute, "" otlier things being equal,"" has been eliminated?",6
28,Mr JENSEN,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,Not at all .,6
29,Mr RILEY,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"Will the Attorney General state whether his Department, in engaging any lawyer to conduct a case on behalf of the Commonwealth, gives preference to the Lawyers' Union ?",6
30,Mr HUGHES,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"In th© exalted and secluded circles in which I move professionally, it is not usual to refer to the Bar Association as a union, and, professionally, I resent the imputation. But speaking as a human being, I do not know what would happen if I did not recognise the existence of the Bar Association and give preference to its members. I assume that it would be impossible to get counsel of reputation a-d standing to take briefs from the Crown.",6
31,Mr BRUCESMITH,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"Will the Assistant Minister of Defence say if , when men are anxious to go to the front, there is any particular union that the Defence Department requires them to join ?",6
32,Mr JENSEN,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"In reply to the honourable gentleman, I am pleased to say that 70 per cent, of the soldiers who have gone to the fron t are unionists.",7
33,Mr GROOM,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"Will the Assistant Minister of Defence state whether his figures are correct, or whether those published by Mr Knibbs are correct?",7
34,Mr JENSEN,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,I think I am fairly accurate.,7
35,Mr WEST,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,Perhaps the Assistant Minister of Defence will state whether it is a fact that only members of the British Medical Association can be engaged as medical officers in connection with the Expeditionary Forces ?,7
36,Mr JENSEN,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,I am inclined to think that that is so. M ANUFACTUREOFEQUIPMENT . question,7
37,Mr MASSYGREENE,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,I should like to ask hides for defence purposes only. the Assistant Minister of Defence if the factories in Australia engaged in the production of equipment for the forces are all working up to their fullest exther tent?,7
38,Mr JENSEN,ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ON,"Yes, as far as I know. NA",7
39,Mr YATES,PORT ADELAIDEWIRELESS,It has been brougbt under my notice that the officer in charge of the wireless station at Port Adelaide is a German. I should like to ask the Assistant Minister of Defence if he will take steps to find out whether that is correct or not?,7
40,Mr JENSEN,PORT ADELAIDEWIRELESS,Yes . INTER - STA TE COMMISSION .,7
41,Mr KING OMALLEY,PORT ADELAIDEWIRELESS,"H as the Prime Minister noticed that, according to the Age. the High Court has the Inter-Stato Commission to be legally non-existent. In the face of that declaraAccounts tion, and of the fact that it has become a Free Trade Association, will he abolish the Commission?",7
42,Mr FISHER,PORT ADELAIDEWIRELESS,"Answering the last part of the honourable member's question been experienced. first, it is not in my power to abolish the Inter-State Commission, nor is it in the difficulty. power of this Federal Parliament to other ways. abolish it without compensation for the balance of the Commissioners' term. have not noticed in any newspaper that the High Court has declared the Commisdifficulties sion to have no functions. I saw that the High Court had stated that the Commission is not a Court, that the members are not entitled to wear the wig, or to the title of "" y o u r Honour."" But beyond that, the Commission seems to have very large powers, and to be exercising them. EXPORT OF HIDES . ^ Mr EODGERS - Has the Minister of Trade and Customs yet decided to relax the embargo on the exportation of hides that are not suitable for defence purposes ? I would point out to the Minister that large numbers of stock have recently died, and that this restriction interferes with the market to a considerable extent.",7
43,Mr TUDOR,PORT ADELAIDEWIRELESS,"I stated last week when the honourable member asked a similar that the embargo referred to Until hides are treated it is impossible to discover whether they are suitable or not. I promised then that I would have f u r inquiries made. A f t e r all, we ought to use and tan our hides locally. The action of the Government was taken for defence purposes. When the Government think it desirable for any other purpose to place an embargo on export they STATION. will be prepared to do so. The Government will consider the relaxation of the embargo in the interests of the sellers. NA ACCOUNTS.",7
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Will the Prime Minister inform the House why it is that whilst the Public Works Committee have reported very usefully from time to time concerning various public works, no report has been made available from the Public Accounts Committee which was declared appointed at the same time?",7
45,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I think the Public Committee is very active, and will continue to be so. The re-arrangement which has been made in regard .10 the financing of the Committee will , I believe, overcome any difficulties that have",7
46,Mr FOWLER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,That is not the only We have been stuck up in,7
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I should like to I ask the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee whether they have encountered in the prosecution of their labours; if so, what those difficulties are, and how soon the House m a y expect some report of the Committee's proceedings?",7
48,Mr CHARLTON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The Public Accounts Committe e have experienced some difficulties , but in view of the P r in i e Minister ' s statement, I think it w o u l d be better not to say a n y t h in g f u r the r at present. NA",8
49,Mr FOSTER,SUPPLY AND TENDER,Will the Prime M in ister in for m the House whether it is the in t e n t i o n of the Government to create a S up p l y and Tender Board?,8
50,Mr FISHER,SUPPLY AND TENDER,"I will t e l l the honourable member frankly that I have not had time to look in to the matter . of that character m i g h t be a good t h in g , but m y m in d has been engaged other matters. I will be g l a d , however, to look in to the matter and make a statem e n t soon. NORTHERN TERRITORY. SURVEYS : ARTESIANBORING : DAIRYING :",8
51,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUPPLY AND TENDER,"the Minister of External Affairs, upon noticeCan the following information be given with regard to the Northern Territory :(a) Has the country been examined between Alroy Station and Alice Springs for the route of the Southern Railway, as recommended by the Administrator, Mr Gilruth? (b) Progress in artesian boring. (c) Progress in dairying, and what has been done with the 500 cows purchased last year? (d) How many settlers have settled in the Territory during the past six months?",8
52,Mr FISHER,SUPPLY AND TENDER," The answers to the honourable member's question s are as f o l l o w : (n) Feature surveys are being made as per section 13 of the fate Minister's outlines of policy. The Administrator expects tliese to be completed at the end of June. Surveyor Stokes is now somewhere east of Tennant's Creek, continuing feature survey south to meet Chief Surveyor Bay, who is doing similar work from the south. (b) No artesian boring has yet been attempted, though tlic diamond d r ill showed an artesian supply near Borroloola, at a depth of 414 feet. Twenty-two sub-artesian bores have been completed at Darwin, and in the vicinity of the railway line to Pine Creek. The boring plant for the overland telegraph line route could not bo transported last year, owing to all available transport being engaged in connection with the Marranboy material plant now boring at Marranboy. Thereafter it proceeds to sites selected by the Government Geologist, between AIT Saints Well and Newcastle Waters. (c) Owing first to the delay of procuring authority, and second to the serious delay in the shipment from Brisbane, due to the disorganization of the shipping at the commencement of the war, the cows were landed in a deplorably poor condition, and calving took place at a period of the year when surface waters and feed are scarcest. The loss, therefore, was considerable. Owing to all settlers not being ready to receive cows they were divided between the Government farms and settlers. The Administrator is now advised BOARD. that the cows have recuperated, but the experiment of the establishment of the dairying industry must be postponed until the great majority of the cows are in milk-probabl y next year. (tf) One only. No special effort has, however, been made to encourage settlement in this direction pending further experience of those settlers already on the land (vide secA Board tion 10 of the late Minister's Outlines of Policy). with PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE.  upon notice If he will place upon the table of the House a statement showing the amount paid to each member of the Public Works Committee from SETTLEMENT. the date of the appointment of the Committee to the present date, showing fees and travelling expenses separately?",8

54,Mr HAMPSON,AMELIORATION OE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether he will consider the advisability of discussing with the State"" Premiers at the forthcoming Conference the question(a) of establishing an insurance fund for assistance to persons who are in distress through unemployment; (B) of devising a uniform system of registration for those in need of work; (c) of providing cheaper facilities to workers when travelling long distances is necessary?",9
55,Mr FISHER,AMELIORATION OE,"I shall be happy to' discuss with the Premiers the matters referred to (a), (b), (c), in the honourable member's question. BENDIG O LIGHT HORSE TROOP.",9
56,Mr HAMPSON,AMELIORATION OE,"the Assistant Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Wliether he bas noticed the report in the Bendigo press that the defence authorities propose to disband the troop of Ligh t Horse in Bendigo? 2. If so, will the Assistant Minister state the reasons why this is being done?",9
57,Mr JENSEN,AMELIORATION OE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:.1. Yes. 2. It has been decided, on the recommendation of the officer commanding the regiment, to raise a troop of the 17th Light Horse at Inglewood in lieu of that at Bendigo, and to transfer the members of tbo Bendigo troop to the bead-quarters and machine gun section, which arc situated at Bendigo. The reason for this is that it has been found that the number of suitable meu, with horses, offering in Bendigo in normal times is not sufficient to effectively maintain a troop as well as the head-quarters and machine gun section of a Light Horse regiment. PRICES OF FOODSTUFFS.",9

61,Mr TUDOR,FRUIT EXPORT TO UNIT ED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:Strong representations have been made on the spot by Mr Niel Nielson, the representative of the New South Wales Government on the Australian Commission to the PanamaPacific Exposition. „ Mr Nielson states that the Californian law provides for the absolute prohibition of the importation of f r u it which is known to be the host of the f r u it fly from countries where the f r u it fly exists, and that such law has been put into effect against the whole of the Commonwealth. His efforts to secure a removal of the prohibition, or even its limitation to those States of the Commonwealth in which the f r u it fly is known to exist, have been unavailing, and he reports that he can see no possible hope of securing an alteration in the attitude of the Californian authorities in that regard. NA TRAVELLERS.",9
62,Mr WEST,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"the Attorney-General, upon noticeBy reason of the railway passes issued to Federal members of Parliament, are members, when using them, or their dependents, deprived of the right of compensation in the event of accident or death?",9
63,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Not that I am aware of. Members' tickets are not free passes, but tickets paid for by the Commonwealth, and I know of no difference between the rights of members travelling on those tickets and those of ordinary travellers. The following papers were presented: Arbitration (Public Service) ActAward of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation ancl Arbitration in Australian Letter Carriers' Association v. Public Service Commissioner and Postmaster General of the Commonwealth-Opinio n of the Attorney-General. Copy of an Award dated the 8th day of April, 1915, which'has been made by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration on a plaint submitted by the Australian Letter Carriers' Association. Statement of the Laws and Regulations of the Commonwealth with which, in the opinion of the President of the Court, the Award is not or may not be in accord. SUSPENSIO N OF MR . MCGRATH .",9
64,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Barrier) move That the resolution of this House of the l l t h November, 1913- "" That the honourable member for Ballarat be suspended from the service of this House for the remainder of the session unless he sooner unreservedly retracts the words uttered by him at Ballarat on Sunday, the 9th November, and reflecting on Mr. Speaker, and apologizes to the House,"" be expunged from the journals of this House, as being subversive of the right of au honourable member to freely address his constituents. Had this motion been submitted and discussed months ago, some heat and passion might have been expected; but so much has happened in the meantime, including a general election, that I think it may now be debated absolutely on its merits. It will not be necessary to go into detail at any length, or to describe, except in a very incidental way, what took place when the honourable member for Ballarat was suspended from the service of the House. There are, perhaps, a few honourable members who are not quite cognisant of the facts; but those who were here at the time will remember that. I tabled a motion to the effect that the House had lost confidence in the then Speaker. The Government, instead of permitting the motion to come on in its proper sequence, refused to allow it to be discussed; and the honourable member for Ballarat went to his constituency, and there, on the public platform, said what he had been denied the right of saying in the House. When the House next met, the honourable member for Parramatta, who was then the Leader of the Government, drew attention to what the honourable member for Ballarat had stated, and submitted PAPERS. that if that honourable member had been correctly reported he should apologize to the House, or, failing an apology, be suspended. I think I am right in saying that the Government of the day justified the position they then took up by the case of Mr Conybeare in the House of Conimons. Much was made of the in cident in the House of Commons when the case of the honourable member for Ballarat was before this House; and it may not be out of place to very briefly state the facts. Mr . GROOM - I think the honourable member will find that the case in the House of Commons was quoted here only for the purpose of indicating the procedure.",10
65,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,0ur first standing o order provides that if any question arises [3.4] - I here which is not covered by our own Standing Orders we shall be guided by the .procedure of the House of Commons; and it was on this standing order that the Government relied.,10
66,Mr GROOM,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,That is so.,10
67,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Mr Conybeare, who was member for Camborne, had, at a public meeting, made a speech somewhat reflecting on Mr Speaker Peel; and when the House met attention was called to the matter by Mr Henry Chaplin, though whether Mr Chaplin was a member of the Government or merely a private member at the time. I do not know. Mr Chaplin asked the Speaker whetlier the speech of Mr Conybeare did not constitute a breach of the privileges of the House, and the Speaker replied that the "" speech was unquestionably a matter affecting privilege, but whether or not it was a breach of privilege rested with the House to decide."" Mr Conybeare spoke in the House on that occasion, and expressed his regret at what had taken place; and no further action was taken. During the following session, however, Mr Conybeare, in a letter to a London newspaper, repeated his charge against the Speaker.",10
68,Mr FOWLER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,What was the nature of the charge?,10
69,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"It was that the Speaker had been unfair and partial in closing a debate on the Crimes Bill . I understand that, in the House of Commons a closure motion cannot be put except with the consent of the Speaker. Under our Standing Orders the position is different, since a motion for the application of the closure can be put with or without the consent of Mr Speaker. Tn the House of Commons, on the occason to which I refer, the Speaker consented to put a' motion for the application of the closure, ancl Mr Conybeare then accused him of partiality, declaring that he had no hesitation in saying that the closure was, in the circumstances, simply a public scandal. The Speaker called him to order, and he at once apologized. Later on, however, he wrote to the newspapers a letter in which he expressed the opinion that the Speaker had not acted fairly. This action on his part was brought before the House by Lord Randolph Churchill, with the result that Mr . Conybeare was suspended. This took place whilst a Tory Government was in office. In the next Parliament, a Liberal A d ministration was in power, and whilst the second Home Rule Bill was under discussion, Speaker Peel refused to put a closure motion. That was in 1893, and Mr Conybeare wrote a letter to the Daily Chronicle, declaring that the Speaker's refusal to put the closure motion at a time when the Home Rule Bill was being obstructed was unfair, since he had not refused to put a similar motion whilst the Crimes Bill .was under consideration. He accused the Speaker of partiality. The attention of the House was called to this accusation on 4th July, 1893, by Mr . Tritton , Unionist member for Lambeth. Mr Gladstone was then afc the head of the Government, but, although, as every one knows, he always stood up for the privileges of the House of Commons, he made no reference to the letter of which complaint was made. It was lef t to a Unionist member to draw attentionfcoifc. In The Speaker of the House, by Michael Macdonagh, it is stated thatThe Speaker, addressing the House, maintained that his action in refusing the closure actually led to a friendly arrnngcinent between the two sides of the Houso. He deprecated any severe declaration on the part of the House which it might possibly be willing to take garding the writer of the letter, and added"" My only course is to leave my conduct to the judgment of calm-thinking and fair-minded men."" Gladstone, as Leader of the House, said he attached the greatest weight to the recommendation proceeding from the Chair, and Mr Thomas. thought it would be wise if the House would act in accordance with it. He added, however, that at the same time tliere ought to be no doubt as to the universal sentiment which prevailed in the House in regard to the impartiality of the Chair. Mr Balfour, the Leader of the Opposition, spoke in similar tones. Mr. Tritton accordingly did not proceed with the motion which he had intended to submit to the House.",10
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,But both Mr. Gladstone and Mr Balfour deprecated any allegation of partiality in respect of the Speaker.,11
71,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Undoubtedly ; but the motion was withdrawn. The position of the Speaker of the House of Commons is very different from that of the Speaker of this House. An honourable member, on being elected Speaker of the House of Commons, immediately dissociates himself from all parties.",11
72,Mr FOWLER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I tliink that the exSpeaker offchisHouse did the same.,11
73,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I have no wish to go into details, bufc the honourable member for Lang, while holding office as Speaker, undoubtedly attended a party meeting.",11
74,Mr GROOM,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,The honourable member is incorrect.,11
75,Mr FOWLER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I do not recollect the honourable member for Lang attending any meeting of our party while he was in the Chair.,11
76,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,The meeting to which I refer was a Liberal gathering at which he was reported to> have made a certain statement.,11
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Does the present Speaker attend the Labour party's Caucus ?,11
78,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,He does. I am not suggesting that the occupant of the Chair should not attend meetings of his party. I am simply pointing oufc the difference between the position occupied by the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Speaker of this House.,11
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,The honourable member for Lang did not attend a meeting of our party while he was in the Chair.,11
80,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"That is not the point. The point that I wish to make is that if re- we are to deal with the occupant of the Chair in this House as the Speaker of the House of Commons is dealt with, then both should be on the same footing. The meeting which the honourable member for Lang addressed while he occupied the chair was not a meeting of the Liberal party in this House, but a political gathering of supporters of the Liberal party. I sliould not have referred to the incident but for the interjection made by the honourable member for Perth. this House I drew attention to the statement reported to have been made by the honourable member for Lang at this meeting, and he stated that he was incorrectly reported, but he did not say that he was not present at it . It is an almost invariable practice for the Speaker of the House of Commons to be re-elected irrespective of any change of Government. That, too, was the practice in all the Australian Parliaments until the late Mr Beazley, who had held office as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria for some years, was replaced by Sir Frank Madden on a Liberal Government taking office.",11
81,Mr FOWLER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,What party started that practice in this House?,12
82,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"The Labour party; but the practice had previously been followed in the Victorian Parliament, and it is now observed in all the State Legislatures. It is now the general practice in Australia for a new Speaker to be elected from the party returned to power. In the British House of Commons such a thing does not occur. Another point is that the Speaker of the House of Commons is always allowed a walk-over. He does not address his constituents when a general election comes round, but sends a letter to them, intimatin g that he has occupied the chair of the House, and expressing the hope that he wil l be returned. He practically takes no part politics. I am not expressing any opinion as to whether that is right or wrong. Occupants of the chair in the State Parliaments take an active part in politics. Tho Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales was, u n t i l a little while ago, president of the Political Labour Council, and took an active part in its proceedings. ",12
83,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"""Undoubtedly . The honourable member for Parramatta was good enough to say during the last. Parliament that the Speaker had rights, not only as Speaker, but also as the member for Lang. I do not question that assertion, but the position in the House of Commons is different from the position here. At this stage I wish to read a quotation from a leaderette published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph on the 13th November, 1913. As honourable members know, this journal does not support the Labour party. When In the late Government were in office it supported them.",12
84,Mr MASSYGREENE,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I wish they had done so. They did not support us.,12
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Since your party has been in power they have given it very consistent support.,12
86,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"If the Sydney Daily Telegraph is a Labour paper it is news to me. At any rate, in this leaderette, headed "" The Iron H and , "" the following passage occurs: It is rather a matter for regret that, with so many bigger questions in front of the Commonwealth Government, it should waste its strength, and compromise its sense of proportion, by squabbling with a new-elected Labour member over his choice of words when exercising a citizen's right at a public meeting to criticise the official acts of the Speaker. During the course of parliamentary debate it is necessary that the Speaker's conduct should only be the subject of challenge under specific motions, as otherwise respect for the authority of the Chair could not be maintained, nor could business be carried on. But outside the House the rights of a member of Parliament in this respect are neither greater nor less than those of any other citizen. For the Speaker to arbitrarily extend his jurisdiction beyond the precincts of the House, and attempt to deal punitively with any one for criticising his conduct in the chair is, therefore, warranted by neither propriety nor expediency. For the head of the Government to take up the cudgels and attempt by penal action to intimidate members from freely expressing themselves within the limits of defamation law regarding any phase of parliamentary business is, if possible, still harder to justify. in partj I think that this puts the case fairly and squarely. An honourable member of this House should have the right to speak freely to his constituents. I may be pardoned for a moment in reverting to Mr Gladstone's remarks in the House of Commons, because they have an in direct bearing on the motion which I have submitted. As honourable members are aware, Mr Bradlaugh was refused entrance to the House of Commons on two or three occasions, and Mr Hunter, the member for Aberdeen North , afterwards movedThat the resolution of this House of the 22nd day of June, 1880- "" That, having regard to the Eeports and Proceedings of two Select Committees appointed by this House, Mr Bradlaugh be not permitted to take the oath, or to make the affirmation mentioned in the Statute 29 Vic, c. 19, and the 31 and 32 Vic, o. 72,"" be expunged from the journals of this House, as being subversive of the rights of the whole body of electors of this Kingdom. When the motion was submitted it was opposed by the Solicitor-General, Sir E. Clarke, who was a member of the Government, but Mr Gladstone supported it, though he asked that the latter portion be removed. He said I would commend this motion to the House as one that is called for by the circumstances of the case, and one which may save its successors from the dangers of committing the most dangerous error-the error, namely, of exceeding the limit of its own jurisdiction. I move this motion because I think that a very grave and serious injustice was done to the honourable member for Ballarat, and, using the words of Mr Gladstone, in order that in the future we may be saved from the danger of this House committing the most dangerous error of exceeding the limits of our own jurisdiction. I also submit the motion so that every honourable member should have the right freely to address his constituents on any subject without being suspended from the House for so doing.",12
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Parramatta) [3.27] - As I am concerned in this matter, I rise at the earliest possible moment to say one or two words about it . regret that owing to inadvertence on my part I was not aware until the House met today that this motion was down for discussion, and, therefore, I have had no time in which to refresh my memory as to the circumstances under which the matter referred to in it took place. Since the honourable member rose, I have been endeavouring to think back in order to refresh my memory as to the circumstances of those awful and fearful times, which I hope will never be repeated in this House. I have been in parliamentary life for a quarter of a century, and I have not seen a Parliament so reduced to Bedlam by an Opposition as was the last Parliament.",13
88,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"How can the honourable member, who has been in the New South Wales Parliament, make that statement?",13
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I have not seen in any Parliament, certainly not in the Parliament of New South Wales during the period when I was in the Legislative Assembly, anything comparable with what took place in this House. What was the position? Here we have an isolated instance only; I am certain that the mover of the motion will be glad to have it so regarded, but I am quite unable to treat it as such. It is a matter which must be considered in the light of the whole of the circumstances in which it took place, and the general political environment of those days, in order that it mav be properly and rightly appreciated. The late Government were tryin g to transact the business of the country; day after day it was assailed by epithets such as I have never heard in Parliament during the whole previous course of my parliamentary l if e ; the Speaker was assailed every day, wholesale charges of partisanship and incompetence, and, indeed, every other epithet that could be given to a man, being hurled at him by ex-Ministers, who ought to have known better. ",13
90,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"The honourable member for Echuca must cast no reflection upon myself. If he does, I shall take a course which will prevent him. I ask him to apologize.  the Speaker.",13

92,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"The honourable member was referring to me. He knows that I am *iot ou the floor of the House, where I could defend myself, and that, therefore, he cannot be permitted to say what he said. I ask him to withdraw his remark, and to apologize for making it .  hyper-sensitive; but, in deference to your wish",13
93,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"The honourable member must withdraw his remark without qualification.  stances, I withdraw it .",13
94,Mr KELLY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I desire to know, sir, whether any action taken by you before you were elected Speaker is, or is not, open to the discussion of honourable members.",13
95,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I shall rule on the point when the occasion requires me to do so. Mr KELLY * - I suggest that the occasion has now arisen. An action of yours in the last Parliament, recorded in the proceedings of the House, has heen referred to.",13
96,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I informed the honourable member for Echuca that he could not so refer to my actions, as I am not able to defend myself on the floor of the House. I ask other honourable members not to follow the same course.",14
97,Mr KELLY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"W it h all deference, I ask whether I may take your statement as a ruling that we are not free to discuss any action of yours before you were elected Speaker ?",14
98,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I shall not rule on hypothetical cases. When the occasion arises, I shall give a ruling.",14
99,Mr KELLY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Then I desire to give notice that tomorrow I shall move that your decision be disagreed with.,14
100,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,The honourable member cannot do so in that way.,14
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Amongs t exMinisters, strangely enough, the mover of the motion now before the House was the most violent. Never have more bitter accusations been hurled against a Speaker than were hurled against the last Speaker by the honourable member for Barrier. The honourable member himself was suspended, and ever since, actuated by that spirit of Christian charity which, it is well known, dominates all his actions, he has been desirous of suspending some one else.",14
102,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I had great pleasure in voting for the suspension of the honourable member; as much pleasure as he had in voting for my suspension.,14
103,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I remind the honourable member for Barrier that he was allowed to address the House without in terruption, and I ask hira not to interrupt.",14
104,Mr KELLY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I have put the following notice of motion in writing. I give notice that tomorrow I shall move That Mr Speaker's ruling, that the honourable member for Echuca was out of order in referring to the action of the present Speaker before he was elected Speaker of this House, be disagreed with.",14
105,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"If the honourable member wishes me to give a ruling, I say that no remark which reflects on the Speaker is in order. If the honourable member wishes to give notice of his dissent from that ruling, he may do so. I cannot accept the notice that he has just read. [100]",14
106,Mr KELLY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I assure you, sir, that I do not wish to give you, as the occupant of the chair, any trouble, and that I have no personal feeling in what I do. The position as I realise it is this: The honourable member for Echuca, in the course of the debate now proceeding, referred to what had been done on a certain occasion by a member who was then a private member and has since become Speaker. Because that private member has since become Speaker, the remark of the honourable member for Echuca was ruled out of order, and the honourable member for Echuca was made to apologize. That is the ruling from which I dissent.",14
107,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I appreciate the spirit which actuates-the honourable member, and assure him that I have no personal feeling in this matter. The honourable member for Parramatta had stated that in a certain debate certain members had interjected, and the honourable member for Echuca, referring to myself, said that the ex-Speaker had done so. He and all other honourable members will see that it is not open to them to make an attack on me personally for anything I may have done last session. I have no objection to references being made fro m time to time to anything I may have said; but as I am not in a position to defend myself on the floor of the House against any reflection that may be cast upon me, honourable members will see that I cannot permit any reflection to be made against me. Tf the honourable member for Echuca disclaims any attempt to cast a reflection upon me personally, I am prepared to overlook his remark.  reflect upon your actions during last Parliament as member for Kennedy? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I shall not detain the House much longer in the discussion of this matter, because I regard the debate as an absolute waste of time. Honourable members opposite have the power to remove a certain entry from our records, but the passing of this motion will not actually erase it . This is only a whitewashing motion.",14
108,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,It shows that the House has thought better of its determination.,14
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"It shows that the Caucus is for the moment all-powerf u l , not that the House is in favour of the removal of this record. The fact remains that last Parliament, during the reign of absolute Bedlam, tke last Government took action to conserve the dignity of this Chamber, and to maintain the rights and privileges of the Speaker. The severest condemnation of the action of those who at the time sat on the Opposition benches and hurled accusations of incompetence, tyranny, and partisanship against the last Speaker, lies in the fact that one of their first acts on their accession to power was to appoint him to a diplomatic mission of great delicacy and responsibility. He was accused peatedly, to use their own words, of doing the "" dirty w o r k "" of the Government then in office; and yet his accusers, directly they came into power, made him a Commissioner to inquire into the affairs of Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands. This appointment gave the lie to the fearful accusations which were made against the late Speaker. It showed that those who made them did not believe them to be true, and that they were acting the part of political hypocrites. I want to say that it was a time such as I hope will never be repeated in this House. Day after day, many times during the day, ex-Ministers and those who sliould have supported the hurled their anathemas at his head, and accused him of all the political crimes in the calendar. They roduoed this Parliament to a condition of affairs which I once described as worse than a pothouse, and I am not so sure that that description was a very inapt one. However, whatever action you may take with this motion wil l not do away with what occurred in those times. Take the honourable member for Bar* rier himself. He, today, has expressed his great pleasure that he was able to a good turn for me.",14
110,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,As you did for me. Mr JOSE PH COOK - May I tell honourable member that it was impossible to do anything else w it l i him than suschose. pend him. H is behaviour was such that it was impossible to pass it by.,15
111,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,What about your behaviour ?,15
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"May I remind the honourable member of a few thin 23 he said, not outside, but here in this House.

114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Bu the is another individual today, and you have the fullest confidence in him, you have sent him away on a specially delicate confidential mission of great trust and responsibility. Here is the first statement made by the honourable member for Barrier concerning the late Speaker. Another referring to the ex-Speaker isYou are telling a different yarn every time you speak. reDid the honourable member read in his erudite observations just now any statement of Mr Gladstone or Mr Balfour concerning the Speaker of the House of Commons in which they accused him of telling a different yarn every time t The honourable member had better have left the field of Chesterfieldian politics alone.",15
115,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Why ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - Because of his owu foolish conduct when he was over here. Because of his own villainous treatment of the ex-Speaker.,15
116,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Order ! The honora,ble member must withdraw that statement. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Ver y well. Speaker Again, on another occasion he saysThere is nothing like having the umpire on your own side. That was an odious charge of partisanship against the late Speaker.",15
117,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Did the honourable member for Ballarat say that?,15
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"No , the honourable member for Barrier said that.",15
119,Mr BURNS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"He was not suspended for saying it , was he ?",15
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"If honourable members had been suspended every time do they deserved it , we should have been doing nothing else from morning t ill night but suspending honourable members. We the should have had the House cleared out, and been able to do whatever business we The honourable member for Illawarra, referring to the late Speaker, said all he was put into the Chair for was "" fco do their dirty work.""",15
121,Mr BTJBNS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Yes , quite true.",15
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I think, Mr . Speaker, you ruled just now that no reference of this kind must be alleged ho against an ex-Speaker of the House.",15
123,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I am just debating within myself as to whether the line the Mr honourable member is himself taking is not likely to bring in a good deal of discussion that ought not to take place. listened patiently to the honourable member for Barrier, to see that he did not overstep the mark, but if I allow the honourable member to proceed we shall get interjections of all kinds, and these may lead us further than we desire. ever, I ask the honourable member for Illawarra to withdraw the statement he made just now.",15
124,Mr BURNS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,What statement?,16
125,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,The honourable member made a certain reflection upon a member of this House.,16
126,Mr BURNS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I did not say anything.,16
127,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,The honourable member did by way of interjection.,16
128,Mr BURNS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"If I have said anything disorderly I withdraw it , but I did not reflect on anybody.",16
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I think I am entitled to make some reference to the circumstances in which this motion was carried. We had a condition of affairs such as I hope no Government will ever have to meet in this House at any time. There is only one other quotation I should like to make, and then I shall have done with this sordid, squalid history. statement made on a public platform, and it justifies the remark I made just now that if we had suspended a member every time he deserved it , we should have been able to do nothing else. Listen to this statement. I ask if , during the whole history of this Eederal Parliament, or of any other National Parliament in this or any other part of the world, language like it has been heard concerning a Speaker of the HouseFor myself, let me state emphatically and unmistakably, speaking as one of your legislators clothed with my full responsibility as such, and here publicly, that the Speaker in his unparalleled course of action bas shown himself to be a pitiably puny party puppet, and has degraded and prostituted his high office and still higher traditions of the Speaker of the House of Representatives.",16
130,Mr BURNS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Where is that from?,16
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"A speech by Senator Ready, the man you distinguished, I understand, by appointing him one of your Whips. Then there is the statement of the honourable member himself, and with this I propose to dismiss the subject. This kind of thing had been going on for some time, and it appeared to us that a climax had arrived when the honourable member for Ballarat, after [100]- 2 I making charges inside the House, after making accusations galore, proceeded to repeat these statements on the public platforms of the country. It was time something was done to protect the Speaker in his then very difficult position. This How- is the statement, I understand, that was made by the honourable member for BallaratTherefore, he wanted to say what he would not be allowed to say on the floor of the HouseThere is his own absolute condemnation, for he is allowed to say anything on the floor of the House that is appropriate to be said.",16
132,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Y o u refused to allow the Speaker's action to be questioned. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Of course we did. We should never have done anything at all otherwise. At the time Parliament closed, there were no less than three motions of censure on Mr Speaker. Others had been disposed of,'and honourable members were coming down with fresh ones every day. They tried to make the life of Mr Speaker unbearable; It is a to hunt him out of his position, if possible, by the abuse and contumely which they heaped upon him. The honourable member for Ballarat went onThe Speaker had lost the confidence of the members. There was good reason for the motion. We had absolute proof that the Speaker had deliberately altered a Hansard proof. The proof showed that the third reading of the Loan Bill was not carried according to his own words, and he altered the proof to make it appear in Hansard that it was carried. Tho Speaker was acting in a biassed manner, aud was proving himself a bitter partisan. These are the words uttered by the honourable member, in addition to his conduct in the House, and it appeared to the then Government that they had to make a stand in the interests of the dignity of debate, and for the protection of a man who was, in those days, unable to help himself. Accordingly, the honourable member was expelled from the House. He was given the opportunity to come back at any moment he cared to make amends. He chose to play the part of a martyr. I do not think he cut much ice in his own electorate. Ballarat did not rise to the honourable member. It sent him back here, it is true, but he was only just able to pull himself through. I am not complaining about that, but it is evidence that they did not regard the honourable member's action in this matter with any degree of appreciation or interest. The Government felt it their duty to do what they did. Personally, I have not one atom of regret. I would do the same again tomorrow. Do what you will with this motion, you cannot wipe oufc the effects. You cannot obliterate from the records of Hansard the facts as they transpired, the statements as fchey were made, ana I say 'that altogether they form one of the most squalid and miserable displays of partisanship and temper ever seen in this or any other Parliament.",16
133,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.58],- I did not think this debate would have developed as it has, according fco the tone of the right honourable gentleman's speech. The motion either raises a matter of procedure or it is of no importance at all . We are far enough away from the event fco discuss it calmly and deliberately from the point of view of the rights of honourable members. Mr J JSEPH COOK - You other side now, of course.",17
134,Mr MASSYGREENE,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,It is a pity we did have calm deliberation at the time:  discuss it in the presence of the exSpeaker.,17
135,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I think there is something in the point raised by the honourable member for Grey, and that it might be better to discuss the matter in the presence of the then Speaker-the honourable member for Lang.",17
136,Mr MASSYGREENE,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,He ought to position to defend himself from the charges made by the honourable member for Barrier.,17
137,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Perhaps I may be allowed to state my view in the meantime.,17
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I am omitted fco quote from the honourable member on this matter.,17
139,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I have not altered my views in the slightest degree. I would not have spoken in the same terms as the honourable member for Ballarat, perhaps; but I do say that that honourable member, or any other member of this House, has a right to say outside the House everything he has a right; fco say here..",17
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I just quoted honourable member for Ballarat as saying fchafc he made the statement outside the House because he could not make it inside.,17
141,Mr MCGRATH,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Because you would not allow me to make it inside the House.,17
142,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"That was sufficient justification for the honourable member for Ballarat, speaking where he had a right to speak. According to the statement of the right honourable member for Parramatta this afternoon, if he had had control of the police, he would have arrested the honourable member because of his speech afc Ballarat. Do honourable members see whafcfchafcproposal meant? Ou a motion in fchis House, with Mr . Speaker in the chair, the honourable member could have said, under the rules of the House, what he did say about the Speaker at a public meeting. Instead, the honourable member, speaking to his constituents, said fchafc in his opinion soand-so had happened; and when he came back to the House it was alleged that he made an attack on Mr Speaker, which was outside the rules of parliamentary procedure. I sayfchafcifc was not outside are on the the rules of parliamentary procedure; and it would be intolerable if Mr Speaker, in not his official capacity, could not be discussed in a reasonable way outside the House as he could be discussed in the House on a proper motion. It is quite true that the Speaker of any Parliament musfc be protected, for the obvious reason that, holding, by virtue of his office, the balance evenly between parties and preserving the rules and usages of the Chamber, he could not very well enter the fighting arena without losing part of the dignity be in a of his office. Having said that much, we have said everything necessary to protect Mr Speaker. If the old argument, which was used at the time the honourable member for Ballarat was punished, were to hold good, it would imply that even during an election Mr Speaker could not be sorry I referred to, except in dignified parliamentary language. That would only be a step further than the contention raised in the case of the honourable member for Ballarat, because Mr Speaker, even though a candidate for re-election, is still Mr Speaker, whether he is inside or outside Parliament. There is only one question to be asked : Can a. representative of the people be suspended from his duties in fchis House because he has claimed the the right, as a representative of the people, to criticise every happening in the Chamber? I think it is his bounden duty to his constituents to claim that right, which is in no way contrary to the best rules and practices of Parliament. The Government of the day trespassed badly when they took action which deprived Ballarat of its representation in this House. Whether the honourable member had a difficulty in being returned or not, has nothing to do with the question. If the honourable member had not been re-elected at all, that fact would not affect the principle we are discussing.",17
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I . treated little more leniently than the Prime M in ister treated me some weeks ago. I would not say anything about that if I were you.,18
144,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I did not treat the right honourable member unkindly.,18
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,You treated me in a despicable fashion.,18
146,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,18
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"In obedience your direction, Mr Speaker, I withdraw the remark.",18
148,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"An y unkindness to the right honourable member was unintentional. I do not wish to argue in any but a judicial way. I believe the dignity of the House and the chair will be protected if this motion is carried, because it will be a direction to any other Government, or any other majority in the House, in the future to mind their own particular business, and not to interfere with the right of the Democracy to hear their representative on any subject that may arise in this House or elsewhere.",18
149,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Do you say that au honourable member could libel other lionorable members of the House?,18
150,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"If a member is not privileged outside, he is privileged in side the House, and if he does wrong, he can be suspended. The right honourable member is falling into one bad error by forgetting that the honourable member for Ballarat was suspended, not for what he said in the House, b ut for what he said before his electors, to whom he has to bow, and upon whom he relies for his parliamentary existence.",18
151,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,He could moved from this House even for doing that.,18
152,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Of course, the majority could remove any member from the Chamber.",18
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Exactly ; as you removed me recently, without hearing me.",18
154,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"This House, by its own motion, can protect itself in any way it thinks fit. Members are privileged in the House, but only to the extent of what the majority may do. I , in conjunction with some of my colleagues, spent some money in Queensland in bringing before the Law Courts a case of so-called injustice and improper him a conduct by the Queensland Parliament. The present Chief Justice of the High Court, sitting then as Chief Justice in Queensland, decided that he would not be the first Judge to interfere with the rights, practices, and usages of Parliament. Therefore, Parliament is the custodian of its own privileges. Parliament itself is responsible for its good conduct; and by the rules aud ' practices of Parliament, and even without them, memto bers can do what they please. Only by act of this House can a wrong once done be remedied. In my opinion, the honourable member for Ballarat was wrongf u l l y injured. I do not impute motives to the majority who were responsible, but in a true Democracy we must, at the very least, permit equal privileges to a member to say to his constituents everything that he could say here on any motion that could be submitted to the House.",18
155,Mr FOWLER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Perth) [ 4 . 9 ] - I am sorry that the honourable member for Barrier has thought proper to resuscitate this motion. I do not think there is any member of this Parliament, who, like myself, has occupied a seat in it since its inception, but must regard the doings of the last Parliament as something they would very much prefer to blot absolutely and entirely out of memory. To me those doings are almost like some hideous nightmare. Perhaps I have even better reason for that impression than some other honourable members. Nevertheless, I do not think there is any one with any regard for the honour and dignity of Parliament who can look back on that particular period of its history with anything but feelings of regret and be re- shame. There is another reason why I do not think this matter need have been brought forward again, and that is that if it were desired that any statement by any person should be buried away where it could never be discovered, it should b© interred in the Journals of this House. There is no doubt that whilst those Journals serve a very useful purpose, are, perhaps, only once in a great cycle of years referred to in regard to a matter such as that we are discussing. who wished to discover the precise words used, or anything of the nature of an alleged offence, would undoubtedly ascertain the date, and then refer to the newspapers. So that the of this motion from the records of this House is a mere formality that would not in any way alter the existing condition of affairs. I am quite unable to follow the argument of the Prime Minister on this matter. The right honourable gentleman contends that it is quite competent for any' honourable member to say outside of the House what he could say inside. I quite agree with But wben he applies that argument a case of this kind, it loses its relevance altogether, because it is well enough appreciated by any one who knows the rules of the House that the honourable could not have said in the chamber what he said at Ballarat. The member, addressing his constituents, that; his party had absolute proof that Mr Speaker had deliberately Hansard proof-a reflection of a very serious kind on the personal honour of Mr Speaker. I ask you, Mr. whether you would have allowed in this chamber any such imputation Would you not have insisted upon a withdrawal and apology? And if the person who made such a charge against you refused to withdraw and apologize, what would follow? Most undoubtedly offender's expulsion from this Then the honourable member for Ballarat went on to say that the Speaker had acted in a biased mariner, and was proving himself a bitter partisan. ask you, Mr Speaker, whether would have allowed a remark of that kind to pass in this chamber? certainly would not. I can well imagine your indignation to 'any imputation of that against yourself, and I would be willing to uphold you to the utmost in vindicating your honour, both as a Speaker and in your private capacity as a man. For the very reason suggested that Mr Speaker has no opportunity stand on the floor of the House and deMr Fowler. fend himself-the honour of the Speaker becomes a question of the honour of the they whole Chamber. Therefore, such imputations made on a Speaker should be visited with condign punishment, if the Any one honourable member responsible for them is unrepentant. If an honourable member, in order to evade the rules of this House, first goes outside and makes charges of the kind, is it to be thought for a moment expunging that the power of the House does not apply to him, and that the honour of Mr . Speaker is no longer in the hands of this Chamber? Surely not. Surely we must take cognisance of the utterances of honourable members which reflect on the honour and integrity of the principal officer of the Chamber. Whether these are made inside or outside the Chamber is absolutely and entirely immaterial; in him. deed, the offence of making them outside to is the greater of the two, because it is the more cowardly. I say, therefore-and I am speaking only as a member of this member Chamber jealous of its honour and dignity-that this House had no option at honourable that particular juncture but to take the said course it did. And I desire to say this for the ex-Speaker: I was associated altered a with him in an official capacity during that very trying period, and his desire for impartiality sometimes rather amused Speaker, me. He spent a great amount of his leisure in looking up rule and precedent as that? for everything he did. He was most remarkably painstaking in these respects; and I have known of no other Speaker of this House who took so much trouble to be sure that his action and his official the decisions were on a sound basis. I can House. well remember the anxiety and worry that this particular episode caused the exSpeaker; and you, sir, will bear me out when I say that the Speaker owes a duty Again, I to this House which is often lost sight of. you That duty is to use the Standing Orders - to use all the forms and rules-to faciYou litate the business of the House; and I am quite sure that honourable members in regard opposite will agree with me, in their kind souls, at any rate, that whatever the exSpeaker did at that particular time, and under the particular circumstances, was in recognition of the duty imposed on him. In the face of organized today- obstruction, the duty devolved on the to ex-Speaker to see that such obstruction was not permitted any longer than was unavoidable, to interfere with the work proposed by the Government. It was because he was doing his duty in that respect that he was made the object of those attacks which, as we all know, culminated in the speech of the honourable member for Ballarat. I again assure honourable members that I am only desirous to uphold the honour and dignity of the Chamber, and I suggest that the honourable member for Ballarat has a duty to perform to the late Speaker, assuming that this House has a duty to perform to the honourable member for Ballarat; and the duty of the honourable member for Ballarat must take precedence of the action proposed now. In other words, this House cannot honourably and fair l y expunge those records until the honourable member for Ballarat has apologized for the language which brought punishment upon him. I therefore suggest, as a very fair aud proper method of arriving at finality",18

The charge against the ex-Speaker has been read here today, and necessarily so; and it is only fair that he should give his version of the incident. The charge which the honourable member for Ballarat made against the then Speaker was, in my opinion, perhaps the most serious that could possibly be made against the occupant of the chair, whom the House has charged with the duty of seeing, with the assistance of the clerks, that the records are kept absolutely correct.

I regard it as an outrageous of injustice by reason of the fact that honourable member for Ballarat had no charge preferred . against him.

233,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,That was because I did not wish to have those words read in my own State.,26
234,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Because they exposed the right honourable gentleman.,26
235,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Not at all .,26
236,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"The ""Western Australian Hansard says that the right honourable gentleman, as head of a Government, brought in a Bill to alter the age of consent from fourteen years to twelve years, and his brother, Alexander, voted against him .",26
237,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,That is a parody of what actually took place. I raised age of consent by two years.,26
238,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"The right honourable gentleman reduced it by two years. I am willin g to leave the matter to a Commitright tee of honourable members from his side of the House. My statement is true. I have challenged him before, but he was not manly enough to accept the challenge.",26
239,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I did not wish to have anything to do with you. My name is too well known.,26
240,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,It is in the records of the Western Australian Hansard.,26
241,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,G o to Australia and prove it,26
242,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,The right honourable member for Swan must cease these continuous interjections.,26
243,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"W it h the knowledge that, at the request of the right honourable gentleman, this matter was deleted from Hansard, I am astonished at his objection to the present proposal. The right honourable gentleman must know that the need Government during the last Parliament will be handed down to f u t u r it y as the "" Speaker's Casting-vote Government."" There is no doubt about that, and it certainly suited some one that an honourable member should be removed, so that, in any close division, the decision would not rest upon the casting vote of the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees. I do not say but that there may have been some reason for taking objection; heat was certainly engendered by an unjust acknowledge charge, and if the honourable member for Ballarat thought that he was not justified in withdrawing according to the forms of the House, when he went outside to the people, from whom al l power comes, he was sent back with a large majority, which was the answer of his constituents as to whether his action was right or wrong. I shall have much pleasure in voting for the motion submitted by the honourable member for Barrier. The fact that the present Government have come in with a majorit y is the keenest answer of the people to a Ministry that tried to carry on the work of the country in its own interests by the casting vote of the Speaker.",26
244,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Les t it may be thought that I wished to have expunged from Hansard some statement that would injure me, let me say that the words that the were taken out were opprobrious expressions that I had applied to my honourable friend, and the use of which I regretted.",26
245,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I think that if the honourable member looks into the own matter he will find that I am right, and that he is in error. No expression was used in regard to me about which I cared twopence.",26
246,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I was sorry that I had used the expressions, and therefore wished to have them deleted.",26
247,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I have based what I have said on the Hansard records, and believe mv statement to be correct.  much to be regretted that the honourable member for Barrier has chosen the present occasion to revive a question which in its nature is extremely partisan. The members of the Opposition are giving the Government the most generous support, to enable them to prosecute vigorously all operations pertaining to the successful conduct of the war; and the honourable member for Barrier might well have taken the advice given to him, and withdrawn his motion, instead of seeking to divide the House on a question exciting party feeling. He has said that he does not wish to reflect on the exSpeaker; but the motion is a reflection on that gentleman. It is brought forward, too, when the ex-Speaker is absent in the Pacific, engaged on important public business. Surely the matter could have been deferred until his return. In his opening remarks, the honourable member for Barrier referred to the action of the ex-Speaker in attending a Liberal conference. As one who was present at that conference, I say that he did not attend it . He merely attended a picnic which was held after the conference had finished its work. At that picnic he made a speech, which I heard, and which I say did not contain a word which could be construed to be of a contentious nature. No doubt the honourable member for Kennedy, under similar circumstances, would make similar remarks. On the 30th A p r i l of last year, the honourable member for Barrier attacked the exSpeaker in regard to this speech, and the ex-Speaker made an explanation, following on which the honourable member for Barrier said I had not seen or heard your denial, or I would not have made use of that report. Now, in the absence of the ex-Speaker, he repeats his attack, a most cowardly proceeding.",26
248,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"The honourable member is not stating the circumstances fairly. T accepted the denial - of Mr Speaker Johnson that he had used certain words. What I said this afternoon is that he was present at a picnic given to a Liberal conference, and I sbould not have said that had not the honourable member for Perth raised the question.  has spoken of the motion as a trumpery oue, and it certainly should not have been brought forward at this juncture; but as it has been brought forward, we on this side must state our views in regard to it . Having been present, I support every word that fell from the lips of the honourable member for Richmond in regard to what occurred during last Parliament. A division took place about 2 or 3 o'clock one morning, when thirteen or fourteen Labour supporters, who were then in Opposition, were in bed asleep; and the honourable member for Ballarat, being' appointed a teller, took something like thirteen minutes- I checked him with my watch-to count twenty-three votes. I do not know whether he was in a fit position to judge what was done on that occasion. ' The honourable member went to Ballarat and said, "" We have absolute proof that the Speaker altered the Hansard proof."" When a member makes a statement of that kind, and it is not substantiated by the fact, we have a right to set out the facts exactly as they occurred. A child from a kindergarten would be able to count twenty-three votes in as many seconds. Regarding the incident bf the picnic, surely a member who becomes Speaker does not tliereby lose his rights of citizenship! Surely he has a right to attend a picnic!",27
249,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I did not question that. I merely pointed out how the practice of our Speakers has differed from that of Speakers of the House of Commons.  this House and the Labour Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly both represent New South Wales constituencies. Let me draw the attention of the House to the fact that during a recent Labour conference in Sydney the present Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales presided at nearly every meeting. He made all kinds of reflections on our Returning Officers, which he was not able to prove; and said that if his party could nob obtain by evolution what it wanted, there would be nothing left for it but to adopt revolutionary methods. That was a nice party statement for a Speaker to make. But at a time like this, when our troops are fighting alongside those of every other portion of the Dominion, we should put a stop to party warfare. Our business now is to further the business of the Empire, and it does not reflect credit on the honourable member for Barrier that he has brought this motion forward for consideration.  aspect of the case which has not been commented on is this: that the present House consists largely of new members, who are being asked to vote upon a somewhat important issue without personal knowledge of what actually occurred. This is unfortunate, but it is unavoidable under the circumstances. However fair these new members may desire to be, they are not competent to express an opinion on the question before them. I do not think that there was ever a noisier Opposition than that which occupied these benches during the time that the events to which reference has been made took place. The noise was incessant, and the Speaker's calls for order continuous. In fact, he injured himself physically in his efforts to maintain order. When the noise was at its zenith something oocurred. The Speaker said he had not done certain things he had been accused of doing, and a member of this House, who would not have dared to make the assertions he did in the House, sought to escape his obligations by makin? platform speeches in the country. The point of the whole thing appears to be this: When the honourable member made the statements alleged, he was asked as to the correctness of the newspaper report. Adopting a mulish attitude, he would not say whether those reports were correct or uot, and we were justified in assuming that all he was reported to have said he did say. Usually, when members are misreported, they are only too anxious to correct the report. Now we are told that the attack is not upon the ex-Speaker, but upon the late Government, because they pursued a line of action which resulted in the expulsion of the honourable member for Ballarat. did take that line of action, and I say now that they would have been absolutely wrong if they had done anything else, because the first duty of any Government is to uphold the dignity of the Chair. That is the fundamental obligation resting upon any Government. The present Government would be at f a u l t if they did not assist the Chair. But what did the late Government do? Honourable members opposite tell us that they excluded the honourable member for Ballarat for party purposes, suggesting that members were so evenly divided that by excluding one the Government were able to carry on. It is perfectly true that the expulsion had that effect, but that was not the motive. The motive was to uphold the dignity of the Chair,' and the honourable member for Ballarat had the ball absolutely in his own hands. All that it was necessary for him to do was to have come forward in a manly way, acknowledging that he had made a statement which he could not prove-that he had reflected upon the Speakeri n away which would not have been permitted in the House-and apologized. Immediately he would have been permitted to return, and to have continued his part in the warfare of the period. Instead of doing this, the honourable gentleman chose to appear before the country as a martyrcrucified by the Government-expelle d for party reasons. As a matter of fact, it was a case of self-crucifixion. The honourable member committed political suicide, was false to his party, and, for a time, disfranchised his own electorate. We have been told by the honourable member for Batman that the fact that, the honourable gentleman came back with a somewhat larger majority than he had previously is proof that the people upheld him in his position. A statement recently made by the honourable member for Angas worth quoting is that "" a people may be always trusted to act rightly if they apprehend correctly."" But it is impossible to get the great mass of the people to judge correctly-, and I am sure that the people of Ballarat never apprehended the inwardness and wickedness of the action of their honourable representative in defaming the Speaker as he did. Parliamentary government would be impossible if conduct like that of the honourable member was to b© permitted, and the people of Ballarat would never have They returned the honourable member to the Chamber if they had understood correctly. Therefore, they voted as they did, and I am sorry they returned the honourable member. Tliere is some force in what has been said regarding the right of the ex-Speaker to take part in this debate. The honourable member for Lang, who is engaged on a Commission for the Government, is necessarily absent from the Chamber, and the attack, whether levelled against him or not, reflects upon him, and he ought to be permitted to speak upon the question at a later stage, though his remarks will he separate from this debate. Not only has the honour and dignity of the House been assailed through the attack ou the but the houesty of certain officials is also impugned, because if the honourable member for Lang, when Speaker, deliberately altered Hansard to suit his own purposes, some paid officer in connection with the Hansard staff is seriously at fault. A conspiracy is suggested, so that the charge is not only a charge against the Speaker. It is a charge against officers of the House, and I feel we ought to stand up in defence of those who have not the right to defend themselves. I agree that the Speaker is in a position where he cannot defend himself entirely, but he can defend himself to a certain extent, .while officers of the House are absolutely powerless. If it is necessary for the House to defend an honourable member, it is quite as necessary that we should uphold the honour and honesty of those who are here paid to do the work they perform. I would like to say, by way of conclusion, that in my judgment, so great was the noise and tumult in the House on that occasion when the incident occurred, that comparatively few honourable members can really know what happened. I usual thing when a member of the House, be his views what they may, makes a statement that he did not do a certain thing, for that statement to be accepted, and properly so. The honourable member for Ballarat did not pursue any such course as this. It suited h im to defame the Speaker. He did defame the Speaker. Even if this motion be carried, it will not be possible to alter the printed record which contains the gravamen of the charge. It must remain for all time.",27
250,Mr MCGRATH,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Ballarat) [5.28] - I have listened with very great interest to the speeches that have been made from both sides in connection with this motion, and I would like to reply to one or two. It might be as well if I answered the observations made by the Leader of the Opposition when he stated that my remarks had done me no eood in my constituency. I did not make them with any idea that they would do me any good in that direction. I had no idea of it ; but the fact that I have been returned by a majority three times greater than I had previously, shows that my constituents still have some faith in me. I do not want to go into fchis question generally, and I do not want precedent. fco discuss the details of what transpired on this particular occasion.' I admit freely Chair, that we were all very excited that night. Not only were we excited that night, but for a number of weeks, perhaps months, party feeling had run very high. I had no persona] feeling against the Speaker when I uttered the remarks I did, and I am sure that 1 can say, on behalf of the honourable member for Lang, that we both regret the incident now, reviewing it in our calm moments. But I felt I had a duty to do at that time, and seeing fchafc I was denied the right of speaking here, I went to my constituents and told them what I thought of the action of the Speaker. A f t e r the lapse of several months-afte r we have all had time to reconsider the events that transpired thenI regret the incident, as I feel sure the ex-Speaker also regrets it . I hope that this aspersion - will be removed from the records of Parliament, because I consider that a very grave injustice was done to me at that time. Although regretting the i ncident, I felt then that, as a'member of Parliament, I had the right to go on a platform and tell my constituents what transpired in Parliament. That is a right t is the which I cannot waive. If I say on a platform anything of a libellous nature, any honourable member has what he has not got in Parliament, the rightfcoproceed against me in the law Courts of this country. I will leave the case with these few remarks, and trust that the motion will be carried.",29
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Parramatta) [5.31] - Wit h the leave of the House, I should like to make a statement. Leave granted.",29
252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"After that expression of regret on the part of the honourable member for Ballarat, neither I nor any honourable member on this side can have any wish other than that this motion should be carried on the voices.",29
253,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I am not quite sure as to the action I shall have fco take in the event of this motion being agreed to. The incident referred to can be expunged from the official record kept in the Department, but honourable members will understand that, as Hansard and the Votes and Proceedings are scattered world-wide, it will be impossible to recall them and have this incident deleted.",29

Question resolved in the affirmative. GOVERNMENTHORSE - BREEDI NG STATIONS .",29
256,Mr CHANTER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Riverina) [5.34] - I move That this House resolves that it is expedient and urgently necessary for the Government to at once establish horse-breeding stations in order to create and maintain a full supply of suitable horses required for military and other public services. The motion speaks for itself, and I have no desire to unduly occupy the time of the House in discussing it . The necessity for the course I propose must appeal to every honourable member. no way a party question, and I desire the House to approach it from that point of view. Already the cost to the Commonwealth for the purchase of horses, for both military and civil purposes, has been enormous. No doubt, the expenditure has been largely increased by the present deplorable war, but, even after the war is over, we must recognise the fact that the Commonwealth will be called upon to maintain and supply a very large number of horses to meet the military and civil requirements. In entering upon an enterprise of this kind, the first consideration is that the horses can be reared at a very much lower cost than the Commonwealth is compelled to pay at the present time. Secondly, the particular types of horses suitable for the Government requirements can be produced in the way I indicate. members, who know the points of u horse and the necessity of having particular types of animals for different classes of work, will sympathize with the Government, particularly the Defence Department, in the difficulties they have bad to encounter in obtaining a suitable class of horses. Of course, in creating and maintaining stations such as I am suggesting, it would be necessary to place in charge experts who have practical knowledge of the classes of horses required. That our horse stock will be more and more depleted as the years roll on we have already ample evidence. Horses of a military type have been leaving Australia for years past, and they have not been going to our people within the Empire. Japan particularly has had purchasers in Australia, and thousands of the best horses, that ought to have been retained for our defence requirements, have been lost to the Commonwealth. On several occasions we have, had opinions expressed in the House as to the best uses to which the Northern Territory can be put. I have had the privilege of spending some time in the Territory and travelling hundreds of miles through it . I have seen the northern portion, and I approached the southern boundary as far as Oodnadatta. Even between Port Augusta and Oodnadatta, territory which manypeople would be inclined to condemn a3 useless, I saw plenty of country admirably suited for the rearing of horses. The best horses for military and It is in civil purposes are not bred on what is known as level country. The horses which are hardiest and truest to strain are bred on somewhat hilly country, of which tliere is a large area in the Northern Territory. The expense of creating stations of this kind would not be very great. It will be necessary, of course, to have a stud.",30
257,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Shoul d not this proposal be referred to the Public Works Committee ?,30
258,Mr CHANTER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"What I am proposing is not a public work, but a public utility, and it will become more so as the years roll on. I have not gone into details or quoted statistics as to the immense cost to the Commonwealth Department of purchasing horses for the military and civil requirements. I desire the Country House to affirm the principle that it will be to the best interests of Australia as a whole, as well as a helpful factor in utilizing the Northern Territory, that the Government should establish at the earliest possible moment horse breeding stations, not to interfere or compete with the private breeders, but merely to supply the requirements of the Government departments.",30
259,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,That would be part of the Defence scheme.,30
260,Mr CHANTER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I think it would. Those, briefly, are my views; and keeping in mind my promise to give other honourable members an opportunity of speaking on the question before the dinner adjournment, I shall say no more, but merely recommend the motion to the House.",31
261,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Wannon) [5.42] For about eighteen months I had on the notice-paper a motion dealing with the question of horse breeding, but not a motion relating, as this one does, to the establishment of State horse breeding farms. The effect of my motion was that a Committee of the House should be appointed to confer with the horse breeders, the Defence experts, the veterinary faculty, and horse shippers, with a view to the standardization or typification of horses required for defence purposes, in order that the breeders throughout Australia might better understand the breeding of horses for army requirements, thus insuring an adequate supply at all times. I appreciate the effort of the honourable member for Riverina in bringing this matter before public attention. Any one who has regard for the blood horses of Australia must regret the pace at which the blood strain throughout the Commonwealth is diminishing. For that there are many reasons. The introduction of motor traction has done much to displace the horse fro m the city; the i ncreases in the prices of beef, mutton, and fat lambs have practically wiped out light horse breeding in the country districts: and the arrival of the American trotting horse has resulted in the blood strains being supplanted to such au extent that today we are unable to get the good old station horses of days gone by.",31
262,Mr BOYD,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,But we gefc faster horses.,31
263,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"My friend is both right and wrong. He is probably right if he means that wo are producing sprinters for five or six furlongs, but I am afraid he is wrong if he is looking for good old handicap horse which used to be the pride of Australia. If I were asked fco suggest an ideal horse for Defence purposes, I should point to the old steeplechase horse with stature, blood, strength, substance, and endurance. It is very hard to get that typo of horse today. It makes a good charger, which can go all day, and subsist on smnll rations; while if it comes in after a hard day on the battlefield it, soon recuperates. We do not desire to have a soft horse that will "" crack up,"" as, unfortunately, does the blood or light horse that we have today. I do not feel particularly favourable to the establishment of State stud farms. The best breeders are engaged privately, and have, undoubtedly, got possession of the best land and stock in Australia for their businesses. A step might be taken similar to that taken in Prussia by an eminent count for the breeding of war horses. That gentleman evolved a class of horse which was the admiration of the world; and the French Government followed on very similar lines. There is no doubt that Australia would be well repaid if a serious and successful effort were made to produce a better class of animal in this country. This effort ought to be made in a business-like way, with the assistance ancl co-operation of those who have been breeding horses all their lives for local use, as well as for export. There ought to be some scheme under which the Defence experts could confer with established breeders, and standardize the most suitable types of horse. There are the transport horse, the charger, the leader, and the gunner; and I may say that the horses sent abroad with our Expeditionary Forces, and in camp in Australia today, number about 30,000.",31
264,Mr GJIEBNE,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Does that include horses purchased on account of the Imperial authorities ?,31
265,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"No ; only those required in connection with our own Forces. I am afrai d that in the better districts of Victoria the light horse has practically gone. The number of failures in breeding is a substantial consideration. A breeder may select what he believes to be an ideal sire, and may have stud mares; but no one can say whether he will get a the full proportion of the right standard of stock. I have conferred on this matter with those engaged in the export trade, and particularly with one gentleman who has for'years been in the Indi an trade, and the proportion of wasters he has had to reject would astound the country.  wasters now..",31
266,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"There is not the same field, because the Indian trade has practically stopped.  India.",31
267,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,The gentleman to whom I am referring was pre-eminent in the business; but he has now gone right out of it.  that cattle pay better.,32
268,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I referred to that point previously. The price of beef, and the rapidity with which that commodity can be commercialized, means that horses are becoming unprofitable. The honourable member for Henty has said that we are now getting speedier horses; but I think any honourable member who has paid attention to the subject will recsgnise that there is degeneracy in this respect. At present we are breeding sprinters, and not that type which, at one time, gave us the dependable buggy horse or good hack-the all-round horse. I may sa.y that I have carried a few of these animals through the drought at a cost of £11 or £12 a head, and I do not suppose that I could get more than £1 a head at the present time. Tliese animals have been bred on stud lines, from stud-book in ares and stud sires; and I have to admit that they are a pack of rubbish, so far as the requirements of the Defence Department are concerned. We have all the one object in view, and I think that the motion might be modified with some advantage. The Government could take the initial step of declaring that they intended to put the breeding of Defence horses in Australia on a sound footing, and that, to that end, they proposed to confer with breeders and veterinary exports, with a view to laying down something like a standard. The Government might go further and import good sires, because no serious efforts have been made in Australia in this connection, so far as the Governments are concerned. It is true that something has been done in New South Wales, but nothing of moment elsewhere. As a matter of fact, we are not able to keep a good sire in Australia. As soon as we unearth the right class of sire, he is taken to the Old Country, for the reason that we cannot here pay the price. Even New Zealand sends here for sires, at prices which we do not seem to bo able to reach. I am speaking now, of course, of private breeders. The French Government have gone to Britain and paid £30,000 for a blood horse, in order to improve their Defence mounts; and I think that it is time we in Australia woke up. I fear for the future of the light horse, for I fear that he will practically disappear, except for the breeding of sprinters. My opinion is that in the establishment of Government stud farms we should only be courting failure. First of all, the nucleus of the right class of mare has to be got, and the breeding traced back. If there be laid down a type or standard such as I have in my mind, no doubt the authorities will stipulate that a mare, before she becomes eligible for breeding from the approved sire must be accompanied by proof of her lineage. The Government, whether State or Federal, will have great difficulty in extracting from the breeders of today the nucleus of a stud, seeing that, those breeders require for themselves all that they now possess. I am afraid that the Government would never be able to marshal a sufficient number of the right type of brood mares, though, with the public purse at their disposal, they would no doubt be able to get good sires. My suggestion is that the Government should enter this business by purchasing a few sires, and that the service of those sires be placed at the disposal of the community. The progeny should be earmarked, first of all, for the Defence Department; indeed, we might go further aud provide that up to three years of age the Department should have the first option of purchase, at a fixed minimum price. It would not be proper to arbitrarily fix a price, and I am not going to attempt to do so; but it should be a payable minimum equal to the return that would be received from the same land if devoted to beef or mutton, or other produce that pays so well. We shall not induce breeders to go into the business unless their position is equalized in the way I suggest. The establishment of stud farms in the Northern Territory is not, in my opinion, a good idea. There is, for instance, the difficulty of mobilization, in view of the fact that the animals would have to be carried from 1,500 to 2,000 miles.",32
269,Mr HANNAN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Buil d a railway.,32
270,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,A railway from the Territory would never get the product to market at a payable price.  said that the horses are required only for Defence purposes.,32
271,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I do not say that; what I say is that my idea would give a better horse for Defence purposes, and bring a better type of animal into general use. To-day there is much indiscriminate breeding. ",33
272,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"That is so. Various efforts have been made to improve the situation. In Victoria, a measure was introduced providing that no draught horse could get a Government certificate for service unless sound and from natural blemishes, but nothing has been done on the same lines in regard to the light horse. only object we have is to put the breeding of light horses, and horse breeding generally, on a better footing; but I am afraid that, with Government stud farms, we should be deprived of the best brains in the business. If an improvement is to be made, it will not be by establishing isolated farms in the Northern Territory, which could have but a slight influence on breeding in the rest of the country.  can be got in Queensland.",33
273,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Quite so; but, as I say, that land must be put on the same footing as land devoted to beef and other payable products. Tbere must be a market for the product. The Defence Department, for instance, might say that for a charger or a remount the authorities were prepared to give a minimum price of £ 2 5 , and for a transport horse £ 3 0 to £35. A breeder would then know the basis of the business, and the prices given would regulate the prices of similar horses in the ordinary market; at any rate, something would be done to put the industry on a definite footing. I think I may say without egotism that I have some little knowledge of this question, seeing that the firm with which I was associated has sold hundreds of thousands of horses. The number of rejects of every class for both the local and export markets shows a tremendous wastage. It would be far better if the animals were never bredfar better if the efforts were devoted to cattle or sheep, in regard to which there is no such wastage. There is a great national economic loss occasioned by indiscriminate breeding, and if one horse has contributed more than another to this result, it is the soft-boned American trotter.  country.",33
274,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Horse-breedin g has suffered considerably from this cause, because the progeny are even much more degenerate than the sires and mares. I have not had time to consider carefully the language of the motion in conjunction with those who are privately engaged in horse-breeding; but I think it might be so amended as to convey a direction or intimation to the Government to free give the most serious consideration to the breeding of our horses, with a view to spreading the organization and effort over The the whole of the continent. Instead of isolating the stud farms in the Northern Territory, a type of horse required should be selected, and bred in certain approved localities, which offer themselves for the purpose. The hard, mountain horse, with a hard hoof, clean in the wind, and so for t h , could be bred with great advantage in certain parts of the Commonwealth. Then again, on the plain country you can breed a big, fine-looking horse. P r i vate owners, however, have been engaged in this work for years, have picked out the most suitable localities, and have established stud farms. If the Government propose to take action, let them do so in a direction that would prove beneficial to the whole community. Let them purchase stallions, and make them available, as far as possible, wherever their services are requisitioned. I do not suggest that the Government could afford at once to supply stallions in every district throughout the Commonwealth; but if they move in the direction I have indicated, and thus give private breeders an opportunity to benefit by their enterprise, they will secure the support of the whole community for a praiseworthv action.  quite in accord with the views expressed both by the honourable member for Riverina and the honourable member for Wannon. This question should have been tackled years ago. Victoria produces the finest type of draught horses to be found in Australia.",33

The honourable member for Wannon's suggestion is a good one. You, Mr. Speaker, will remember the Hon. J - P. Bell, a former member for Dalby in the Queensland Parliament, whose one desire throughout his political career was to improve the breed of horses in that State. You not infrequently joked at his expense, particularly in regard to his proposal that a stallion tax should be imposed. Such a tax is very necessary. No one knows better than you do, Mr. Speaker, the type of horses bred in the western plains of Queensland. There we find many nondescripts that are horses only in name. It was because of this that the honourable member for Dalby proposed a stallion tax. He was constantly asking the State Government to take action on the lines suggested by the lionorable member for ""Wannon; but, so far, nothing has beeu done. In Springsure district, Queensland, a stud farm is conducted by the State Police Department. There we have beautiful limestone country, which was said to be absolutely useless save for the breeding of horses and cattle. When the present Commissioner of Police took office in Queensland, he set about the establishment of a stud farm there; and today the Springsure district is producing the finest type of saddle horse to be found in Australia. The Police Department of Queensland breeds its own horses. found it necessary, as the honourable member for Wannon has said will be necessary in our case, to prove its blood stock, and it was fortunate in obtaining a good type of mares and of stallions from the Old Country. If the Commonwealth Government spent £100,000 a year in providing in the different States entires for the encouragement of horsebreeding, they would do a service, not only to owners of mares, but to the whole of the people of the Commonwealth, since it would give an impetus to the breeding of good types of horses. All who have had anything to do with horses are aware that the coaching horse, the buggy horse, and the good strong hack of olden days are not to be found today. What, too, has become of the old type of roadster that could carry a burden of 4 cwt. or 5 cwt. 50 or 60 miles a day? That type of horse is not available today. One would have to use a mongrel-bred draught to carry such a load over a long distance.  member account for this change?  breeding is dying out, because farmers find that it pays better to breed cattle. If you breed a weed of a horse, you cannot sell it ; but you can sell, without difficulty, a weed of a bullock. It matters not whether it has the ricketts, is devoid of rump, or is bred as fine as a camel-it s shape matters nothing-as long as it is a bullock one can sell it at a good payable price. On the other hand, a weed of a horse is thrown back on one's hands. The number of rejects, as has been said, is very large; but since the Imperial and Commonwealth Governments have been buying horses, the percentage of rejects in the case of private purchasers of horses for export to Manilla and India has been the very small. I think the suggestion made by the honourable member for Wannon, that the Government should lease out entires at a nominal rental in different horse-breeding districts, is a good one.",33
276,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,And fix a very low fee for service. ,34
277,Mr MASSYGREENE,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"But only to approved mares.  has just forestalled me. I was about to say that the type of mares should be apIt proved so that the Defence Department would be able to say, "" Whatever the foal may be we are to have first claim on it as a three-year-old for, say, £25."" Twentyfive pounds is not a big price for a good army remount. If the Defence Department did not exercise its option on a colt or filly reaching the age of three years, the owner should be afc liberty to sell it to whom he pleased. The honourable member has also referred to the Northern Territory in relation to the establishment of a stud farm. In the western and northern parts of Queensland there are wide areas of accessible land suitable for horse breeding. Queensland is rapidly becoming intersected with railway lines, and between these lines, in certain parts, we have plenty of good country on which hundreds of thousands of horses of the right type could be raised. Then again, the honourable member has said that horse breeders would not part with tlieir stud mares to the Commonwealth Government; but there are many who would be only too pleased to do so, because they desire to go in tor cattle breeding. The high price of meat makes cattle raising more profitable than horse breeding. Four years elapse before a horse breeder can raise a £ 2 5 horse. In the same time he would raise £60 or £ 7 0 worth of cattle on the same country. It is for this reason that so many horse breeders are giving up the business in the St. George district, electorate, where the true type of saddle hack is largely raised. Some of the finest horses in Australia come from that district, and fetch the highest market prices. I have known fifty guineas to be paid at auction for a saddle hack from that part of the Commonwealth. This desirable state of affairs has been brought about by judicious breeding. If the Police Department in Queensland can carry on a stud farm with success, why should not the Commonwealth be able fco do so ?",34
278,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"The Commonwealth would have to spend a lot of money i acquiring in any of the States the necesfarm . sary country for stud farming, and in obtaining plant that is already in vate hands.  square miles of good horse-breeding counthan try in Queensland that can be leased about 12s. per square mile per annum.",35
279,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"But horses raised there would be fairly costly by the time they reached Victoria.  from Townsville, Rockhampton, Gladable stone, Pinkenbah, and other Queensland ports. The freights to Melbourne would not be very high. If horses can be exnecessary sires, it would do well. ported with profit to India and elsewhere, it should be good enough for the Governsires ment fco breed horses in Queensland, and fco ship to Melbourne all that are reor quired for its service in this State. Comfche monwealth stud farms would raise the type of horse required for our own serround vice, and would have an educational i fluence on the horse-breeders of the districts in which they were situated. As the honI orable member for Wannon has said, some districts are not suitable for the breeding of horses. The horses raised certain parts of Queensland are more like goats than anything else, whereas in other parts of ths State, only a few dred miles distant, some of the finest horses in Australia are raised. stone country is the most suitable for horse-breeding, and I am sure if the Government took up this scheme it would prove a success. I hope that the motion will be carried, and that, even if we cannot at once establish our own stud farms, we shall do something, as suggested by the honourable member for Wannon, in the direction of supplying stallions in different parts of the Commonwealth at a nominal rental for suitable mares.",35
280,Mr MASSYGREENE,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Richmond) [6.12] - I in my am very much in sympathy with the object that the honourable member for Riverina has in view, although I do not think the method he suggests is altogether the best by which to achieve it . I would suggest to the honourable member that he omit the words "" establish horse-breeding stations in order fco create and maintain a full supply,"" and insert in their stead the words "" take steps to encourage and improve the breeding of suitable horses required for military and other public services.""  n possible to establish a Government stud",35
281,Mr MASSYGREENE,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Not at all. I am primuch impressed with what the honourable member for Wannon has said. The present crisis has brought home to us more anything else the necessity for insurfor ing a suitable supply of horses for the requirements of the Commonwealth. If the Defence Department were to endeavour to organize the horse-breeding possibilities of Australia by registering throughout the Commonwealth all suitmares-it is always possible to obtain approximately the breeding of any fairly good mart-and importing the It would be able to register or to hire for the purpose of making them available to breeders at a reasonable fee, a fee which would be sufficient to pay actual cost of the upkeep of the sires and the wages of the men taking them the country. In that way, also, n - the best places for putting these sires from time to time could be ascertained. t very often happens that the small farmer has a suitable and well-bred marefor instance, in the district which I rein present many farmers take pride in having a real good horse for driving; in fact, some of the finest horses on the roads of hunAustralia are to be found there-and if fchis suggestion were adopted we should Limeprobably get a far greater supply of horses suitable for military requirements, and at a very much smaller cost per head in the long run, than by the mere establishment of stud farms. I am not altogether opposed to the idea of establishing these farms- I believe that something can be done in that direction; but I do not think that it wil l be possible to establish them in any part of Australia and supply sufficient horses to meet our requirements, particularly at a time like the present, when we need them most. At such a time as this, which may occur agaiu, though we hope that it will not, we must be able to put our hands on a great many more horses than it will be possible for us to get by breeding our own. Nevertheless, something should be done in the direction of breeding our own horses, because we can thus produce good sires and good mares; but we should not attempt it on a large scale at first. We can conserve the public interests, and do far more for the horse-breeding industry, by following the course suggested by the honourable member for Wannon-that is, the registration of mares suitable for breeding horses for military purposes and the importation of sires which can be leased out in districts where there are sufficient mares registered to justify the sires standing.",35
282,Mr CHANTER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,That system should be auxiliary to the other.,36
283,Mr MASSYGREENE,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I put it the other w a y - the stud farms should be auxiliary to the other method.,36
284,Mr CHANTER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,The motion merely establishes the principle; it is a direction to the Government.,36
285,Mr MASSYGREENE,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"The honourable member should consent to alter it , thus leaving to the Government the option of establishing stud farms or of acting on the line suggested by the honourable member for Wannon, and approved by the honourable member for Maranoa. Both honourable members are experts in the matter. The amendment I have suggested will not preclude the Government from setting up stud farms. In passing, I may say that I have seen Government stud farms which were anything but what they ought to have been. There are Government stud farms in the Richmond district particularly-thos e dealing with cattle breeding-whic h are anything but a success. On scores of farms in the district infinitely better stock can be seen than can be seen on the Government farms. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth might be very sucoessful in establishing stud farms. I hope the honourable member will consent to alter his motion, ancl thus leave the Government free to adopt both methods. If the motion is carried as it is printed, the Government, in acting upon it , will be precluded from doing the other thing, which, in the first instance, would be more useful for Australia.",36
286,Mr CARR,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Macquarie) [6.20] - The motion submitted by the honourable member for Riverina is intensely practical, and I welcome it . It covers all the ground necessary, and meets the objections raised by the honourable member for Richmond. It asks the Government to establish horse-breeding stations, not only for military purposes, but also for "" other public purposes,"" which will cover any scheme for distributing the product of the stations. If the honourable member, when he reflected on existing stud farms, meant that the Government were not capable of managing such stations, they are equally not capable of nominating persons to distribute stock throughout the country, or fco say under what circumstances any person should have the use of it. There is always an element of risk in the Government undertaking a scheme of this sort. As a matter of fact, success depends entirelv on the man chosen to manage the undertaking. To me the virtue of the motion lies in an incidental result, namely, that we can use part of the Northern Territory as a stud station. The objection raised by the honourable member for Wannon, that the stock could not be shifted about quickly enough, does not seem to have any justification, because the establishment of such an institution in the Northern Territory should assist in bringing about at an early date that railway communication we all hope for there, and when all the States are connected with the main trunk line, the facilities for shifting stock will be plentiful.",36
287,Mr RODGEHS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,The process of learning how to select suitable stock is a lifelong matter.,36
288,Mr CARR,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,There will be nothing to prevent people in different oarts of the country visiting stud farms and selecting stock.,36
289,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,To evolve a proper breed will take centuries.,36
290,Mr CARR,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I am not talking of centuries, I am talking of years; but even if that assertion is true, then there is greater justification for getting a move on quickly. The longer it will take, the more quickly we should act now.",36
291,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,We are all agreed as to that.,37
292,Mr CARR,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"There is no proposal to confine the movement to one station. The motion says "" horse-breeding stations,"" therefore, presumably there will several stations selected, and among them. I sincerely hope that the Northern Territory, with its fine stretch of big stock country north of the Macdonnell Ranges, will be chosen.",37
293,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"As the motion stands, the benefits to be derived from any stock the Government may import will be confined to particular districts, instead of being spread over the community.",37
294,Mr CARR,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I cannot agree with that statement. As the stations are ' to be established, not only for military purposes, but also for public purposes, presumably there will be some centre from which the stock will radiate, and there is nothing to interfere with the stock being taken from the different centres wherever required at stated times, which will be quite in accord with the main proposal of the honourable member for Wannon and others. That the standard of horseflesh in Australia has fallen so low is a disgrace. Only today we notice in the evening paper a report to the effect bhat the Australians in the Levant are particularly noticeable by reason of their rough-coated, ugly horses. There may bo something in this accusation. I was disgusted with the type of horses that we had to secure in order to send our contingents away; and, in view of the fact, as has been pointed out, that the ten-' dency is for this deterioration to set in largely because other forms of motive power have been adopted, it is necessary for the Government to do something in order that we may be in a position at any time to equip our A r m y. We shall probably have a standing Army for some time after the completion of the war, and horses will be in demand. A war cannot be won without horses. They are useful as much for the intelligence they display as their other powers. With our idle lands that need developI ment the Government should get a move ' on speedily and establish these stations, particularly in the Northern Territory. I know of men who are experienced in this particular direction, and who would be able to render valuable aid. As I have already said, a great deal of the success of the undertaking will depend nn the men selected to manage it .",37

Our recent experience in securing remounts and artillery horses has shown us that some system of breeding horses should be introduced, better than we have had in the past. I refer to the class of horses used for military purposes. The reason for the deterioration in that class of animal in Australia is easily seen. In the old coach days there was a constant demand for strong horses for the roads, which encouraged breeders to breed that particular class of animal. That time has passed, and our difficulty, which will grow in the future, is to know how far the requirements of the Defence Department will warrant people breeding the class of animal required in a large way.

297,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Bourke) [7.48] - I should like to know from the Minister in charge of the Bill whether the following statement, which appears into-night's Herald, is correctMembers of the Federal Ministerial (Labour) party are now said to be in general agreement with the provisions of the Amending War Precautions Bill, which have been the subject of much adverse criticism from the Government supporters in the Senate and the House of Representatives. At the usual weekly caucus of the party today, consideration was given to the clauses which some members have declared unnecessarily subordinate civil rights to military power. Mr A. Fisher, the Prime Minister, said subsequently that much of the criticism arose from misunderstandings, and that these had been cleared up. l t was shown that the latent power was always with the civil executive. He did not think that any amendments of the measure would be necessary. I have had a very pleasant day, I have just risen from an excellent meal, I have given this subject mature consideration, and I see no reason for altering the opinions which I expressed in the debate last night. To my mind, there is no necessity, and no justification, for the provisions of the clause, and if I can obtain support' I shall press my objection to the provision. Last night the Attorney-General was being advised from this side of the House, and by the honourable member for Angas and others .on the Opposition side, until at length he said, "" I wish I had not so many friends to advise me."" His remark reminded me of a passage in Byron's Don Juan. The hero was asked, "" Have you no friends?"" and his reply was, "" I had some, but, thank God, I have lost them."" That seems to be virtually my position. Those who were supporting me last night have, in the interval, been ground through the mill. The honourable member for Parramatta asked me, and those who were then supporting me, why we were so fearful of a military despotism, and why we made charges against the military officials. Let me say that no one has a higher respect than I have for those who go forth to fight the battles of their country, no matter how humble their rank, or exalted their position. I hold in far higher estimation those who have taken the risk of life and limb to serve the interests of their country than I hold the platform patriots, who urge others to do what they are not prepared to do themselves. It is not because I am opposed to ine military that I oppose the clause; it is because I am opposed to the giving of absolute power to a few men. I would object to such a measure were those fco whom this power was to be intrusted my dearest friends, or the associates of years. I object to the giving of absolute power except in the most extreme emergency. Crises come in the history of nations and of individuals. There are periods of history in which nationalities must war against others to their very There are times when, to save disaster a vessel buffeted by the wind and the waves, all on board must be subject to one intelligence and will; there must be no discussion or argument, but implicit obedience to the orders of one person alone that all may be saved. The hour of supreme crisis may have dawned for the Old Country countries of Europe, but has not yet dawned for Australia. The honourable members for Parramatta ana Kooyong are in the same boat with the but I occupy a very different Last night the honourable member for Flinders said, "" This Bill gives enormous powers,"" and he added that lie could not imagine any circumstances which would necessitate their exercise. He said that he would like to know what circumstances would require their exercise. That was a plain question asked from the standpoint pf Toryism. I ask it from the standpoint of working Democracy. instance of extremes meeting. The members of the British House of Lords showed their hostility to tins because they recognised the gjorious love of liberty which is traditional with the British race, and felt that only under the most extreme emergency should liberty be violated. The Ministry and the honourable members for Parramatta and Kooyong say that the Bill does not give new powers, but merely, sets forth powers that they already possess. I have denied that. I hold with the honourable member for Flinders that the Bill gives new and extremely wide powers. gives the power to make regulations, and by regulations you can bring within the scope of the military authorities all civil liberties. You can put an end to the liberties of the people, if you will, under the excuse that that is necessary in the public interest. I ask, "" What are the powers that are demanded ? What is the need for them, and to what extent are they to be used?"" I am told that Ministers do not know of any circumstances under which they are needed, of any evil that they are designed to meet.

Even supposing that we have the Bill with limitations imposed by the House of Lords, while it may meet the objection of the honourable member and his party, how can it meet the attitude of the men with whom I am associated today? Men who claim to be Radicals in politics find that the framing of their Bills has to be done, not in accordance with the Radical It is an instincts of the working classes of this country, but in accordance with propositions carried through the House of Lords. provision That is the position. How do honourable members justify the fact that they are not one step in advance of the British aristocracy today; that they are going backthat wards; that they are not acting in accordance with their own needs and instincts, not in accordance with the principles and fundamentals of a movement with which we are supposed to be allied; and that they have to go to the Old Country and its aristocracy to know how Democratic they should be?

In many respects it constitutes the Defence Department the sole administrator of justice throughout the Commonwealth. Has that been denied ? Is there any honourable member on this side-and we all attained to our positions by the votes of the working democracy-wh o will stand on the floor of this Chamber and deny that this measure makes the Defence Department the sole administrator of justice throughout the Commonwealth ? The In the clause goes on to say that the methods of the military tribunal shall be brought into been a closer approximation with the forms and principles of civil law; but we do not do anything of the kind. Every five minutes yesterday it was stated clearly and distinctly that the Bill does not embody any new principles. We were assured that it was exactly what the Bill was eight months ago. We were told that we were called upon to give our adherence to something to which we gave our adherence then, and the honourable member for Parramatta said that the B i ll was. a. mere repetition or a mere reiteration. A r e we asked to believe that we are called upon here to occupy the time of the country with mere repetition and mere reiteration ? In the clause we are now considering there is not a single line, from the beginning to the end, which is not absolutely something new to be embodied in the existing law. The clause providesAn offence against this Act may be prosecuted either summarily or upon indictment It says that there shall be certain offences maintain which may be prosecuted in a summary navymanner, and certain other offences which may be prosecuted upon indictment. It lays down the penalty for an offence; states clearly and distinctly the processes of the Court; and, in a line, say that an offence may be prosecuted "" if the regulations so provide by court so martial. "" Can any honourable conceive of a Bill presented to ParliaDo ment which sought to so cajole the judgRight! ment of its members- a measure under which, if it be passed to-night, tomorrow the military authorities may proceed to last Januarymake regulations which will nullify every provision of the Act? This clause says that certain offences may be prosecuted summarily, and certain other offences by certain processes of indictment. orable members read the clause and examine it for themselves. It is clear that the day after the measure is passed the Executive Government can make a regula- "" tion which will say that those things shall not be done, and that everything comes within its scope shall be within the purview of a court martial. Further down it says that certain other provisions this commentwill protect the civil rights of the working classes, and then, cunningly, another is clause provides that the Government can take away that protection by a mere protime clamation. Is not that an evidence of ploited its mala fides? . If there is anything genuine about the whole matter, why should we not lay down clearly and tinctly what we mean ? Why should we paper wrotewith one hand give a protection and with the other hand enable the military authorities to take it a .vay ? We are told that this provision is designed for the preservation of public safety. Now, what is the preservation of the public safety ? Let me read a few extracts to show the situation which is dawning in Australia, and we are told that it is not dissimilar from that which is occurring in England. Let me see what is the position since, under some of the regulations, the authorities can take away the rights of ordinary civilians, can multiply offences, create any crime they like, and impose any penalty they like. They can take a case to an ordinary military tribunal; they can bring in the prisoner; they can condemn him, and from that court there is be no appeal. But, says the Daily Express of the 21st JanuaryJust as it is the duty of the Government to an efficient well-nurtured army and Do honourable members believe that? Do they believe that it is the duty of a couni t try to maintain a well-nourished Army and Navy ? They will not speak.

Who are the enemies to the great supremacy of the Empire if it is not those men who, in the hour of National emergency, are seeking what they pan make out of it? Before I come back fco the question, let me read an extract from a newspaper which, mark you, is not a revolutionary journal, not one of the red-rag brigade, but one which from beginning to end is filled with a desire to animate the British race to that glorious supremacy which has prevailed for long centuries. It describes how the manufacturers, the Cadburys and others, have exported 16,500,000 lbs. of cocoa through Holland fco feed German troops, as against 3,500,000 lbs. in the corresponding period of 1913; it shows how these buccaneers of our race, who talk of their patriotism, have exported 20,000,000 lbs. of tea fco the enemy, as against 2,000,000 lbs. in the corresponding period of 1913. I propose to read this extract because it is a true today. What applies to the Liberal Government in England applies to the Labour Government in Australia. If this is an argument against a Liberal Government in England, it is equally aa argument against a Labour Government in Australia. If we are true fco our ideals; if we believe ourselves to be someto thing distinct from honourable members on the other side, let us show the difference in our acts and deeds, and put our views into force.",39
301,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"What newspaper do you propose to quote from? Here, Mr ANSTEY - Reynolds' s Newspaper. There is not a sentiment in that newspaper which cannot be taken out of every other English newspaper. Whether you take the Tory Daily Express, the Yorkbehind, shire Post, the Daily Chronicle, or the Clarion, edited by Blatchford, everything it contains on this subject is a mere repetition of the few lines I am going fco read, and I hold that our Government stands in exactly the same position in reagainst gard to the working classes as does the Are the Liberal Government in England. It saysto raise They have enlisted in numbers that have staggered the conscriptionists. They have laboured superhumanly in the national interests; and what have they seen happening around them? First they saw the railway shareholders safeguarded by a Government guarantee of full dividends based on the rate the of a record year; they saw the banks secured at we know not what a colossal price to the taxpayers; they saw the shipping interests helped by the Government in regard to insurance; they saw contractors being given huge prices for work that was a disgrace. All round them they saw the commercial and financial interests, they saw money receiving help from the national coffers, and for themselves they listened to continual appeals for patriotism and sacrifice. Then, as if the open scattering of national wealth among the profiteers was not enough, there came the conscienceless throttling of the workers by the food and fuel exploiters; and still the Government left Labour to the mercies of whoever could grapple it by the throat. Where are we today? Do honourable members mean to say that we stand here today as a party and have no power? Does any one dare to make that statement ?",41
302,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Do you mean to imply that this Government is doing the same thing as Reynolds's Newspaper says is being done elsewhere ?,42
303,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"That is exactly where it stands. It comes here to pre. serve the interests of money. It comes here with the endorsement of the banks. For twenty long years we have said that the struggling working men were subjects of a system of exploitation and public robbery. But how do we, in this hour of National crisis, act? simply say, "" It is not we, but others who have saved the country. Thanks to the banks, the situation has been saved,"" and the Minister of Defence says, "" I have to thank the mercantile community for the manner in which they have come to the rescue of the country."" No more shall we be able to argue against them upon the platform. The banks, God bless them ! have saved us, not our members, not our policy. But God bless the banks!",42
304,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"How is all this relevant to the Bill? Mr ANST E Y - Of course it is relevant, because the matter is one that affects the preservation of the public safety. The Government will be given power to deal witli any commodity thab it thinks fit. But the point I wish to emphasize is, the Government, under its war legislation, has had the power to apply the social and economic principles upon which the party stands. From the very hour that the war started, the Government could, in the interests of the public safety, have checked the exploiters in tlieir operations in the foodstuffs of the working classes. It could have dominated the Sugar Trust; it could have applied the Act against butter, wheat, and every thing else.",42
305,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Y o u are not advising your party, under the pretext of war, to violate the Constitution, are you ?",42
306,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"In the American Cousbitution, upon which ours is based, the war provisions are of the most elastic character. Abraham Lincoln on one occasion, when somebody put the question to him as to whether their operation was not a breach of the Constitution, asked, "" Do you know any one who in this hour of national trouble is prepared to take oufc an injunction ? Tf you do, see that he goes to the concentration camp before he gets his injunction. "" The maintenance of national existence and the securing for the civil population of all the necessaries of life is one of the most important duties imposed upon us during war time.",42
307,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Y o u are going further than that. You are advocating the socialization of industry under the guise of war.,42
308,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Order ! The honourable gentleman has reached the time limit . We Mr ANSTEY - I have nearly finished. I oppose every provision in this Bill on the ground that there is no national emergency, and that nothing has happened to justify this interference with the civil rights of the people, and this handing over of such extensive powers to any particular section of the community.",42
309,Mr JENSEN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Bass-Assistant Minister) [8.16] - I desire to move the following amendment, adding at the end of sub-section 8 the words: Provided that whilst this proclamation is in force any sentence passed by court martial. . . .",42
310,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I rise to a point of order. I proposed an amendment, and spoke to it . Wliere does the Minister come in?",42
311,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I must call the honourable member's attention to the fact that he has exhausted his rights. He has spoken to the clause and also to the amendment.,42
312,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I do not wish to deprive the honourable member of his right to move an amendment if he wishes. He has the right to speak twice. Honorable MEMBERS - He has spoken three times.,42
313,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Balaclava) [8.20] - I do not desire to obstruct the Minister in charge of the Bill in the tabling of this amendment, but the issue prior to this is as to whether sub-clause 8 should stand in the Bill at all. I am afraid if the M in ister now moves any proviso tliere will be no opportunity for honourable members to sav whether they think the sub-clause should stand in the Bill or not. Yesterday, the Oommittee will recollect, and the Attorney-General will recollect also, the whole question was whether the Ministry should, after debate, consider that subclause essential to the Bill .",43
314,Mr JENSEN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,We do consider it essential.,43
315,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"We have had three utterances on the point, and it is of that that I wish to speak. Eirst, the Assistant Minister said he regarded it as vital . Then the Attorney-General said that he himself did not like it ; that he was not enamoured of it ; and was prepared to consider its excision. Then the Prime Minister said that he wanted to hear dobate.",43
316,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Suppos e you move the deletion of the sub-clause: then you will bring the matter to a head, and we can come to a decision.",43
317,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"That is the procedure, of course. But I am not prepared to take the responsibility after the more recent utterances of the Minister, to move the excision of that clause. Personally, I do not like it . I think it is extreme!) dangerous. I think its value and necessity may be doubted ; but the Prime M in ister's latest utterance was that he regarded it as essential, after hearing the debate.",43
318,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Would martial law to this?,43
319,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"That is a term that is particularly elastic, and we have had many interpretations of it . I prefer not to deal with that matter at this stage. It may be necessary to break down all impediments to National safety, and declare that a military ordinance is essential to National l if e ; but my position is this. I am prepared to forfeit my fears, to abandon my dislike of the clause, if the Government will take the responsibility of saying, "" We regard this clause as essential to the Bill.* ",43
320,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I tliink the f a i tion is this. The Government say that while there is no emergency now, such a law is required should the emergency arise.",43
321,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Precisely .,43
322,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"And because of that it prefers to take that power in such a form that the House may share the responsibility, and that the people may know where we are.",43
323,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"That attitude, if I may without presumption say it , seems to be highly reasonable. We who sit in this House, provided we are off the Treasury bench, cannot know as much as the Government knows. There are all sorts of communications, necessarily confidential and secret at certain stages, passing through the hands of the King's representative direct to the head of the Government that advises him, and if , after due consideration-whethe r that has been the case here or not>-whe n a proposal comes from the Cabinet - as a deliberative body, and is recommended to. Parliament, I am prepared to lay down every objection I have, and vote with the Government. But in . doing that the Government invites and accepts from members like myself on this side a loyalty it is not getting fro m its own supporters; and I hops the Government will recognise that we are doing this because we believe that, although we are opposed to many principles of the Government, there must be absolutely one single will controlling the nation in a time of National emergency, and that that wil l appropriately rests in the Government.",43
324,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"If there is no ioyalty to this Government, there is loyalty to the principles of the movement.",43
325,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I do not want to take you prefer part in the unedifying squabbles that are occurring on the Ministerial side of the House. But I beg leave to say, after a knowledge of the member for Bourke extending over twenty-five years, that, although I do not agree witli him in his utterances, I believe that they were thoroughly earnest and conscientious, and whatever his friends in the party may think, I am quite sure his constituents., though they may disapprove of many of his sentiments, will probably give him every credit for honesty and earnestness. I am prepared, for one, now that the Government has said, "" Give us this subr posiclause,"" to put the responsibility on them, if they think it essential, and grant the power, whatever their supporters may do. Whether the proposal is qualified by an amendment or not, my vote will go as the Government desires. The danger from a cancellation of the civil rights provided for in sub-clause 6 by the military authority advising the Government is very real, and I hope the Government, through its head, will give the assurance to this House, before the Bill passes from it, that these large powers, the greatest ever intrusted to any Government, since self-government was granted to the Australian people, will be exercised with the greatest care and discretion, not only with a desire to preserve the general peace and stability of this part of the Empire, but to preserve also those individual liberties that injudicious use may jeopardize.",43
326,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Wide Bay-Prime M i nister and Treasurer) [8.29] - Wit h regard to the remarks that have fallen from the honourable member for Balaclava, the Government do not need to delay for one moment the assurance the honourable member desires. These powers will not be used except in the case of emergency. They will be safeguarded in every way, and especially in the direction outlined by an amendment which was read by the Attorney-General last night. Regarding the differences of opinion that have been referred to, I have stated from the first that this is not a party question, and will uot be made a party question by this Government in any circumstances whatever, nor will any of these National measures be dealt with in a party spirit. We are uot going to wrangle on the steps of the temple in a matter of this kind, and whatever be the attitude of individual members, it wil l not affect the Government one iota as to the course they intend to pursue. It may be the right way or the wrong way, or it may not be the besfc way, but we think it the best course that we can take with the information in our possession.",44
327,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Batman) [8.30] - I move That at the end of sub-clause 2, the following words be added :- "" Provided that civilian shall be tried before a court martial.",44
328,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,That is duly provided in sub-clause 6 in another way.,44
329,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"No , it is not. There is another clause which, fco a certain bent, is a saving clause, which gives civiliansfcheright fco apply for civil trial they are sufficiently well advised of their powers. I do not wisli to speak at length on this subject, and merely wish to say that I support in general terms the attitude taken up by the honourable member for Bourke, who expressed the hope that there would be one at least on this side to support him in his opposition to this extension of military power. I shall be that one, at all events, and I hope there will be others in opposition to the clause. I would like to have it tested whether the protestations of this party against military law and trial by court martial are genuine or whether they are really make believe. The right honourable the Prime Minister gives the assurance that this power will be exercised in the most guarded way, and has told us that every sentence to be imposed by court martial will be reviewed by the Executive Government. How reviewed ? It will be reviewed upon the evidence that is given before the court martial. My trouble is as to the original trial, not the review of the trial. I am opposed to the extension of military law to civilians for that reason, and I am moving the amendment in conformity with my own view and with that expressed by the honourable member for Bourke, who was technically excluded from the right to move the amendment.",44
330,Mr KELLY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Wentworth) [8.33] - I congratulate the honourable member for Bourke, even at this late hour, on being able to get one supporter amongst honourable members opposite for the views which he put with such force and ingenuity only a few moments ago. From the remarks which have fallen from this side of the House, however, it is clear that members of the Opposition are prepared generally to trust the Government, and the Government's utterance upon this question, so my friend the honourable member for Bourke will probably find yet another supporter or two from the ranks of Government supporters.",44
331,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,They are afc liberty to do so if they like.,44
332,Mr KELLY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Q u it e so; but my honno orable friend was not a few moments ago, "" and I fancy I detected a look of relief for when he realized that, owing to the united support of members generally to the head of the Government at this time of great exnational emergency, he would still be free, to without jeopardizing or inconveniencing if his party, to continue in his attitude.",44
333,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I suppose you think that is funny ?,45
334,Mr KELLY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"No , I think it is deplorable; and I think I can see a look of relief on the honourable member's countenance.",45
335,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"At any rate, that is the remark of a clown.",45
336,Mr KELLY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I do not wish to excite the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in any way. It seems to me that the amendment moved at this stage practically amounts to a want of confidence in the statement which has been made to the House by the Prime Minister. Only a few moments ago the Prime M i nister stated definitely that he realized the gravity of these powers with which he is seeking to be clothed, and that he only proposed to use them in a time of the gravest emergency, and after the most careful consideration. Now, the honourable member for Bourke says, in effect, that whatever happens those powers are not to be put into effect against civilians. Would the honourable member wish that to be the position in the event, say, of Australia being invaded ? Australian troops were engaged in the firing line in Australia, would the honourable member say that any traitor giving valuable information to the enemy should not be summarily dealt with, and according fco martial law? That, of course, is the ultimate emergency wb ch might be ; expected to arise.",45
337,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,It has not arisen yet.,45
338,Mr KELLY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"How can my honourable friend tell us that an emergency of that kind will not arise? What opportunity, compared with the Government, have private members of this House of getting in formation as to the real risk with which this country may be confronted ? Tfc is for that reason that I am prepared to believe and accept the weighty utterance to which we have just listened from the Prime Minister. I am willing to trust the Prime Minister with these powers, with which I should certainly have absolutely nothing to do if it were not for his weighty utterance.",45
339,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,When was this weighty utterance given ?,45
340,Mr KELLY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"J u s t prior to the honourable member's amendment being moved. Honourable members in Opposition are prepared fco trust the Government. If the Government say that these powers are necessary, we will give them to the Government; but the responsibility for their exercise will depend absolutely on the Government of this country. If mistakes occur, they will be the mistakes of the Government; but I trust no mistakes will be made.",45
341,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Do you not know the Government have the power now to act in emergencies without any law afc all ?,45
342,Mr KELLY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Yes ; but only by going beyond the powers which are legally reposed in them. The Government want these extended powers, but I trust they will not require to use them.",45
343,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"It is only a practical, straightforward way of putting into words the powers which we desire to exercise in an emergency.",45
344,Mr KELLY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Yes ; but I hope that those powers will never require to be exercised. The Government have asked for them, and the least we can do is to support the request in this emergency.",45
345,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.38] - The honourable member for Batman has moved an amendment If fco sub-clause 2 which practically covers the ground set out in sub-clause 6, excepting that it extends its provisions to aliens as well as to British subjects. I venture to suggest that the proper place for the honourable member's amendment is in sub-clause 6. It is a matter for very serious argument, indeed, whether, at a time like this, an alien enemy should enjoy the same privileges as a British subject. Let us take an extreme case. Suppose an alien enemy is charged with espionage, that he is a spy proposing to strike some vital blow at the Commonwealth ; is he to have all the advantages of the civil law; is he to be safeguarded as if his liberty and his rights were coincident with, or in some respects the foundation upon which civil liberty itself rested ?",45
346,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,It does not include alien enemies.,45
347,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"If c does; but it ought not to do so. As to aliens other than alien enemies, I am certainly quite favourable to including them with the general provision, and giving them the advantages of the civil law. I see no reason why they should not have it . I see very good reason, however, why alien enemies charged with these offences, which are offences particularly arising oufc of the war, ought to be treated in a different way to that in whioh the civil law deals with offences under the civil code. appears to me that the trouble - with the honourable member for Bourke, and the honourable member for Batman, is that their imagination, fecund and exuberant as it is, moves only in one direction. They see the danger of civil liberty being lost. Their minds pierce the misty past, and grope with the shadowy host of reformers who have blazed the track of liberty; but they are blind to the bloodred present. They cannot see the tens of thousands of men who die every day that - civil liberty may be maintained. They do not see through the mists of the abstractions in which they live the dreadf u l horrors of this war. They live in a little world of their own, where the sound and horrid din of war is never heard; where academic discussions about the civil rights of men take the place of action; such discussions, for instance, _ as the Sansculottes and the Jacobins in dulged in during the afternoon before going out next morning to behead each other. What we have to do as practical men is to face the facts. My friends talk about civil liberty being in danger. So it is : but who threatens it ? I want to ask the honourable members for Batman and Bourke do they realise that there is at - the present lime in progress the greatest war of all the ages,. and that _ if it be the destiny of our Empire that she and her allies be defeated, civil liberty will completely disappear ? Does the honourable member think that if the Prussians were victorious, and were to conquer Australia, they would allow in the Reichstag, or whatever Parliament they constituted, his voice to be heard with that freedom which the honourable member has exercised to-night? The honourable member speaks about the danger of militarism; does he not see that at this juncture the foundations and fabric of civil liberty depend for their very existence upon the military power of the Empire and its Allies? The honourable member does not see that militarism, which has been for ages the enemy of liberty, is today the very sword and shield by which liberty is to be maintained. The honourable member declares liberty to be endangered by this Bill designed to protect, not only our liberties, but our very existence. From the very inception of this war the honourable mem[101] ber treated it as some immoral and monIt strous thing, in which we were participators. He has spoken of the grant to Belgium as if it were a reflection on the community, and an offence against its in terests, that we should give £100,000 to that afflicted country. He does not realise that but for Belgium, and the deathless valour of her people, in all probability he would not be in this House to-night. The honourable member's imagination peoples the whole atmosphere with figures moving in every direction, so that it is all one vast cinema show, in which he sees all the ages passing swiftly before his eyes. But his imagination boggles when it comes to facts. He turns his head away from the stern realities of l if e ; he turns fro m this war, where men are now fighting and dying for civil liberty, and pokes his head into a recess, where abstractions and figments of the imagination take the place of facts and stern realities. We are in this House to carry out the business of the nation, to protect the country, and to discharge the duties for which we are elected. 'The honourable member for Batman, amongst others, has reflected upon the Government as if we were recreant to our position and trust, as if it were not the business of a Government composed of Labour men to fight for liberty, and to do everything possible to safeguard our national honour, is much as it is the business of any other citizen. That view I utterly repudiate. If now, when we, as Labour representatives, are in a position in which we are intrusted with the reins of government, we allow them to dangle slackiy in our hands, we shall be rightly branded as incompetent doctrinaires. The honourable memtW for Bourke speaks of civil libertv. Does he understand how civil liberty has been built up?",45
348,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Do you?,46
349,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I do; it has never been built up by words, but by deeds. The honourable member's talk about liberty reminds me of Jean Jacques Rousseau, who kindled a revolution, the smoke of the fires of which stung him, so that he disappeared into the shadows from the conflagration which he had ignited. Revolutions have to be made by men, aud not by orators. The honourable member has drowned his judgment in the sea uf his emotions. I have always prayed for imagination to descend on the people l it e a ,*iffc of the gods, because imagination is good. But imagination must ' e counteracted by common sense, and must not be allowed to sweep cataract over one's mind, filling every corner with phantasms and figments. The honourable member ignores the solid fact that there is war, and we have to deil with that fact as men facing the greatest reality of life. If there be one greater reality than war it is death. Would the honourable member, seeing a man dying in the gutter, preach about civil liberty, or would he not do everything possible to render help and succour? I know the honourable member is a thousand times better than his words; and when he is silent he is excellent. But when he speaks !! The Committee can decide this question in a very much simpler way than that suggested by the honourable member for Batman, and that is by voting against subclause 8. The clause as it stands, without sub-clause 8, gives the civilian ample rights. I admit that it does not give the alien civilian those rights. If the honourable member chooses to delete the words "" British subject,"" and insert in lieu "" any civilian,"" we can take a division on that proposal, and we shall be in exactly the same position as we should have been had we pushed this matter to a division on sub-clause 2. Personally, I am not opposed to allowing alien civilians to have the same rights as B r it i sh subjects, but I am opposed to alien enemies, who may be charged with offences under this Bill , enjoying those privileges. I would not rob the alien enemy of any rights he possesses under the civil code, but the offences dealt with in this Bill are those which no person is more likely to commit than an alien enemy, and no person is more likely to commit them with the deliberate intent of inflicting vita l in j u r y on the nation. For that reason I am opposed to exemption of the alien enemy fro m t r i al by court martial ; I am not opposed to the exemption of any other civilian, and I am prepared to accept an amendment on those lines. If , however, my honourable friends constitute themselves the champions of the alien enemy, they can put the question to a test by moving an amendment.",46
350,Mr GLYNN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Angas) [8.52] - I understand that the Attorney-General proposes to delete from the Bill the power to try by court martial civilians who are not alien enemies. When this proposal wasbefore the Imperial Parliament, on 24th like a February, there was a general feeling, which was expressed by some members, fchafc the Act upon which we modelled our legislation, and which was passed on the 27th November, 1914, was a mistake in respect to these provisions. Civilians ought not to have been included within the provisions of the measure as regards courts martial, and the A ct was amended in February by leaving in those provisions, bufc inserting a proviso that the option should be given to British subjects, within four days, of electing to be tried by a civil tribunal; also the provision in clause 8 giving power fco suspend was inserted. But had the matter come on as a new proposal, the Bill would have been differently drafted. Ifc would not have given power of court martial ovsr civilians, bufc a provision would have been inserted enabling the Executive in cases of invasion or other special emergency to extend the scope of the Bill fco civilians. That is what ought to have been done, bufc as such a course would have involved an alteration of the text of the Bill , the other means was adopted. When honourable members on this side spoke on the question yesterday, we did not wish to embarrass the Government, and if the Minister assured us that the powers herein contained were necessary, we were prepared to vote for them. It was stated in the House of Commons by the Attorney-General, Sir John Simon, speaking on behalf of the Government, fchafc the special emergency under which the suspending clause would operatefchat is the clause taking away the option to be tried by a civil tribunal-wa s in invasion or other such special emergency. If the Government will administer the provisions of sub-clause 8 in the sense of Sir John Simon's remarks, I do not see that any harm will be done by retaining it in the Bill . The reason for such a provision in England is that the Imperial Government have not yet been given power by Act of Parliament to proclaim martial law. The moment war broke oufc martial law was declared in Germany and France, but we have a different fcraditioa, and, so far, no power to take that step has yet been given. This clause does not deal with martial law, bufc with trial Dy military tribunals in certain cases' for offences against the existing law.",47
351,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,It does not suspend processes of the civil tribunal.,48
352,Mr GLYNN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"No ; it gives the alterwho native in certain cases of trying offences against the existing laws by courts tial ; but there is no power here, or by Act in the United Kingdom, to deal with civilian offenders under martial law. If an emergency arise, martial law would be proto claimed, but in order to avoid that, they have taken this special power to try by a special military t r i bunal offences committed before the Act authorizing the proclamation of martial law is passed. Knowing that was the case, I did not wish to press for an amendment to be made. Nevertheless, the Attorney-General chooses to go beyond that, and restore the right by jury, I will not object, because that step logically follows from the position which a good many honourable members abiding have taken up. If , however, the Governterests ment are inclined to administer this vision in the sense of the assurance given in the House of Commons by Sir John especially Simon, that the option of trial by a civil tribunal would be interfered with only in now. case of an emergency, such as an invasion, I do not think it will be objectionable. Mr KING O'MALLEY [8.58] - The Attorney-General, as well as several honourable members on the Oppoin sition side, have had a lot to say about ral fighting so strongly for it? invasion. Before this country can be i vaded, there must be some nation prehands of some civil servant? pared to do that. Will my Conservative friends opposite say which nation is capable of swimming here ? At present Japan, which is an All y , is the only tion that has the ships with which to come to our shores, unless the invaders are coming in Chinese junks. This connot tinent is surrounded by walls of water and sharks, whales, and alligators, and yet every honourable member talks about invasion. Western Australia has an infriends vasion of rabbits; is it that to which orable members refer ? To me, this talk is amazing, and yet we are considered educated and thinking people. The germ of greatness is in everybody, but we are all the victims of a puncture in the germ's development. The great Labour torney-General party must not permit the freedom of worker to be touched. In an Englishinto speaking country a Judge weighs the evithose dence at a trial, and his sympathies are prosecution to get them there? always with the victim. It is not so with [101]- 2 the the military man. He has a peculiarlyconstituted conscience. I heard soldiers, were trained in Presbyterian universities, and were Sabbath school men, after marcoming back from the American War, sit round the table and talk of killing a man as a Chicago butcher will talk about butchering a hog. The great Labour did party should not allow these military men be judges of treason, or let them come into our houses, drag us out of our beds, emergency and shove us into gaol.",48

359,Mr KING OMALLEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I have, and I shall see a lot more before I die, though I am .a teetotaller. I do not believe in stagger-juice, which, in my opinion, is the curse of the English-speaking people. This Bill will set up here a military despotism more damnable than ever existed in Egypt. The newspapers came out today with the information that the Caucus was throttled. There is no throttling our Caucus. Thank God, we have freedom of speech, and we intend to maintain it . Our business in this matter is to tell bur Ministers not to violate the sacred principles of the Labour party. I can remember the time when Americans used to hunt Congressmen on their way to church on Sundays, and get them while at ""Washington to President, because it was impossible, without an order from the President, to get a man out of gaol. A man might say, "" I have no right to be here, because T committed no c r i m e "" ; but he was in gaol all the same. This is an assembly of intelligent men. Honourable members around me are possessed of towering intellects, yet they permit three or four Ministers to induce them to support a measure which did not emanate from Ministers at all , but which is submitted in fear of an invasion suggested by some officer who has been dancing the tango.",49
360,Mr JENSEN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Le t me tell the honourable member that no military man had anything to do with this Bill .,49
361,Mr KING OMALLEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I am prepared to put up any money, and say that no Labour man ever suggested it .",49
362,Mr JENSEN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I have answered the honourable member's statement.,49
363,Mr KING OMALLEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"It is no answer. I had three years of office, and know something about the game. I know as much about business as does anv member of the Committee, and if any honourable member thinks that I do not, let him take me on at the game of boodle. I shall divide the Committee on this clause, if I stand alone. I shall never have it said that I have been a traitor to the working man of Australia, and yet I never did an honest day's work, and never intend to. You cannot make money working. I should regard the passage of this measure as a national calamity. In Australia we are 12,000 miles away from the honourable scene of war-like operations, and there i j no chance of an invasion of this country. What nation would invade us ? The German fleet is gone, and the German flag is gone. I think they killed my brother down in Mexico, and I have got an oil-well there that I shall probably never see, yet America will not invade the country. When Ministers talk of an invasion of the Commonwealth, I say that the Almighty created the real defences of the Commonwealth by putting miles of ocean between it and other countries. An enemy would require a great fleet and a great stock of provisions before it could attempt the invasion of fchis country, and, if it did, Australians would meet the invaders, and guide them into hospitable graves.",49

I understand that the Government would be prepared to accept such an amendment of the clause, and, if it were agreed fco, no naturalized British subject could be tried by court martial. Perhaps the honourable member for Batman will say whether he is prepared to withdraw his amendment in order that sub-clause 6 may be amended in the way I have suggested.",49
365,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Batman) [9.13] - 1 do not wish fco withdraw my amendment, but I am prepared, with the consent of the Committee, fco have it amended in the way suggested by the Attorney-General, by adding after "" c i v i l i a n "" the words "" other than an alien enemy."" If fchafc is agreed to, we can deal with subclause 6 afterwards.",49
366,Mr GLYNN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Angas) [ 9 . 1 5 ] - If the words "" British subject"" are retained, they will apply to naturalized British subjects, and if the words ""other than an alien enemy"" are also put in , it may exclude some naturalized subjects. A German subject, according to German ideas, is a man who has been born in Germany, though he may have been naturalized elsewhere; and he remains a German-subject unless he gets a special certificate of dismissal, which a good many do not. I fancy the limitation goes beyond what the honourable member intends, and that the amendment now suggested may possibly deny the right of civil trial to some naturalized British subjects, and to aliens who are not enemy subjects. Amendment, by leave, amended.",49
367,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Melbourne Ports) [9.18] - The proposed amendment does not, to my mind, meet the case. The principal weakness lies in sub-clause 8, which nullifies sub-clause 6. We are assured by the Attorney-General and the Assistant Minister that no sentence of capital punishment will be carried out until the Executive has had an opportunity to review it. The trouble is that the suspension of sub-clause 6 by the operation of sub-clause 8 will immediately give the military authorities the right to exercise the powers to which we object. Unless it is absolutely set forth that any military decision shall be submitted to the Executive, the military authorities will be able to do anything they desire.",50
368,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"But there is to be a proviso that no sentence shall be carried out unless and until it has been submitted to the Governor General for review, confirmation, mitigation, or remission.",50
369,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Wit h other honourable members, 1 prefer working under an Act of Parliament to working under martial law; and what the honourable member for Elinders said eased my mind a good deal. But the military authorities are very likely to take action before the civil authorities can step in. This I know can be done under martial law, but I am afraid that the military authorities may deal with matters offhand, on the ground that they have no chance to appeal to the Executive, and that the necessities of the case compel them to take action at once. I do not think that this sub-clause is at all necessary, and if it is allowed to remain, we might as well place the conduct of all business under martial law.",50
370,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Sub-claus e 8 cannot come into force until it is proclaimed by the Executive.,50
371,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"And once it is proclaimed, the military authorities are given power to do certain things.",50
372,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"The Executive will give the military authorities what powers they please, and not what the military authorities ask for. No sentence can be carried out until it has been submitted to the Executive, and there is the fact that the proclamation will limit the area and the powers.",50

379,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I admit that; and I understand from the Attorney-General that if martial law prevails there will be no need for the operation of the Bill. My contention, however, is that we might just as well be under martial law if subclause 8 be retained.",50

My friend, the Attorney-General, did me the honour to say a few words about me, and to refer to my marvellous imagination. What envy! What jealousy! Never was Ananias more envious of Sapphira than is the Attorney-General of the honourable member for Bourke. What is the qualification of the Attorney General, if it is not his fertile imagination? What is it but his imagination that makes him grasp at the air? The honourable gentleman accuses me, not of stating facts, but of talking fiction, apparently envious of any one who may excel him. in this regard. Can the honourable gentleman not at least admire a competitor in the art of fiction?",50

382,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Let me say only a few kind words. Other honourable members have spoken severely about me, but never, in my most despondent moments, 'did I think that one such word would come from the Attorney-General.

385,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"The honourable member would have spoken in the same way .about representative government, religion, morality, or anything else.",51
386,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Do uot let us talk of morality-in politics. It has been said that in politics there are no morals and no principles, but only expediency; and those of us who lead the life well know that.",51

388,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"It is well for us that sometimes we should open the door. The Attorney-General talked of the Sansculottes; but why did we come here if not to speak for the Sansculottes ? Who constitute the nations of the world if it is not the Sansculottes ? The Attorney General was kind enough to remind honourable members, the ladies and gentlemen in the audience, the press, and the count r y generally, that the honourable member for Bourke had, at the beginning of the war, said something about the Belgian Fund, the inference, of course, being that that honourable member is less English and less patriotic and less a lover of his race than is the Attorney-General.",51
389,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I never said any of these things. That is all your,51
390,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Imagination . I suppose. Do not let envy run away with you. I am saying all this to the Attorney-General in a kindly spirit, i Mr HUGHES - You take a worm and make a sea-serpent out of it .",51
391,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"We have both done it . Wherein lies the honourable gentleman's excellence if not in his capacity to do that very thing? My honourable friend was pleased to remind the country and my friends on this side-and especially those friends of mine on the other side who have on occasions fought against methat on one occasion I spoke against the grant of £100,000 to the Belgians. I deplore the miseries of the Belgians. I recognise the struggle they have put up, I dealt but I based my objection to the grant on the ground that if any Parliament governed by a Labour party could vote £100,000 to the miserables of Belgium they could at least grant something to relieve the desolati'on in tlieir own midst. Those are the grounds upon which I stood, and upon those grounds I still stand, and I have no need to retreat from them. Then my honourable friend talks of the greatness of the war, the misery and desolation it has caused, and the duty devolving upon us to maintain civil liberty. He says that if the enemy conquers civil liberty will disappear. Is civil liberty to be maintained in a community by a measure of this kind ? Do we preserve civil liberty by providing ourselves with weapons against it? Do we further the cause of civil liberty by destroying it at the very beginning of the struggle? There is no necessity whatever to destroy one iota of the civil liberties which have been secured in Australia today in order to preserve our race. Will the honourable member allow me to remind him that Disraeli, in the forties, wrote a book designated The Two Nations, which afterwards became the foundation of the dissemination of the Socialistic doctrine in nearly every part of the w o r l d ! He laid it down that every country that existed tinder one flag was not one nationality, but twothe oppressors on the one hand, and the oppressed on the other. Let me ask my honourable friend, who is an exponent of the principles of the Labour party, for what does our party stand if it is not for the acquisition of civil and religious and political liberty, and the preservation of the rights of the great mass of the working classes, and the instrumentalities by which the great bulk of the community have risen out of the dens and caves of savagery to their present standard ? These things have been secured, not by wars upon men of other natioHalities, but by depriving of acquired rights and exclusive privileges some minority of men within our own nation. Prom what law? sprang the civil liberties of the British race; upon which we pride ourselves? They are not inherent in the race; they ing them. - are not the) exclusive property of the British people; they do not belong to us and attach to us exclusively, nor did they .grow up with us. They were born in the war has proceeded for nine months. very blood and fibre, and were secured the unselfish sacrifices of the great proleft letariat of the world. England has been made great by the struggles of the masses of the poor and obscure. It is they who have made her glorious in political, ligious, and civil liberty. Against whom have the English working classes warred It has not been against the Germans or against conquerors of foreign extraction, but against tyrants of theii own race creed. We have risen superior to tyrannies of the past by slow and agonizment, ing steps, by sacrifices, by tragedies the gallows and in the dungeons of - country; and those members of the British race who left their country because were not prepared to barter their ciples and their political rights have helped to make the British Empire the pride and glory of the world. chance Yet we talk of civil liberty as if ment only comes this chance. it were a mere birth right inherited us. The British race has been made great by those who suffered upon her gallows, who are buried in nameless graves, by that glorious and unnumbered army of the dead their support. and forgotten, who fought first for reconvictions; ligious liberty, and secondly for political liberty and the rights of the nation. From this mighty army of the unnumbered dead have come the great traditions which have made our nation what it is. Are to sacrifice these glories, these liberties, wood and drawers of water. and these traditions, when we can t u round and say today that under our flag there are monsters who call themselves Britishers, who enjoy civil and religious protection under the flag, and who yet, while men are drawn from th© mine, the and m ill , and the factory to go forth to and die upon the fields of Belgium France to uphold the glory of the Empire, are making profits out of the necessities of their fellow men?

I will affirm to-night that whether the war lasts another three months or anand other three years, we who call ourselves the a Labour party and a Labour Governwho are here by the will of the on people, put here by the efforts of workingour class men, we who were once working men ourselves, we who have risen to it , will they not be prepared to take our chance and prinour risk by using the power that has come into our hands.

What are we doing to protect the people against a rise in prices? What will we do, as the lionorable member for Wannon asked, to help the farmers who have had to shoot their horses and cattle because others have raised the price of fodder ? What are we doing under this Bill , in which we take the power to suppress the rights of every individual in the community, to take any civilian and order him before a court martial? We are not prepared to use our power to regulate the prices of which we have talked so much. Let us own and acknowledge that it is all one gigantic hypocrisy; and when we talk of civil rights and the shedding of blood, I will say once more, as I said at the beginning, as one who honours and glories in the men who offer up their lives in the forefront of battle, that at least it becomes our duty .and obligation to live up to our principles. I have had a week or two of this game on one subject and another, and probably this is the last that honourable members will hear of me for some time.

The proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne is surely preferable in for m. Why should we have two dicta stretching across these two sub-clauses when we can easily put them in one, particularly sub-clause 6?",53

It has, no doubt, a colloquial and well-understood meaning, but the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne is preferable, as it keeps to the words used in the sub-clause in the Bill . It says "" any person not being an alien enemy, and not being a person subject to the Naval Discipline Act . "" If the honourable member for Batman will agree, the Government will accept that amendment, which will do exactly what the honIt orable member wants, so far as it goes. If the honourable member for Batman wishes to move the deletion of any portion of sub-clause 6, so as to give the f i g h t of t r is l by j u r y to any civilian other than an alien, without requiring that he shall claim it , I shall offer no objection. But sub-clause 8 will then have to be made the subject of a second amendment. The effect of the honourable member for Melbourne's suggested amendment would be that every person other than an alien enemy would be entitled to civil t r i a l ; but sub-clause 6, as it stands, goes on to provide that such a person must make his claim to be tried by a civil Court within six days. I have no objection to the clause providing straight out that every civilian other than an alien enemy shall be entitled to a civil trial . I attach no special importance to the conditions in the clause hedging about this right. They are not, and cannot be, intended to defeat the purpose of the clause as it stands, which is to give to a British subject the right of trial by civil law.

410,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Plinders) hostile views can be reconciled. [9.48] - I did not hear the latter part of the Attorney-General's speech because of the circumstances in which it was made. As I understand the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bat8 man, it provides in sub-clause civilian, other than an alien enemy, shall be tried by court martial. If that provision be inserted, sub-clause 6 will become entirely inoperative, and a consequential amendment to omit it will have to be moved, since it contains a general provision that any civilian may be tried by court martial. Sub-clause 6 being thus deprived of any effect by the amendment, sub-clause 8, for the same reason, would have no effect, since it merely prothey vides that, in a certain contingency, clause 6 shall not be held to apply. I understand the honourable member for Batman to Be bringing forward in the form of his amendment an assertion of the general principle that everv civilian shall have the right to be tried by a civil Court. Let us test the question on that straight-out issue. Do not let us think for one moment that any alteration in subsequent parts of the clause will enable us to make the two inherently antagonistic views come together. It is better that we should decide once and for all whether the sub-clause is to stand. I am just as much opposed to a provision that will take away these rights, except in a case of extreme urgency, as is any honourable member. I agree with much that was said by the honourable member for If the Bourke as to the struggles of our fathers to secure certain liberties, which, no matter what our political opinions may be, are equally prized on both sides of the House. I therefore repeat what I said last night-that it is only because of the assurance of those who are intrusted with the governmenb of the Commonwealth in a time of great national peri] that it is necessary to take this power-and because of their solemn promise that they will not exercise it , except in a case of extreme national peril-that I , for one, am prepared to support them in this matter. Let us vote on this straight-out question. Honourable members who say that they are not prepared in any that circumstances to give the Government power should support the honourable amend member for Batman's amendment, but not under the impression that tliese two They can no moire be reconciled than water can be made to mix with oil.

412,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I am aware of that, but I am unable to agree with the honourable gentleman's interpretation of this provision. The honourable member for Batman's amendment is, in form and substance, intended to be a definite and absolute guarantee to all civilians that shall be entitled to t r i a l by jury besubfore a civil Court, no matter what the peril or the circumstances may be. If it is carried, the subsequent sub-clauses 6 and 8 will become absolutely meaningless, and should be struck out. That is the plain issue.

413,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Melbourne) [9.55] If sub-clause 8 is to be struck out, then I think I shall be right in stating now what I had intended to say when we reached that provision. I have given this matter considerable thought, and I intend to follow an example once set us by the honourable member for Flinders, although with a very different result. The honourable member said on one occasion in this House that he would have voted for a certain proposal if the Labour party had not been in power. In determining what should be my attitude in regard to this clause, I asked myself whether I should have voted for it if the late Government had been in power. My conscience told me that I would nQt, and, therefore - and this is where my action differs from that of the honourable member for Flinders- I decided that I could not support it , even with the present Government in power. Let us consider for a moment what martial or military law really is. According to Haydn's Dictionary of DatesMilitary or martial law is built on no principle, but is entirely arbitrary, and, truth, no law; but sometimes indulged, rather than allowed, as law - Si r Matthew Hale. It has been several times proclaimed in parts these Kingdoms, and in 1798 was almost general in Ireland, where it was also claimed in 1803. Military Manoeuvres Act, passed 1897, Military Works Acts, passed another, 1899. The King's regulation orders promulgated, 1901. Honourable members must know that marin tial law has never yet been proclaimed fro m frontier to frontier of the British ever Empire. It has never been proclaimed throughout the TJnited Kingdom and Irebecause land, but only in parts. Lest honourable members think that statement is too farthe fetched, I shall refer them to page 792 of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, where we have the statement thatIn 1803 a similar Act was passed by the liament of the United Kingdom That was an Act of indemnityas it was after the Act of Union. In introsome  one to enable the Government in Ireland to declare martial law in districts where rection exists, for that is a power which His Majesty already possesses-the object will to enable the Lord Lieutenant, when any perLet us sons shall be taken in rebellion, to order them to be tried immediately by a court martial."" This power exists in Great Britain afc the present time. There is a special law, to which the honourable member for Angas has referred. Let us see now where martia l law has been proclaimedDuring the 19fch century martial law was proclaimed by the British Government in the following places :- . 1. Barbadoes, 1805-1816. 2. Demerara, 1823. 3. Jamaica, 1831-1832; 1865. 4. Canada, 1837-1838. 5. Ceylon, 1817 and 1848. 6. Cephalonia, 1848. 7. Cape of Good Hope, 1834; 1849-1851. 8. St. Vincent, 1863. 9. South Africa, 1899-1901.",55
414,Mr GLYNN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,In some of those cases it was held subsequently that there was no power to proclaim it .,55
415,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"That is stated in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. In such cases, I presume an Indemnity Bill was subsequently passed. Last night, in answer to an interjection, which I regret was made regarding a name I did not desire to make public, I did an injustice to the honourable member for Balaclava. I settled withdrew the remark at the direction of in the Chairman, and I wish now to express my regret for having made it . The honof orable member for Balaclava is not to blame for the fact to which I am going to prorefer, and which will prove my statement 1897; in regard to a certain officer. I have and always fought against military domination, and shall continue to do so. I glory the idea of a civilian citizen soldiery to defend Australia, and am proud whenany of our citizen soldiers enlist for active service in this war, every one must recognise that the fight for civilization is taking place on battle-fields of Europe. We have had in our midst a coterie of officers who have advanced men who had not the courage to volunteer for the front-me n who stayed at home and polished up the Parhandle of the big front door. The latter have thus attained high rank. Only when they could not skulk any longer did of them volunteer for service abroad. not I have in my possession a letter from a man at the front whose statements I was insurable to verify today by reference to a be member of our Expeditionary Forces who has been invalided borne. My correspondent assures nie-and I know him as an honest man-that a free g if t of two barrels of wine from the Mayor of Fitzroy, together with other gifts of preserved f r u it and eggs, were sold in the regimental canteen, and the proceeds given to the officers.",55
416,Mr WATT,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Was that troop-ship ? Dr M AL ONE Y - Ye s .,56
417,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Where happen ?,56
418,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"On the way to ""Egypt. Whilst on this subject, I would like to quote from a report made by a deceased senator, who was not then a Labour man, but a Liberal, and who was an exceedingly straight goer-the honourable member for Balaclava will understand why I do not wish to mention the name of the officer concerned- I refer to the late Senator Styles, who saidLast yoar the following pricos wore charged at the canteen:Colonial alo, sold in bulk of nine gallons in a keg . . . 12 6 . . 18 0 J.5.K.Z. gin, per bottle . Whisky, per bottle .. Limejuice, per bottle . Sarsaparilla, per bottle Even mean and paltry thefts of coal belonging to the men were committed. But the late Senator Styles affirmed-and I think his statement drives the nail home better than does any statement. I have ever heardIf the higher prices fixed for the men were to discourage the use of intoxicants, it follows that the rates shown above were also fixed higher to check over-indulgence in limejuice nnd sarsaparilla. On the other hand, if the lower charges were to wheedle officers and sergeants into drinking canteen limejuice, it follows that the same cause would produce a like effect on the lower-grade non-commissioned officers and the men. If these things are done in time of peace, it is not impossible that they are done in time of war. I also hold in my hand a statement to the effect that members of our Expeditionary Forces abroad have not been provided with the clothes which have been sent to them. Whenever they have to r i d themselves of vermin, they are obliged to strip for the purpose. should men who draw only 2s. per day be required to pay for their clothes, after the Government have undertaken that they shall be properly equipped? I am sure that no honourable member will imagine for a moment that either the Minister of Defence or his colleagues have been unduly impressed by the views put on board a forward by military officers here. We all know that this Bill is almost a copy of the Imperial Act . But anybody who is familiar with the British Parliament did it knows that it consists largely of retired military and naval officers, and as a result not only every clause, but almost every line, of this measure is tinged with the military advice which is thus at the command of the Imperial Government. I repeat that martial law has never yet been proclaimed throughout the United Kingdom. W it h all its evils, I consider that lynch law would insure a person quite as fair a trial as would a court martial. I hope that an inquiry will be conducted into certain remarks which one of our brigaOfflcars and diers is alleged to have made on New Sergeants Men Paid. Paid. Year's Day-remark s which were an in s. d. s. d. sult to every honest man in our Expeditionary Forces. I would not soil my lips with the language which he used. 5 6 .. 8 0 Such language, addressed as it was to 4 0 .. 6 4 0 11 . 1 4 Australian natives, who have sacrificed 1 9 .. 2 8 much to uphold the cause of the Empire, should certainly be sufficient to warrant him being speedily brought to book. The remarks of this officer have not yet been published in the press-perhap s the censor has prevented that; but we may yet see them there. What is a trial by court martial? It is simply a trial of the accused by an officer who has had the advantage beforehand of seeing every document pertaining to the case, and who has, therefore, acquired an unconscious bias. How different is the trial of a soldier from that of an officer? We know that one soldier is now serving a term of imprisonment in this country for a certain offence, whilst an officer who is a greater thief and a viler man has escaped. Fortunately, he may yet be brought to book, because the Government have promised an inquiry into his case. On the suggestion of the Attorney-General, if the honourable member for Batman is prepared to withdraw his amendment, I would like to Why move that the following words be inserted in lieu of the first paragraph of subto clause 6Notwithstanding anything in this section, no person other than an alien enemy or a person subject to the Naval Discipline Act or tary law shall be tried by court martial for an orable member offence against this Act. - Mr HUGHES (West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [10.12] - I would like to plain to the Committee that the adopmine tion of the proposal which has been lined by the honourable member for Melhave bourne would leave the position of accused exactly where it was, except that it would include aliens other than enemy aliens, and that it would omit those conditions, which, after all, tomight embarrass some persons who might fail to recognise the importance of exerleft cising their right in this matter. would give to all persons other than enemy aliens the right of a civil trial.",56

I would suggest I moveto the honourable member for Batman that he will scarcely accomplish his purpose, even if the amendment he has submitted be carried, and that, therefore, he would do well to withdraw it , and to allow proposedus to vote upon the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne. The latter commences with the words, ""Notwithstanding anything section,"" whereas in similar words usually employed are, withstanding any of the foregoing to paragraphs of the section.""

426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Hav e not the sentences of all courts martial to be referred to the Executive for confirmation, together with minutes of proceedings and all details? This provision is entirely unnecessary.",58
427,Mr JENSEN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,It was suggested last night that the matter might be overlooked by the Government. The amendment has been moved to reassure honourable members.,58
428,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Bourke) [10.35] - We have been debating to-night proposals for the abrogation of the civil rights of the community, and some of us have objected to provisions giving to courts martial the right to try civilians. Our arguments may have been good or bad, but some honourable members at least have been influenced by them, because at the beginning of the evening I seemed to stand alone. A f t e r a great deal of discussion. Ministers have professed to make a conAYES. cession to the opinions of their critics by providing that no British subject shall be tried by a court martial, and we are asked to be content with that. But what they seem to give with one hand they take away with the other. Having given way in regard to sub-clause 6, they propose that sub-clause 8 shall stand, and thus their concession is Thomas, J. worth practically nothing. Ministers have the gigantic hypocrisy to say thafcfchesentences of courts martial will be subject fco review. The Prime Minister and other Ministers told us last night that the Executive would always review such sentences, and would see that justice wasNOES. 'done. If that be so, what is the need for the amendment that has just been moved? The Attorney General has told us fchafc the Executive has the powerfcoreview any military de- cision. Why, then, has this amendment been moved?",58
429,Mr GLYNN,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Angas) T10.38] - The power to try by court martial must be provided for by regulation. Sub-clause 8 pro- will be inoperative u n t i l a regulation is passed providing for the trial of civilians by martial law. That is an additional protection to civilians. I take it that.were an emergency which would just if y the operation of sub-clause 8 to aris». it. would be the duty of the Government to call Parliament together, if it were not then sitting. I assumefchafcthe emergency would be something in the nature of an invasion. Parliament being assembled, it would be in a position to disallow any regulation to which it objected. That is one of. the considerations which influenced'me in voting for the provision. The Defence Act requires the calling together of Parliament in certain contingencies, such as the calling out of the Forces with a view to prevent invasion. I take it that any similar emergency justifyin g the operation of sub-clause 8 would require the summoning of Parliament if it were not in session, and honourable members would then have power to disallow, if they thought fit, a regulation taking away the right to civil trial. Amendment agreed to.",58
430,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Bourke) [10.40] - I move That sub-clause 8 be further amended by the addition of the following words:-""Nothin g shall be deemed a military emergency which deprives a British subject of the right of trial by j u r y . "" I have had two experiences. We have argued this question hour after hour. On the resumption of the sitting after dinner, I presented a case, and gradually arguments in favour of my contention were built up. Members of the Opposition saw that there was some common sense and reason in what I advanced, and they began to support my view. Government then professed that they would make a concession, and the honourable and learned member for Batman moved an amendment to the effect that no British subject, not being an alien in any for m or shape, should be subject to the military power. That proposition was argued again pro and con; the Government then came down, and said, "" It is a very good Droposal.""",58
431,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"I said over and over again that it did not affect sub-clause 8, and the honourable member heard me.",59

436,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"The Attorney-General should not be too sure that honourable members will not yet come to my way of thinking. I advanced arguments as to why the military authorities should not have jurisdiction over civilians; and the honourable and learned member for Batman moved an amendment that British subjects should not be tried by a military court, and the Attorney-General, speaking candidly for the Government, said he would accept it .",59

448,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I cannot say that of you.,59
449,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,What did the At torney-General mean when he said that he would accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Batman ? He meant that he accepted the SDirit of it.,59
450,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,And you said you were satisfied. What more do you want?,59
451,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"The honourable member for Batman and I were satisfied provided that sub-clause 8 came out, because that I otherwise the Government gave us nothing. In other words, they gave with one hand what they took away with the other. The honourable member for Elinders once introduced in this State what we denounced as a Coercion Bill . We walked up and down the platforms of the country; we wrote articles and talked about the honourable and learned member are merely as an "" iceberg,"" as a man who had introduced a Coercion Bill . I venture to say that, odious as it was, it was not so far-reaching in its effects as will be this Bill , which has been introduced in the name of the Labour Government. I submit my amendment, and when a vote is taken I will go home.",59
452,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Flinders) [10.48] - I would point out to the honourable member for Bourke that the effect of his amendment, if carried, would be somewhat remarkable. It would not in the slightest way prevent the operation of the rest of sub-clause 8, which suspends the righ t of a man to trial by a civil Court, but would introduce an entirely new kind of trial- at r i a l before a court martial with a jury.",60
453,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"That is not bad, either.",60
454,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [10.49] - I submit that if the honourable member for Bourke wishes to enshrine this principle in the measure he could not possibly have selected a sub clause more inappropriate than sub-clause 8. The whole gravamen of Ins criticism has been directed against a court martial, because it is fundamentally opposed to , and destructive of, the principle of trial by jury under the civil law, and now he proposes to make this monstrous and unholy g r a ft on that principle. First of alh I think the amendment is out of order, because it is quite irrelevant to the subject-matter of the sub-clause, and it will not have the object of making workable or of rendering null and void this section which has been the subject of debate for two nights. I say this also to the honourable gentleman, that there is no honourable member on this side - or on the other side, so far as I know - who is not as anxious to preserve the rights of trial by jury as he is. He is not the only custodian of the people's rights. If he were to die, does he imagine that liberty would die with him? Does he for one moment imagine that if his voice were silent, then freedom would die? Does he think that freedom is so f r a i l a thing that it depends solely upon his advocacy, or that it will totter to a f all if he does not uphold it? I do not think so. Freedom existed before he lived, and will continue after he dies. The honourable member has, first of all, to recognise how utterly insignificant the individual is in the scheme of things. It is because of thab, and because of the lateness of the hour, that I suggest we come to a settlement) in regard to this matter. Question-That the words proposed to be inserted, be inserted-put .

455,Mr MCGRATH,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Ballarat) [11.0] I should like to explain that I voted against the Government to-night because we were promised by the Prime Minister that sub-clause 8 would be withdrawn. During the discussion yesterday, when this matter was referred to, the Prime Minister stated that, and I was under the impression, after the honourable member for Flinders had spoken, and after the discussion and the remarks by the Prime Minister, that sub-clause 8 was to be withdrawn.",60
456,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,That was not so. Such a thing was not in my mind. Ask the honourable member for Flinders.,60
457,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Of course not. The Prime Minister invited discussion; that was all.,60
458,Mr MCGRATH,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"In view of the opposition coming from this side, there was a feeling that the sub-clause was to be withdrawn; but now we find the Minister insisting upon it .",60
459,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Do you say that you were under that impression?,60
460,Mr MCGRATH,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,Yes ; I was. I thought that it would have been withdrawn today.,60
461,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,I said over and over again that sub-clause 8 would have to be dealt with when we came to it in Committee.,60
462,Mr MCGRATH,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Evidentl y there has been a misunderstanding. I was strongly of the opinion that it would not have been proceeded with, and I am surprised at a Labour Government introducing a Bill containing such a clause; but after experience of the military authorities, and after what I saw going on today, I am pleased to think that I was able to cast my vote against any increased power being granted to the military authorities.",61
463,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Wide Bay-Prime M i nister and Treasurer) [11.2] - I am sorry that there was a false impression in the mind of the honourable member, because I am clear that I invited discussion on the sub-clause referred to. In view of the position that we find ourselves in today, it is necessary, if we are going to do anything at all, either to take ample powers or leave the matter alone. That is my opinion. As regards the character of military officers and others, I think the honour of the former is equal to that of anyone else in the world. The time is past when we should cast any reflection upon them. We should realise that they are doing their best to meet the difficult circumstances of this world-crisis. time has come' for plain speaking in these matters, and that plain speaking ought to be done by me. If there are military officers who are incompetent to discharge the duties intrusted to them, they should be pointed out, and if the charge can be proved, they should be dismissed as not being worthy to carry the King's commission or be intrusted with the honour of this country. As far as I am concerned, I have said again and again that this is not, and must not be regarded as, a party measure in any way; so I would ask honourable members to be reasonable in their criticism, and not cast any reflection on men who are not in a position to answer the charges made.",61
464,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL MEMBERS AS RAILWA Y,"Bourke) [11.4] - I find myself in a most unfortunate position. I have been associated with the Labour movement from boyhood, and now it seems that today I am recreant to my party, though I am still under the impression that I am true to my conscience. I find myself left in a forlorn position upon things which I regard as of very high im portance; but I say clearly that I owe no allegiance after to-night to this Government, or to the men I find associated with them. The constituency of Bourke can have my resignation tomorrow. If I have not conducted myself properly, I am no longer fit to be a member qf this Parliament.",61
