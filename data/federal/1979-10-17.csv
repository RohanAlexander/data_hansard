The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the National Women's Advisory Council has not been democratically elected by the women of Australia; That the National Women's Advisory Council is not representative of the women of Australia; That the National Women's Advisory Council is a discriminatory and sexist imposition on Australian women as Australian men do not have a National Men's Advisory Council imposed on them.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the agreement between the Commonwealth and Japanese governments granting Japanese long line fishing boats access to Australia's recently declared two hundred mile fishing zone for a fee of SI.4m will seriously imperil the world's largest population of black marlin which inhabit the Nonh Queensland waters and consequently endanger the invaluable tourist and ancillary industries in that area which depend on big game fishing.

The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: There is a definite limit to the quantity of Australia's mineral resources. Accordingly our resources should be managed and developed under Australian ownership and control Publicly owned trading enterprises and corporations have been established and operated since Federation. The Commonwealth Banking Corporation, Trans Australia Airlines, Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, Australian were all designed to operate to the benefit of our Nation whole under public ownership.

The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Commonwealth Banking Corporation, Trans Australia Airlines, Qantas, Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, Australian Meat Livestock Corporation, Australian Wheat Board, were all designed to operate to the benefit of our Nation as a whole under public ownership. The Fraser government's irresponsible proposals to sell off our Nation's interest in the Ranger Uranium Mine, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, and to dispose of other successful statutory corporations such as Trans Australia Airlines and the Fawnmac group of drug companies would be contrary to the Nation's interests. Fawnmac still makes a profit of about half the proposed sale price in a year and costs the Australian government several times the proposed sale price. It provides the Pharmaceutical Benefits pricing negotiators within the Health Department inside information on drug manufacturing costs and so collusive monopolistic pricing by major transnational drugfirms.It complements the resources of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories to make both Government owned drugfirmsmore efficient and competitive by co-operation. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright proposals of the Fraser government to sell the Ranger Uramum Mine, the Housing reLoans Insurance Corporation, Trans Australia Airlines ana the Fawnmac group of companies.

That, as a result of these policies, many thousands of refugees are fleeing their homes and risking starvation and drowning. Because of the failure of the rich nations of the world to provide more than token assistance, the resources of the nations offirstrefuge, especially Malaysia and Thailand, of are being stretched beyond reasonable limits. As a wealthy nation within the region most affected, Australia is able to play a major pan in therescueas well as resettlement of these refugees. It should be possible for Australia to: establish and maintain on the Australian mainland basic transit camps for the housing and processing of 200,000 refugees each year; mobilise the Defence Force to search for, rescue and transpon to Australia those refugees who have been able to leave the Indo-China States; the offer of those church groups which propose to resettle some thousands of refugees in Australia. adoption of such a humane policy would have a marked effect on Australia's standing within the region. your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Burns, Mr Jarman and Mr Shipton.

Commonwealth Employees (Employment To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of electors of the State of New South Wales respectfully showeth: That the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act 1977 should immediately berepealedbecause: It provides unfettered power to Ministers to suspend, stand-down and dismiss Commonwealth Government employees and places them in a markedly disadvantageous position as compared with all other Australian workers. Its use places Commonwealth Government employees in direct conflict with the Government as it circumvents the arbitration tribunals and denies appeal rights.

As residents of Brisbane suburbs which, according to the Civil Air Operations Officers, are likely to be affected by increased noise pollution as aresultof the position and direction of the new proposed runway, your petitioners therefore pray the Government will (a) take note of the submission of the Civil Air Operations Officers' Association of Australia to the Public Works Committee Public Hearing on the Brisbane plans, and (b) ensure citizens of Brisbane that no increase in noise pollution will result from the Brisbane Airpon Plan adopted by the Government.

And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, by Mr Jarman. Petition received. To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That restoration of provisions of the Social Security Act that applied prior to the 1978-79 offset the rising cost of goods and services. The reason advanced by the Government for yearly payments 'that the lower level of inflation made twice-yearly payments inappropriate' is not valid. Great injury will be caused to 920,000 aged, invalid, widows and supporting parents, who rely solely on the pension or whose income, other than the pension, is $6 or less per week. Once-a-year payments strike a cruel blow to their expectation and make a mockery of a solemn election pledge. Accordingly, your petitioners call upon their legislators to: 1. Restore twice-yearly pension payments in the Autumn session. 2. Raise pensions and unemployed benefits above the poverty level to 30 per cent of AWE.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will make generous funding available for the specific purposes of: making a real improvement in the health, housing, education, employment and welfare of the Aboriginal people, doing so with dueregardfor the needs, hopes and aspirations of the Aboriginal people themselves; providing increased help, encouragement and opportunity for Aboriginal people to train as nursing aides and in other paramedical roles, and as fully qualified nurses, and social workers; providing increased health education for Aboriginal people in ways that are acceptable to them. by Mr Ruddock.

We urge you to implement this request through your Minister for Social Security.

5,Mr JOHN BROWN,DISALLOWED NOTICE OF MOTION," Mr Speaker, I wish to raise a matter of privilege. Yesterday in this House I asked a question of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Street). I was given an answer. But my perusal of the Hansard today leads me to believe that the sense of that answer has been altered in the text of the Hansard- altered most dramatically, almost to produce a direct negative of the answer I was given. I seek your indulgence, Mr Speaker, to establish whether a prima facie case of privilege exists by listening to the tape of the proceedings.",23
6,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED NOTICE OF MOTION,"I suggest to the honourable gentleman that he not pursue the matter as an issue of privilege. It is the practice of the House, when a member disagrees with the Hansard repon, to bring it to my attention. It is the Presiding Officer's responsibility to ensure that there is an accurate Hansard repon. The honourable gentleNotice of Motion man will point out to me where he believes that the report does not accurately reflect what was said. I will make my own inquiries.

9,Mr STREET,DISALLOWED NOTICE OF MOTION,"Coul d I ask for your indulgence, Mr Speaker, to make a statement. I heard that there was some allegation that the Hansard greens had been altered in some way. I checked with the Principal Parliamentary Reporter.

Therefore, to expose the Minister, you should give an early hearing to the honourable member for Parramatta.",23
11,Mr SCHOLES,DISALLOWED NOTICE OF MOTION,"On the point of order, Mr Speaker. The explanation given by the Minister for Industrial Relations does not relate to the matter raised by the honourable member for Parramatta. The issue of privilege raised by the honourable member for Parramatta was that a misrepresentation of the answer to a question in this House had been placed in Hansard by alterations to the text of the answer. It did not refer to the debate on the matter of public importance at all, but to a question, which is a quite different matter.",23

15,Mr KEATING,URANIUM SALES,"I ask the Prime Minister a question about uranium. I refer him to the fact that approval has been given for the developactively ment of the Ranger, Nabarlek, Yeelirrie and Roxby Downs uranium deposits-that is, excludters ing Pancontinental Mining Ltd-and that proproliferation duction from the first three mines will reach 8,000 tonnes per annum by 1985 with at least further 3,000 tonnes from Roxby Downs. Given security that the Australian Atomic Energy Commission ness estimates of annual world demand for uranium have dropped from 115,000 tonnes in 1973 to 54,000 tonnes in 1978 and that the surplus in world uranium production will be more than world 30,000 tonnes a year by 1985, does this not mean that Australian uranium will be in acute overthink supply and will be sold into a buyers market tumbling prices and safeguards deterioration? Will the Prime Minister confirm that not one new uramum contract has been entered into since And one 1972? Will he confirm that the one small union prospect of sales to the Philippines is now recedwas ing and that the only other likely prospect moment is for modest sales to Britain? Finally, will he expatiate upon his Government's bullish He went on: assessments for Australian uranium sales by . . telling the Parliament precisely where all this risy uranium is to be sold? May I ask respectfully that Japanese the answer be based upon fact and not upon rhetoric?",24
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM SALES,"As to the details of the honourable gentleman's question, I will treat the question as placed on the Notice Paper and get a written reply to that as soon as I But, there are one or two general things that, think, ought to be said. The Government has made decisions about the mining and export of uranium under the strictest possible safeguards because it believes that there is a need to supply energy in an energy-short world. I would have Notice Paper. thought that some of the discussions on energy conservation and statements by representatives from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others in recent days and the news in the Press this morning that there is a Ukelihood of a further price rise by some OPEC countries all indicate that there is at the very least a great scarcity of oil. I hope the honourable gentleman will accept that. There is also an acceptance throughout European countries and in Japan and a great many other countries that if they are to have the energy that they need to keep their own industries going and to keep their homes warm in the winter, they will need to rely increasingly on nuclear generated electricity. Therefore, the trade is going to go on. I would have thought that it would be far better for the peaceful and proper prosecution of that trade for Australia to be very involved in it because that then strengthens our voice in non-proliferation matand in making sure that the world nonregime is as effective as it possibly can be. That affects our security as it affects a everyone's security. It does not help Australian at all for Australia to stay out of the busiof selling uranium and let other people do it in the way that may be less secure and less safe than if Australia itself had been involved. So, Australian security in the longer term, as well as security in relation to proliferation, is a significant part of what we are about. But also I that there have been some notable comwith ments made about this subject in quite recent times. Somebody recendy said: I have been to Japan and talked with the people there. overwhelming point that was put to me by the trade ofncials and the workers there unanimously . . . what right have you, the Australian trade union movement to tell us, the Japanese people, about the at the dangers of nuclear power. . Can you figure any greater gall and greater hypocthan we comfortably sitting here in Australia should make a decision on the basis of what is good or not good for workers inrespectof nuclear power. They have been through it and they have made an economic decision",24
17,Mr KEATING,URANIUM SALES,"I raise a point of order. I did not ask about Japanese workers; I asked about Australian uranium demand on the basis that the can. Australian Cabinet has approved the developI ment of four major uranium mines in Australia. If Cabinet has considered this issue, the Prime Minister should be able to expatiate on his feet about market demand and give us some indication and not to put the question quietly on the",24
18,Mr SPEAKER,URANIUM SALES,The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. The answer being given by the Prime Minister is relevant to the question asked.,24
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM SALES,"If the honourable gentleman wants to ask a detailed question and quote a great many figures in the question, I think it only appropriate to make sure that the information is adequately recorded and that a proper answer is given, and it will be. The honourable gentleman said that he was not concerned about Japanese workers. That, of course, is the attitude of the Australian Labor Party in relation to these matters. The Australian Labor Party just does not care about people. It cares only about an unrelated philosophy that bears no relationship to the real world. I will continue with the quotation. This gentleman said, and let me repeat a little of it: Can youfigureany greater gall and greater hypocrisy than we comfortably sitting here in Australia should make a decision on the basis of what workers in respect of nuclear power. They have been through it and they have made an economic decision endorsed by the trade union movement that in terms of the economic needs of Japan, it is essential that they have nuclear generated power. They have made the decision and if some of you sitting here in your luxury want to substitute your consciences for theirs, I could not think of any hypocrisy. Of courseMr Jull-Who said that?",25

The honourable member for Blaxland can try to suggreater gest that there is no need for them to move off their comfortable but hypocritical perch-no t my term but, in the words of Mr Hawke, hypocritical-becaus e he thinks there is not going to be a substantial need. There will be a market for Australian uranium. The honourable gentleman knows quite well that there has been a need to negotiate safeguards arrangements. He knows quite well that over the time there will be an expanding market for uranium from Australia. The honourable gentleman wants to suggest that there is a respectability in his position because, he says, there is not, and will not be, a demand for Australian uranium. As usual, the honourable gentleman will find his judgment very much misplaced. NA Mr THOMSONM y question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. The Minister will be aware that a petition containing 8,818 signatures from Cairns has just been presented to this House. It calls for a delay in the signing of the fisheries agreement with Japan so that negotiations can be continued for a larger buffer zone to protect black marlin. Last night the Minister had a meeting with fishing representatives from Queensland and New South Wales to discuss this very difficult problem. Can the Minister comment on the possibility of delaying the signing of the agreement? What steps can be taken to ensure that the black marlin are protected from long-line fishing, both now and in the future?",25
34,Mr NIXON,BLACK MARLIN,"I regret having to tell the honourable member that under the international obligations we have in respect of this agreement there is no way in which we can delay the signing of the agreement. The signing will take place this afternoon. I should remind the honourable member of the important factor in this agreement that will allow for a consideration of the concern expressed by the 8,000-odd people who signed the petition which has been presented to the House. For the firsttimethe 200-mile economic fishing zone now comes under the control of the Australian Government. For thefirsttime there is an agreement between the Australian Government and the Japanese Government as to fishing in those waters, and for the first time there is also a capacity to negotiate with respect to long-line tuna fishing in those areas in the 12 months ahead. As I pointed out to the House yesterday, the present agreement excludes the Japanese fromfishingin an area of some 80,000 square miles of waters. That is a very significant departure from the situation that existed while these were Commonwealth waters. I also pointed out to the House yesterday that there are a number of other protections that are important to the marlinfishingin that area. For the firsttimewe will be able to co-ordinate the monitoring of the fishing that is taking place and we will be able to have Australian officials on board Japanese boats which are fishing in the area. The essential point is that the long-line tuna agreement is for 12 months only. Representatives of the game fishing clubs who met me last night agreed to the setting up of a joint committee consisting of Commonwealth, State and gamefishingofficials who would take part in the monitoring. Whilst to those who are concerned there may seem to be some negatives in the agreement, the fact is that there are a number of positives that should not be ignored. NA NA",26

52,Mr KILLEN,FORMER OFFICERS TO COMPANIES,"I take it that my honourable friend is adverting to the matter which the honourable member for Melbourne raised in the House this afternoon. There is no provision that I Aerospace am aware of in the Defence Act which would preclude any former member of the Defence Force entering into private employment any Government's where in Australia. I am not aware of any such provision, and I am not aware of any convention or practice to that end. I am aware of the fact the Public Service Board has recently provided guidelines which it is suggested should lowed by former public servants of the country. As things now stand I invite the House to accept the view that those guidelines would be persuasment ive only in character and would not have the force of law. This Parliament has not legislated to prevent former members of the Pubhc Service or former members of the Defence Force from another one. entering into private employment. That would be a matter for conscious government decision and for the authority of this House, and that is clearly a matter of policy. I think that the majority of members in the Parliament would aware that this matter has been considered the Bowen committee of inquiry; with what resituation? sults, we will have to wait and see. I would that how a former member of the Defence Force behaves upon entering into private would be essentially a matter for his own sense of fitness and integrity. I hold the view, and I hold it very strongly, that where there is no instinct for honour one cannot legislate for it. I am not aware of any abuse by any former member of the Service who has gone into private employment. Members of this Parliament, members of this House, have gone into private employment. I would regard as a startling proposal to seek to place a complete embargo on all former members of the Public Service or the Parliament or of government the Defence Force entering into private employment. I remind the House that several members of this House have returned to pastoral duties. I would think any person who returned to pastoral duties out in the parish after a few years in this place would have a distinct advantage over his brethren. NA NA",27

I ask the Minister to bear in mind also this officer's recent experience in the Army and as the representative on the committee of inquiry into an international satellite proposal.",27

I am that not aware of any obligation upon that gentleman to seek the approval of the present Secretary of be folthe Department of Defence.

56,Mr HOWARD,ECONOMIC POLICY,"While I was absent I noticed reports of proposals, mainly emanating from the Opposition in this Parliament, that there should be a change in the Government's economic strategy in the name of being more effective in reducing unemployment. I tell the honourable gentleman and the members of the Opposition that the single most important impression that I gained it more than ever before from the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Belgrade and discussions that I had with my counterparts or of in the governments of the United States of America, Britain, Germany, France and other industrialised countries was the unanimity of opinion amongst those countries as to the need to defeat inflation as a fundamental pre-condition of lasting economic growth and therefore a recovery in employment levels. Country after country which has tinkered with the poUcies now advanced by the Opposition has abandoned them. If members of the Opposition doubt that I invite them to look at what the former British Labour Government was doing to the job creation schemes that were established by the Wilson and Callaghan governments in the 1970s. I invite them to examine the communique issued by the interim committee of the International Monetary Fund after its meeting in Belgrade a couple of weeks ago. It stated, among other things, that the committee emphasised that the main task of economic poUcy was to contain inflationary pressures and to reduce inflationary expectations. I draw the attention of honourable gendemen on the other side of the House to the increased emphasis now being placed by the United States Government on containing inflation. In that context I welcome the measures recently announced by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve which are designed to constrain the rate of growth of the money supply in the United States and also to introduce quantitative controls on the volume of credit in that country. All around the industrialised world governments are reaffirming in a stronger manner than ever before the importance offightinginflation as a fundamental pre-condition to economic growth. There is no greater hoax in the economic debate in Australia at the presenttimethan the proposition that one can defeat unemployment by allowing inflation to go up. Nothing has altered the simple economic truth that the only way effectively to fight unemployment in this country is to defeat inflation, and that is why more than ever before this Government does not intend to make any alteration to the fundamental basis of its economic policies.

Does the Prime Minister recall debate in this Parliament in March 1978 on IBM-Facom affair? Does he recall one of the points at issue in that debate relating to the appointment of a Mr Harragan, formerly of the Department of Social Security, with Facom Austraha Ltd, a likely suppUer of computer equipment? The Prime Minister will recall saying, as recorded at page 591 of the House ofRepresentatives Hansard of the debate: It is not only my judgment and the judgment of the Government that what was done in those circumstances was wrong. The Prime Minister then went on approvingly to quote my criticism of Mr Harragan taking such an appointment when there was likely to be a conflict of this sort of interest. I ask the Prime Minister: Why is the Government now distinguishing between its attitude of objection to Mr Harragan taking such an appointment and its justification of Brigadier MCMillen taking an appointment with the Ford Aerospace and Communications Corporation?",28

59,Mr LUSHER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT,Is the Treasurer able to give the Parliament any details of progress in redrafting section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act?,28
60,Mr HOWARD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT,"Section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, as honourable members will know, is the general anti-avoidance section which was inserted many years ago. As a consequence of successive decisions of the High Court of Australia, the section now has a more limited operation than was originally the case. The Government has been engaged in trying to rewrite the section for a number of months. A draft of the section was completed by Parliamentary Counsel and the Taxation Office some weeks ago and on my instructions the Deputy Crown Solicitor briefed senior and junior counsel in Melbourne and Sydney to settle the draft of the section. So far I have received one of the combined opinions from two of the counsel involved and I am presently awaiting the second opinion. When that has been received, I, in consultation with my advisers in this respect, will consider those opinions and their impact upon the draft. The Government attaches a good deal of importance to the successful rewriting of section 260, for two reasons. Firstly, I believe that the Inhe come Tax Assessment Act should, in the name of effective anti-avoidance, contain a general antiavoidance provision. I think that is a view that the would be shared by honourable gentlemen on both sides of the House. Secondly, I believe that in the course of rewriting the section we should be careful that it is done in a way that makes it effective to detect tax avoidance but at the same time ensure that it is not written in such a general fashion as to cast an unnecessary pall over ordinary and thoroughly legitimate commercial transactions. It is for that reason that the Governrecollection ment is taking very considerable pains, through briefing private counsel, to make sure, to put it shortly, that we get it right. I do not believe, in view of the time scale involved, that it would be possible to expose a draft of the section before the Houserises,but it is my intention, when I have completed a draft of it and it has been approved by the Government, to make that draft pubhc and to invite comment upon it from all interested parties from both sides of the House so that, when the Parliament resumes in the New Year, we will be in a position, in the light of those comments, to present the Parliament for adoption what will then be regarded as a satisfactory rewrite of section 260. While I am on this subject, I take the opportunity of publicly commending some remarks made recently in the Journal of the Institute of Chartered Accountants by Mr Bishop, the President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. He drew attention to the obligations of members of that profession so far as advice in respect of tax avoidance practices is concerned. I believe that Mr Bishop, in giving that advice, displayed very considerable courage and displayed a conspicuous sensitivity to the responsibilities of his office. I believe that all of us who think that there is merit in members of the legal and accountancy professions accepting a sense of responsibility in these matters ought to pay particular tribute to Mr Bishop's stand and his remarks.

The timetable is something like this: Public comment on the Staples letter was first made by the Australian Broadcasting Commission program PM at or about six minutes past six on 11 October.

After reading a transcript of the PM segment and after speaking to employees of the ABC PM program several hours later- I cannot give a precise time, but it was some time after 9 p.m - a member of my staffmade copies available to several members of the Press, particularly those who had been seeking information about the document.

79,Mr BRADFIELD,DEPRECIATION ON MOTOR VEHICLES,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. He will be aware of speculation regarding the Government's Budget announcement of an $18,000 ceiling for depreciation purposes on passenger cars and station wagons. Is he also aware that some community uncertainty is causing a temporary loss of car sales? Does he agree that some speculation regarding the effect of this legislation is incorrect?",30
80,Mr HOWARD,DEPRECIATION ON MOTOR VEHICLES,"I thank the honourable member for Barton for that question because I believe that some unfortunate confusion and doubt has arisen from this Budget measure. I make it clear to the honourable member that the Government has given very careful consideration to many representations that have been received. As I indicated in the Press statement which I made yesterday, the Government intends to adhere to the Budget decision. I indicated in that statement that because of the appUcation of the commencement date the measure will not affect cars and station wagons which were ordered or were on hand prior to the time of the Budget. In those circumstances, in effect, some kind of transitional period lowed. That will obviate severe liquidity lems that might- I stress the word 'might'-hav e yesterdaybeen experienced by a limited number of dealers. I will arrange as soon as possible for details the announcement and any anticipated arising out of it to be circulated to all motor dealers in Australia. I am aware, for example, that some dealers did not know that under the Budget decision all lease charges will remain totally tax deductible, provided a business can be established. Equally, some people were under the impression that the measure in some way affects vehicles purchased entirely or partly for private use. Of course, that has never been case. The measure was designed simply ceiling on the amount that can be claimed for depreciation purposes for the business use of a motor car or station wagon. I think it is a fair measure that will be seen by the community as having been taken in the interests of tax equity. I think that the interruption in sales which has been alleged by a number of dealers in recent weeks has been due more to an anticipation that the measure may be reversed than the actual effect of the measure. Some of the evidence available to the Government, particularly that regarding motor vehicles which are priced only just above $18,000, indicates that this is almost certainly the case. I make it clear to the honourable member that the Government has looked very carefully at the measure. We have decided not to alter it. The modification I announced last night will be the only modification to it. The necessary legislation will be introduced in due course. NA NA",30

He will recall denying that he was responsible. He will also recall that subsequently I asked him a question directly whether any member of his staff was responsible for such a distribution. I ask whether he recalls stating: I will check up on the question asked by the honourable will be algentleman and let him know. probWhy did he prevaricate in his answer",30

I have also noted that according to May's Parliamentary Practice it is not an acthe ceptable word in the House of Commons, and of to put a course I withdraw it.

Why did he seek to evade a direct response to that question when he clearly recall such an important matter of such recent event, unless he had decided to embark on an attempted cover-up?",30

As I said, I had no intention of making this document public until it had become public, because, as the honourable gentleman would appreciate, there is no mileage in Mr Justice Staples' letter so far as the Governby ment is concerned. It is a matter of public edge that the contents of the letter are highly critical, in emotional terms, of much of the Government's legislation which has been through this House and which is now before the Senate.

Indeed, in one of the main classes for red wine, Australian wines won all four of the first places. I congratulate the wine producers. I am sure all honourable members will join me in that. Australian wines have consistently won international is awards. Our exports of wine are increasing, but is still a big job to do. Perhaps it ought to be noted that only about 2 per cent of Australian production is exported. Last year those exports were increased by about 15 per cent which was the first increase for five or six years. Tradithe wine producers themselves have not undertaken the exports. Some markets in Scandinavia are new. Other important marketsJapan, Germany and the United Kingdom-ar e The Australian Wine Board has taken generalised promotion abroad and has recently appointed an international marketing manager, we think will assist. The Government has made a number of efforts in respect of export market expansion and development. It has taken a direct interest in assisting those exports.

112,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN AID TO EAST TIMOR,"In view of Australia's very genuine concern for the tragic humanitarian situto his colleagues in the Arbiation in East Timor, and in view of reports that the over 40 per cent of a recent multi-million dollar arbiaid grant from the International Red Cross failed to reach its proper destination, I ask the Minister our hands for Foreign Affairs what steps are takenHonourable members interjecting.",32
113,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN AID TO EAST TIMOR,"I would rather have a sick throat than a sick mind. My throat will be better in a couple of days. I ask the Minister: What steps are taken to ensure that Australian Governaid truly reaches the scores of thousands of people in need? Is the Minister able to comment on a recent announcement by the New Zealand that it intends to institute a full inquiry into the delivery of New Zealand humanibut during tarian aid to East Timor?  chased under previous arrangements and to previous Australian grants, and delivered by barge to Dili, Australian officials, as I have said in this House in answer to a question from the honourable member for Fraser, were satisfied with the storage and distribution facilities used for the aid. They were impressed also with arrangements that they saw for distribution of relief material. Indonesian authorities have, for that aid for that particular area and for those particular grants, provided satisfactory accounting for the distribution of that aid. We believe that the record of the Indonesian Red Cross in relation to its relief effort in East Timor is reasonably satisthe factory. Similar conclusions were, in fact, drawn by New Zealand Red Cross officials following a visit to East Timor last January. There has been with later consignments of aid a hold-up which I have been concerned about. I have asked the Australian Embassy in Jakarta to investigate this and have the matter expedited. When I receive the Ambassador's report on that matter, I will advise the honourable member. NA",32
114,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM SALES,"I ask for your indulgence, Mr Speaker, to add to the other part of the answer about uranium sales which I gave earlier to the honourable member for Blaxland.",33
115,Mr SPEAKER,URANIUM SALES,The right honourable gentleman may proceed.,33
116,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM SALES,"The honourable gentleman was concerned whether there would be an adequate demand for Australian uranium. It ought to be noted that there are 200 nuclear actors operating in 22 countries at the present time and a similar number under construction in 29 countries. The reactors now being built have an average of around 70 per cent greater capacity than those now operating. Even if 400 or more additional reactors which are either firmly ordered or planned are excluded, what is now happening represents a three-fold expansion of uranium requirements over the next ten years. It is nonsense to suggest therefore, as some have done, that production from new Australian mines will not find a market in this situation. Indeed, after 1990, the question is not whether there will be a market for uranium but whether there will be productive capacity to meet the requirements of the reactors then in use. The interest already shown by companies wishing to acquire a share of the Government's participation in the Ranger project is an indication that industry shares the Government's view that a substantial future market exists for Australian uranium.

137,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION,"For the informadon of honourable members, I present the annual report of the Department of Housing and Construction for the 1978-79 nnancial year. NA Ministerial Statement  Foreign Affairs)-by leave-On 14 October 1976 the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) presented to the House on behalf of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence the Committee's report on 'The International Legal and Diplomatic Aspects of the Situation of Australians Possessing Dual or Plural Nationality'. This is a short statement on this matter. The report of the Joint Committee was presented on a realistic note by the honourable member with the comment that the problems of dual nationality are well nigh impossible of unilateral resolution by Australia. Further study has unfortunately confirmed that view. The difficulties that arise for Australian citizens from their dual nationality are however of continuing concern to the Government. The House will recall that in my statement of 26 May 1978 on consular services I dealt with the problems of dual nationality. Briefly, I indicated at that time that many migrants who are naturalised Australians, or in some cases their children who are natural born Australians, may be regarded by their countries of birth, or of their parents' birth, still to be citizens of those countries. Such dual nationals can be subject to the laws of the country of their first citizenship, who may claim jurisdiction over them in such matters as military service or taxation. My Department and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs attempt to make dual nationals aware of the problems they might encounter on return to their country of birth or ethnic origin. The requirement for assistance to dual nationals has inevitably grown as more foreignborn Australians return to visit their former homes. The problems of dual nationals cannot be overcome by citizens simply asserting that they do not accept their other citizenship. In some cases formal acts of renunciation are possible, but in other countries no such provisions exist; the requirements should be carefully established in advance. It is for the individual to ascertain and to bear the consequences of coming within the jurisdiction of another country which claims his or her citizenship, whether the individual or the Australian Government recognises that claim or not. I take this opportunity to repeat my earlier advice that consular officers can advise, but beyond a strict limit they cannot assist when in these circumstances the jurisdiction of another country is being asserted. My Department publishes a booklet called 'Hints for Australian Travellers', which is issued free with all Australian passports, and which is available from any office of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Australia and from any overseas Australian mission. This booklet contains information and advice on the problem of dual nationality. The report of the Joint Committee was referred to an interdepartmental committee drawn from the Departments of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney-General and Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The interdepartmental committee's conclusions were endorsed by the three Ministers concerned. The committee's report and conclusions by departments have most recently been given consideration by the Government. The long-standing policy of the Australian Government of avoiding wherever possible the creation by its legislation of instances of dual nationality, while at the same time giving recognition to such status wherever it occurs, has been reaffirmed. The Government thus accepts the over-riding conclusion and recommendation of the committee. As I have indicated, responsible Ministers and departments are also active in disseminating information on dual nationality problems-anothe r recommendation of the Joint Committee report. On the other hand, our conclusion is that there is no requirement as proposed in the report for new or additional machinery to investigate complaints by dual nationals. The recommendation that consideration should be given to replacing particulars of place of birth in Australian passports with particulars of place of residence has been dealt with in detail in my second reading speech on the Passports Amendment Bill. There remain two recommendations of the report calling for constructive action: That Australia should initiate relevant action in the United Nations and should give high priority to negotiating bilateral agreements to overcome dual nationality problems. Formidable difficulties of a poltiical, legal and practical nature in the way of progress on dual nationality problems, either by way of bilateral or multilateral agreement. This cautious and, I might add, common assessment needs to be emphasised. Nevertheless the Government has decided, with respect to the report submitted by the Parimportant liamentary Joint Committee, to study the ments. prospects of negotiating bilateral agreements with certain countries. The Government also proposes to examine further the possibUity having the question of dual nationality examined in an appropriate forum of the United Nations. A further statement to the House will be made a future time on this subject in the light of studies. While speaking about this question of dual domicile nationality I should mention that the Governlaw ment is keenly aware of the concern felt by cerbirth. tain Australian citizens about the new Soviet law on citizenship which came into force on 1 this year. The implications of this law are the subject of an urgent study in departments conis cerned, and the Australian Embassy in Moscow has formally sought clarification of certain points from the Soviet authorities. I hope that the Government will soon be in a position to provide guidance to those people who have made inquiries about this new law. In the meantime I can give an assurance that nobody will lose Aushonourable tralian citizenship through the operation of a law of another country.",34
138,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DUAL NATIONALITY,"Before the Minister sits down, could he inform the House as to the nature of the new Soviet law of citizenship?  thing to the honourable member. We are receivmany ing advice in regard to that matter so that we give detailed information not only to the honourdifficulty able members who have made representations to me, but also to various individuals who have responded directly with me. The Soviet Union introduced fairly all-embracing laws regarding its citizenship and the ramifications of these should be responded to, I believe, with the best of legal advice avaUable, both at private international law and pubUc international law. That is why I say that I wiU be advising honourable members in due course.",35
139,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DUAL NATIONALITY,"by leave-It will be appreciated that I will be unable to refer to the Soviet law matter but I would like to make some other comments. We appreciate what the Minister for Foreign  statement. We are aware of the fact that there stand was a committee which reported some time ago as the Minister indicated. I am also aware of the conclusions and recommendations of that committee, which the Minister has suggested in good faith he will endeavour to implement if possible. We are aware of the situation in Australia. It is that we try to get bilateral arrangeIf other countries are anxious to have us take their citizens-as many countries are because they are anxious to get the nnancial of exchange which in many cases is remitted to them-it seems to be an appropriate time to suggest that those countries might enter into a bilatat eral arrangement whereby a citizen, on acceptthese ance of nationaUty in Australia, is no longer obUged to be a dual national. I am aware of the international law which relates to the question of of origin. It will be difficult to erase that because the domicile of origin is related to If one is born in another country there is going to be an issue always as to whether one is July deemed to be originally a national of that country. Honourable members will notice that it an accepted principle of international law that diplomatic protection may not be given by a state to a dual national of that state when he is in the country of the other nationality. So there are also problems in regard to international law. I am aware of what has been happening. The member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) is anxious to put certain matters before the Parliament.he Par and he is going to say a few words in a moment. We have made representations to other countries on the basis of those countries accepting passports which did not have the place of birth entered in them. From the answer given the Senate on 11 October, it is pretty clear that countries-suc h as Greece-ar e not precan pared to accede to that request. We have the of countries not being prepared to accede to what I would say is a reasonable recorquest. This will require further strong negotiation. The Opposition would give support to the Government in that area. We are also mindful of laws the recommendations of the Joint ParUamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence that the Hague Convention was of the opinion that a person should have only one nauonality. Obviously it would be the nauonality of the resident's permanent domicile. If honourable members look at page 5 of the report of the Committee, they will see that only 20 countries ever became parties to that particular Convention. Australia is one of those countries, but the major countries from which we obtain migrants are not parties to the Convention. We appreciate the efforts made by the Committee and by the Minister, but there is a long way to go. It would seem appropriate that we should be using some of our monetary muscle to indicate clearly to these countries that when citizens leave them and come to Australia, by a bilateral arrangement which we should negotiate at the time, and if they adopt our citizenship, they should be accepted by other countries as having one nationality only, namely, that of Australia.",35
140,Dr KLUGMAN,DUAL NATIONALITY,"by would like to comment on the interdepartmental committee's report which the Minister for  to let me look at. I understand that the interdepartmental committee consisted of officers from the Department of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Department of the General, and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I would like to draw the attention of the House to paragraphs 26, 27 and 28 of that report. I seek leave to incorporate parts of the document in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read asfollows26. For example, between 1956 and 1958 the Soviet Union concluded bilateral agreements with Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, North Korea, Poland and Mongolia. These Conventions provide that persons who possess tracting States and reside in the territoiy of one of them, may choose exclusively the citizenship of the other by tiling a declaration to that effect with its Embassy within one year from the date of coming into force of the respective Convention. 27. The declaration of choice is examined by the competent authorities to whom it has been submitted. The Contracting States are bound to cations which have been accepted and, in the case of certain Conventions, also of the appUcations rejected. Persons who fail to express their choice of citizenship are to be regarded citizens solely of their country ofresidence.Minors as a rule follow the citizenship of their parents. 28. An example of a multipartite agreement to which the Committee made reference is the 1963 Council of Europe Convention on Reduction of Cases of Multiple Nationality and Military Obligations in Cases of Multiple NationaUty. This Convention comprises two substantive chaptersChapter I concernsreductionof cases of multiple nationaUty and Chapter II concerns military obUgations. Parties may apply both chapters, Chapter I with reservations and Chapter II, or Chapter II only. Only Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Luxembourg apply both chapters without reservations. Unlike the Conventions concluded between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, which require only that a person seek the consent of the State in which he is not resident but whose nationaUty he wishes to retain, Chapter II of the Council of Europe Convention requires that a person seek the consent of the State whose nationaUty he wishes torenounce.Such consent may not, however, be withheld if the person has not been aresidentof that State for ten years and is at thetimeordinarily resident in the State whose nationality he wishes to retain. 29. There is provision in the European Convention for other States to accede to it. The Government is considering the desirability of Australia doing so, although it should be noted that the countries with which Australia encounters most difficulties over dual nationaUty are not parties to the Convention.",36
141,Dr KLUGMAN,DUAL NATIONALITY,"Paragraphs 26 and 27 refer basically to what has happened in what we call 'Soviet satellite states'. I will read very quickly from paragraph 26 which says: . . . between 1956 and 1958 the Soviet Union included bilateral agreements with Yugoslavialeave-I I suppose that Yugoslavia is not a Soviet satellite state. I apologise to the Yugoslavs. Hungary, Romania, AlbaniaAlbania also is not a Soviet satelliteCzechoslovakia, Bulgaria, North Korea, Poland and MongoUa. Attorney- North Korea probably is not a Soviet satellite. It is probably having an argument with the Chinese in that regard. These Conventions provide that persons who possess the citizenship of both contracting States and reside in the territory of one of them, may choose exclusively the citizenship of the other by filing a declaration to that effect with its Embassy within one year from the date of coining into force of therespectiveConvention. Paragraph 27 makes the following point: Persons who fail to express their choice of citizenship are to be regarded as citizens solely of their country of residence. Minors as a rule follow the citizenship of their parents. the citizenship of both conThat is the important point that we ought to aim at. If a person desires to have a citizenship of his new country of residence, as is the case with most of the people who have moved to Australia, he ought to be entitled to that citizenship, and exclusively that. That is the important point. The inform each other of the applisecond point I would like to make is that the Council of Europe Convention on Reduction of as Cases of Multiple Nationality and Military Obligations in Cases of Multiple NationaUty in 1963, made a number of suggestions. I quote from paragraph 28 which reads: Unlike the Conventions concluded between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, which require only that a person seek the consent of the State in which he is not resident but whose nationaUty he wishes toretain,Chapter II of the Council of Europe Conventionrequiresthat a person seek the consent of the State whose nationality he wishes renounce. Such consent may not, however, be withheldThat is importantif the person has been a resident of that State for and is at the time ordinarilyresidentin the State nationality he wishes to retain. My own view is that the Government ought to try to conclude bilateral agreements with the countries of Europe and other countries of origin of Australian citizens on the basis of either one of those criteria. As I said earlier I think that that would be of great satisfaction to Australian citizens whose origins were the co-caUed Soviet bloc countries- I admit that not all of them are Soviet bloc countries-and the countries belonging to the Council of Europe. The only other point I make-it was an important point that we raised in the report on dual nationality-concern s the question of whether the place of birth should appear on passports. The argument has been that the place of birth has to appear on passports because a number of countries will not accept passports if the place of birth does not apear on them. Paragraph 44 of the interdepartmental committee report states: The authorities of France, Turkey, Trinidad and Tobago, South Africa and Guyana stated that passports which did not show the place of birth would those countries. Jamaican authorities stated that if passports did not include this information, travellers would be required to provide other proof of place of birth. The only point I make is that it is regrettable to my mind that a number of countries require the place of birth to be inserted in a passport before that passport is considered to be valid. I urge the Minister and the Department to take at least the first step in the right direction and to state clearly that Australia does not require foreign passports to contain the place of birth of the person carrying that passport before we accept that passport as being valid. I do not know whether at the present time we accept as being valid passports that do not show the place of birth. I think that it is purely a bureaucratic requirement or inertia and that we are used to having the place of birth put in passports. To my mind it is fairly irrelevant. There must be much better methods of obtaining the identity of a person, such as photographs or fingerprints, than the place of birth. I urge the Australian Government to state quite clearly that it does not require the place birth to appear on foreign passports before accepts those passports. I think that we should continue to press for the situation of passports Australian citizens not being required to show the place of birth. The holder of the passport should have the opportunity either of not filling to in that part of it or voluntarily having his place of birth inserted. Alternatively the place of residence, rather than the place of birth, could be shown so that Australian citizens born in certain ten years countries are not afraid that they will be conwhose sidered to be citizens of their country of birth, when they visit that country, or other countries, because their place of birth appears in the passport.

AUSTRALIAN FISHING ZONE: NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance,37
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROTECTION OF BLACK MARLIN," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Australian Government to protect black marlin in the AustraUanfishingzone. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",37
144,Mr COHEN,PROTECTION OF BLACK MARLIN,"In the last two weeks an issue has erupted that has angered Australian people, and Queenslanders in parof ticular, in a manner that most members have not it experienced in their lives in Parliament. This Government has announced that it is about to for sign an agreement with the Japanese Government that will permit Japanese long-line fishermen to fish for black marlin within the Australian fishing zone. The size and scope of people's anger has quite clearly shocked and surprised both the Australian and Queensland governments but it appears to be insufficient to make them do anything about the matter. A number of members of parliament, including one Minister, have informed me that they have received more phone calls, letters, telegrams and petitions on this issue than on any other issue in their parUamentary careers. The arrogance and insensitivity of the Government and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) is breathtaking. Despite the overwhelming opposition of the Australian people, and incidentally of many Government members, the Government insists that it will proceed to sign the agreement this afternoon. It has been suggested by some quarters that the reason for people's anger is the fact that the fishermen are Japanese. In a few instances this may be true. Having flown to Cairns last Sunday to talk to people of north Queensland and to the fishermen in particular, I can assure the House, the Japanese people and the Japanese Government that the overwhelming majority of Australians are not interested in who takes the black marlin, but only about the fact that they are being taken. If the long-Une fishermen were French, American or British the objection to this act of negligence and gross vandalism would have been just the same. The reasons for Australians' anger over the Government's action or inaction is very simple. They know very well how important the resources of the Great Barrier Reef are to Australia. They know that the area off north Queensland is the greatest black marUn fishing area in the world. The people of Australia have been made aware of the fact that, due to the past exploitation of the waters, the region is being denuded of one of its greatest assets. Let me make it clear that while the game fishermen may be leading the fight to save the black marlin they are far from being the only people who are furious at the Government's action. North Queensland's prosperity depends marlin to a great degree on tourism. I have said so many has times before that the Great Barrier Reef is Australia's greatest tourist attraction. The sands of people involved in tourism concerned. The world knows that the Great BarJapanese rier Reef is one of the greatest ecological master20 pieces in the world. In recent years the world has become aware of the threat to the Reef's survival from,firstly,the crown of thorns starfish, secondly, the Taiwanese clam fisherscientific men, more recently the threat to drill for oil in waters and now the long-line fishermen. Conservationists are equally concerned. The black marlin is the symbol of north Queensland's tourist industry. If the black marlin goes, so will a large part of the north Queensland and Australian tourism. This matter first surfaced, if that is the appropriate phrase, when the former Minister for Primary Industry, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), announced the proclamation of the 200-mile nautical fishing zone. He stated in his speech to the House of Representatives on 25 September that negotiations were proceeding with the Japanese Government to provide access for Japanese fishing vessels to the Australian fishing zone. Within a matter of days it was announced that the Queensland Government would refuse to cooperate in the declaration of the Capricornia section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park unless the Australian Government renegotiated the agreement to exclude Japanese long-line fishermen because of the threat to black marUn. From that moment the conflicting and confusing statements emanating from the new Minister for Primary Industry and the Queensland Government have been so conflicting and confusing that they would be laughable if the matter were not so serious. Without getting into this comedy of errors, let me point out that while originally professing great indignation at the agreement the Queensland Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, now is an enthusiasic supporter of it. What became apparent when this matter was raised in the House was the incredible lack of knowledge of the Minister for Primary Industry and, even more, his lack of concern for the future of the black marlin. When I asked him on 9 October on what scientific information concerning the population of black marlin off the Great Barrier Reef did the Government decide to allow Japanese long-line fishermen access to fish for tuna and black marlin, he provided the following priceless reply: In all the discussions that have taken place in respect of fishing in these waters, whatever scientific evidence been available has been used. One of the problems is that there is a complete lack of scientific evidence. thouWhen the House finally stopped laughing he are equally went on to say: The only evidence of any use at all is the experience the have gained fromfishingthese waters over the past years. On that basis and on the knowledge of the history offishingin these waters an agreement has been reached Great Barrier with the Japanese. The Minister is wrong on two counts. Firstly, studies have been done and papers its have been published on the black marlin fishing area off north Queensland. Two papers, one pubUshed in 1965 by John Howard and Shoji Neyanagi and the other in 1972 by Isumi Nakamura, provided scientific evidence that the waters around Cairns are a major breeding ground for black marlin. Secondly, there is considerable evidence from responsible bodies that the black marlin catch is declining at an alarming rate. The United States Department of Commerce National Marine Fisheries Services 1978 report states that the catch rate from sport fisheries off Cairns had declined by 50 per cent from 1971 to 1976. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation statistics show a decline in the tonnage of black marlin landed in Japan from 2,200 tonnes in 1971 to 772 tonnes in 1976. In 1975 the Japanese took 394 tonnes of black marlin from the Cairns region but in 1976, year later, their catch dropped to 169 tonnes. This may not be scientific evidence but when these figures are considered alongside that charter fishing operators from the Cairns gion have reported a marked decline in the sighttralian ings of black marlin during the past two years to: one would have thought that the Minister for Primary Industry and his Department would have fishermen taken an educated guess and come to the view can that something serious was happening to marUn in the area off Cairns. A sensitive Minister would have said to himself: 'These figures cate that something is wrong. Let us have a scienyear. tific study before we proceed with the agreeSouth ment'. But no, the Minister prefers to take the risk and for a miserable $1.4m is prepared to allow the Japanese long-line fishermen to plete black marUn stocks further to the point where black marlin may become an endangered species. I am sorry to have to say this but the Japanese record on conservation of the world's fishing sources is quite deplorable. We are all well of Japan's appalling record, along with that of the Russians, with regard to the whale. One could have some sympathy for Japanese fisher men if Japan were a poor developing country. But clearly it is not. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and it can well afford to buy other food to replace whale and marlin. The total value of the black marlin catch from Australian waters landed in Japan is an insignificant $750,000. To look at this in strictly monetary terms, Australia stands to lose a great deal more financially than the $1.4m that it will receive in licensing fees from the Japanese-the major portion, incidentally, being for tuna. At least boats are engaged in charter for black marlin sportfishingplus 10 mother ships for accommodation. Some 300 tourist fishermen pay more than $3m each year in charter fees alone, not to mention air fares, food, transport and a whole range of other goods and services that they pay for when they come to Australia, including of course the multiplier effect of Mr John Brown-Grog .",37
145,Mr COHEN,PROTECTION OF BLACK MARLIN,"As the honourable member for Parramatta reminds me, I imagine that those fishermen occasionally have a drink. There is also the multiplier effect on the tourist industry and the effect that has on the north Queensland economy. The publicity alone that people such as Lee Marvin and Jack Nicklaus bring to north Queensland is a major factor in building the aura of the region as an exciting tourist destination for hundreds of thousands of other visitors, both one domestic and international, who come to the area even though they personally may never fish for marlin. In my view this answers the sort of the fact charge made by my dear friend Mungo reMACCullum, who wrote in this morning's AusFinancial Review that the campaign was . . . save the black marlin from marauding Japanese so that macho American actors like Lee Marvin spend huge amounts of money coming to Queensland to black catch one and be photographed with it. I point out to those who make this point that the indisportsfishermencatch only 100 black marlin a The rest are tagged and released. The New Wales State Fisheries Game Fishing Tagging Program, under which the catching and tagging in the region is supervised, reports that de1,200 marlin have been caught and tagged during the past two years alone. So there is a very small ratio of one marlin killed for every six which are caught and released. One would have thought and hoped that at re- least the Government would have insisted upon aware a provision in the agreement similar to that required by the United States Government. Since 1977 the United States has prohibited foreign long-line vessels operating in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico waters from keeping any bUlfish such as marlin or sailfish if they are caught in the United States 200-mile fishing zone. United States observers are on board each fishing vessel at thefishermen'sexpense to see that aU bUlfish caught are released. The Minister, who professes to be concerned about the problem, had not even heard about the United States regulation when I asked him a question about it yesterday. I understand that the United States is drafting simUar 28 regulations to apply to its Pacific waters next year. The Minister has made great play of the fact that Japanese long-line fishermen have been operating in this region for the past 20 to 30 years. That is totally irrelevant because, as the Minister well knows, under the previously existing law of the sea there was no way that we could have stopped them. The declaration of the Australian fishing zone under the new law of the sea enabled Australia to prohibit those fishing practices which we considered deleterious to Australia's resources. What the Minister has now done is to formalise and legalise these practices for a small fee. The agreement reached between the Commonwealth and Queensland supposedly restricts the Japanese fishermen from 80,000 square miles. The Australian fishing zone does absolutely nothing further to restrict Japanese fishermen other than to ban them from the Gulf of Carpenteria. Long-line fishermen would not fish in most of those 80,000 square miles anyhow. The agreement that prohibits them from 12 mUes seaward of the 200-metre depth mark is absurd. In the Cairns area the 200-metre line is only 100 or so metres from much of the reef. Earlier the Queensland Government was pubUcly calling on the Federal Government not to aUow long-lines any closer than 100 mUes from the reef in an area 13 degrees south to 18 degrees south. This is still the call from fishing organisations and conservation groups. One of the most disgraceful episodes of this whole mess is the fact that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has not been consulted. This was made clear when on 11 October Senator Webster, the Minister for Science and the Environment, was asked a question about black marlin fishing. We have also been informed from reliable sources that the Department of Primary Industry is setting up a State-Commonwealth committee to investigate game fishing. It does not include representatives of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. When the Authority asked why it was not to be brought into the discussion it was told: 'You stick to tourism. Fishing is none of your business'. When one realises that the next section of the reef to be declared is likely to be the area between Lizard Island and Innisfail one wonders just what is going on. This is just another example of the total competence of this Government when it comes to protecting Australia's environment from predsition ators. The Government still has not given an surance that the Great Barrier Reef will not be drilled for oil. Taiwanese fishermen are still operating quite openly and taking hundreds thousands of clams. And now we have an Ausstrictions tralian government selling out the black marlin for a miserable few dollars. It is ironic that next week Australia Post will release four stamps dealing with fish that have a special significance to Australia. One of those stamps will be a 50c stamp showing a black marlin. If the Government does not move soon to end this outrage the only people who will see black martin in future will be philatelists. As Lee Marvin has been mentioned in relation to this matter I finish by quoting what he said. He is one of our best known black marlinfishermen.He has made a public appeal to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) not to sign the fishing agreement with the Japanese because, he said:  Manhattan for 27 bucks.",39
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROTECTION OF BLACK MARLIN,Mr MILLAR Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,40
147,Mr NIXON,PROTECTION OF BLACK MARLIN,"Gippsland-Minister for Transport and Minister for Primary Industry) (3.55)-The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) does no service to the black marlin fishing industry, nor does he solve the problems facing it, when he speaks so emotionally, ulogically and with a lack of information. It is interesting to note that this is the first time that the Opposition has started to take any interest in the welfare of Australia's fishing resources. Let us look at the current position. Till this point of time the Japanese have been fishing in Australian waters, unhindered, up to the 12-mUe limit and in some cases, till 1975, up fo the 3-mUe limit for the past 20 to 30 years. Why has not the Australian Labor Party expressed any concern about that? Till this point of time, fishing has been almost open slather. I can only say that the honourable member for Robertson is simply trying to score cheap political points. One could readUy ask the Opposition what its intentions would be, looking at its policy in respect of the 200-mUe Australianfishingzone. Its policy states that a Labor government will without prejudice to the existing fishing industry establish Australian and joint international projects to exploit the 200-mile economic zone for control overfisheries.There is no mention in that policy of protecting the marlin. So let us not have in any of the humbug that we had from the honourable member for Robertson. What the Opporefuses to recognise in this matter is that as as a result of the declaration of the 200-mile Australian fishing zone, Australia has been able for the first time to negotiate a fisheries agreement of with Japan which places very considerable reon its fishing activities within Australian waters. This agreement places on Japanese activities limits which have never previously been imposed and with regard to the tuna long-linefishingthe agreement can be renegotiated at the end of 12 months. This agreement is not life-long. It is re-negotiable after 12 months and within the period of the agreement it can and will be closely monitored. The Opposition completely and absolutely refuses to acknowledge the benefits of the agreefishermen ment. It seems that fundamentally the Labor Party has adopted the view that Australia should not sign any fishing agreement with Japan and presumably with any other foreign country. attitude totally ignores ALP policy, but more portantly it ignores Australia's international obligations and can be described only as completely irresponsible. In extending jurisdiction over a 200-mile fishing zone Australia gets tain rights but also has to assume certain oblisimple gations. Among these is a requirement from the Law of the Sea Conference 'that coastal States are required to have regard to the need to miniand mise economic dislocation in States whose nationals have habituallyfishedin the zone or have made substantial efforts in research and identification of stocks'. Japan fills both these teria. The Japanese have been fishing these waters for 25 years. But despite this Australia succeeded through the fisheries agreement to have Japanese fishing activities in Australian waters restricted over considerable areas around Australia, including the 80,000 square miles water off Queensland. Let me explain some of the history which led up to this agreement. Preliminary discussions with regard to this proposed agreement took pletely place in mid-1978. Since then there have been consistent consultations through the Australian Fisheries Council, consisting of Commonwealth and State Ministers, and the Standing Comproposed mittee on Fisheries, the South Committee, the Northern Fisheries Committee and directly, as occasion required, by official discussions with the States concerned. In the last two weeks further discussions have been agreement held on the marlin issue. Last Friday a joint Commonwealth-Queensland officials meeting in Brisbane reached an agreed position on access by Japanese tuna long-line fishing vessels in waters off the north of Queensland. The the Japanese Government has been notified of that agreement. Prior to signing the agreement the Japanese have been informed that the Australian Government will seek early consultations to examine the necessity or otherwise of an adhaving ditional area off Cairns from which long-line tuna vessels should be excluded next year. Also more detailed studies will be undertaken during the period of the one year agreement to determine the full effects of Japanese long-line activities in Australian waters. The Japanese Government has been notified that in the ensuing months Australia will be paying particular attention to monitoring the arrangements as they affect game fishing stocks and activities in the Cairns area. Under the agreement the Japanese wiU be required to report the activities regularly, including catch information every six days. Their activities will also be subject to inspection by Australian officials at any time. That These restrictions have not been imposed on imJapanese fishing activities in the past. As I have already said, this agreement excludes Japanese fishing operations from concersiderable areas of Australian waters. Put in terms, these areas of exclusion on the east coast take in all waters inside the 200-mile isobath. This includes all the Great Barrier Reef the continental shelf. In addition, on the east coast there is further exclusion of long-liners from a strip of water some 3,600 square miles in area between 14 degrees 20 minutes south and cri18 degrees. This is the area fished by northern Queensland game fishermen. In both these has areas, there is total exclusion of Japanese longline vessels accounting for a total area of about 80,000 square miles of water. None of these exclusions would have been possible without a of fisheries agreement with Japan. Around the remainder of Australia Japanese long-liners are excluded from operating in large areas of waters in the south-east, across the Great Australian Bight and off the Northern Territory either comor on a seasonal basis. Otherwise their operations are excluded from all waters within 12 miles of the Australian coastline or its islands. These conditions are precisely defined in the agreement relating to Japanese longEastern Fisheries line access. Let me stress another point about this agreement in respect of long-line vessels. It will be an for only one year. During the year, as I have said, we will be closely monitoring the working of it and the effects of the Japanese long-line activities. We wttl be taking into full account the views of interested parties, including observations of gamefishingorganisations. I am advised that statistics do not indicate evidence that the operations of the Japanese longliners are seriously affecting marlin stocks m waters off north Queensland nor that they are an adverse effect on the appeal of big game fishing as a sport and tourist attraction. Members of the Opposition might be interested to know that the Japanese claim that this agreement will result in a considerably reduced fish take. The honourable member for Robertson tried to make capital from what I said the other day in answer to a question about the lack of research information. Let me make the point again that there has been no Commonwealth funded or effective research into marlin or other bill fish, but there has been considerable research and scientific evidence available to and used by the Commonwealth in relation to fisheries. The Commonwealth has not involved itself directly because until now it has had no jurisdictional responsibility in this area. However, all information on the various examinations that have been carried out has been available to the Department of Primary Industry and has been used by the Department in its assessment of the situation. These research programs have provided information into breeding areas,fishingpatterns, migratory patterns, the size of marlin stocks and age distribution within stocks. On the basis of all this information there is no evidence that marlin or tuna fish stocks in the Coral Sea are under any biological threat through present fishing activity. I think the honourable member for Robertson does a disservice by trying to build this up into an emotional issue. Indeed statements in recent days by gamefishermenspokesmen bear this out, On AM yesterday the President of the Cairns Game Fishing Club, Mr Jock Izatt reiterated a point which he made on Australian Broadcasting Commission radio in Brisbane the day before. He said: There is absolutely no evidence we have found have to hand to suggest that the black marlin is an gered species. Catches have been variable from year over the past 30 years. But, definitely nothing to they are an endangered species. fish up here.",40
148,Mr COHEN,PROTECTION OF BLACK MARLIN,He is the only one in the area who says so.,42
149,Mr NIXON,PROTECTION OF BLACK MARLIN,"I suggest he would know more stocks about it than the honourable member would. That is what Mr Izatt, who is the President of Cairns Game Fishing Club, said on Brisbane radio in the last couple of days. He also said-thi is the truth-that the whole affair had become political football. He said that the people who have been making statements have not the knowledge- I think he is referring to the honourevidence able member for Robertson-o r the right to make statements on behalf of the areas in the far north of Queensland. However, should there be any evidence of deterioration in the stocks of marlin or tuna fish during the 12 months of agreement with the Japanese it will be within the power of the Commonwealth to modify any future agreements in order to protect Australian fishing interests. It is worth looking further at the protection and benefits that the 200-mile Australian fishing zone offers to Australia. The essential effect is that foreign fishermen operating within the 200-mile zone will be in breach of the law unless they have an Australian licence and they comply with terms and conditions of access determined by Australia. Australia will determine the total allowable catch; the catch that will be taken by Australians, and the allocation to foreign countries of any available surplus. Foreigners will not be allowed to fish areas fully exploited by Australians or likely to be exploited in the near future. The aUocation to foreign fishermen will be reduced as Australians develop the capacity to operate in specific areas. Foreigners will not be allowed to fish areas fully exploited by Australians or Ukely to be so exploited in the near future. Allocations to foreign fishermen will be reduced as Australians develop the capacity to operate in specific areas. Let me summarise: Australia is now in a far better position than ever before with regard to Japanesefishingactivities in our waters. For the past 30-odd years, the Japanese have been operating freely up to 12 mUes off the Australian coastline. They are now required to report details of their catch and operation every six days. Their activities are subject to inspection by Australian officials at any time. Japanese tuna long-line vessels are excluded at present from a total area of that we 80,000 square mUes off the Queensland coast; endanand that has never been the case before. All this to year is the result of negotiations among the Commonsuggest that wealth, the Queensland Government, industry There's still plenty of good organisations and the Japanese. We have now served notice on the Japanese that we will be closely monitoring the effects of their fishing activities on the tuna and marlin off the Queensland coast. If there is need to exclude their long-liners from additional the waters, they will be excluded in future agreements. We will be conducting studies which will s include input by game fishermen organisations a throughout the duration of this 12 month agreement. Australia will not aUow the marlin or tuna stocks to be dangerously depleted. There is no at present to suggest that past fishing activities by the Japanese are leading to such a situation. For the first time ever, the entire question of Japanese long line fishing activities has been brought under control to a position where it the can be monitored and its effects studied. As a result of a meeting that I had last night with representatives of New South Wales and Queensland gamefishingorganisations, a working committee is to be established to monitor the progress of the agreement. The committee will be made up of Commonwealth, Queensland and New South Wales government officials and representatives of gamefishingorganisations.",42
150,Mr COHEN,PROTECTION OF BLACK MARLIN,The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority?,43
151,Mr NIXON,PROTECTION OF BLACK MARLIN,"The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is not in it because it is not even in the zone offishing.That is the simple reason. The fishing begins way beyond the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. It is as simple as that. I have also agreed to put to the Government as soon as possible a request by the game fishing delegation that Australia seek a voluntary withdrawal by the Japanese of their tuna long-linefishingvessels from operating in waters off the Queensland coast between 13 degrees and 18 degrees south during the period of the agreement. I can assure the House, as I assured the delegation which saw me last night, that the Australian Government is vitally concerned to ensure adequate protection of the marlinfisheryoff north Queensland. We will not allow long linefishingactivities to jeopardise that fishery.",43
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROTECTION OF BLACK MARLIN,"The discussion is concluded. NA Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time.",43
153,Mr FIFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1979 now before the House proposes amendments to Schedule 2 to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. The Bill follows a complete review of the operation and appUcation of the 2 per cent revenue duty imposed on 1 July 1979 as part of the Government's overall budgetary policy. As a result of this review the Government has decided to exempt two specific areas of imports from the 2 per cent duty. While remaining committed to the retention of the levy, the Government had decided to exempt two specific areas from its application. The areas involved are: Ships and other vessels temporarily imported into Australia on the authority of the Minister for Transport under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations; and goods for use in connection with the exploration for petroleum or the development of petroleum wells to the point where the well-head assembly is attached. Exemption from the 2 per cent duty on these goods has been made because of the temporary nature of imports of ships and similar vessels and the Government's desire not to impede oU exploration in Australia. Whilst the Government appreciates the effect of the revenue duty on other goods and areas of industry it could not see its way clear to extending exemptions beyond the two areas referred to. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Clyde Cameron) adjourned. NA (ADMINISTRATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1979 Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time. Second Reading",43
154,Mr FIFE,DIESEL FUEL TAXATION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Diesel Fuel Taxation (Administration) Act 1957, which contains the administrative machin(No. 3) 1979 ery for the collection of a tax imposed on diesel fuel when used in propelling a road vehicle on a public road, currently stipulates that if a person who has purchased diesel fuel free of tax for use Second Reading otherwise than in propelling a road vehicle on a public road subsequently uses that fuel for propelUng a road vehicle on a pubUc road he shall, within 21 days after such use, notify a collector of customs in writing that the fuel has been so used. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Diesel Fuel Taxation (Administration) Act 1957 to enable that notification period to be extended beyond 21 days so as to accommodate persons who have experienced difficulty in complying with this requirement because of present day accounting practices. Clause 4 of the Bill continues the Government's policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect therightsor entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Cohen) adjourned. NA Suspension of Standing Orders Motions (by Mr Viner) proposed: 1. That Standing Order 48A be suspended for this sitting. 2. That in relation to the prog. ceedings on the following Bills, so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill 1979. Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 1979 [No. 2]. Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1979. Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1979. (Quorum formed).",43
155,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SECURITY LEGISLATION," I oppose the motion. I did not think I would ever see a day when a so-called parUamentary democracy would allow a Bill such as the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill, which will introduce into this country a potice state, to be pushed through the Parliament without proper debate. That is what the motion moved by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) is all about. He is asking this House to agree to allow a Minister to gag a debate on the introduction of a police state. I remember speaking at a meeting of the InterParliamentary Union in Majorca how I astounded some of my co-delegates when I set out some of the complaints I had against the laws and the government of this country. I said that I lived in a country in which people could be forced tofightagainst their will in an undeclared foreign war; a country in which men could be sent to gaol for refusing to work at a rate of pay fixed by somebody sitting as an arbitrator. I said that I belonged to a country which had a Crimes Act which made it a crime to decide to withhold one's labour until one got a rate of pay that one considered to be justifiable. I went through all the complaints I had about Australia but I concluded my speech by saying: 'But with all the things I have enumerated with which I disagree I have one advantage over most of the delegates at this conference. The advantage is this: When I go back to Australia after condemning my own government in the manner in which I have, nobody will put his hand on my shoulder as I get out of the plane and say ""Come with me"".' I remarked that to me that represented an enormous advantage. It was something that distinguished my country from those of many of the delegates who had spoken at the same conference. Mr Donald Cameron-Goug h Whitlam said it to you in 1974 when he sacked you.",44
156,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SECURITY LEGISLATION,Gough Whitlam did not sack me in 1974. Mr Donald Cameron-In 1975 then.,44
157,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SECURITY LEGISLATION,Now the honourable member is changing his ground. He should make up his mind. Gough Whitlam did not sack me in 1975 either. Gough Whitlam told the Governor General how to sack Ministers. He time in respect of all the Bills: pointed out to the Governor General the section of the Constitution which gave him the right to sack any Minister. There is no such thing in the Constitution as a Prime Minister. I want to correct the honourable member on that point.,44
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SECURITY LEGISLATION,Mr M ill a r ) Order! I ask the honourable member for Hindmarsh to remain relevant to the motion.,44
159,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The proposal to gag the debate on a matter such as this must be unprecedented. I could not now go to another international conference and make concluding remarks of the kind I did at the IPU meeting in 1967. This Government is not a democratic government. It treats the Parliament with utter contempt, otherwise it would not have moved a motion such as that which has been moved. This Government is being governed by pubUc servants who are not answerable to anybody. It does not care two hoots for the Parliament. We may as well all pack up, go home and allow the Government to ram through its dictatorial legislation without debate. One would have thought that the Government would at least have gone through the pretence of making it appear that we are living in a democracy. I do not know of any democracy in the world in which such a motion could be moved. In the United States a Bill such as the ASIO Bill could certainly not be raUroaded through the Congress without proper debate. It was bad enough pushing through the ConcUiation and Arbitration Amendment Bill without debate and without letting those who wished to make contributions have their say, but to push through a proposal that affects the tiberty of every single human being in this country is the last straw. I asked in the debate yesterday- I repeat it now-wh y is my private residence under almost constant surveUlance? That is what I want to know. The Minister will not answer the question.",44
160,Mr VINER,SECURITY LEGISLATION,Goug h Whitlam wants to look at your papers.,44
161,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SECURITY LEGISLATION,The Minister says that Gough Whitlam wants to look at my papers and that he is about to make a Watergate break into my house. I do not care who is doing it. All I know is that the surveillance is being carried by two people who are using motor cars from Commonwealth car pool.,44
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SECURITY LEGISLATION,Order! The resent honourable member for Hindmarsh will come back to the motion.,45
163,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SECURITY LEGISLATION,"If Gough Whitlam care has the use of Commonwealth cars, he has much more influence than I imagined him to have. I am genuinely disturbed about the trend in the Australia. I warn the Government that once has set the police state apparatus in motion there is no way that it can unwind it. There is no going back on it. We are taking steps from which there is no possible retreat. We are elected by our taken. various constituencies to put a point of view. I remind the House that that view is widely held by people all over Australia. Those honourable members who will vote to gag the most important debate that any of us in the Parliament have are. listened to for the past two or three years are representing people who will not support them what they are going to do. People with the police state propositions which the Government is trying to push through the Parliament without debate. Mr Hodges-Rubbish .",45
164,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It is not rubbish. It is absolutely correct. I am answering the interjection because I want the honourable member's rehonourable mark to be registered in Hansard. I notice that the Hansard reporter has looked at him and got the offence. his name. The electors of his district will now know that he believes that it is proper debate on a Bill that affects the civil liberties of every human being in this country, including the people in his electorate. Mr Ruddock-It was rubbish when you suggested that it was a police state.",45
165,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Of course it is a Ports police state. I repeat that it is a police state make no apology for saying that. It is a police state purely and simply, without any qualificadrawal. tion at all. The Minister can seem to care whether this country is a police state. His behaviour today is a behaviour of Minister of a police state. Honourable opposite should not grizzle. I repeat that the Minister's behaviour today is the behaviour one would expect from a Minister of a police state. No self-respecting democracy in the world would try to push this sort of legislation through without the people's representatives having the right to say what their constituents out the matter. Honourable members are not cheatthe ing us. They are cheating the people we represent. They are cheating not only the people whom we on this side of the Parliament repbut also the people whom they represent. They do it smugly with an arrogant indifference to the effect of what they are doing. They do not that the people's representatives are being prevented from saying what they want to say. They sit smugly, satisfied that because they have numbers they can do what they like. I do not it mind their using their numbers to win a vote after there has been a fair and reasonable debate but I reject and resent their using their numbers to prevent a proper debate before the vote is Motion (by Mr Viner) proposed: That the question be now put.",45

Question so resolved in the affirmative by absolute majority. Declaration of Urgency",46
182,Mr VINER,PAIRS,"I declare that the following Bills are urgent Bills: The Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill 1979, the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 1979 [No. 2], the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1979 and the Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1979.",47
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The question is: 'That the Bills be considered urgent Bills'. Question resolved in the affirmative.,47
184,Mr VINER,PAIRS,"I move: That the time allotted in connection with the Bills be as follows: (1) Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill 1979: (a) For the remainder of the committee stage, until 8.20 p.m. this day; (b) For the remaining stages, until 8.30 p.m. this day; (2) Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 1979 [No. 2] - For the remaining stages, until 10 p.m. this day; (3) Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1979-For the remaining stages, until 10.13 p.m. this day; (4) Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1979-For the remaining stages, until 10.30 p.m. this day. In giving the reasons for introducing this tation to the debate, let me explain that it been found necessary during this Budget session to create a balance between the Budget debate, the debates within Estimates committees and debates on the Budget Bills as well as debates other important legislation which is before the House. Included in those important Bills are those upon which this limitation of debate is being placed. Let me point out to the House that already there has been very extensive debate all these Bills in the other place and in this House. The time taken in the Senate for debate on these Bills was just under 30 hours. Already this House we have spent some 18 hours and 15 minutes in debate. With the time now allotted before completion there will be a total of 21 hours debate in this House. Therefore I think that all honourable members will appreciate that with 51 hours of debate on this Bill the Government has allowed very extensive time. I have Jenkins, H. A. previously advised the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the Manager of Opposition Business that the Government is anxious to complete the passage of these Bills by this evening. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out particulars of the an amount of time taken in debate in this House as well as the figures that I have mentioned relating to debate in the Senate. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsNA Time debated in the Senate: just under 30 hours.

185,Mr VINER,ASIO BILLS,"Jus t in case the Opposition should think that the Government is using a heavy hand in bringing about this limitation of debate on these Bills, let me just compare the experience of the Parliament under the present Government since it was elected to office late in 1975 and the experience when Mr Fred Daly was Leader of the House between autumn of limi1973 and the Budget of 1975. I remember this has very well because Fred Daly as Leader of the House for the Labor Government, was a very good mentor. Just to show the earnestness with the which this Government approaches the operon ation of the Parliament and the opportunity for debate in this Parliament, I mention these total figures. Under the former Labor Government, Bills initiated totalled 694; Bills passed, 504; closures, 404; matters of pubhc importance, 93; on and guillotines 26. That was 26 guillotines involving 59 Bills. Under the present Government, the totals are: Bills initiated, 618; Bills passed, in 581; closures, 296; matters of public importance, 154, against the Labor Government's 93; and guillotines, 3.

Budget 1977 Autumn 1978 . Budget 1978",47
186,Mr VINER,ASIO BILLS,I think that this House will appreciate that the Government has allowed very extensive debate in the Senate and in this House on what we do acknowledge is a Bill of considerable importance. We bring down this guillotine only in order to facilitate the business of the Parliament in this very busy Budget session.,48
187,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ASIO BILLS,"The Opposition rejects the motion moved by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner). I think it is quite specious argument to talk about who moved many guillotines in the past. There have been Bills like these in the Government's legislation program before. There would be no more portant pieces of legislation in Australia than these Bills. A report on the security service some years to prepare. Mr Justice Hope travelled the world to gather information intelligence organisation should be run in this country. He said that it ought to be run on a bipartisan basis. I cannot think of anything more ridiculous or more confrontationist than to say this stage that the Government will guillotine bate on this legislation. This action will tee that everybody in the country who feels there is something wrong with this legislation will go out and agitate against it. So they should, as this is a democratic country. How do we expect to maintain democracy in this country if these Rafferty rules apply to the",48
188,Mr VINER,ASIO BILLS,"Three guillotines involving only seven Bills. I ask leave of the Parliament to incorporate that table in Hansard.

The Government has never set aside a consecutive period of days for discussion of this Bill. We are talking about the liberties of the people. We are not talking about Fred Daly, how many guillotines he moved or how many pieces of legislation passed by such a device. We are talking about the rights of the people. Not one of the amendments moved by the Opposition has been a accepted. The Government has a Charlie so MCCarthy type of proposition here: Whatever no we put up cannot be accepted. At least in the Senate the senators did have some discussions on imthis legislation. Some amendments were accepted. In terms of the Government adopting a took flexible approach to or acknowledging any expertise in the suggestions that we make, this aron how an rangement is a phony one. Let us put the argument very clearly. I discussed this matter with the Attorney-General at (Senator Durack) on a television program. He desaid that the Leader of the Opposition would be guaranentitled to as much information as he as that Attorney-General had. When we moved the amendment yesterday, that proposition was rejected by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. This is the sort of nonsense we get. It demonstrates the duplicity of standards in intelligence gathering in this country. Let us make this point very clear: If the Government does not get the co-operation of the Opposition, it will have no intelligence system. Let us make that very clear indeed because that is the very problem we face at the present time. How does the Government expect to maintain the democratic forces in this country if it is to deny to an Opposition the chance to move amendments. Honourable members should look at the time schedule allowed for the discussion of the Bills. Within an hour and a half, we have to debate another 19 amendments. Government members have been participating in the debate as often as we have. The Government has allocated an hour and a half to the debate on the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 1979 (No. 2) to which we propose another 16 amendments. Why have a debate at all? Why not guillotine consideration of the legislation now? That is the Government's standard. Do not worry too much when eruptions take place outside, public meetings and national protests are held, or anything else occurs because of the standard that has been adopted by the Government. Does the Government think that it will hold the line on the basis that because it passes certain legislation by the use of the guillotine device here it will be able to explain to the people outside that it gave the Opposition the opportunity for a bipartisan debate on this matter. It did nothing of the sort. The position has carefully prepared and circulated 25 amendments and they require a lot of consideration. We have now reached consideration of amendment No. 6. We therefore have 19 to go and only an hour in which to deal with them. I put it to honourable membersMr Hodges-You are wasting time.",48
189,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ASIO BILLS,"I am not wasting time. I place on record the fact that, if the Government does not get the co-operation of the Opposition there will be no intelligence service. Do not come here with a jack-boot arrangement. There was no discussion, none at all, about this legislation. Let us make that point clear. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs asked me yesterday whether he could get the cooperation of the Opposition to finish debate on the Bill. I said that I could not guarantee it because of the number of amendments we proposed to move. These amendments will not be discussed. This Bill will not be discussed. Mr Hodges-It is up to you.",49
190,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ASIO BILLS,"It is up to the tutional Government. It proposes this action. That is problem it faces. So I will move, in the concludare ing stages of my speech, that we alter the timehonourable table. We do it on the basis that thetimefor the remainder of the Committee stages of this Bill be until 6 p.m. on Thursday, 18 October and for the remaining stages until 10.30 p.m. of that day. I will move that the debate on the remaining stages of the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill be allowed to continue until 10 p.m. on 23 October, that debate on the Telecommunications Amendment Bill continue until 10.15 p.m. on 23 October, and that debate on the Customs Amendment Bill continue until 10.30 pm. on 23 October. Therefore, in accordance with what I have outlined, I move: That the timetable and dates be omitted and the following substituted: (1) Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill 1979: (a) For the remainder of the committee stage, until 6 p.m. Thursday 18 October. (b) For the remaining stages, until 10.30 p.m. 18 October. (2) Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 1979 [_o. 2]'#or the remaining stages, until 10 p.m. 23 October. (3) Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1979-For the remaining stages, until 10.15 p.m. 23 October. (4) Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1979-For the remaining stages, until 10.30 p.m. 23 October 1979.",49
191,Mr HOLDING,ASIO BILLS,"I second the amendment and, in speaking to the amendment, I make this point: I have never Op- heard two more specious arguments than those used by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner), who is at the table. I listened to the constitutional nonsense that is involved in his motion. What we are told is that if a period is spent in the Senate debating a particular Bill, that is time, presumably in the view of this Government, that ought to be deducted from the debatingtimein this House. The logic of that argument presumably is that if the Senate spent double that amount of time in considering the legislation, there would be no need at all for debate in this chamber on these matters. That is not only constitutional nonsense from the Minister. He is a lawyer and he knows it is constitutional nonsense. It is also political hypocrisy of the worse sort. Of course, the other argument is that we look at what a government did at some other time. Many present members of this Parliament were not in this Parliament at the earliertimereferred to. To say that what somebody did in the past is binding upon honourable members who were elected to this House at the last election is constinonsense also. Let us look at the subthe stance and the merits of the argument. What we being told is that it is more important for members to have two hours for dinner. This is the reality of the argument. The great Liberal Parry-the party that talks about liberty and freedom believes that it is more important for all members on the Government side to be able to go and wine and dine for two hours than to allocate more than an hour and a half to sider the main Committee stages of the legisargument. lation. That is the logic of it. Mr Haslem-Don' t you have committee walk meetings?",49
192,Mr HOLDING,ASIO BILLS,"The honourable member for should Canberra wants to put a gag on himself. I do not blame him. Most of the things he says are so intelligent that he ought to apply a gag to self. But there are many of us about the rights and the liberties of the people of Canberra. I do not believe that, because, the honourable member or some of his colleagues wander off into a room with a handful of food expired. and some bottles of wine and talk about great matters affecting the Liberal Party and the nation, they are discharging their obligations. What honourable members opposite are saying is that they can have two hours for those sorts meetings but only an hour and a half is to be allocated for members of this Parliament to bate this Bill. What honourable members opnotice posite are paid for is to put their arguments this Parliament, to stand up and argue the issues that are involved in this very important legisDeputy lation. There is no single piece of legislation deals with the rights and liberties of the Australian people that is as important as this legislation. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who is trying to interject, comes here only to put up his hand to suggest the guilloin tine. He has not been present for any stage of the debate on these Bills. Of course, he is in here to give the Government the numbers. I endorse very strongly the views previously put by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Cameron). He said quite properly that the Government by virtue of the numbers that it in this House is entitled to use those numbers order to get whatever legislation it wants through the Parliament. We understand that that is the process works. If this process is destroyed demeans this Parliament. It makes a laughing stock of the Parliament when the Government uses its numbers to deny honourable members concern. the right to argue these issues fully, within the framework of their conscience, and to put the argument that they want to put. That is what comes down to.",50
193,Mr GRAHAM,ASIO BILLS,As k Senator Pat Kennelly.,50
194,Mr HOLDING,ASIO BILLS,"I would defend the right of the honourable gentleman opposite to get up and put his argument. I concede that he has been in the chamber for most of the debate, but I, and conthe people who elected him, want to hear his On an issue as important as this I believe the Parliament does itself a great disservice when honourable members opposite simply in, and put up their hand for the gag and say: 'We have the numbers and we are going to use them'. Honourable members opposite not believe that by gagging this Parliament they are going to stop the debate. The deunbate concerning these issues will continue in the himcommunity. They are important issues, and the who are concerned debate will go on.",50

196,Mr RUDDOCK,ASIO BILLS," I must say that I am somewhat surprised at this rather feigned anger to which we have just had to listen. Usually, when the guUlotine is introduced, there of is an immediate reaction. One hears cries from the Opposition at the way in which it is being detreated. It was remarkable that today, when was given of this motion and the suspenin sion of Standing Orders was moved on this most important question, as it was described by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel that Bowen), there were no cries of anger.",50
197,Mr GILES,ASIO BILLS,No reference to jack-boots.,50
198,Mr RUDDOCK,ASIO BILLS,"There was no concern expressed and there was no reference to jack-boots, as my honourable friend mentions. There were in so few honourable members opposite interested hearing the discussion that there were not enough of them to rise to their usual chorus. One now of the honourable members opposite even had to go to the trouble of calling for a quorum. Usually members of the Opposition wait outside the door Clyde to make the Government provide the numbers-w e all know about that tactic- but on has this occasion an honourable member was madly in waving to his friends to come into the chamber. One person to whom he waved was the honourhow able member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), who it was wandering about outside, wondering whether to come into the House to help provide the audience to give us this demonstration of One might be convinced if one thought that all it honourable members of the Opposition were basically interested in this subject, wanted to see it discussed and had new information to bring to us, which matters they wanted to be put on pubUc record. Of the 37 members opposite only 14 have spoken in this debate at any stage. There have been many opportunities for them to do so. Yesterday we had to listen to four or more honourable members opposite making speeches twice in order to ensure that the debate was coniable tinued as long as possible. Honourable members on this side of the House are expected to sit and aUow the proceedings of the House to thwarted in this way. If honourable members posite had been in that position, we all know iof what would have happened. We know from their that record what has happened in that situation. Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) quoted from the record of the Opposition. I am surprised that some of the newer members of the Opposition do not take the time to read through Hansard in order to see what that record was. They might care to dissociate from it. I would be happy to hear from them if they did. I do not think anybody really expects them to do that. During the term of office of the Order! previous government some 59 BUls were dealt with in 26 guUlounes. During the term of office of this Government only three such procedural mechanisms have been used. I am quite preBowen's pared to put that record against the record of the Opposition at any time. I admit that the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill is an important piece of legislation. If it were not necessary for the business of the Parliament to proceed perhaps I would be prepared to give honourable members opposite extra time. I enjoyed the debate so much yesterday when honourable members opposite demonstrated their differences of opinion on this question, that Adermann, A. E. I would like to see them given more time to deAldred, velop those differences.",50
199,Dr BLEWETT,ASIO BILLS,Then why not vote with us?,51
200,Mr RUDDOCK,ASIO BILLS,"I said that if it were not imiBurr, M.

202,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,Las t night just before the adjournment debate I made the declaration that a tap had been placed on the private telephone of Mr Justice Staples by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.,52
203,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,How do you know? Prove it.,52
204,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"I do know and I am not going to tell the honourable member how I know because when people give me confidential information I never reveal in this place where I get it. That is why I get so much information. People know that they can trust me not to disclose my source. I am expecting to get a little more information as a consequence of the declaration I have now made. During the weekend just passed Mr Justice Staples phoned me at my home to ask whether I knew whether there was any truth in the newspaper reports that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Street) had been the person responsible for leaking to the Press a copy of the letter of Mr Justice Staples. I told him-the ASIO Thomson, D.S. Viner, R. I. tape recording of our conversation will confirm this-that I refused to believe that the Minister had leaked it; that I believed it had been leaked by other persons, perhaps from the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I asked him whether he had sent copies to the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations, the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations and the employers. This had also been reported in some of the newspapers. He told me quite emphatically that no copy of his letter had gone to the ACTU. I then warned him that I had been informed on impeccable authority that his telephone was under tap. I said to him: 'If you want to say anything more to me that is likely to be of a confidential nature I ask you not to proceed because our telephone is under tap'. Mr Birney-What did he ring you for? Why you?",52
205,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"He rang me to course, ask- I repeat what I said earlier-whethe r I lieved there was any truth in that the Minister for Industrial Relations had been the one responsible for leaking a copy ofhis letter. I denied it. I said that I did not believe the Minister would do it; that there would be mUeage in it for him; and I am now astonished learn that somebody from his office, apparently without his knowledge, had done exactly that. repeat that the tape recording of the converment, sation which ASIO has in its possession will confirm those remarks. It is terribly important that the Minister have the right to call for dossiers and for the files ASIO might keep. I cite no better case of Mr Justice Lionel Murphy, as he now is. When he was the Attorney-General, one Thursday night after the Senate adjourned he decided to go to the headquarters of ASIO in Canberra with Mr Kerry MUte and Maureen Barron to have a talk about concern that was being exabout pressed by the Commonwealth Police regarding the security of the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, who was expected to arrive in Canberra within few days time. ASIO had previously said that there would be no threat to the Prime Minister's life. It had to say this, because this was the story it had kept feeding to Senator Greenwood when he was Attorney-General. When Senator first Murphy got to the ASIO headquarters he disof covered that in point of fact ASIO information that it was the intention of Croatian terrorists to put cyanide in the air conditioning system of the Lakeside Hotel. What I am telling the Parliament now has never been revealed before but it has to be revealed now because it is germane to the clause that we are talking about. Senator Murphy asked the people at ASIO: 'What have you done about this threat?' They replied: 'We have put telephone taps on all the people who we believe might be involved in this attempt to kill the Prime Minister'. He asked: 'What does the telephone tapping reveal?' They replied: 'Oh, we do not know because we have not transcribed the recordings yet'. He asked: 'When do you propose to transcribe them?' They replied: 'Oh, it won't be for a while-perhap s a week or so after the Prime Minister leaves Australia'. He asked: 'Have you photographs of the Croatian suspects?' They answered: 'Oh, yes, we have photographs'. He asked: 'Have you given photographs to the Lakeside Hotel?' They replied: 'Oh no, but that is a jolly good idea. We have given the Lakeside the names'. He asked: 'Couldn't they change their names?' They agreed: 'Of but you have a good idea, AttorneybeGeneral. We will give the Lakeside the photos of newspaper reports the suspects'. Senator Murphy then said: 'Now I want to have a look at the file, if I may'. So the people at that ASIO handed over the file. Among other things, no in the file Senator Murphy discovered that there to had been a secret meeting among officers of the Department of Immigration, the Department of I Foreign Affairs, the Attorney-General's Departhis own Department and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet at which these officers had decided that they would inform Senator Murphy that his answer to a question rethat lating to Croatian terrorism should be in the case than the form of a Ue. Mr Carlton-That was probably a dummy file.",53
206,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"No, it was not a dummy file, the honourable member would know a lot about this. I will not say any more his involvement in it. But it was not a dummy file. Senator Murphy then discovered to his astonishment that, because the public sera vants on this interdepartmental committee, had told Senator Greenwood to lie to the Senate, they decided it was important that they make Senator Murphy lie as well. What I am telling the Parliament now in revealing these facts publicly for the time ever is information given to me by one the people who was present at that meeting had received with ASIO that evening. Mr Birney-Lione l Murphy.",53
207,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"The honourable member says that Lionel Murphy told him that. I can tell him that somebody else told me the same so that confirms it. What Senator Murphy saw in the file was so disturbing that he decided that he would there and then make arrangements to go to Melbourne immediately next day to check on other vital, quite sensational revelations shown up in that file. He sought to make a booking on a VIP aircraft first thing next morning and could not do so because one was not available. But ASIO was immediately told ofhis attempt to get a VIP aircraft and started to prepare for his visit to the ASIO headquarters in Melbourne next day. When Senator Murphy went to the airport on the Friday morning- I was standing alongside him and I can bear witness to the fact that I heard Murphy go through this dialogue-h e asked whether he could be given a seat on the aircraft. He was told to his astonishment that every seat was taken up. He said: 'It cannot be that every seat is taken up. Is everybody on yet?' The reply was:'No, but there have been some bookings made by ASIO for all the empty seats. It was not until Murphy discovered about the phantom bookings made by ASIO, for the purpose of preventing his getting a seat to Melbourne, that he asserted his authority as head of ASIO and demanded that seats be given to him. ASIO was quite prepared to pay for booked seats it was not going to use in order to prevent own Minister travelling with one of its officers. On the flight Murphy found himself sitting next to an ASIO officer named Marshall who had been told by his headquarters in Melbourne to bring with him a particular file. Murphy said: 'What have you got there?' The officer replied: ' I have got a file'. Murphy said: ' I want to have a look at it'. The officer said: ' I am sorry, not have a look inside this file because I am working for the Director-General of ASIO, not for the Attorney-General'. Murphy, it was reported, said: 'You are now working for me; hand it over'. When he had a look at the file what he discovered was nothing short of startling. For people subsequently to talk about",53
208,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,54
209,Mr VINER,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL," I wish to make some brief remarks concerning the amendment. But first let me deal with what the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) said last night at 10.29.1 think everyone in this chamber, certainly those on this side, would consider that outrageous allegations have been made, in effect, against the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia (Senator Durack), although the honourable member was not prepared to say that, because it is the Attorney-General who must approve the issue of a warrant on the recommendation of the Director-General. The allegation was that a phone tap had been put on the private phone of Mr Justice Staples by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. It is an outrageous allegation because, among other things, the honourable member would know that the present practice of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Attorney-General in relation to parliamentary questions concerning ASIO is not to comment, that is, neither to confirm nor to deny any allegations or presumed allegations. Mr Justice Hope in volume I of the fourth report at page 219 said that he thought that that practice should continue except in very special circumstances. Paragraph 781, at page 259, under the heading 'Parliamentary Responsibility' in the recommendations of that same volume, states: That the present practice, whereby the Prime Minister and the Minister administering the ASIO Act do not confirm or deny any allegations, or presumed allegations, in respect of ASIO, continue in force. I am sure the honourable member for Hindmarsh knew of that recommendation. Notwithits standing that, he was prepared to make those allegations. I also notice that it was reported on one radio station this morning that the honourable gentleman was not prepared to repeat the allegations outside the chamber. I should however point out that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has already had a number of briefings by the Director-General of ASIO. If the you can- Leader of the Opposition wishes to have a briefing concerning the allegation by the honourable member, the Government will certainly facilitate that briefing by the Director-General. As to the other allegations concerning the conduct of ASIO and His Honour Mr Justice Murphy, it is a matter of rehashing what was a great political scandal at the time. I do not intend to embark upon any comment on it. In directing my attention to the amendment moved by the Opposition, I would say that the Bill, as now drafted, gives effect to the long standing philosophy that while the Minister responsible, that is, the Attorney-General, should in a general way be responsible for the activities of the Organisation-and I refer to the speech by the late Dr Evatt in 1956-h e should not concern himself with the details of the activities of the Organisation except insofar as this is necessary for the carrying out of the Minister's responsibilities. The Opposition's amendment assumes that the Attorney-General could police the activities of the Organisation by ascertaining the existence or non-existence of specific files but without access to contents. This is a fallacy because the mere existence of a file in the Organisation is virtually meaningless. The best example I can give of that is that files are kept on persons having a top secret clearance. Surely it can be assumed that the Director-General, whoever he or she is, having regard to the manner of his or her selection will truthfully and accurately report to the Attorney-General as required. Likewise, the Director-General must be prepared to answer the questions of the Leader of the Opposition in regular consultations. The proposal to give the Minister a right of access tofilesas a method of policing the activiIntelligence ties of the Organisation is, with the greatest spect to the Opposition and particularly the honourable member for Hindmarsh, based on a think crude misunderstanding of the real position. thermore, the Opposition directly seeks trude politics and political considerations into the operations of ASIO. The Government lieves that the general power of direction given to the Attorney-General in clause 8 of the Bill, meeting as it does the long standing philosophy, does provide the Parliament through the minisshould terial responsibility of the Attorney-General with a safeguard to watch over the affairs of ASIO together with the other safeguards that are built into the exercise of special powers, the requireformance ment of an annual report and the requirement regular consultation arid briefings with the Leader of the Opposition. Therefore, the Government opposes the amendment.",54
210,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"Mr Deputy Chairman, by way of explanation, I point out that we do not tend to call a division because only 50 minutes remain in which to debate 19 clauses. I would just like the Opposition's objection recorded.",55
211,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"The request of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will be acceded to. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 9 to 17-by leave-take n together, agreed to. Clause 18 (Communication of intelligence cetera).",55
212,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL," Mr Deputy Chairman, I seek leave to ecution move together amendments No. 7 and No. 8 as of circulated. Leave granted.",55
213,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"I move: Clause 18, page 6, line 41, omit 'or relates to the performance by the Organization of its functions'. Clause 18, page 7, at the end of sub-clause (3) add 'which consent shall not be given unless the Attorney-General is satisfied that the communication the subject of the prosecution had, or would be likely to have, the effect of seriously prejudicing security*. The Opposition's amendment No. 7 seeks to omit from clause 18 the words 'or relates to the performance by the Organisation of its functions'. Under clause 18 a person is unable to communicate any information or matter that has come to his knowledge by reason of having been an officer or employee of the Australian Security Organisation. The clause refers to inreformation or matter that relates to the performance by the Organisation of its functions. We that provision is far too wide. It is importFurant that there be freedom of information. We to inshould bear in mind what has happened in America with the Central Intelligence Agency. A belot of information was disclosed by former officers. This is a healthy exercise. The disclosure of information that clearly indicates some clandestine operations which had been undertaken not have been perpetrated. This is a democratic country. We do not want a position in which former officers and employees are unable to communicate information relating to the perof the Organisation in relation to the of way it works. We do not want detailed information. We want to know how the Organisation works. The clause lays down a heavy penalty. There is a discretion as to whether an offence can be dealt with summarily or on indictment. Upon summary conviction, the penalty is a fine not inexceeding $ 1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, and on indictment it is imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. They are very substantial penalties indeed. From our point of view, this clause would be improved if we were to delete the reference which relates to the performance by the Organisation of its functions. We propose adding to the end of this clause this discretion which relates to the question of action being taken by way of and prosecution either summarily or on indictment. We say that it has to be with the consent of the et Attorney-General, 'which consent shall not be given unless the Attorney-General is satisfied the communication the subject of the proshad, or would be likely to have, the effect seriously prejudicing security'. In other words, it has to be pretty substantial offence. If we leave it as it is in the Bill we will really create a situation whereby public comment by ASIO officials will be denied. I do not think that that is at all effective, particularly if they are former employees, from the point of view of how they see, particularly from a conscience point of view, the operations of the Organisation. Where else can they go with that sort of conscience position? To whom can they go and talk about the problems that they have? They cannot go back to the Director-General; he happens to be their superior. They really are not able to go to the Attorney-General because that would involve all the other problems that we have been talking about. It is important that later on we have a judicial audit. We would like to think that, if there were some matter of close security, there could be an opportunity for an officer to talk to the judicial auditor about matters. But in matters relating to the Organisation in the performance of its functions, we think it imperative that there be as much information as possible given to the public and to the Parliament and that no penalty be imposed on employees on that basis. What we are proposing here is a better drafting exercise than has been perpetrated in clause 18. That is the whole idea of debate in the Committee stage. We are not here to say that there has not to be some obvious prohibition against the disclosure of information which relates to security or which would prejudice officers in that intelligence organisation. Far be it from that. But the proposal to leave it in the form of not imparting any information which would relate to the performance by the Organisation of its functions is far too wide. Amendments negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 19 to 23-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Proposed new clause 23A.",55
214,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL," I move: After clause 23, page 8, insert the following new clause: '23A. The Minister shall not issue any warrant pursuant to the powers conferred upon him by this Division, unless he is satisfied onreasonablegrounds that other lawful methods of investigation have proved insufficient, or would in all cumstances be quite impracticable as a means of obtaining the information for which the warrant is proposed to be issued.'. These warrants of course concern the question of privacy, searches, seizures, inspection of records, inspection of postal articles, use of listening devices and, in a complementary piece of legislation, telephone tapping. In other words, they are matters of most serious concern to every Australian citizen. The major difference between the Government and Opposition here is that the Government seems to believe that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation should use these powers as a matter of course. Whilst we are prepared to accept the use of ministerial warrants in the security area, we do not believe that they should be used, except as a very last resort. Mr Justice Hope made it clear that in the past ASIO had frequently broken the law. That is on record. Because of the capacity of this legislation to affect the civU liberties of every Australian by legal means, it is essential that safeguards be written into the legislation. This amendment is by no means the only safeguard that we would like to see written in. We would like to insist on the inclusion of parliamentary reporting and other matters that we have mentioned here, such as the Leader of the Oppositions being fully informed and in particular-this will be foreshadowed in a later amendment-fh e opportunity for judicial audit. This would simply require the Attorney-General to be satisfied, before issuing a warrant, that no other form of obtaining the information would be successful.",56
215,Mr BARRY JONES,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"It is very important that a qualification as proposed in new clause 23A as moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) be agreed to to make sure that, if the enormous powers of this section are in fact used, it must be on reasonable grounds. I draw the attention of the Committee again to the case that I mentioned yesterday, that is, the trial of Dr W. B. Sutch in February 1975 in New Zealand. That case provides the best example that we know about the organisation and operation of security services in the South-West Pacific. There is no comparable case in Australia that we know of. This New Zealand case is the best example. It is the Mount Everest of security work in the South Pacific; thetipof the iceberg. Not only is it the best example; it is almost the only example. It provides the most clear cut evidence of how a security service works. I put the initials 'SS' in my notes and I think that perhaps in the circumstances they are appropriate. We are justified in assuming that the cirthe evidence adduced in the Sutch case is, at best, of superior quality to the evidence in the files that we know nothing of or, at worse, of similar quality or worse than most of the evidence in the files. There was a series of incidents in New Zealand during the period of the Labour Government, first of Mr Kirk and then of Mr Rowling, which involved Security Intelligence Service activity, carefully leaked to the then Opposition leader, Mr Muldoon. The incidents involved members of the Labour Cabinet, Labour members of parliament and members of the Labour Party organisation. In the case of the Sutch prosecution, the Labour Attorney General, Dr Finlay, was put in an excruciating position. He did not think much of the prosecution case but, if he failed to authorise the prosecution, inevitably it would have leaked through to Mr Muldoon and the Opposition would have said: 'There you are. The Labour Party is going against the Security Intelligence Service and is sabotaging the national interest'. So, Dr Finlay authorised the prosecution. I have no reason to assume that same type of activity as happened in the Sutch trial would not happen here in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and has not happened in the pastthat is, political harassment of a kind where it is very difficult to fight back. For example, they can tap our telephones but we cannot tap theirs. So it gives the ordinary citizen or even the ordinary member of parliament very little fight-back capacity. The New Zealand experience is a grisly example that we ought to examine very thoughtHaving fully. The report of that trial is really instructive and I urge all honourable members including Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Ellicott), who is at the table, to examine it. I think that most charitable description that could be applied to the prosecution case in the Sutch trial is that it come. was piffling and mindless. The great fallacy- a fallacy as big as the George Washington monument-is that the prosecution goes along and says: 'Look, in this manila folder we have such devastating information that if ever it got out the whole of society would collapse'. But people say 'Can we see what is in the folder', officials say: 'No, it is too devastating'. Then, once in every 25 years when the information does come out, one finds that the actual evidence that they are leading is evidence such as that brought out in the Sutch case to the effect that Sutch was going around picking up his milk and talking to someone who used to come around jogging in the morning. There were converway. sations with this man and, worse of all, this was an embassy employee of a foreign power-to wit, Russia. They said that they came to the clusion that something sinister had gone on. they said, they knew that he was a man who had been associated with some very dangerous discussed. causes, to wit after the war he organised nationwide collection of old clothing to Attorney-General relieve the hardship of refugees in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. With a backable ground like that it must have seemed like an open and shut case. That is what one might assume to be the best example of the work being done by security services in New Zealand and Australia. If that is the best example, we might ask: 'What are the worse ones?' Mr Jacobi-Jea n Seberg in the United States.",56
216,Mr BARRY JONES,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"Perhaps one would be the Jean Seberg case, as the honourable member suggests.",57
217,Mr ELLICOTT,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"Wentworth-Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for the Capital Territory) (5.46)-This amendment is an example of the sorts of amendments which have been put forward by the Opposition and which probably strike at the unreality of the situation. The unreality is that the integrity of the security service depends on two people. It depends on the integrity of the Attorney-General and the Director General, as well as the officers in the service. No amount of prescription of requirements about being satisfied with this, that and the other can get over that fact. Any security service has to depend on the integrity of those two people. had experience of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation over a number of the years and having been involved with it as Attorney-General I can only say that that is the the conclusion to which any reasonable person who has some knowledge of the security service has to If the Attorney-General has to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that other lawful methods of investigation have proved insufficient or would in all the circumstances be quite impracticable as if a means of obtaining the information for which the the warrant is proposed to be issued he would have to assume the character of a super Director General. In other words, he would have to inquire as to all the methods that had been undertaken in relation to every warrant. He would Dr have to say: 'Have you done this, that or something else', et cetera. A considerable investigation would be required. It cannot happen that The Attorney-General is not in that posman ition. The Minister could never be in that position. If the question of a warrant is being disconcussed between him and the Director-General, As needless to say the question of what investigations have been undertaken will inevitably be But the prescription contained in the a Opposition's amendment would place the in an impossible position visa-vis the Director-General. He would never be to satisfy that prescription unless he had almost a royal commission every time he issued a warrant. As I said, it does not happen that way. The Government rejects this amendment not because it wants to put the officers concerned, the Minister and the Director-General in some absolute position but because it does not meet the reality of the situation. We always come back to this simple proposition: The issue of warrants depends on the integrity of the two people I have mentioned. If one of them, particularly the Director-General, is not a person of integrity and presents to an Attorney-General a case which is not based on fact, obviously the Attorney General can be misled. The great fortune in this country is that we have never had such a Director-General. Certainly, the Director General we have at the moment is a man of considerable capacity and integrity. His appointment was recommended by the previous Government and he was actually appointed by this Government. The same sort of bipartisan attitude needs to be adopted every time. Mr Barry Jones-There was nothing bipartisan about his predecessor but one.",57
218,Mr ELLICOTT,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,I do not think that is a fair comment. I do not think that the honourable member knows enough about the circumstances. I do not want to go into that sort of discussion. It is not fair. When the question of appointing a Director-General comes up there is a great need for a bipartisan attitude. There is a need to find a person with qualities similar to those of the present Director-General because that is the Only guarantee.,58
219,Mr JACOBI,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"In answer to the Minister, in my view the present incumbent of the position of Director-General of Security has neither a mortgage on wisdom nor longevity. Somewhere along the Une the Parliament has an obligation to provide appropriate safeguardschecks and balances and the protection to which every citizen is entitled. I support the remarks of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) on what can be done by security organisations. I corroborate the point he made. I consider that the most horrific case to be recorded is the Seberg case. I draw the attention of the House to a letter from America by Alastair Cooke on 23 September from which I shall quote extensively. It stated: . . . I picked up the Sunday paper and read a story that I hope has given Americans the son of pause that chills the blood. It was a postscript to the suicide of Jean Seberg, the young actress from Iowa and expatriate in France, who was found dead in her car, leaving an empty bottle of barbiturates and a note. The postscript was released by the Government, by in fact the FBI, and it's certainly to he released a detestable confession which reinforces the suspicion that for many years the FBI in the hands of J. Edgar Hoover, its first and long-time head, could hardly be matched by any government for malice and cunning. Miss Seberg at one time was a passionate supporter of Leftist causes and made no bones about it. In Mr Hoover's view she became, like the late Martin Luther King, a social nuisance who it was necessary to intimidate, then to bug, in the hope of breaking their will. Some anonymous source one day got in touch with the FBI and passed on to them a rumour, or an invented smear, that Miss Seberg was pregnant by one of the Black Panther leaders. The source suggested to Hoover that, if this rumour could be fed to gossip columnists, it would help tarnish Miss Seberg's image as a glamourous young movie star from the Middle West. 'Very good,' said Mr Hoover, 'afineidea.' So the Bureau fed the item; most papers turned it down, but a Hollywood writer, what is politely known as a 'lady' columnist, printed it. Pretty soon Jean Seberg saw it, living in Paris. There are always good friends alert enough to see that you get the nastiest clippings. From that moment on Jean Seberg was a doomed girl. She was pregnant by her husband, the French novelist Romain Gary. But, as he said last weekend, while she was intelligent and courageous, she did not possess a tough hide, the ruthlessness that can tolerate an outrage against oneself. She saw the item and within hours went into premature labour; was delivered, by Caesarean section, of a girl who died within days. She took the dead baby back to Iowa in a glass coffin as a glaring proof that the baby was white-a n excessive reaction perhaps, but in 1970 she knew that the FBI could and did destroy hundreds of radicals .and non-radicals. Romain Gary says that on each succeeding anniversary of the baby's death she attempted suicide. Finally, last week, she made it. A former FBI man, who was with the Bureau at the time, had no other justification to offer for this barbarity than to say that getting involved in radical politics could get you involved in national security, that the kid with the picket sign might turn into the kid with the bomb. And, he said, you just keep going down the line. Well, for too long the FBI went down the line of its own improvised rules, as we can horribly see, once the Freedom of Information Act made it possible for you and me, the ordinary citizen, to go to government files, including the files of the FBI, and read anything and everything which had been kept under wraps as confidential government information. Congress has up for debate in this session-and its committees are already taking testimony on it- a new law, a charter of dos and dont's, a legal charter of behaviour for the FBI. Roosevelt once confided to a friend that, if the Congress had ever had a hint of the shifts and manoeuvres he was engaged in with the British, before this country got into the war, he would have been impeached. And many of these manoeuvres involved brutal decisions and secret tricks not at all unlike the techniques of James Bond. We can now salve our conscience by saying that after all Hitler was the enemy, we were fighting to survive, and that it was essential for us to go beyond any traditional code of open warfare. However, these tricks and shifts passed over, when the war was over, from the main secret intelligence body, the OSS, into the running of the CIA, which was set up after the war. the credit of its present chief that Watergate: Watergate, of course, more than anything, did enormous damage to the reputation of the CIA and the FBI. And when all the dirt was shovelled out from under, President Ford's Attorney-General re-vamped the FBI and set his own strong rules. It was the present head of the FBI who chose to make public the disgraceful treatment of Jean Seberg. Romain Gary said he was grateful. He always maintained that she had been destroyed by the FBI, but he said: if the postWatergate FBI had not issued a confirmation, to this day I would have been considered a' mytho-maniac'. I think if this sad wind has blown any good it must the thought that the Seberg case will quicken of the Congress and sharpen its wits, and make it get busy writing and passing a new legal charter of the FBI. I pass a couple of simple observations. I have refrained from entering the debate on this Bill far. The only part of the Bill I want to debate the provisions relating to judicial Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott) what safeguards are contained within the provisions of this Bill, what mechanisms are provided for in the Bill, and what criteria are laid down that will obviate the possibility of something like the move: Seberg case happening in Australia in the absence of a freedom of information Act? My next '90 days'. question arises from this statement by Hoover: Well, for too long the FBI went down improvised rules, as we can horribly see. Do I assume from the lack of checks and balances in the current legislation that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation is to go down the line with its own improvised rules? I think it is regrettable. This Parliament ought to institute checks and balances by way of its legislation to obviate what otherwise will ultimately be inevitable in Australia, as it was in New Zealand, and as it was in the United States America. I would be grateful if the Minister ision could reply to this point. I see nothing in this legislation that provides for this type of guard, which is critically important.",58
220,Mr BARRY JONES,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"May I gence make two points. The first is that Hansard may not have picked up the retraction I made in my short interchange with the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott). It was essentially the appointment of not the preceding Directorwish General but the penultimate Director-General that I was more concerned about. I hope the Minister will reply to my second point. He that there was a double check in that approval had to be obtained from the Director-General and the Attorney-General before certain activistress ties could take place. I would be grateful for the Minister's comwhich ment, as a former Attorney-General, on the cruciating situation in which Dr Finlay found himself in New Zealand, as Attorney-General in a Labor government. AU indications were that the Security Intelligence Service was, in effect, leaking information like a sieve to the Government's political opponents. As the Attorney General he was in a 'Morton's fork' situation. If he declined to go ahead with the prosecution, obviously that would be leaked to the Opposition and used to the detriment of the Government. Yet he really was obliged under very strong polbe in itical pressure to go ahead with the prosecution the conscience in which he had no great confidence.",59
221,Unknown,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,59
222,The CHAIRMAN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,The question before the so Committee is that new clause 23A proposed by are the Deputy Leader of the Opposition be inserted audit. I ask the in the Bill. Proposed new clause negatived. Clauses 24 to 34-by leave-take n together.,59
223,Dr BLEWETT,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"by leave-I (10) Clause 26, page 11, line 18, omit '6 months', insert (11) Clause 29, page 13, line 38, omit 'Director-General', the line of its own substitute' Minister'. (12) Clause 29, page 13, line 40, omit'by the Minister'. (13) Clause 29, page 14, line S, omit'the Director-General may', substitute 'the Minister may orally authorise the Director-General to'. (14) Clause 34, page IS, line 12, at the end of the clause add the following sub-clause: '(2) The Minister shall, as soon as practicable after the receipt of the report by the Minister from the Director General, furnish a copy of the report to the Leader of the Opposition.'. of These are the remaining amendments to Div2 of Part III of the Bill. I think it is important at this stage to recall to the Parliament safeexactly what Division 2 provides. Division 2 grants powers to the Australian Security IntelliOrganisation which we know it has used illegally in the past and which now, ironically, are to be made legal. Those powers relate to surveillance devices. SimUar powers in relation to telephone tapping are provided in associated Bills. I to repeat some of the remarks that I made in an earlier debate on a related Bill about the problems and principles of electronic surveUsaid lance which are embodied in Division 2. I think it is important when we discuss our amendments to consider why we are putting this on these amendments. This is because the power to bug citizens and to wiretap citizens are provided in this Division of the Bill are exI think abhorrent to anyone who beUeves in a citizen's basic rights-his right to privacy, his right to liberty and his right to say what he wants to say in the privacy of his own home. Indeed, unless we manage to preserve some irreducible core of privacy our whole system of civil liberty becomes simply a formalistic ritual. I think that the methods of electronic surveillance embodied in Division 2 of Part III of the Bill and the wiretapping provisions embodied in a related Bill are peculiarly insidious because these things are by design virtually unquestionable. The victim is usually unaware that his privacy has been violated. Very rarely is he in a position to challenge such actions in any court, simply because he does not know that his privacy has been violated. Thus this Division sanctions the taping of a person's most intimate conversations, his privileged communications and his utterances, whether they be conspiratorial, criminal or just plain silly. All this can be done without the victim 's awareness that his privacy has been totally violated. It is because of the existence of those very dangerous powers that we insist that there be an effective authority in relation to democratic control over their use. Let me suggest how wide these powers for ASIO might be. The Law Reform Commission calculated, on the basis of United States experience, that the 107 wiretappings in Australia in 1972-73, which were acknowledged by Senator Murphy, may have involved some 12,000 people and some 68,000 different conversations. This quite massive invasion of privacy is an extraordinarily high price to pay in return for the somewhat nebulous security gains that might be made. We on this side of the chamber acknowledge that there may have to be some balance between security needs and the right to privacy. But we demand that ASIO be empowered to make use of electronic surveillance and wiretapping devices only under the most stringent conditions and that we control effectively the spread of this cancer in our society. The amendments which I have moved relate to that effort to impose stringent controls. We propose to impose these controls in three major ways. Firstly, by amending clause 26 as proposed in the tenth amendment moved by the Opposition, we try to limit the time in which one of these listening devices can be implanted. We think that six months is far too long a period. We suggest instead 90 days-that is, three months. There is a provision in the Bill for continuation, but it again requires ministerial approval. Our whole point is to try to limit these activities by ministerial control. So we suggest that the clause be amended to read 90 days rather than six months, which seems to be an enormous amount of time to have a device implanted without ministerial reference. Secondly, we wish to amend clause 29, which is of course the emergency clause. We need to be particularly alert when emergency clauses are introduced into Bills such as these because emergency clauses can be used as breaches in the whole defence apparatus that we erect. Time and time again civil servants will fall back on the emergency provisions because they are the ones over which effective democratic control is much less. Therefore, whilst we recognise the need for emergency provisions such as those contained in clause 29, again we want to bring the democratically elected Executive into it. The three amendments that we move to clause 29-that is, amendments 11, 12 and 13-ar e all related amendments which give the Minister powers of oversight in the use of emergency provisions. The third way in which we propose to impose stringent controls is set out in the Opposition's amendment No. 14. We ask in that amendment that the report which the Director-General is required to provide on each warrant issued in relation to the implanting of a listening device be sent not only to the Minister but also to the Leader of the Opposition. This is to ask again that the Government be genuine in its bipartisan approach to this legislation; that is, that it involve the Leader of the Opposition in the reports that are made to the Minister. We regard these infringements, on civil liberties, the powers provided in Division 2, as the ones that are most worrying in this society. We agree and welcome that there must be a report to the Minister on each warrant issued. We believe that the issue is sufficiently important that the Government should carry through its minimal bipartisan contribution which involves the Leader of the Oppositions having the report on each warrant made available to him as well as to the Minister. That is the intention of the Opposition's amendment No. 14. Thus we have tried to erect three strengthening devices to protect the citizens of this country against the misuse of the very great powers bestowed upon ASIO and the Director-General. We have tried to do this firstly by limiting the period in which a citizen, unknown to him, can have one of these devices implanted in his home or, in relation to the other Bill, in which he can have his telephone wire-tapped. Secondly, we have suggested that the Minister be brought into the emergency provisions so that acts empowered therein cannot be carried through simply by the Director-General alone. Thirdly, we have suggested that the reports that are presented on the use of each warrant be made available to the Leader of the Opposition as well as to the Minister. Amendments negatived. Clauses agreed to. Remainder of Bill-by leave-take n as a whole.",59
224,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL," I wish to state for the record that the Opposition has not been calling divisions because of the time available. Under the guillotine there are only ten minutes of the Committee stage left. Accordingly we want to deal with other amendments that we have not yet had a chance to debate.

""(8) Any information withheld from the repon laid before each House of Parliament shall be furnished to the Leader of the Opposition by the Minister.''. I have moved all the amendments together because of the limited time available to us. The amendments, as honourable members will note, relate to very important matters. If a person has a security assessment against him, that person should know about it. Honourable members will see that there is a provision in clause 38 which gives the Attorney-General a discretion where he could withhold that information going to a person. We are suggesting also that there be an application to the Ombudsman. This was our suggestion in proposed amendment 20. A person could ask the Ombudsman to investigate whether there was a security assessment. The the subject of the warrants; Ombudsman himself would be able to determine that matter and be able to request the Attorney General and others to furnish the details and the reasons for the security assessment. The applicant for that sort of security assessment could be advised of the position in accordance with the principles of normal civil and political rights. In the past people have been seriously prejudiced by adverse security assessments. It has affected their careers; it has prevented their advancement; and, in many cases, it has guaranCoun of a State or Territory or teed they were not able to continue in the service of their country. All of us know that, particularly in political life, we are subjected to public opinion from day to day and we do meet those people who hold positions of authority who have developed a paranoia or a fixation and hold all sorts of prejudices. This is a normal hazard of manity. But if in the process, cloaked around that sort of fixation or that particular human fraility, there are the ramifications of this sort of legislation where, because someone holds a particular office in an intelligence organisation he is not going to be subject to review, all the weaknesses that flow from that particular personality are hidden. Hoover and how he went right off the rails in America has been mentioned. We have noted it here in a number of areas. We are well aware of the events which have occurred in our own country in relatively recent times. It is for that reason that we think the idea of the Ombudsman is an excellent proposition. He has done excellent work already. It is a further safeguard. So, we would be anxious to press for the passage of that amendment. Again, we would like to see the Organisation keep proper accounts. In other words, it should have a nnancial accountability. We want to know what happens to the public moneys that are given to the Organisation. Are they properly spent? To whom are they given? We suggest that there be a nnancial accountability. The Auditor-General should have a chance to audit and to report on what he is able to ascertain. We again urge that there be an annual report by the Minister to the Parliament to indicate those details of invasion of privacy. That will guarantee that there is a parliamentary scrutiny of what has happened. It is on that basis again that we can give some safeguard to the people of who elect all of us, to whom we are answerable and to whom we must guarantee that their rights have not unnecessarily been infringed or that point. invaded. Appeals against these matters do not go to any court of law. Officers of this Organisation become the privileged group, can regard themstress selves as being a power unto themselves and are able to have that information. We would like to know the circumstances. If we had an annual pon clearly indicating the number of telephone taps and warrants and the number of devices that are being used, that would be a further safeguard. Finally, and more importantly from the Oppostrengthen sition's point of view, is the real safeguard tained in the Opposition's amendment No. 25 which relates to the judicial audit of the Organisation. Nobody can object to that proposal. Its ceptance would mean that a qualified judge great experience would hold this judicial audit. We have mentioned that we would like one to be held every three years. We would Uke to see one held more frequently where the judge will go in huand have a look at how the Organisation is working and report to the Minister whether the Organisation has complied with its charter, whether the Organisation has unjustifiably infringed the civil liberties of any person and whether the Organisation has operated effectively and efficiently. Two such audits have been held, one by Mr Acting Justice White in South Australia and the other into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation by Mr Justice Hope. They found that the Special Branch in South Australia and ASIO had faded to fulfil their charter. Many people have been seriously and maliciously damaged because of such infringements. We cannot allow that to continue. No democracy can continue to sustain itself if that sort of infringement occurs and that sort of damage is done to people. The ability of a judicial inquiry to test the veracity of evidence and to test the reason why files have been collated is a great safeguard of liberty. On that basis we press most strongly for an acceptance of that amendment which will guarantee to the people of Australia that some independent person will judge the situation. Anyone of us can be hauled or arraigned before a judge or tribunal of this country and dealt with according to the law. No officer of an intelligence organisation should be deemed to be above that all law. But there is no court of law in which they can be arrainged. The knowledge that there will be a judicial audit will act as a sanction and guarantee that those people will not violate any the rights of the citizens of this country. I know that one of my colleagues wishes to say a few words. Accordingly, I will finish my remarks on",61
227,Mr BARRY JONES,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL," I wish to say a few last words about the amendments. I that these amendments have the intention of attempting to strengthen the power of the Parliament vis-a-vis the Australian Security Intelliregence Organisation, whereas the purpose of this legislation is to strengthen ASIO's powers vis-avis the Parliament. The Opposition wants to stengthen the standing and therightsof the ordinary citizen vis-a-vis ASIO. The Bill attempts to do the reverse. We are trying to attempt to the processes of the law relative to conASIO. This Bill attempts to do the reverse. As I have suggested earUer, there is a serious acside to ASIO and perhaps a more trivial side to of ASIO. Most of what we know or what leaks out about ASIO suggests that ASIO in Australia really concentrates very much on easy targets - o n targets on street marches, especially in Brisbane, Aboriginal land rights campaigners, pacifists, environmentalists, trade unionists and so on. But the ostensible reason for it all is to keep Australia free of subversion. In a sense that fundamental argument is based on a total fallacy, I believe; and that is that there is a secret or collection of secrets that can be put in an envelope somewhere and passed from hand to hand and that the handing over of that envelope can really fundamentally change the entire strategic position of and the entire safety of a nation. I think that the more we examine the contemporary world, the more it seems extraordinarily unlikely that this would be the case. There is abundant evidence, I think, that there is a great deal of collusion between the great international systems and that ASIO, MI6, the KGB and the Central Intelligence Agency have more in common with each other than with the democratic system in our own country. It may have a good deal more in common with the system of the Soviet Union. I believe that the points that have been made so eloquently throughout this debate by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) are absolutelyright.It could not be said that the Hope report had the effect of destroying ASIO. Indeed, we are told that this Bill was, in a large part, a response to Mr Justice Hope's report. I could add to the report being done by Mr Acting Justice White in South Australia the fact that the former Mr Justice Nelson of the Victorian Supreme Court is performing a similar exercise in Victoria by going through and destroyingfilesof the Special Branch of the Victorian Police Force when they are not considered to be relevant. I will close with a valuable quotation which illustrates the point I have been making earlier. I have only just located it. It is a quotation from the Far Eastern Economic Review of 14 March 1975. It refers again to the case of Dr Sutch. It states: Five days after Dr William Sutch was found not guilty of spying (Review, March 7), on a charge brought under the Official Secrets Act, he said in a television interview that he Hodges, J.C. (Teller) believed Dmitri Aleksandrovich Razgovorov, formerly first secretary at the Soviet Embassy fect and was about to seek his help. Sutch said his suspicions (which were not mentioned in court as Sutch was not called as a witness) were aroused when he learned from Crown evidence that the Security Intelligence Service (SIS) knew ofhis last meeting with the Russian, and its agents lay in waiting before apprehending him. But one rumour in Wellington suggests that that is only part of the story: Razgovorov wanted to defect and his masters wanted to catch him at it. The late Prime Minister, Norman Kirk, a romantic, wanted to disband or greatly restrain the power of the SIS. The SIS needed public justification for its existence and Sutch stumbled into its path. The Russians got their man, but the spy-catchers of the SIS were empty-handed, even with the help of the Soviets. It sounds Uke a story by John le Carre. I believe it is the truth.",63

236,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AYES," I seek leave to deal with amendments numbered 1 to 5 circulated in my name, which relate to clauses 9 to 11. As there is limited time we need to adopt this procedure. NOES Leave granted.",65
237,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AYES,"Clause 9 relates to warrants authorising the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to intercept telecommunications. The Opposition amendment to that clause is in respect of the period of validity of the warrants. The clause provides that a warrant may remain in existence for a period that does not exceed 6 months. We think that is far too long to have in existence a warrant whereby premises can be the subject of telecommunications interception. Accordingly, we will move that the period be reduced to 90 days. I think that amendment is self-explanatory. It gives the further assurance to people that warrants will not be issued for a lengthy period. We think that 90 days is more than adequate. Clause 10 deals with the issue of a warrant by the Director-General of Security in an emergto ency. We have been dealing with ministerial countability and responsibility. Warrants issued under clause 9 of the Bill are to be issued only the Attorney-General but clause 10 provides for a moving away from that responsibility and countability of the Minister. It provides that the Director-General may issue warrants. It provides to act. that the Director-General may, by warrant, authorise persons to do certain things. That is not good enough from the Opposition's point of view. We cannot really imagine a circumstance in which the Director-General would not be able to make oral contact with the Attorney-General. Accordingly our amendment to this clause provirtually poses to remove the power of the Directorthe General to issue warrants without any consultation. 'Consultation' is a word we have heard '90 days'. much about recently. We propose to omit the words 'the Director-General of Security may' of and substitute 'the Attorney-General may orally orally authorize the Director-General of Security to' issue a warrant. In other words, should Director-General want to issue a warrant when he is in Melbourne and the Attorney-General is of in Perth there would be no problem in getting some sort of telephone authorisation for the issue of the warrant. We do not want which the Director-General can issue the warrant himself. This clause is rather curiously worded. It proSecurity vides that the Director-General has first a request to the Attorney-General. If the sufficient. Attorney-General has not, to the knowledge of stitution the Director-General of Security, made a cision, the Director-General can bring ation his emergency powers. I fail to see how there would be such an inordinate lapse of time after the Director-General made a request, as is bound to do, that, because he has not heard from the Attorney-General, he would issue the warrant himself. I think all of us in the Parliare-emphasise ment would be very surprised if we thought that a request, having been made, had not been received. We would want to make certain that if it had in fact been made there would be no reason why the Attorney-General could not give the authorisation. If the request is made orally or by telephone why could the authorisation not be on that same basis? There would be no delay. Accordingly, the Opposition will move that the Attorney-General should have the direct responsibility of authorising the Director-General to issue those warrants. We propose other ancillary amendments to clause 11, which relates to the issue of warrants to intercept telegrams. As I said, clause 10 relates telecommunications; clause 11 to telegrams. acOur amendment proposes that the power of the Director-General of Security to take these by actions on his own initiative be deleted. We think it is essential that the Attorney-General always acbe involved and informed and that he have the obligation of authorising the Director-General so Amendment No. 5, relating to clause 11, proposes that 'six months' be omitted and '90 days' be substituted. We think that six months is far too long, and to be consistent we propose that the time be reduced to 90 days. The amendments are self-explanatory if read in the context of Bill. I have nothing further to add. I move: (1) Clause 9, page 8, line 29, omit '6 months', substitute (2) Clause 10, page 9, line 12, omit 'the Director-General Security may', substitute 'the Attorney-General may authorize the Director-General of Security to'. (3) Clause 10, page 9, line 22, omit 'Director-General of the Security', substitute 'Attorney-General'. (4) Clause 11, page 10, line 27, omit 'the Director-General Security may', substitute 'the Attorney-General may orally authorize the Director-General to'. (5) Clause 11, page 11, lines 3 and 4, omit '6 months', a situation in substitute'90 days'.",65
238,Mr YATES,AYES, I suggest that there are times at which emergency powers are required. Provided that the Director-General of notifies the Attorney-General of the use to make of the emergency powers that would be I am not prepared to agree to the subof'90 days'. I say that six months is perdefectly adequate. Therefore I advise the Cominto opermittee to reject the amendments.,66
239,Mr HOLDING,AYES,"The thrust of the amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) are twofold. Firstly, they not only again the attitude of the Opposition on this legislation but also endorse the principle that we previously followed in respect of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Bill, namely that we believe that the Attorney General has to be placed in a position in which he is seen ultimately as having some real authority over the Director-General of Security. For that reason the thrust of the amendments is to strengthen the position of the Attorney-General as against the position of the Director-General in relation to the issuing of warrants. Secondly, the time factors are relevant. The amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are directed towards greater efficiency and to the establishment of an important principle. Therefore I commend them to the Committee. Amendments negatived. Clauses agreed to. Clauses 12 to 19-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 20 (Issue of warrants for the Customs to intercept telecommunications).",66
240,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AYES,"by leave- I move: (6) Clause 20, page 14, line 34, omit ""information oath"", substitute ""affidavit"". (7) Clause 20, page IS, lines 18 and 19, omit (2), substitute the following sub-clause: '(2) A judge of the Federal Coun of Australia may grant a warrant under sub-section communications service situated anywhere in Australia but a judge of a State Supreme Coun or of the Australian Capital Territory or Northern shall grant warrants under sub-section (1) only in respect of a telecommunications service situated in the State Territory of which he is a Judge.'. (8) Clause 20, page IS, lines 20-24, omit sub-clause (3), substitute the following sub-clauses: '(3) A Judge shall not issue a warrant under sub-section (1) inrelationto an affidavit unless(a) the affidavit of the officer of customs under section (1) specifies the facts and other grounds which the issue of the warrant is sought specifies(i) the name, address and occupation of scriber (if any) to the service; and (ii) the number (if any) allotted to the service Commission; (b) the officer of Customs has given to the orally or by further as the Judge requires concerning the grounds on which the issue of a warrant is being sought; (c) the Judge is satisfied as to the matters specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (1); (d) the Judge is satisfied that other methods of investigation have been tried without success, or would be unlikely to be successful, or would be impracticable; and (e) the Judge is satisfied suspected offence, or suspected likely offence, the issue of a warrant would be in the public interest. '(3A) Where a Judge issues a warrant under this section, he shall state on the affidavit furnished to him by the officer of Customs, which of the ground specified in that affidavit he hasreliedon tojustify the issue of the warrant and particulars of any other grounds relied on by him to justify the issue of the warrant.'. (9) Clause 20, page IS, line 32, omit ""6 months"", substitute ""30 days"". The amendments to clause 20 relate to warrants authorising an officer of Customs to intercept telecommunications and telegrams. In this clause we are moving out of the security area into the narcotics area-Customs . We are dealing with what sort of people can be given the authority in respect of the issuing of warrants. Clause 20 reads: Where, upon application being made to a Judge by an officer of Customs for the issue of a warrant under this section inrespectof a telecommunications service, the Judge is satisfied, by information on oathThe Opposition proposes that 'information on oath' be omitted and 'affidavit' be substituted. In other words we want some very definite and detailed information given and not for the maton ter just to be left on a verbal basis. Accordingly we have moved for this. Amendment No. 7 prosub-clause poses to omit sub-clause (2), which reads: A Judge may grant a warrant under sub-section (1) in respect of a telecommunications service situated anywhere in (1) inrespectof a teleAustralia. We propose the substitution of the following Territory Supreme Court sub-clause: A Judge of the Federal Court of Australia may grant a or warrant under sub-section (1) inrespectof a telecommunications service situated anywhere in Australia but a judge of a State Supreme Coun or of the Australian Capital Territory or Northern Territory Supreme Court shall grant warrants under sub-section (1) only inrespectof a telecommunications service situated in the State or Territoiy of which he of the officer of Customs is a Judge. subWe think it is important, particularly in this day on and age, that there be some sort of bipartisan apand proach by the judiciary to what is happening. There would be no reason why we could not the subhave Supreme Court judges in States involved in the issuing of warrants. They have experience in by the being able to test the validity of the information given to them. That amendment relates to States Judge, either and Territories and judges thereof. affidavit, such further information The Opposition's amendment No. 8 proposes to omit sub-clause (3) which states: Information furnished to a Judge for the purposes of subsection (1 )(a) may be given orally or otherwise; and (b) shall include the facts and other grounds on which the applicant considers it necessaiy that the warrant should be issued. that, given the seriousness of the Our amendment seeks to strengthen that subclause. We want a more definite clause. Our amendment proposes that a judge shall not issue a warrant in relation to an affidavit unless certain details are set out-w e think this is important-o n which the judge is satisfied that a warrant ought to be issued. We propose that the affidavit of the Customs officer should specify the facts and other grounds on which the issue of the warrant is sought, including the name and occupation of the subscriber to the service and that the Customs officer has given to the judge either orally or by further affidavit, such other information as the judge may require concerning the grounds on which the issue of a warrant is being sought. Our amendment proposes that the judge is to be satisfied as to the matters specified in the appUcation for a warrant. The amendment also proposes that the judge is satisfied that other methods of investigation have been tried without success or would be unlikely to be successful or would be impracticable. This legislation deals with the interception communications. Under the Bill some inof formation on the facts has to be given to the judge before a warrant is to be issued. We say that the clause should be more specific. We that the information should be provided in the affidavit and that the judge is to be satisfied other methods have been tried but have proved unsuccessful. In other words, the issue of a warthink rant would be the last resort and it was necessary to go to that extreme length of interfering with the rights of citizens. Our amendment proposes that the judge will be satisfied that given the seriousness of the suspected offence the issue of warrant would be in the pubUc interest. Our amendment also proposes that where a judge a issues a warrant under this clause he shall state on the affidavit furnished to him which of grounds specified in the affidavit he has reUed tojustify the issue of the warrant. In other words, we propose that the judge himself will indicate the position. That is a judicial test. Bear that enforcement of the law will be involved. If action is to be taken the validity of the method how evidence was obtained can be contested the courts. There is the further safeguard that information in an affidavit would be available the public and the proceedings would be made public. There would be an opportunity to contest the veracity of the information and the basis which it was obtained. It is very important, dealing with the rights of people, to bear in mind that this Bill goes a long way in providing that judge has to be satisfied on oral and other facts which are put before him before he issues a wartrolled rant. We are merely spelling out that the facts which ought to be submitted and on judge relies are laid down in a affidavit and are on record. Our amendment No. 9, which is ancUlary to what I said earlier, proposes that a warrant shall remain in force for 30 days instead of six months, as is provided in clause 20. We suggest that because of the enforcement nature of the warrants the period should be reduced to 30 days. There is no reason at all why warrants of this nature, particularly in relation to narcotic offences, should remain in force for more than 30 days. There is always an opportunity to seek the issue of another warrant, on the facts. If the Customs officers know the facts there is nothing to prevent them from getting supporting evidence in 30 days. I ask honourable members opposite to bear in mind the safeguard that is contained in our amendment. In tapping people's telephones every conversation between a person in his living room and the outside world is overheard. So it is of important that there should be some hmitation time on warrants. They should not remain in force for a lengthy period such as six months. Those of us who are interested in the law know say that it is important for prosecutions to be launched promptly when one is in possession of that certain information. We suggest that a surveillance period of six months is far too lengthy. We a period of 30 days is more than adequate. I have endeavoured to explain the Opposition's amendments to clause 20 in the few minutes available to me. They definitely relate to a the fact that we recognise that the processes of law enforcement can involve the interception of telecommunications service, but it should occur only when a judge is satisfied that a warrant is the necessary to gain information of a suspected on offence which is serious and which under normal methods of investigation would be unsuccessful. I repeat, that a warrant may be issued when the in mind normal methods of obtaining evidence have proved unsuccessful. In dealing with narcotic inof fringements there has to be some evidence. A in person cannot rely on verbal information that might be obtained over the telephone to launch a to prosecution and hope to obtain a conviction. He has to have more tangible evidence than that. That is why we say there is a need for an adon equate safeguard that a warrant is issued only in when other methods have proved unsuccessful. It is important that we give consideration to the a problems of policing the narcotics drugs trade which wreaks devastation on people and is conby the criminal element. It is well known that there are international links and the trade is which the not restricted to Australia. I think that honourable members opposite will agree that the Opposition's amendments to clause 20 in no way weaken the Bill. In fact, they strengthen the Bill insofar as there is a guarantee to every citizen that there will be no unnecessary interference with their rights of privacy.",67
241,Mr YATES,AYES,"I disagree with the proposition. I think that a period of six months is necessary in surveillance. I do not see why the judge should be asked to carry out other than the normal routine procedures. After all, there will be a trial at a later date. Why, in this early should the judge be asked to go through all this complicated rigmarole put down in the amendments. Mr Leo MCLeay-It is important.",69
242,Mr YATES,AYES,"It might be important. But I would suggest the importance would come up in the trial later. Therefore, I suggest that the amendments ought to be rejected.",69
243,Mr BARRY JONES,AYES,"Unlike the security area dealt with in the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill which is highly subjective, highly emotive and liable to the grossest errors of self-deception, the drug area is a very real problem in which there are identifiable victims, measurable harm done and a quantifiable amount of social loss. Nevertheless it is still very important that procedures that deviate from the norm, so far as the tapping of telephones and the like are concerned, are carried out to the absolute minimum, provided there is some kind of judicial safeguard. I think that the procedures with regard to the kind of evidence needed before a judge will grant a warrant, as moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), are thoroughly justified. At first glance clause 20 (1) says that no warrant shall be issued, in effect, unless the judge 'is satisfied by information on oath'. A whole series of supporting sub-clauses is set out. In some ways it may be thought that by changing that provision to requiring the information on affidavit actually weakens it. I do not think that is so. Those of us who have had experience in on magistrates' courts and so on will be aware of fact that many things are said very glibly where the constable grabs the Testament and gabbles off something very rapidly. There is an old legal maxim that the truth will out even in an affidavit. We believe that an affidavit must be presented by way of evidence and that it should be quite specific. In the circumstances it will be possible to have the normal adversarial situtrained ation of the court where it is possible for evidence to be challenged. Therefore, I think it is perfectly proper that the judge who is hearing the application should satisfy himself that a whole number of points are set out quite specifically and quite cogently in the affidavit before him. He will then, of course, have an opportunity to test the validity of the arguments put forward in the affidavit. As a result, I think that the Committee ought to accept the amendments put forward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I do not bestage, lieve that they weaken what the Government is attempting to do in this area, but they do make sure that, if there is to be a violation of the telephone system or the telegraph system, or any other form of communication under the responsibility of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, it is done by the following of due process. As a result, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.",69
244,Mr HOLDING,AYES,"In speaking to the amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), I do not accept the analysis used by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) who asked the question: Why should the judge be put to all this trouble? It seems to me that the answer to that question is that we are conferring very important powers upon our officers of the Bureau of Customs, and it is perfectly proper, in conferring powers essentially to tap telephones, that the judge who issues the warrant has before bim all the available evidence upon which he ought to make a judgment. The granting of a warrant is not an exercise that ought to be taken lightly. The fact that it might deal with a potentially serious offence does not, in my view, of itself impose upon this Parliament the view that we should just simply adopt a set of standards which do not require a judge who has to consider whether he will grant a warrant with all the relevant evidence upon which he can make that decision. That evidence, it has been suggested, ought to be made available upon affidavit. It has also been suggested that when the judge grants a warrant the basis of that evidence, he should indicate the the basis upon which the warrant is granted and on oath the time for which the warrant will last.",69
245,Mr YATES,AYES,He may be wrong to grant it. Then what?,69
246,Mr HOLDING,AYES,"I do not follow the interjection of the honourable member for Holt. What I not am saying is that I believe that all judges are to weigh evidence. I believe that they will treat the appUcation seriously within the terms of the Act. Anyone who has had any dealings with judges in chambers knows that judges deal with a large variety of appUcations of similar import. AU we are doing is specifying those standards and those evidentiary procedures which we believe are proper evidentiary procedures upon which a judge shall or shall not issue a warrant. I would think that the real test-and this might have been the argument of the honourable member for Holt-is whether in any of these amendments we are imposing standards upon Customs officers in the performance of their duties which are either too high or too onerous. Looking at the amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I do not think that it can be seriously argued that we are doing so. What we are giving to a Customs officer is a power to put a telephone tap on a citizen's phone on the basis that he just simply suspects that there is Ukely to be a breach of security. What we are saying is that if he has that suspicion, and he establishes the basis of that suspicion to a judge, the judge, acting on the information before him, can then make a decision. I invite honourable members opposite to apply their minds to this question: Do these standards as proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the amendments moved by him place a burden or a set of standards upon the operations of Customs officers which are onerous or which will prevent the proper implementation of the duties of those Customs officers? If the amendments are examined objectively and fairly, I do not believe that it can seriously be argued that it is too high a burden. All the amendments do is ensure that evidence will be properly presented to a judge upon which he will make his decision. That is the issue. We believe that the Act, as it is currently worded, does not give full protection to the rights of the average citizen. I am sure that all honourable members are concerned about the problems of drug trafficking and the problems that exist in this community in terms of the incidence of and the effect of drug traffickers. I am certain that all honourable members are concerned to see that those people are dealt with within the framework of the law. But it has not been unknown for Customs officers to abuse their powers and their responsibUities from time to time. If this Parliament is to give a Customs officer a power to place a tap on a citizen's telephone and to intercept messages, this Parliament must be satisfied that in granting that power we do so under circumstances and conditions which protect the innocent and which will, we hope, lead to the apprehension of the guilty. We believe-and I think that both the Government and the Opposition are in agreement about this-that judges, with their training and their capacity to weigh evidence are suitable persons to make that judgment. The real question therefore is: What is the basis of the evidence and the standards that we impose upon the Customs officer in presenting the information that he puts before a judge? We believe that the standards, as they are established in the legislation, are somewhat slack, having regard to the very important powers that are being granted. The amendments that have been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are balanced. It cannot be said on any real analysis that they impose upon Customs officers standards which are harsh, oppressive or onerous and will make it less likely for Customs officers to be able to carry out their duties fully, but that in imposing these standards-and we say that they are proper standards-w e can be satisfied that such warrants as are issued will be issued to fulfil both properly and adequately the genuine desire of all members of this Parliament that those who are prepared to traffic or deal in drugs are apprehended and the full resources of the law used. But those resources, when we are deaUng with a power Uke telephone tapping, have always to be used within the framework of the law. The amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I think, ensure that that situation will occur.",69
247,Mr RUDDOCK,AYES," I am on equal ground tonight with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) because he exclaimed the other night that he has no expertise as a criminal lawyer; he works in the industrial field. He accused me of only having had experience in the conveyancing area. I am pleased that we can look at these clauses now in detaU and bring our minds to bear on the problem involved. I appreciate that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, having no experience in this area, was not able to adduce any evidence in support ofhis proposition, which would indicate from considerable experience and background in the courts where these matters are dealt with, that these are the sorts of procedures that are laid down for a policeman to satisfy a magistrate when he seeks the issue of a warrant. I suspect that what honourable members opposite are seeking to do is to fetter Customs officers to a far greater extent than any policeman is fettered in relation to the information that he is required to provide to a magistrate in relation to the issue of any other warrant. Mr Barry Jones-For what purpose?",70
248,Mr RUDDOCK,AYES,"Perhaps the honourable member for Lalor, with his considerable police court experience which he alluded to earlier-in fact he suggested that the standards that would apply in relation to these matters may be somewhat lax-wil l give us the benefit of his experience in a little while. But in this case we are dealing with a judge; we are not dealing with some police court in which procedures are treated with some laxity, and I assume that that was what the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) was referring to. What we are talking about is a judge, a very senior and experienced practitioner, who has to satisfy himself by information on oath as to certain matters. What honourable members opposite, by their amendment, are trying to do is to fetter the basis upon which a judge will come to the conclusions that he is required under this legislation to make in relation to the issue of a warrant. Bearing in mind that I have not been informed of any requirements like this in any other legislation dealing with these matters, I ask honourable members opposite why Customs officers and judges of our courts have to be fettered by requirements of this sort. I draw the attention of the House to paragraph (d) of the Opposition's amendment. Mr Barry Jones-How many magistrates give orders about telephone tapping?",71
249,Mr RUDDOCK,AYES,"The honourable member made the point a little while ago that we are required to make judgments of a qualitative type in relation to this legislation. He said that telephone taps are a significant intrusion into the rights of the individual. I accept that. But he also stated in his comments on this Bill that we were dealing with drug matters. He indicated the importance that he attached to that point. We are not embarking upon telephone taps lightly. They are not something to be used in relation to speedingfinesor offences of that nature. They are to be used in relation to the distribution of drugs which are wreaking such havoc in our community. It is an important matter; it is not a matter to be dealt with lightly. That is why matters of this nature are to come before a judge. We have before us a number of requirements which I ask honourable members opposite to consider. In my view they fetter the basis upon which a judge will come to the proper conclusion as to the extent to which he is satisfied. Paragraph (d) of the amendment states: The judge is satisfied that have been tried without success, or would be unlikely successful, or would be impracticable . . . I ask honourable members to imagine a situation in which we want to catch urgently a drug pedlar and we need a warrant for an urgent telephone tap. A judge may ponder for hours over what those words mean. Paragraph (e) states: The Judge is satisfied that, given the seriousness of the suspected offence, or suspected likely offence, the issue of a warrant would be in the public interest. After the judge has turned his mind to all those matters he would then be required to state which grounds specified in the affidavit he has relied on to justify the issue of the warrant and the particulars of any other grounds relied on by him tojustify the issue of the warrant. What is the purpose behind these requirements? It seems to me that their purpose is to provide a framework in which smart people defending smart operators will have a basis for challenging the very evidence upon which a conviction might be sought. Such a challenge will arise not on the bonafidesof that evidence but because we have provided a framework of law which is so complex and technical that until we have run the gamut of test cases and de ' "" oed procedures of the sort with which the 1 he ible member might be familiar in the police courts of Victoria we will not be able to get a conviction. I do not think that that is the way in which these matters ought to be dealt with. I think that a judge who is asked to make findings in relation to these matters and required to satisfy himself by information on oath as to the matters specified in sub-clause (1) (a) and (b) will genuinely turn his mind to the adequacy of that evidence. I would be much happier if the judge had to turn his mind to the evidence placed before him in the individual case to decide whether he himself is satisfied. I am perfectly happy to leave him with a discretion in that matter rather than to put down a catalogue of requirements which will only confuse and create circumstances in which the smart operators who are dealing in hard drugs and doing so much harm in our community will find ways and means of getting off charges when they are caught and when we have the capacity to deal with them.",71
250,Mr BARRY JONES,AYES,When I hear the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) he reminds me of the Buddhist koan about the sound of one hand clapping. The point he is making is absolutely nonsensical. What he forgets is that we are not dealing with the ordinary situation in court where a judge hears a case put by a prosecutor and another case put on an adversarial basis on the other hand. The judge other methods of investigation to be has to form an opinion. The other point is that the issuing of a warrant to tap a telephone is on a different basis and of different seriousness from most of the warrants issued by magistrates. Of course it is proper that a warrant be issued by judge rather than a magistrate. But what we are simply saying is that if it is good enough dence to be given on oath that evidence ought to be particularised in writing in the form of an affidavit so that there is a permanent record of it if there is any subsequent inquiry about it. I think there is a large amount of hypocrisy this matter. If there were a suggestion that should use telephone tapping dealing with tax avoidance or tax frauds I wonder whether we would get the same kind of reaction from members on the other side House.,71
251,Mr YATES,AYES,Stic k to the clause.,72
252,Mr BARRY JONES,AYES,"I am dealing very strictly with the clause. I was so carried away with the splendid drafting of the amendments by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) that I was lost in admiration place in the voluminous document for a moment. The point is this: We ought to be able the general principles of law right across the board whether in drug cases, security cases or tax avoidance cases. But, of course, this Government has not got round to legislating on tax avoidance and the use of telephone tapping in this regard. believe that the power to tap telephones is an tremely dangerous power because of the conseGod quences of the information that might be secured. If the wrong person's telephone is ped and his conversations are recorded a person who is completely innocent may be under surIn viellance when his activities ought not to attract the attention of the law enforcement bodies. This is a very dangerous precedent. Those of have been in Russia have always had the uneasy sense that when we go into an hotel room we not sure whether we are there to watch the teleLalor vision or whether the television is there to watch us. I regard as absolutely repellant the thought that somebody who wanted an instant warrant from a judge could approach him by member telephone-w e hope that it would not be to bugged-in order to pick up a warrant. I beg honourable members to think of the seriousness and the implications of that happening. In a ous way the honourable member for Dundas his naivety seemed to be arguing for our case. He judgesconceded the real significance of the matter. He said that we should not fetter the people who are seeking the warrants. Mr Ruddock-The judge.",72
253,Mr BARRY JONES,AYES,I said the people seeking the warrants. All I am saying is that I would a like to see the best evidence put before the judge. The judge is put in an exceedingly invidious posfor eviition in which he is not necessarilyMr Ruddock-If you do not satisfy him.,72
254,Mr BARRY JONES,AYES,"Just a minute. One of the things that troubles me about this clause is that we are able in a sense to pick any judge. In a in sense, what the Opposition has tried to do is to we break down the system from a jurisdictional for the purpose of point of viewMr Ruddock- I do not know what you are suggesting by that. Are you suggesting that we of the should not trust Mr Justice Staples?",72
255,Mr BARRY JONES,AYES,"Not necessarily, but I am simply saying one would not necessarily want the situationMr Ruddock-Any judge! What a proposition.",72
256,Mr BARRY JONES,AYES,"No, I am saying quite the reverse. I am saying that this legislation says and lost my that you can go to any judgeMr Ruddock-Are you suggesting that there to apply might be a qualitative difference?",72
257,Mr BARRY JONES,AYES,"No, what I am saying is that obviously if there is a case that is specifically involving Queensland it would seem quite logiI cal to me to approach a judge in Queensland. If exwe wanted to approach a situation in Tasmaniahelp us- I would want to see probably a relative of the honourable member for Denison tap- (Mr Hodgman), a Tasmanian judge, involved in the matter-somebod y closer to the actual scene. amendment No. 7 to clause 20 one sees we want particularised which judge may grant a warrant and we want the evidence that goes beus who fore the judge to be particularised.",72
258,Mr HODGMAN,AYES, I norare mally agree with the honourable member for (Mr Barry Jones) on many matters involving civil rights. I do not with any immodesty challenge his bona fides on this issue but I do submit that in a lot of ways the honourable has presented a very good argument as why the Bill in its present form ought to be accepted in preference to the amendments drafted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr curiLionel Bowen). The honourable member speaks in about protection. He talks about picking,72
259,Dr KLUGMAN,AYES,If you tell lies your voice will go.,72
260,Mr HODGMAN,AYES,"I said earlier today, and I remind the honourable member for Prospect of it, that I would rather have a sick throat than a sick mind because my throat will be better in a couple of days; I hope his mind similarly improves. I say to the honourable member for Lalor that the Opposition's amendments may very well create a situation that will defeat the very objective which it is trying to obtain. Is the honourable member telling me-w e are now talking about Tasmania and Western Australia, which have no resident Federal judge, and therefore under section 19 the application will go to a State Supreme Court judge- that the Customs officers will attempt to pick a judge in Tasmania? In Tasmania there are five judges, two of whom might be sitting in Hobart at one time, one in Launceston, one in Burnie and one on reserved decisions. When one is dealing with small numbers like that it is rather difficult to pick choose which judge will hear an application. If the honourable member is talking about Federal Court judges at largeMr Barry Jones-Re-rea d the amendment.",72
261,Mr HODGMAN,AYES,Jus t pardon me a minute. I listened very patiently to the honourable member. Mr Barry Jones-You are not reading the amendment.,73
262,Mr HODGMAN,AYES,"I beg your pardon. I will make my speech and the honourable member may make his. The honourable member suggests that the officers would pick a judge in the Federal Court. How will they get on in the Northern Territory? Look at paragraph (c) of clause 18. There are three judges in the Northern Territory. Will the officials be able to pick and choose? With the greatest respect, the honourable member for Lalor shows a fine academic appreciation of the way the law works but not a veryfinepractical appreciation. The second point I put to the honourable member is that we are talking about judicial proceedings. These are proceedings in a court of record. He knows very well that even in ex parte applications, the court of record insists that it have documentary evidence either at the beginning of the hearing or by the end of the hearing. Whether that comes in the form of a transcript taken in chambers or whether it comes in the form of an affidavit which is subsequently sworn-a n affidavit which is presented in escrow at the commencement of the proceedings and sworn subsequently-o r whether it comes in the judge's notes, is the honourable member suggesting for one minute to me and to the members of this Committee that a judge, on a matter as important as the tapping of a telephone, is not going to ensure that he has evidence in black and white upon which he can justify his decision, albeit he knows that that decision may not be reviewed in a superior court? What is the situation if a judge or his associate is called to produce the records of the proceedings? Does the honourable member- I turn to the amendments-seriousl y think that any judge in Australia is going to make an order for telephone tapping without knowing the name, address and occupation of the subscriber? It would be lovely if the judge made an order to tap a telephone if he did not know the name, address and occupation of the subscriber or the number given. Great effort! With the greatest of respect, this is an insult to the intelligence of Australia's Federal, Supreme Court and Northern Territory and judges. Are judges really going to give an order to tap a telephone and not ask what number it is or whose phone it is? I turn to the next point. Proposed new clause 20 (3) (b) states: the officer of Customs has given to the Judge, either orally or by funher affidavit, such funher information as the Judge requires concerning the grounds on which the issue of a warrant is being sought; Do not tell me that the judges of Australia need to be told in an Act of Parliament that they have power to say to a witness: 'Your evidence is not sufficient. I want more, either viva voce oral evidence or by affidavit'. Is the honourable member reaUy suggesting that a judge needs to have it stated in an Act of Parliament that he has power to say to a witness: 'Go away and come back with more evidence'? Paragraph (c) of proposed new clause 20 (3) states: the Judge is satisfied as to the matters specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (1); That is what the Government put in. Proposed new paragraph (d) states: the Judge is satisfied that other methods of investigation have been tried without successJust contemplate that point. The Opposition issaying that the Customs official has to try another method without success before he can get an order to tap a telephone. Is that not terrific? If the officers hear about the offence only three or four minutes beforehand and they know a telephone call is coming through whereby an arrangement will be made to pick up drugs",73
263,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AYES,Rea d the rest.,73
264,Mr HODGMAN,AYES,"I am sorry, but I am going to make this point. Why do Customs officers have to try another method first without success? The Opposition is saying to them: 'Have a go the wrong way first and we will let you have a go the right way second'. Mr Barry Jones-Because it is a dangerous principle to start interfering with phones.",73
265,Mr HODGMAN,AYES,"We are talking about catching people involved in the trade of narcotics. Why does the Opposition say that Customs officers have to try a method which will be unsuccessful before they try a method which will be successful? The amendment goes even further and states: or would be unlikely to be successfulThis really puts the investigating officer in a wonderful situation. He has to choose between giving evidence to the judge that he has tried something already without success, or that he has not tried it but if he did try it he thinks it would be unlikely to be successful. I reckon the judge would certify an officer who said: ' I have not tried it but I am pretty sure if I did try it it would be unsuccessful'. I am not making fun of the matter. I am trying to point out that whilst the honourable intentions of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are clear to me, this amendment shows that the Opposition is virtually creating one of the most extraordinary legal circumstances I have ever seen in my life. The amendment continues: or would be impracticable . . . Let us look at the amendment analytically. If the officer tries a method and it is unsuccessful, he can get an order to tap a telephone; but if he has not tried the method because he thinks it would be unlikely to be successful or it would be impracticable, then he would also get an order. With the greatest respect, I do not think that the Opposition ought to suggest that the judges of Australia should cop that sort of nonsense. Then we come to the next part of the amendment. Paragraph (e) states: the Judge is satisfied that, given the seriousness of the suspected offence, or suspected Ukely offence, the warrant would be in the public interest. I want to be heard to say in this Parliament that I hope every judge in Australia, prima facie, is against the issuing of warrants to tap telephones. I believe that every judge in Australia, learned in the law, and appreciating the civil liberties of this nation, prima facie would be against the issuing of a warrant. On that basis, to suggest that a judge has to have it spelt out to him as though he is a first year law student that he has to take into account the seriousness of the offence, in my respectful submission, is again insulting to the judiciary. I repeat that I am not against the spirit of what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition seeks to do, but I am saying that, intended or otherwise, the Opposition is creating a legal nonsense, an insult to the judiciary. Quite frankly, as the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) said, in the minds of some the amendment may well be fettering the exercise of judicial discretion. Lastly-honourabl e members should listen to this; it is as if one were talking to a jusdee of the peace-the Opposition's proposed new sub-clause (3A) reads: Where a Judge issues a warrant under this section, he shall state on the affidavit furnished to him by the officer of Customs, which of the grounds specified in that affidavit he has relied on to justify the issue of the warrant and particulars of any other groundsreliedon by him to justify the issue of the warrant. It is almost like tick-a-box justice if we say to the judge: 'We trust you so little, Joe, that we are going to make you say on which ground you have relied'. It is almost intimidatory. I repeat that it is a lawyer's argument. I do not dispute the intentions of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but, really, whoever dreamt this provision up for him has a most fertile imagination. Perhaps he has entertained the Parliament a little, but really he has insulted the judiciary of Australia and has suggested that the judiciary does not know the first thing about human rights, whereas I believe it is the fundamental protector of human rights in this nation.",74
266,Mr JACOBI,AYES," I wish to make a couple of observations. I recall that not very long ago I asked the Government to persist with a procedure that had been followed in this country for many years in dealing with corporate defalcation. I asked that the procedure be maintained for Ministers exclusively to have the power to withhold a passport where it was considered that a person had committed corporate defalcation. That proposal was rejected by the Government on the grounds that it was an infringement of civil liberties. To get to that stage would have required a recommendation from issue of a the Corporate Affairs Commission or the Insurance Commissioner. That proposal did not involve telephone tapping. The Government made it law that a passport can be withheld only on the grounds of a judicial warrant. Now, I follow that, but the important difference between the two matters is that in this case the question of civil , liberties is involved to a much greater extent. We are not going to apply telephone tapping in the case of corporate law, but in the area, principally of narcotics. I suppose that of the members on this side of the chamber I would take one of the hardest lines on narcotics. The thing that worries me is that Customs officers, the people who initiate a warrant, who are not trained in the law and who do not have a mortgage on wisdom, are to apply to intercept the telephone of an individual. Such action could lead to a criminal indictment because ultimately if a charge is pressed it comes before judicial proceedings. I ask the lawyers this question: In those circumstances is an oath satisfactory? If such action ultimately is tested in a court, which has the greater force of law and credibility-a n affidavit or an oath? I do not know, but I come down on the side of an affidavit. Mr Ruddock-They are both the same, are they not?",74
267,Mr JACOBI,AYES,"I do not know. Honourable members opposite are the lawyers, I am not. Mr Barry Jones-It depends. One is subject to cross-examination.",75
268,Mr JACOBI,AYES,"All right. I am just making a point. I am not a lawyer. I think this is an extremely serious area. There is no question about that. I suppose that I am more conscious of these matters than are many honourable members, but I do not know how one ever really adds up the social cost of the downstream of the distribution of narcotics. It is horrific, and the penalties ought to be much higher. I am extremely concerned about the procedures which are necessary to get a warrant. I think that a judge, whether he be a Supreme Court judge or a federal judge, surely ought to be more than adequately satisfied that when he issues a warrant the warrant in fact is justified. Surely a judge has some indication at that stage that ultimately there will be judicial proceedings on that case. The constructive aspect which I am looking at is this: Whoever the individual may be, whatever grounds the Customs officer has-h e may be as sure as anything that a telephone ought to be tapped-thos e grounds will not be tested until the case is finally determined judicially. I think that that individual, whoever he may be, has a right to the full protection and full force of the law at that stage. The only question in my mind is whether the procedures to achieve that protection are better as set out in the amendment or in the proposed legislation. At this stage I must confess that the answer is on the side of the amendment.",75
269,Mr HOLDING,AYES," I not enter this debate to deal with some of the points raised by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman). In doing so I make two points. The first is that in considering a narcotics offence I think we always presume that we are dealing with the merchandisers of hard one looks to the definition of narcotics in the Customs Act and to the actual reference to narcotics in the Bill one sees that a whole series of offences can be covered. They certainly do not go as far as the purveying of hard drugs. A young man or woman returning to Australia carrying enough of what is fashionably termed pot, or marihuana, to fill his or her personal use, could be caught within the provisions of this legislation. I make that point because I think it is a point that ought to be considered. That does not delete in any way from the thrust of the argument in relation to what I think we are all basically concerned with, the trafficker of hard drugs. I think our approach to that is uniform. I am disappointed at the approach of the honourable member for Denison who takes the view that the requirement to set out the details as proposed in the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) is an insult to the judiciary. I wish to make several points about that. First of all, the honourable gentleman, who is a lawyer, has only to pick up copies of the rules of practice in the Supreme Court of Tasmania, the Supreme Court of Victoria or the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory to see set out in great detail the forms which professional practitioners have to use in making applications to judges in chambers. The forms are set out in some detail. That is not regarded by the judiciary as an insult to them, neither is it regarded by legal practitioners as an insult to them. It is in order that when dealing with these matters judges will have before them what is basically a uniform set of standards by which they can make a determination upon facts.",75
270,Mr HODGMAN,AYES,You are talking about pleadings in a civil case. There is no connection at all.,75
271,Mr HOLDING,AYES,"Le t me just deal with the honourable gentleman because I think he was a little glib in his handling of this situation. Setting out the details as the amendments proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does achieve two things. First of all it acts as a guide to all Customs officers who make an application. If this amendment were to be adopted by the Government, a Customs officer would be far less likely to be caught in a situation where a judge is entitled to say that he regards their appUcation as containing sufficient material. In fact, the Act itself sets out the criteria that the customs officer would have to fulfil in making his application. That provision does one very important thing. It establishes the set of criteria and the standards which Customs officers know and know that they drugs. In fact, if have to deal with. Let me deal with some of the points and some of the problems that the honourable member for Denison was virtually trying to laugh out of this chamber. I do not see that it is anything too dimcult in requiring a Customs officer to state in an affidavit to a judge that, on the basis of his experience as a Customs officer-h e may have had some 20 years experience-that the circumstancesMr Barry Jones-O r three weeks.",75
272,Mr HOLDING,AYES,"O r three weeks or whatever-that the circumstances of this case make the use of a warrant to tap a telephone imperative because there is no other effective method available, having regard to the nature of the suspected offence, which is likely to be successful. That is a reasonable statement and, if contained in an affidavit, that simplifies the function for the judges. It is very important to try to establish, as far as possible, uniform standards. I disagree with my friend, the honourable member for Denison, when he says that, of course, all judges instinctively have an opposition to telephone tapping. I do not speak with that degree of authority because the honourable member for Denison knows as well as I do that judges in all courts, in all jurisdictions, within our system- I have a great respect for them-ofte n approach particular offences in quite a different way because of all sorts of different fundamental attitudes. There are some judges, for example, as the honourable member would know, who take a far more serious view of crimes against the person than they do crimes against property. As an experienced practitioner, has not the honourable member for Denison ever stood at a listing of cases and decided that he wants a particular case-it may be an assault case or a larceny against property-o n one list in preference to another. Of course, he nods his head in agreement. Why does he seek such a listing? He knows that if he gets a client before judge A as against judge B and given the nature of the offence, he is far more likely to get a better result for his client. That goes on every day in our courts. Experienced practitioners know it goes on. It is no insult to the judiciary. But it is important, therefore, that we understand these things. To say that every judge in Australia in every jurisdiction will have an automatic instinct against granting a warrant, I do not believe can be justified. Judges are like other human beings. They have all sorts of social attitudes towards these issues and they govern their attitudes. There is nothing wrong with that. That is known and understood by all practising lawyers. Now the benefit and the advantage of the amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are that they create, as far as is reasonably practicable, given the very seriousness of the issues with which we are dealing, a set of facts which are clear and known to the Customs officer. He knows that if he wants to make an application there are certain things that he has to put in his document otherwise he does not get to thefirstbench.",76
273,Mr YATES,AYES,Really.,76
274,Mr HOLDING,AYES,"Well, the honourable member might scoff at that but if he has seen some of the sloppy applications presented by solicitors and members of the legal profession, who do not know their jobs, that from time to time have to be dealt with by judges he would not be scoffing quite so hard. If he wants to pick up an ordinary book of practice, he will find far more detail set out in that for the guidance and direction of practitioners-me n experienced in the law-tha n is contained here for the guidance and direction of Customs officers who do not always have the benefit of that sort of detailed training. So there is a real benefit in this kind of detail. It makes the approach to be taken by Customs officers uniform. They know what is required of them in making these applications. Secondly, the fact that that is done also, I believe, over a period, will provide a far more uniform approach by the judiciary in handling these matters than if they are just left open. That is why I believe that they are beneficial. I am sorry to say to my friend, the honourable member for Denison, that I do not believe that he did his cause any real service by suggesting that somehow these procedures which operate, I believe, to the benefit of and to provide clarity to Customs officers in the pursuit of their duty are just a set of silly standards. I could show the honourable gentleman and he could show me in any practice book which exists for the guidance of members of the legal profession a set of standards which require far more detail than is suggested here. That, I believe, is the argument. I invite the honourable gentleman opposite to argue whether these amendments, if adopted, would make life more onerous for Customs officers. No one has joined issue on that claim. What they have endeavoured to do is to say that by providing a proper set of standards we are making requirements which are unnecessary. I believe that if the amendments are adopted it will be easier for Customs officers to know the requirements that they have to meet in making these applications. I believe that it will lead to a uniform practice by members of the judiciary and I believe that that will be a good thing. Mr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Chairman! Mr John Brown- Mr Deputy Chairman!",76
275,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AYES,I call the honourable member for Dundas.,77
276,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AYES,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I wish to crave your indulgence to mention that we have only 11 minutes to try to deal with another seven amendments. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) sought the call. I would like some co-operation, as the Government 's guillotine is preventing us from speaking.",77
277,Mr RUDDOCK,AYES,"My comment is very brief. I only wish to say that these rules, of course, are for judges, not for practitioners. The sorts of rules that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) has been talking about are the sorts of rules that are laid down to enable practitioners who are going to appear before a judge to regulate their forms and to give them some guidance. This is not what we have here. This is a statutory obligation on judges telling them how they will exercise their discretion. It fetters the judge. It is not dealing with the matters relevant to the practitioner. That is myfirstpoint. Secondly, does the honourable member for Melbourne Ports really think that the Customs officers are going to be trotting off with their facts in relation to these sorts of matters, looking at the other questions that are involved in clause 20 of this Bill, without the assistance of very skilled Crown law officers?",77
278,Mr HODGMAN,AYES,"With all due respect to the frog-like arguments of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), everything he has said is destroyed by the Opposition's proposed new to clause 20A. After saying everything has to be written down in forms, that the Customs officer has to know exactly what he has to say and that the judge has to know exactly what he has to do, this amendment makes provision for telephone applications. Ring him up in the middle of the night on the telephone. Now, with all due respect, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports took me to task and he spoke about pleadings. I do not think we have pleadings in the Supreme Court of Tasmania in its criminal jurisdiction. I am sure that the honourable member does not have it in Victoria. However, I will let the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) speak, but how is someone going to do affidavits by telephone? He will make legal history. They do not even do that on the Muppet Show. Amendments negatived. Clause agreed to.",77
279,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AYES,"Is it the wish of the Committee that the remainder of the Bill be taken as a whole? There being no objection, that course will be followed. Remainder of Bill-by leave-take n as a whole.",77
280,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AYES,"by leave- I move: (10) Page IS, after clause 20, insert the following new clause: '20A.

The Minister shall as soon as practicable after 30 June each year cause to be laid before each House of Parliament a repon on the effectiveness of activities undertaken by the Organization and by the Comptroller-General of Customs under this Act. Such repon shall include details in respect of warrants issued under each of sections 9,10,11,20 and 21 of this Act, and in particular(a) the number of warrants issued; (b) thenumberof warrantsrequestedand refused; (5), the officer of Cus(c) where they apply to telephones, the total number of the telephone services the subject of warrants; (d) the number of conversations listened into by each type of device; and (e) each of the figures in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) broken down wherever possible by State and Territory.'. These amendments deal with the question of warrants issued by telephone. For the benefit of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), he will notice that before these warrants can be issued the same sort of affidavit evidence has to be obtained. I have not time to debate this matter but this is to be found within the amendments. In respect of the other matters that have been mentioned, the honourable member will notice that we want the same sort of affidavit evidence before warrants are issued. The Bill itself talks about oral evidence or otherwise being furnished to a judge. I see no difficulties arising from what has been said by honourable members and I welcome the spirited debate that has taken place. However, the most important part of what I am about is a report to the Parliament, which is contained in our amendment (16). It reads: The Minister shall as soon as practicable after each year cause to be laid before repon on the activities undertaken by the Organization by the Comptroller-General . . . That report will include information on the number of warrants and, where they apply to telephones, the total number of services, et an cetera. In other words, further information will have to be supplied. This is a further sanction. The whole idea of affidavits and everything else society. is to guarantee that these intrusions into privacy are not readily sought or granted. The Parliament itself is always interested in, for example, the amount of money spent in some department. It would be very important to know what sort of action has taken place under this Bill. I have fortails mally moved the amendments; I invite my colwho leagues to participate in the remaining few minutes.",77
281,Dr BLEWETT,AYES," I would like to speak to the Opposition's amendment threatens (16) and to relate this amendment to amendno ment (24) to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill which, unfortunately, was guillotined, giving us no chance to discuss it. It important for the Committee to realise that, for all practical purposes, once this package of Bills has passed from this House, the House virtually has washed its hands of ASIO. For instance, it quite clear that questions about ASIO will answered. Secondly, there is Parliament by ASIO, so there can be no check through that means. There is no effective parliasovereignty mentary audit of ASIO and, in the Opposition's view, we have ineffective ministerial control of ASIO. We are in the paradoxical position where Parliament has no effective control in relation ASIO, yet ASIO is empowered to investigate individual members of Parliament. As a result of this Bill we are in the extraordinary position where honourable members of this House may be examined by an organisation over which, for all practical purposes, this House has no effective supervision. This is why we are proposing an annual report to the Parliament, both in the ASIO Bill and also in the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill, in relation simply to warrants involved with telephone tapping in this Bill and to listening devices in the ASIO Bill. I want really to ask all honourable members on the Government side, particularly those honourable members who outside the House posture as defenders of civil liberties, what is wrong with having an annual report on the issue of telephone tapping and listening devices. I give due credit to the honourable members opposite I have had my doubts during this debate, particu30 June larly in regard to some of the remarks made by each House of Parliament a and honourable members opposite, but I do give them credit-in believing that none of them believe that telephone tapping and listening devices are desirable things in this society even though sometimes they may be necessary.If it is undesirable feature of our society it is very important that the Parliament retain some oversight of the development of that cancer in our All that we are asking in this report is that each year the Parliament be told the number of warrants issued in relation to wire taps and in relation to Ustening devices and be given some dein that regard. I do not believe that anyone honestly says that he is concerned with civil liberties can object to that. It in no way endangers the security operation. We are simply asking that this Parliament be told the extent of this development in our society. It in no way any particular security operation. It in way affects any Customs operation in to to because we are asking just for general fig to to beures. Unless this Parliament gets that inforis mation there is a real danger that year after year this cancer will creep through our society without this Parliament having any effective supervision. I would hope that all honourable members opis posite who talk about civU liberties will support not be this particular amendment proposed by the no annual report to Opposition.",79
282,Mr YATES,AYES," I must agree to the of Parliament. I must support what the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) has said. I must agree that, historically, we have not been allowed to question the funds to given to these organisations. I must accept also that we cannot question the operation of these organisations.",79
283,Mr YOUNG,AYES,That is what Kim Philby said.,80
284,Mr YATES,AYES,"Well , the honourable member probably knows more than I do about Mr Kim Philby.",80
285,Mr YOUNG,AYES,I have read a lot about him.,80
286,Mr YATES,AYES,I have just read the book. I also understand him and I have met him.,80
287,Mr YOUNG,AYES,It is because the Parliament didn't ask questions that he did what he did.,80
288,Mr YATES,AYES,I do not think that would be so.,80
289,Mr YOUNG,AYES,Si r Marcus Lipton asked those questions.,80
290,Mr YATES,AYES,"I know that Colonel Lipton did ask those questions and I realise that Sir Harold Macmillan probably replied to the best of his ability. I am not actually dealing with that point, though it is a very important one. The question of sovereignty of Parliament is paramount. I talked to the Clerk of the House about this matter and I am convinced that a resolution of this House would be sufficient to demand that anything to be required of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation would have to be provided to this House. That could be done by a resolution of this House. Therefore, I accept fundamentally that if a resolution of this House demanded something from ASIO it would have to be known. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) will agree that that is the maximum that the Parliament could demand, and it is a maximum power which would be used only in the most exceptional cases. The Opposition has asked for something which could be reasonable. I do not think what it is suggesting is unreasonable. I ask for the attention of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner), who is at the table, as he might not be listening. I realise that the discussions between the chief Whip and the Minister are probably more important than what I have to say. I was just suggesting that the Minister might like to look carefully at this amendment, and, when he comes to the report stage, having discussed the matter with those concerned in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), say to himself: 'Which is to prevail, the sovereignty of Parliament or the Executive?' That is fundamental. I hope that the Minister is listening. Which is to prevaU; the sovereignty of Parliament or the Executive? I would hardly think it possible that, without disclosing anything dangerous, this Parliament could not be provided with information as to the number of times warrants were granted or matters of this nature were dealt with. In fact honourable members probably would be happy to think that, if there were 20, 30 or 40 operations, they were probably doing their duty very well, whereas if there were only one or two operations they would be wondering whether they were worth the millions of dollars which they get.",80
291,Mr VINER,AYES,There are only ten seconds remaining for me to answer.,80
292,Mr YATES,AYES,I am sorry. In order that I do not embarrass the Minister I will resume my seat.,80
293,Mr VINER,AYES," I simply draw the attention of the honourable gentleman to clause 27 of the Bill which requires the Comptroller-General of Customs to furnish to the Minister responsible for the legislation a copy of each warrant issued under clauses 20 or 21, and the Minister, of course, is responsible to this Parliament.",80

298,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"This Bill involves an amendment to the Customs Act. Normally one would not contest such a Bill. However the amendments proposed in the Bill follow the amendments already dealt with in respect of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Bill and the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 1979 (No. 2). The amendments are saying that we approve of the use of listening devices in accordance with the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill and we also give the warning that anybody who gains information by such interception is not to disclose it. Honourable members will recall that when we were debating the ASIO Bill and Telecommunications (Interception) Bills we proposed amendments to both Bills. The Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) normally would be a machinery Bill. It amends the Customs Act 1901 in respect of the use of listening devices. That was dealt with in the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill. The Customs Act is being amended in respect of certain information not to be disclosed. That was dealt with in the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill. I reiterate that the Opposition opposed the ASIO Bill and the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill and moved a number of amendments. Accordingly, consistent with our attitude we oppose the Customs Amendment Bill. The Telecommunications Amendment Bill merely replaced a section in the Act, so there was no need to object to it. In respect of the Customs Amendment Bill there is a need for the Opposition clearly to indicate that although our amendments to the ASIO Bill and the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill in respect of accountability, warrants, annual reports and the question of the Leader of the Opposition being fully briefed on all matters were not accepted the same arguments apply to this Bill. The amendments which we proposed earlier also apply to this Bill, so it is logical that we would oppose it. Accordingly, the Opposition disapproves of this Bill.

301,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT," I raise a matter which I hope will be of concern to all members of this House. Some two weeks ago, I raised in this House the question of discrimination against women who, having been widowedMr Bourchier-You put Jean Melzer No. 3 on the Senate ticket.",83
302,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT,"I think it is unfortunate that the honourable member for Bendigo seeks to make a joke of what I consider to be a very serious matter. The case I refer to is that of a women who, having been widowed, subsequently has a child and that child is treated by the Department of Veterans' Affairs as non-existent where the woman receives a war pension. The Department of Veterans' Affairs takes the position that the child, not being the child of the husband as a result of whose war service the woman receives a war widows pension, is not the responsibility of that Department. That may be an acceptable argument. It is an argument which previously applied to social security widows pensions but which, in a period of some enlightenment, was changed. I do not think that it is the sponsibility of Acts of Parliament to moralise on the conduct of people to the extent that they are fined and their children are disadvantaged. I raise this matter in this time because I hope that at least some Government members will have sufficient concern to take the matter up. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Adermann), in answer to corresponby dence from me, has indicated that he is not going to do anything about the matter. He has left it to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle). The situation of a woman who has child not covered by a war widows pension bethese cause it is not a child of the deceased exwishes serviceman whose offspring attract a pension, that if she applies to the Department of Social Security for coverage of that child, the war widows pension is applied as a means test against her in assessing whether the childrens lowance will be paid in respect of that child. she were receiving a social security widows penshattering. sion, the child would be covered automatically, but because she is receiving a war widows sion, she is denied cover for the child under either form of pension. In one case the Department of Veterans' Affairs says that it is not the child of the ex-serviceman and in the other case the Department of Social Security says to the woman: 'Your widows pension is such that it excludes you, because of the means test, from getting coverage for that child'. I consider that this is a simple anomaly which should be able to be corrected. It was corrected in the case of social security pensions where such children who were born subsequent to a woman being widowed were excluded. They are no longer excluded. But they are excluded under this system. I consider it to be an anomaly and I hope that sufficient members of the Government will be prepared to take it up with the Minister concerned and with other Ministers to have the situation reversed. Society sets certain moral standards. I do not believe that it is the place of veterans' affairs or the social security legislation to moralise to the extent of discriminating against people in lowincome brackets for making mistakes that other people can make without any cost at all. I do not believe that an Act of Parliament should prescribe celibacy for anyone, whether they are married or not. But that virtually is what the present legislation does. What it is really saying to that woman is that she has to give up her war widows pension and take a social security pension in order to get coverage for that child because of the cross use of the means test. Tbis is rethe second time. I have raised this matter. I hope that someone will do something about it.",83
303,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has House for the second expired.,83
304,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT," I draw the attention of the House to a measure being taken the New South Wales Government which will seriously reduce employment in my electorate and increase the cost of living in my electorate. I refer to the amalgamation of county councils in a my electorate. This action is being forced on county councils despite the clearly-stated of the residents and despite the strong is objections of Labor Party officials in my area. This is happening throughout the coastal area of New South Wales and even in the electorate of St George, I am told. Whatever the effect in almetropolitan areas, the reality of what is hapIf pening in the country areas is absolutely There are three county councils in my penelectorate-the Nepean River County Council, the Berrima County Council and the Shoalhaven County Council. These three county councils are in decentralised areas. Nepean River County Council is in Picton. The Berrima County Council is in Bowral. The Shoalhaven County Council is in Nowra. The State Labor Party in New South Wales, with its steamroller tactics, with its gauleiter approach to local governmentMr John Brown-The saviour of local government.",83
305,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT,"It is temporarily in government in New South Wales. The New South Wales State Labor Party, with its steamroller approach, not caring for the wishes of the residents, has imposed its will on the people as is the normal style of that kind of centralist organisation-the people will be able to express their view at the next opportunity-and has forced the amalgamation of these councils. Some people might say that it is a great thing, that it will make for greater efficiency. The facts are that that is not so; it will not lead to greater efficiency. In the case of all the county councils in my electorate, it will lead to higher costs because they will be forced to amalgamate with councils with higher rate structures to the disadvantage of my constituents. But, even more serious, there are small areas Uke Picton in my electorate where the removal of the county countil to Parramatta, of all places-and what a curious place to move it towill mean the removal of jobs from a decentraUsed area to a city area. We all know that the Labor Government in New South Wales hates decentralised areas, does not like the bush and wants to kick the guts of the people in Picton. Let me quote from a recent issue of the Illawarra Mercury, a paper which the Labor Party appears to love because it quotes it so frequently. An article in this newspaper states: More than 100 jobs are expected to be transferred out of the town-that is, the town of Picton-whe n the Nepean River district is swallowed up by Prospect County Council and the transfer will cause other businesses in the town off staff. Picton's Chamber of Commerce President Mr Hilton Middleton yesterday said the State Government seemed determined to go ahead with amalgamation, despite the affect it would have on the economies of many regional centres such as Picton. Mr Middleton said protests from people of all political persuasions had fallen on deaf ears in the Government. As I understand it, in Sydney there was the most intriguing little Caucus fight where some qf the most disgraceful trade-offs were involved in getting this proposal steamrolled through the Caucus. The article continues: ' Amalgamation is a tragedy for Picton', he said. 'Institutions like the County Council are vital to the economies of regional centres and amalgamation is the opposite of the decentralisation the State needs'. I totally agree with the points that Mr Middleton has made. In this regard I have received a letter from a constituent who writes: About a month ago a group, including myself, from the lower ranks of the Nepean River County Council staff formed an action committee to fight the State Government's plans to amalgamate the County Councils on the Eastern seaboard. This little organisation that we call Consumers Against Amalgamation represents people from both sides of the political fence . . . I am not trying to push only one political barrow; I am trying to push for a fair deal for the people of my electorate. I am pushing for a fair deal for the people in small, decentralised towns. I am pushing for a fair deal for employment in Picton, in Bowral and in Nowra. When I hear members of the Labor Party get up and complain about unemployment in those areas, I put the finger on where the blame really lies.",84
306,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT," I will not take very long. I now have a copy of the letter circulated to the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission by His Honour Mr Justice Staples. I am concerned that the Press has either deliberately misquoted or has been misled into misquoting that part of the letter which some newspapers say mentions Hitlerite Germany and which others say uses the term Nazi Germany. No such expression appears anywhere in His Honour's letter. The letter says this: Whether or not the jurisdiction is left in our hands by the High Coun, which of us in any event would want to be like the judges in pre-war Germany who simply acted out their office in a train of events that culminated in legal conclusions that 'Jews' and 'Communists' were no longer full citizens entitled torelyonrightspreviously accumulated, that is to say, were persons who could be struck down by a mere executive act. Those remarks which talked about the position that the judges would be placed in were the only remarks anywhere in this letter on which the to lay Press, or whoever handed out a copy of the letter or alleged extracts from the letter to the Press, could have based its reports. But in order to get the worse possible public relations effect of the letter the term 'Hitlerite Germany' was used in one case and in most cases the term 'Nazi Germany' was used. One after the other the newspapers said that Mr Justice Staples likened the legislation to Nazi Germany. The situation was entirely different.",84
307,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,That is what he did.,84
308,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"He did nothing of the kind. That is why I wish to have the letter incorporated in Hansard. I hope that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) will give me leave. I am sorry that I have not had time to show him the letter but I think that he knows what it is all about. I seek leave to incorporate the letter in Hansard so that honourable members can read it and form their own view as to whether the judge has been misreported. Quite clearly, there was an intent to set him up. It backfired and I am glad it did. Leave granted. The letter read asfoUowsNA NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1979 I circulate to members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission some comments on the proposed amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act introduced into the House of Representatives by the Minister for Industrial Relations on Thursday, 20 September 1979. 1. The amendments have been produced under conditions of secrecy not appropriate in a law-makingfieldin which the prime concern is and should remain the conciliation of conflicting interests. It appears that the Department of Industrial Relations played no part in the drafting of the amendments, that no member of this Commission was consulted and no trade union or employer or peak councilrepresentingemployees or employers was consulted. The Minister, in his second reading speech claimed that the ""initial proposals"" (but not, apparently, the final proposals) were shown to some persons present at the National Labour Consultative Council, but he admits that no trade unionrepresentativeswere present at that meeting. He does not claim that those ""initial proposals"" were forwarded to the trade union representatives who were entitled to be at the meeting, or left in the possession of the employers' representatives present. He does not claim that the final proposals were shown to any member of the National Labour Consultative Council or to the Council as a whole. Nor does he offer any reason for his failure to take the final proposals to the Council before their introduction into the legislative process. Urgency, if it is ever an excuse for hasty legislating, not a factor discernible here. Considerations of courtesy to this Commission warranted consultation with ourselves if only because the amendments can be construed by uncharitable minds as insulting to the integrity of the Commission as a whole and to cenain particular members of it whose decisions are part of the background of the proposed changes. Some notice of the ""initial proposals"" was given to members of the Government parties some weeks ago under conditions of privacy and confidentiality. Persons privy to this disclosure were not permitted to retain the text distributed. Each was required to surrender the same before leaving the place of meeting. ""The Government (was) keeping the legislation under tight wraps. Copies were collected at the end of Tuesday night's meeting and backbenchers were asked to regard the briefing as confidential."" (Age, 31 August 1979). Law making by these methods is antipathetic to the best procedures open to be pursued in a democratic socity. They deny the search for consensus and the accommodation of conflicting interests. Laws made in such circumstances are not likely to gather up broad assent andrespectwhich it may be desired to put in place of the temptation to resort to force. 2. Lawreformis often proposed on two grounds: Firstly, it may have the purpose to restate in more concrete and substantive manner values which are not obtaining expression in the decisions of persons, judges or administrators. So, a rule must be stated or restated so that its intendment may not be avoided in its application in particular cases. Secondly, law reform is often directed to procedural questions. Most commonly, procedural changes are proposed so as to simplify and expedite, with a reduction in cost, delay and complexity, the trial of issues of Chambers, fact and law. Proceduralreformsset the quality and imLaw Courts Building port of the substantive rules of law. It has been said that Queens Square 'the substantive law is secreted in the interstices of Sydney, 2000 procedure'. 28 September 1979 Measured by these considerations the present Bill is not reform: it isreaction.It introduces complexity and delay. It is not argued that the procedural changes arerequiredin order to achieve expedition and economy in the trial of issues. Such a contention would fall before a timeconsuming, cost-incurring, delay-provoking system of resorting to Full Benches on issues which have hitherto been dealt with by one person under the sanction of an appeal procedure, (which is now in practice to be broadly removed with all its benefits taken away). The denial of the right of appeal is a step backwards. I take the liberty ofreproducingwhat I wrote in a recent Full Bench decision: 'Institutions such as ours, however, should be structured so as not to afford even the appearance of arbitrariness of judgment, fickleness of decision or other waywardness. That is why an appeal tribunal is put here behind the arbitrator within reach of a dissatisfied party. Law systems that do not provide opportunities for appeal invite suspicion. Thus, the existence of the opportunity to appeal may serve fromtimetotimeto condition the manner and the terms in which a decision is brought down. The presence of an appeal tribunal gives confidence to parties to enter into a procedure having a bindingresult.A decision is more authoritative if it has been confirmed on appeal; it may sometimes fetch authority precisely because it has not been appealed.' (B.W.I.U. and the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, 11 May 1979-PrintE39.) 3. The Bill proposes torequireCommissioners to consult is with Presidential members m certain circumstances, in a smoke-filled backroom,as it were, to deal with the interests of absent parties. In every sense this proposal deprecates the competence and integrity of Commissioners. They are directed to submit their will and their judgment in the discharge of an office (in which they have given their oath 'faithfully and impartially to perform the duties of that office') to the overriding determination of another. The evil of this proposal is that it can only shake the confidence of parties before a Commissioner in the integrity of any ruling to which he ultimately puts his hand. No party knowing that a Commissioner reserves his decision and submits it to another can have sure confidence that he will report each pany's case accurately to the Presidential member or that the Presidential member will accurately understand that party's case. The understanding may be conditioned by the manner in which the Commissioner seesfit,in all good faith, to present it. The Minister justifies this astonishing departure from established standards of behaviour by claiming that there is a complex range of awards and agreements within the jurisdiction of the Commission. He argues that 'this very fact demands consistency of principle and decision making . . . there have been some occasions when such consistency has been lacking.' One is entitled to wonder when it came about that identical dollar sums alone may manifest consistency of principle and why a discrepancy in dollar sums manifests a want of principle. What is the principle that the Minister contends for? Is it lock-step mechanical judgment in the face of all the circumstances of a case? Is the only decision correct which comes first in time? Is the only decision correct which makes the most modest draft upon the resources of an employer? Is it right that a matter beresolvednot by reference to its own facts but by force of other facts established by other persons between other parties? What do we have an appeal procedure for? No person need fear that I will deal with the interests of parties whom I have not heard in open court I will prefer to be a member of a panel of one or, if this is not convenient, to require that any consultation take place in open court with the parties present by way of a rehearing. I would do this acting out the values expressed by the Privy Council in the Boilermakers' Case 95 C.L.R. 529 & 544: 'The same qualities of fairness, patience and courtesy should be exhibited by conciliator, arbitrator or judge alike . . . none of them should act without hearing both sides of the case.' It would be inconceivable that the community would tolerate judges acting in the manner enjoined of Commissioners and Presidential members by the Bill. 4. Clause 6 of the Bill deals with stand-downs. It sanctions one of the great evils that beset the judicial process from time to time, namely, the manoeuvring of parties to select the judge of their cause. Where an applicant for a stand-down finds success in doubt he may have another coun as of right (even after a matter has been reserved for decision) and thereby not only does he shed one judge but he deprives his opponent of a right of appeal against the decision taken at first instance. Moreover, an exercise expressed to be directed to expedition is thereby beset with delay. Further, the second court is permitted to take short cuts without the consent of the parties by havingregardto evidence given and arguments adduced in the previous attempt at a trial atfirstinstance. 5. Time lost through industrial action. The Minister in his second reading speech described his amendments in terms of'time lost' and 'industrial action'. It is to be noted that 'industrial action' embraces conduct not involving a strike, e.g. bans. Such bans do not necessarily involve any loss of working time. Nonetheless they may attract the amendment. To the extent that the Minister adopted the phrase 'dme lost' he has not stated accurately what is embraced by the proposal, which is directed to claims in respect of a period during which the employees are engaged in 'industrial action'. This need not necessarily have involved the loss of time as in a strike. The claim may arise in a period in which work was done. The Minister seeks to enrich employers by saving them from paying for what is done. This amendment seeks to defeat the common law and to deny employees access to this Commission in the interest of employers. It can only serve to depreciate the status of this Commission in the eyes of the millions of employees who contribute by their (axes to its support, for it is proposed to forbid members of the Commission to attempt to prevent and settle by conciliation and arbitration industrial disputes. It occurs under the same speech in which the Minister complains that some unions have failed to bring their disputes to the commission and have 'rejected the proper processes for settling their disputes'. Yet here there is a denial of all process for settling a dispute. Other members of the Commission have mentioned to me cases in which they have given decisions which they believe would be caught by the amendment. I wish to add to the count a ruling I gave in a dispute between the Union of Postal Clerks and Telegraphists and the Australian Postal Commission on 26 April 1979 (Print D9961)-a ruling which provoked a certain displeasure in high places at the time. It was a 'no work no pay' case. In the particular case an employee had carried out 99.999 per cent of his duties, omitting one of trifling significance as a work task but of monstrous impon to the bureaucratic mind, for by reason of a union ban he had declined to sign a document which was otherwise authentic, complete and accurate, lacking merely his mark. He had performed in every otherrespecthis duties faithfully and well but for none of it would the employer pay him. It was plain to me that the employer hadrequestedimplicitly, if not explicitly, the doing of the work for which it would not pay. Inter alia, I had this to say on the 'work-on but no pay' principle: 'My understanding of the law and the position is perfectly clear. A servant has certain entitlements ofhis master and he has cenain duties towards his master. If the contract of employmentrequiresof the servant that he should perform cenain duties then arefusalby the servant to perform those duties provides an option to the employer. Where a servant declines to perform a task within the duties contemplated by the contract of service the employer may treat the contract as being at an end. It is voidable at his option; he may, if he wishes, dismiss the servant; he may, if he wishes, ignore therefusal.But he is not entitled to take the benefit of services rendered by the employee, by the servant, without paying a fair price for them. It may be that the price that is deemed fair and which ought to be paid by the master to his servant for such services as the master accepts, explicitly or implicitly, from the servant ought not to beremuneratedby reference to the amount due if the service that isrefusedwere given and taken into account. In other words, a fair price for the service that isrenderedby the servant may not be one that is determined by reference to the wage due in the ordinary circumstance, but it does not follow that a fair wage for services that are offered and accepted may berefusedout of hand. The master is under a duty to pay for what he accepts from his servant. The master, however, has another resort and that is to sue the servant for damages if he declines to dismiss him, and he may recover damages from the servant simply for the mere refusal to carry out the full intent of the bargain. The mere breach of the contract gives rise immediately to a right to nominal damages arising from the fact of the breach. Whether the master is entitled to recover damages that are not nominal but, indeed, are substantive is a question that needs to be determined byreferenceto the loss suffered by the master as theresultofthe breach. In the present case the position taken by Australia Post is' We will accept the servant and we are accepting the service*. Indeed, it has been represented to me that they actually threatened someone against withdrawing service, or more accurately, perhaps,requiredof that person that he should actually continue to render service and not go home, although he was on no pay. It is not conceivable to me that any authority can be found in the common law which will support a result that the Postal Commission is entitled to take the services without payment on the facts that I have been dealing with here. The Postal Commission, one would have thought, consistent with its being a creature of statute law would at least seek to justify its position by argument about the consequences of the common law rules. Howrver, here they seek to evade the obligations that may appear to be cast upon them by the common law by arguing that in this tribunal there is no jurisdiction to deal with the matter, and further they put that the employee if dissatisfied can take them to law in another place. Let me just put the position this community has a duty to adhere to the rules of law and has no privilege to escape his obligations by reason merely that he has not been ordered by a court to carry out that which the law prescribes, just as I have a duty to conform to the rules of law as I understand them to be and am bound to do my best to carry them out without the command of a court. In my view the Australian Postal Commission, being a creature of the parliament, is acting inconsistently with the public's interest in the upholding of the law if they decline to act out the rules of law of their own volition and sit pat waiting until someone sues them in a court properly vested with the jurisdiction to make the orders appropriate in the circumstances. People should volunteer to obey the law, the Australian Postal Commission should volunteer to obey the law, and the law includes not only the statutes but the rules of common law; in this case, contrary to what one would expect of a great statutory corporation, we find people sitting pat and asking others not nearly as equally placed as they are to call on the courts in their aid if they have a complaint. Not only in my view is the Postal Commission at law misconducting itself on the factsrevealedto me, but they are misconducting themselves in that they are seeking to impose a situation of total inequality upon their employees. In my view, the proper position for Australia Post to take up at this time is to pay the employees and then sue the employees at law if Australia Post feel the law is on its side. The resources available to Australia Post to conduct litigation on its own initiative are the resources of ordinary employees, and if the law is on its side and it is justified in pursuing the line of conduct it would lead to the consequence that Australia Post should do the right thing and pay these people for the work taken from them, and if it feels it has suffered a loss that goes beyond nominal damages, it can sue to recover the losses.' 6. It is proposed in Clause 8 to empower the President to take a matter out of the hands of a member of the Commission which is actively before him if he is of the opinion that there are 'special reasons' tojustify his so doing. What considerations, one is entitled to ask, constitute 'special reasons'. A definition would Nothing is more calculated to strike at the independence and authority of any member of the Commission than that he be under threat of becoming disentitled to act if he does not please. By what corridor of power may complainants hope to reach the ear of the President and to induce him to defrock a colleague? What pressures may we expect to be brought against a recalcitrant President if he fails to respond to insinuations, subtle or overt, against one judge in favour of another? How will the President satisfy himself that there are 'special reasons'? With whom is he to consult? With the parties? Severally, or altogether, or shall strangers be consulted? Or shall the President be left to act with all the appearance of caprice? The power toremovea matter before a member of the Commission from his hands falls somewhere near a power already in the Act (s. 23 (3)), under which Presidential members may allocate work to members of the panel who are bound to comply with the directions of the Presidential member. There is no basis for concluding that the power of a Presidential member to organise and allocate the work of a member of his panel permits what is here proposed. I had occasion, not so long ago, to give a direction to a member of my panel not to take any step in a matter which had been previously under his active attention, and which came before me in his absence. My direction gave rise to certain misunderstandings. as I see it. Every citizen in The member of my panel affected was away on vacation when a matter was notified to me and was urgent. When it was last before my colleague certain recommendations he had made had been rejected. The matter had been stood over generally. When it blew up again, I conferred privately with the parties. I gained a strong impression that a manoeuvre was on foot, notwithstanding the urgency of the matter and the absence of my colleague, to delay a further hearing in the Commission until he returned and became available. I had the strong impression that this manoeuvre was founded on two considerations-firstly , to ensure that I did not hear the matter and secondly, to ensure that my colleague did. To put a short word on what I believed to be going on, some persons were intent on selecting the judge of their cause. I gave the direction, of which I immediately informed the parties, without explanation, in order to make it perfectly plain that I would not permit it to appear that outsiders could influence the procedures of this Commission. Whether the particular means I chose to quash the ambitions that I detected were politic is a matter that others may question. It was not my purpose to act against my colleague's stature, rather to uphold his and mine and the independence of the Commission. This amendment strikes at the concept of judicial independence. Moreover, the amendment curtails a provision in the Act which is intended to serve the interest that justice shall appear to be done. Section 22 provides that where a member of the Commission has exercised powers with respect to conciliation he shall not participate in an arbitration, if there is an objection. are infinitely greater than Under this proposal the President is free to attempt a conciliation and thereafter to impose an arbitration at his will. So much for the spirit of s. 22 (2). 7. It is proposed in Clause 16 to empower a Full Bench to makerelevantdeclaration where it is satisfied that two persons have been in the past engaged in industrial acnon (e.g. a ban) which has had a substantial adverse effect on the welfare of part of the community. The declaration may rest upon the losses alleged to have been incurred by shareholders. Such persons are 'part of the community'. The system is not limited to present or future situations and would not be any more acceptable if it were. be peculiarly appropriate here. One of the key practices of totalitarian and authoritarian regimes is to dissolve trade unions and to put puppets in their place. This legislation provides for precisely that possibility. The amendment is framed so as to manoeuvre this Commission into providing respectability for an exercise which is essentially reactionary and under which this Commission may berenderedperfectly superfluous if it is not willing to be an instrument of the Government's will in a particular case. We have already seen a number of examples recently where the present Government's will has been declared to have been thwarted by the decisions of this Commission. So, amendments have been brought into the Act and are now proposed again for the Act in order to promote the authority of the Government over our deliberations. Under this amendment, if the Government can empower the Commission to make a declaration it can, as well, amend the law so that it may proceed without the need for our declaration. We shall be left with the power only so long as we exercise it to the pleasure of the Government. One could write a treatise on the unconstitutionality of this proposal taken as a whole. It is not a proposal to prevent and settle industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration. Its purpose is to proceed to put an end to relevant industrial action by Government harassment, oppression and expropriation. Furthermore, a choice is given to the Government either to cancel registration or to set at nought therightsof a particular employee. By stripping a man ofhis civil rights, he becomes to that extent an outlaw. It is not to the point to clothe this diminution of status 'suspension'. A man at any point of time is either within or without the law. This proposal seeks power to put a man outside the law and to do it withal by executive act. Who wishes to co-operate in Full Benches trying such applications? Whether or not the jurisdiction is left in our hands by the High Court, which of us in any event would want to be like the judges in pre-war Germany who simply acted out their office in a train of events clusions that 'Jews' and 'Communists' were no longer full citizens entitled to rely on rights previously accumulated, that is to say, were persons who could be struck down by a mere executive act. 8. I am opposed to the amendments one and all and I would wish that my colleagues were too. We shall be lesser men and women and of lesser use to the community as a whole if they become law.",84
309,Mr NEIL,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I wish to give to the House a view in relation to the Executive and the judiciary or conciliation and arbitration commissioners. It may not be the view that is always adopted in practice. I take the view that the Executive, the legislature and the judiciary should remain separate. We have a separation of powers under our constitutional system. There should be at all times a clear and guiding principle that we maintain the separation of those functions. The Executive and the legislature, although composed of persons who are elected to the Parliament, have separate functions and the judiciary has separate functions. The position of commissioners and members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission who are presidential members is one that needs to be considered especially. However, because they carry out functions that are very much analogous to those of the judiciary and because they carry out important matters of conciliation and arbitration and lay down rules which bind-at least we hope that they bind-thos e parties to the various disputes, I believe that there is for the purposes considering separation of powers no real distincexpired. tion between their position and that of the judiciary. We should re-emphasise that. The point I want to make is that I do not lieve that on matters of substantive law against procedural matters there ought to be any consultations or discussions between any of the judiciary or commissioners and members of the legislature or the Executive. I believe that that a fundamental principle. Perhaps it has been eroded at various times by practices that, understandably, have come onto the scene in the industrial relations field because of the wish of parties to try to provide the maximum amount of prior consideration of proposed amendments. But this can lead to difficulties and the types of under the misleading phrase problems which have arisen recently. I do not believe that a conciliation and arbitration commissioner, a presidential member of the Commission or a judge ought to write to a member of the legislature or the Executive-that includes the appropriate Minister-o n matters of substantive amendments to an Act. It is up to the judiciary or that culminated in legal conthe Commission to take the laws as they are amended and to interpret them in accordance with their office. I do not believe that the Executive should seek to contact the judiciary or the Commission in respect of substantive laws and tell them what it believes should be an approach to those laws. Procedural matters are different. One would J. F. Staples, not suggest that matters such as delays in court Deputy President proceedings or how to ensure that the business of the court or the Commission is best conducted should be the subject of such a rule. Procedural matters obviously ought to be considered prior to their implementation to provide the smooth running of the court or the Commission. In this case procedural matters have been alluded to and the provision in the Act- I will not go into it relating to consultation was procedural. But there should not be these types of discussions on other matters. This would avoid the problems that have arisen. If Mr Justice Staples sent a copy of some criticism of substantive matters to members of Parliament, including members of the Opposition, as I understand he did, or to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Street) I do not believe that he should have done so. Those substantive matters should have simply been returned to him without any comment. Procedural matters are different but I think it is most important that we understand the basic principle.",88
310,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Mr MILLAR of Order! The honourable member's time has Mr FitzPATRICK (Riverina) (10.48)During the adjournment debate last night I referred to the great value of country newspapers. I bewas about to mention the north-south road when as I was sidetracked by someone saying that I should not retire. I believe that the New South Western Standard has every justification in reviving interest in the north-south road. The is honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) and I have raised this matter in this House on several occasions. Recently, members of the Broken Hill City Council, the secretary of the Barrier Industrial Council, Mr Fred Smith, and others have asked me to raise the matter in the House once again. I inform the House that interest was first taken in the north-south road when a picture was taken by an out-of-course satellite in its dying days. This was during the greatest inland flood in living memory in 1974. At that time the inland of Australia had been deluged by rain and the inland road system was impassable to traffic. All roads to the east were cut by flooding in the Channel country. The low roads south from Alice Springs were a quagmire. The route of the proposed north-south road follows the high ridge of land dividing the two great drainage basins of this continent, the Lake Eyre and Murray-Darling Basins, and continues along the eastern edge of Lake Eyre connecting with Sturt's Stony Desert. The satellite picture showed that the route was flood free even in the record flood. It not only showed the proposed route to befloodfree, but also showed it to be the most direct route to the north from the populated east of Australia. Much of the proposed highway is already in existence. From the south, from Melbourne through Mildura to Broken Hill the road is fully sealed. To the north, Darwin is already linked by a sealed highway through Tennant Creek, Mount Isa and Boulia. The portion of the road we are worried about is from Boulia through to Tibooburra. This portion has not been constructed. The Committee asks that the Army do a survey of this road. I think it is important that this road survey be carried out at this time. The debate last week on roads pointed out the value of road work to employment. We were told that 75 per cent of the cost of road work goes to labour. Soil tests have been taken of tfus road which show that the material is already there. One can see the great advantage now of investigating this road further. It has caught the imagination of all of the people in the area who have had a look at this road. I think it is up to the Government at least to say that it will put the Army into do survey. I believe that during the period of the Labor Government the Army stated that it was anxious to make this survey and I believe it still would be. I ask the Government to give further consider that ation to this road and to remember that it is great benefit to Australia's tourism, beef roads, agriculture, natural gas line servicing, et cetera. Australians would be able to travel and explore the interior of their own land. Darwin would be isolated duringfloodperiods and it would become a greater consumer of goods from the south and possibly a port for overseas goods for the inland. I ask the Government to take an interest in this road once again because I think there are great benefits to be derived for Australia.",88
311,Mr YATES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I was delighted this evening to receive from the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) a full copy of the letter by Mr Justice Staples, Deputy President of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission, about the Government's proposed changes to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act. On page 4 of his letter appears a statement which I think honourable members will be most interested to hear. It reads: The Bill proposes to require Commissioners to consult with Presidential members in certain circumstances, in a smoke-filled back room, as it were, to deal with the interests of absent parties. In every sense this proposal deprecates the competence and integrity of Commissioners. They areI suppose in this smoke-filled back roomdirected to submit their will and their judgment in the discharge of an office (in which they have given their oath 'faithfully and impartially to perform the duties of that office') to the overriding determination of another. I never read anything of that sort in the Bill. I wonder whether this is written by a man of the law or a politician? I am amazed that the honourable member for Hindmarsh could be so affronted. In his wind-up, Mr Justice Staples stated: Whether or not the jurisdiction is left in our hands by the High Coun, which of us in any event would want to be like the judges in pre-war Germany who simply acted out their office in a train of events that culminated in legal conclusions that 'Jews' and 'Communists' were no longer full citizens entitled to rely onrightspreviously accumulated, that is to say, were persons who could be struck down by a mere executive act. I think the media, for the first time, were quite right. I am amazed to find an occasion when one would really think that the media were perfecdy fair. What were judges in pre-war Germany? Were they some sort of saintly organisation? I thought that in pre-war Germany the nazi this government was in full power. What is the Opposition complaining of? I am amazed to think that the honourable member for Hindmarsh could be so sensitive. I would say that Mr Justice Staples has stated his view quite clearly. What he does not like is any action of this Parliament to decide we should reinforce the Conciliation and Arof bitration Act to protect the members of smaller unions and give job security. My own electors do not care about what goes on in this high fandango of arbitration. They want job security. not They are saying: 'Does the legislation of the Government give me more chance of job security or not?' The perfect answer is that it will. What is more, the Opposition has not woken up to this fact-the electorate knows it will increase job security. This honourable justice has complained that the Government is going to strengthen the powers of the President of the Commission. What is wrong with that? Does the Opposition object to that? Why has it not said so? If the Act asks a Commissioner to consult with the President, does that mean to say that when he has consulted the President he will say to the two parties",89
312,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Mr M ill a r ) Order! The honourable member is not entitled to canvass the contents of a question that has previously been before the House or is scheduled for the attention of the House. His remarks in the main were acceptable but he is now proceeding to debate the contents of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. If he continues to do so he will be out of order.,90
313,Mr YATES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you have probably run me out of time. I say quite frankly that this proposition put before us by the honourable member for Hindmarsh does not stand up to any examination by any honourable member of parliament. The honourable member for Hindmarsh is greatly mistaken. The letter I have read is political pamphleteering and I cannot see that it has any justification whatever.",90
314,Mr LEO MCLEAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," This evening I bring to the attention of the House the plight of the Canterbury Community Youth Support Scheme. Today I received advice from the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner), that that scheme had received $26,616 for the half-year program this year. That amount is a reduction of 10 per cent on the grant that that scheme received last year. In real terms it is a reduction of about 20 per cent. When one considers that this Canterbury scheme is a most successful multilingual, multicultural scheme-probabl y one of the most successful schemes in the metropolitan area of Sydney-it is a crying shame that the Minister has seen fit to provide a 10 per cent across the board reduction to it. Those running the scheme receive enough subsidy to provide three salaries. In fact, they have four part time workers-tw o Arabic speaking people and two English speaking people. In 1977-78, 960 young people went through the scheme in the Canterbury area. This month nearly 800 people under 21 years of age who are out of work are registered with the Campsie Commonwealth Employment Service office, and 30 job vacancies are registered as being unfilled. Arabic speaking people constitute 45 per cent of those who have gone through this scheme in Canterbury. I submit to the Parliament and to the Minister-unfortunatel y he has not seenfitto come into the chamber tonight even though I did ring his office to let him know I would be raising this question during the adjournment debatethat this is a special case that should receive a sympathetic hearing from the Government. There are very few community youth support schemes that have such a high ethnic content as the Canterbury one. Very few schemes have taken positive steps to ensure that the cultural and work experience of all the people in the electorate are taken care of. I submit that the Minister should reconsider his decision to reduce the Canterbury scheme funding by 10 per cent and that in view of the very good job that is being done for migrant children in the community in Canterbury in my electorate of Grayndler he should give the scheme personnel some special consideration to ensure that they can keep up the job they have been doing over the last three years and do not have to dismiss staff.",90

Annual Annual average average (4) What specific controls does his Department exercise increase increase over home-made aircraft. in GDP in GDP (5) Is there a register of these aircraft in Australia; if not, per hour per person why not worked employed (6) Will his Depanment establish a register. 4.3 4.1 Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable 9.4 9.2 member's question is as follows: 3.6 3.3 (1) Yes. 2.3 1.7 (2) and (3) It is assumed that the question is directed only to power driven aeroplanes. Air Navigation Regulations define an aeroplane as 'a power-driven heavier-than-air aircraft deriving its lift in flight chiefly from aerodynamic reactions on surfacesremainingfixedunder given conditions of flight.' Assuming 'home-made' to include those aeroplanes includingrotorcraftbuilt to a set of plans provided by the designer, or those assembled from a kit of parts, which may include some completed sub-assemblies, there are two categories of aeroplane to consider: (a) Those in the amateur built category which must comply with airworthiness requirements specified in Air Navigation Orders, and (b) those sport aeroplanes operated under exemptions specified in Air Navigation Orders. These include powered hang gliders, minimum aeroplanes and gyroplanes. Between 1 January 1975 and 18 September 1979 the following accidents were reported: NA Total accidents 2 Fatal accidents 2 (first introduced into Australia in 1976) Total accidents 0 Fatal accidents 0 (4) The Department of Transport exercises control over amateur built aeroplanes which are constructed by individuals or groups for recreational or educational purposes. An amateur built aeroplane may not have a maximum take-off weight in excess of 1,000 kg. Aeroplanes certificated in the amateur built category must comply with the airworthiness standards specified in Air Navigation Orders. These orders define the design standards applied to this class of aircraft and detail the inspections tests required for a certificate of airworthiness. Amateur category aeroplanes must be registered and must comply with the Air Navigation Regulations, in common with other registered aircraft. On 30 June 1979 there were 107 registered aeroplanes certificated in the amateur built category. There are, however, other aeroplanes and gyroplanes which may be either home built of factory produced, exempt from certain Air Navigation Regulations including those concerningregistrationand airworthiness. They are, firstly, aeroplanes having a maximum take-off weight not in excess of 180 kg and with a maximum wing loading not in excess of 19.5 kg per square metre (sometimes called minimum aeroplanes) and, secondly, gyroplanes with a maximum take-off weight not exceeding 350 kg. (5) Certificated amateur built category aeroplanes are included in the register of Australian aircraft. Minimum aeroplanes and gyroplanes are not included in theregisteras Departmental control of these types is confined to the specification of operational limitations in Air Navigation Orders to minimise third party risk. (6) It is not intended to keep a register of minimum aeroplanes or gyroplanes. Referrals from General Practitioners to Mr Moore asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 13 September 1979: (1) Do a considerable number of persons in the community receive specialist medical treatment for various chronic illnesses. (2) Are these persons required to obtain a new note of referral from a general practitioner every 12 months. (3) If so, is the patient treated as a new patient and charged a much higher fee when attending thefirstspecialist consultation after the general practitioner's referral. (4) What action will he take to alleviate the necessity of patients having to make these visits to general practitioners for referrals.",90
316,Mr HUNT,AMATEUR BUILT AEROPLANES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) Yes. Not all chronic conditionsrequirecontinuous specialist treatment. Ideally the specialist orders a course of treatment to be supervised by the patient's general 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 practitioner. 1 2 5 5 (2) Yes, if they wish to qualify for the higher rate of medi0 0 0 0 cal benefits for the charges raised by the specialist (3) The fact that a newreferralis issued after 12 months SPORT AEROPLANES does not necessarily mean that the specialist would charge an initial consultation fee which would attract the higher rate of benefit. However, where the specialist has not seen the per1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 son for a considerable period, or is commencing a new, or reassessing the current, course of treatment it would not be 0 1 5 10 unreasonable for the initial consultation fee to be charged. 0 0 4 5 (4) Because of the wide and to some extent unpredictable variations in circumstances which may arise inrelationto medical treatment, there are obvious difficulties in developing referral procedures to meet all cases. From the viewpoint of any particular individual who is fortunate enough not to require the services of a general practitioner between annual visits to a specialist, the system may be seen as involving some personal inconvenience and small added expense. From the viewpoint of efficient and economical administration of the Medical Benefits Scheme, it is a necessary safeand guard against unnecessary expenditure by the Commonbuilt wealth and by the health insurance funds. The amount of medical benefits paid for visits to general practitioners to obtain referral renewals once a year would undoubtedly be less than that involved in paying the higher rates of medical benefits for visits to specialist for attention to conditions that could be adequately cared for by general practitioners, which isregardedas being the likely result if there were no referral system or if no limit were placed on the life of referrals. This is particularlyrelevantwhere, as frequently occurs, the specialist recommends a course of treatment which can then be supervised by the general practitioner, with only occasionalreassessmentby the specialist. With some 35 million specialist services each year, of which only a small proportion relate to continuing treatment by specialists of chronic illnesses, it would be administratively impracticable to consider each individual service separately to decide whether or not a newreferralshould be required in that particular case. The only practical course is to lay down a system which is capable of uniform application. Since 1970 there have been a number of reviews of the referral system undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the Australian Medical Association. The latest review was specifically directed at the question of treatment of chronic illnesses. The outcome of each review has been the Specialists 'general consensus' that the system is necessaiy, is a good (Question No. 4619) one, and is working satisfactorily in the overall interests of the Medical Benefits Scheme.

(4) What guidelines apply to the use by private individuals or companies of the area known as Equestrian Park. (5) Do these guidelines differ from those pertaining to other pubUc places administered by his Department; if so, why. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am informed by my Department that: (1) The general principle foUowed by the Department of the Capital Territory in managing facilities and land set of aside for recreational purposes is that they should be available to as many people and uses as possible, provided the management principles are observed. If any conflicts emerge these are usually settled by conference between the user groups. member to the Ministerial State(2) (a) The charges levied are variable.

319,Mr HUNT,AMATEUR BUILT AEROPLANES,"The answer to the honourable than English. member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Australian Radiation Laboratory does prothat vide a radiation monitoring service at Nabarlek. This service is available to uranium mining companies as an extension the normal national film badge service although the severe Division temperature and humidity conditions encountered at uranium mines have required the development by the Lab(Question No. 4728) oratory of a new badge using thermoluminescent phosphors in lieu of the normal radiation sensitive film. The badges are normally worn for a period of 4 weeks and then returned to the Laboratory for processing. Total radiation exposures for the wearing period are reported to the mining company and to the Northern Territory supervisory authorities. (2) The highest exposure recorded for any individual at Nabarlek up to 14 September 1979 (when the latest series of was recalled) is 378 millirem accumulated over a 6 week period thus corresponding to an average rate of 63 millirem per week. It is difficult to provide a meaningful averagefigurefor the workforce as it is distorted by the large number of employees who wear badges but whose work does not normally take them into areas of significant radiation and whose badges accordingly indicate only a normal background level 1.9.78 1.9.79* of about 2 millirem per week. However, of those whose badges indicate exposures significantly above the normal background level the weekly rate lies within the range of 8 to 97 115 63 millirem per week with an average value of 27 millirem 64 49 per week. 39 30 Under the 1975 Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores which is cur1,289 1,243 rently in force in the Northern Territory, the maximum per1,640 1,528 mitted whole body exposure for an occupationally exposed 514 466 employee is 5,000 millirem per year or approximately 100 millirem per week. 942 1,033 1,065 977 Immigration Forms 331 320 (Question No. 4771) 1,361 1,836 Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Immi2,496 1,834 gration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 24 739 651 September 1979: 283 264 (1) Further to his amended answer to Question No. 4472 471 399 (Hansard, 25 September 1979, page 1530) concerning the 37 30 necessity for the use of the English language in incoming 1,371 1,297 passenger cards and outgoing passenger cards, is it a fact that the words 'The card must be completed in the English 12,739 12,072 language' appear on the back of each card and that the instructions are printed in the English language alone which might giveriseto an inference that no other language will be Region to understood by immigration officials.

(4) Further to the answer to part 2 of Question No. 4472, have immigration officials ever complained that passengers have in practice made their tasks difficult by the use of native scripts; if so, what were the native scripts in question and in way would the answers to questions 1 to 9 and 11 and 12 on the exit form and questions 1 to 9 and 11 and 13 on the entry form differ if they were written in a language other (5) Wili he give further consideration to the contention the insistence on the use of the English language suggests a cultural anxiety and insecurity which is not appropriof ate for a nation with 100 languages in use. (6) Would Australian travellers be (a) advantaged or (b) disadvantaged if other countries, e.g. China and Japan, require them to fill in forms in the local national language. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The passenger cards contain in English the words 'The card must be completed in the English language'. The cards are collected by Customs officers acting for my Department. They are processed by staff not recruited for multi-lingual service. Information obtained from the passenger card is used by a number of Departments. It is available also for evidentiary purposes before Courts. (2) No. It is of relevance required, all answers to questions on passenger cards are to be given in the English language. This facilitates identification and passenger clearance at ports, the subsequent handling of the documents and retrieval of data. For some time multi-lingual pamphlets were made available to travellers to assist in the preparation of passenger cards. The practice was discontinued since they were rarely made use of by passengers. (3) No. UK. practice is not necessarilyrelevantto Australian needs. (4) Passenger cards are not often presented in a language other than English. No specific record is held of the incidences where they were not. In those instances where the answers to questions are not in English passengers can be assisted, with the aid of an interpreter the card in the English language. The answers to the questions on passenger cards referred to would not differ in content if completed in native script but subsequent translation for essential purposes would be a time consuming and expensive undertaking. (5) No. (6) I am not able to comment. However, English is in very common use in countries caught up with international travel. Sex Education Lecture Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 9 October 1979: (1) Has the Government been contacted by any member of the Queensland Government in connection with a sex education lecture given to pupils at a Brisbane college by a Sydney-based art lecturer whose trip to Brisbane was apparentlyfinancedby Commonwealth Government funds. (2) If so, what assistance has the Government offered the Queensland Government for its investigation into this matter. (3) What cultural organisations are involved and what is the amount Commonwealth Government assistance each receives. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Not to my knowledge. (2) and (3) See (1) above. Foreign Fishing Vessels Mr Braithwaite asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 1 March 1979: (1) What was the number of reported intrusions into Australian waters by foreign vessels during the periods (a) 1 July 1977 to 30 June 1978 and (b) 1 July 1978 to date. (2) How many of these vessels were arrested. (3) What is the average cost to the Government for each vessel arrested in terms of detection, arrest, detention, port dues, legal processes, quarantine, cleaning and repatriation of crews to their own country. (4) What is the average total receipt for each vessel captured throughfinesand sale of vessels. (5) How many of the arrests were made (a) by naval craft and (b) from 'private charter vessels'. that, other than where a mark is Mr Nixon-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) (a) Fifty-five reports involving 150 vessels were received in 1977-78. (b) Fifty-seven reports involving 97 vessels were received between 1 July 1978 and 30 June 1979. (2) Twenty-three vessels were apprehended. (3) It has not been possible to identify every component cost to the Government for the apprehension and subsequent actions required in respect of each foreign fishing vessel found in breach of Australian fisheries law. However, the followingfiguresgive an indication of the cost that can be incurred in respect of some of the actions involved: if necessary, to complete Port dues-dependin g on the port up to $ 100 per day for each apprehended foreign fishing vessel. Legal costs-examinatio n of the consideration of matters hasrevealeda difference in average costs (Counsel's fees, travel expenses and filing fees) from one capital city to another e.g. Brisbane $206; Darwin $560; Hobart $ 157. Quarantine-averag e of $200 per each vessel. Repatriation-averag e cost per crew inrespectof apprehended Taiwanesefishingvessels has been approximately $9,500. (Question No. 4799) Arrest-averag e cost for use of Commonwealth Police has been in the vicinity of $7,400 per incident. Surveillance-primar y and secondary surveillance efforts are directed to covering the requirements of a number of departments and are co-ordinated through a centralised surveillance unit in the Department of Transport, the Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre. It is not possible to apportion costs, to any one department or to any specific incident, in this case the detection of foreign fishing vessels. (4) Fines imposed for breaches of fisheries law vary depending on the circumstances of each case. Revenue from vessel sales depends on the type of vessel, its condition and the demand for such vessels. For example,fineshave ranged from $200 in one case to $ 1,600 in another. Revenue from vessel sales has also varied from $600 for a clam boat in poor condition to $65,000 for a stern trawler. In 1977-78 $183,902 was received through fines and vessel sales and from 1 July 1978 to 31 June 1979 $86,210 was received. (5) Between 1 July 1977 and 30 June 1979, 14 vessels were apprehended by the defence forces, 8 vessels were ap(Question No. 3331) prehended by civil craft chartered by the Department of Primary Industry, and 1 vessel was apprehended as aresultof combined operations between a chartered civil vessel and a defence force vessel.

Of these services-and there are seven of them-onl y one appears to have direct relevance for the question asked: obtaining information by way of cables initiated by applicants/clients. Applicants for entry to Australia often seek expeditious processing of their applications or information on the progress of the application at overseas offices by cable communication overseas. The proposed charges are intended to recover those costs which are incurred by the Government at the initiative of the applicant. Where normal processing of an application warrants cable communication, current practice will continue: the Depanment will pay for the cable. In this context, it is usual for State or Federal Parliamentarians to seek answers, without specifying the means by which these are expedited. It is thus a matter for my Depanment to decide what information, if any, is needed from overseas and how this is to be obtained. In such circumstances, no charges would apply to parliamentary representations. Zoonoses Disease (Question No. 4611) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 13 September 1979: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the concern of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union that occupational as well as family and community health standards are threatened by the lack ofresearchinto the Zoonoses disease to which meat workers are exposed.

325,Mr HUNT,AMATEUR BUILT AEROPLANES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of this concern of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union. However the real threat to health arises from the existence of these zoonoses in our animal population rather than lack of research. The Government is therefore investing money in campaigns to eradicate brucellosis in animals thus removing the risk to human health. (2) All requests for research funding of this type are considered on their merits by the independent scientific bodies concerned. The National Health and Medical Research Council, which is the body within my portfolio, advises that no application has been received this year from the Department of Mircobiology, University of Melbourne, for the support of a project related to brucellosis, although eight other research projects are currently being supported in that Department. Sheep and Cattle Skins Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 18 September 1979: (1) What was the decrease in the number of carcasses exported during the period January to June 1979 as compared with the same 6 months in 1978. (2) Is it a fact that those countries to which Australia exported live sheep are now competing with Australia in the overseas skin trade. (3) Will he investigate the introduction of a more simple, less damaging form of identification for sheep and cattle as a means of saving more carcasses for use in the skin trade. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Statistics on export of Australian meat arerecordedas tonnages shipped, and numbers of carcasses exported are not available. Estimates of the carcase equivalent of tonnages exported are as follows: . .. . 2,663,200 . .. . 218,600 . .. . 6,228,700 . .. . 1,480,200 The decrease in the estimates of carcase equivalent of tonnages exported during the period January to June 1979 as compared with the same 6 months in 1978 are: Cattle-n o decrease. Calves-n o decrease. Sheep-800,400. Lambs-323,100. (2) It has been reported that some sheepskins derived from Australian sheep exported live to Iran are sold to other countries. (3) Sheep are normally identified as to ownership by means of ear marks or ear tattoos. I am not aware that branding of sheep is practised nor further of any related problem associated with damage to sheep skins.
