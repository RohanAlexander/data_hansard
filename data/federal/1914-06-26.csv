1,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,I ask the when it was passed? Prime Minister if he has noticed this in one of the leading Fusion newspapers of Tasmania;,11
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"An honourable member is not in order in founding a question on a newspaper statement. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Then I ask the right honourable gentleman if he has  Tasmanian Legislature, in a speech delivered on the 23rd of this month, declared that 1,250 names had been struck off the Darwin roll, 600 being names of persons enrolled for the Zeehan subdivision, and that he hoped that they would now find a man to oust this "" Yankee."" If this gentleman, who is licensed to preach, and dispenses fire and damnation once a week, glories in striking names off the roll, what does the Prime Minister think will happen with bigoted persons who are out for gore on both sides)",11
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It is obvious that such a question does not seek information on any matter within the control or cognisance of the Prime Minister. The question is out of order.,11
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I should like to reply to what the honourable member has said.,11
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"As the question is - not in order, a reply would also - be out of order.",11
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In a leading article of today's Argus, it is stated that when the Labour party abolished postal voting it provided for the lodging of 6s. with every objection. As the Prime Minister was in Parliament in. 1901, I ask him whether this provision was not in the Act passed in 1901, when only one-fifth of the House was composed of Labour members, and in the Act passed in 1905, when only one-third of the House was composed of Labour members. Does he not think that action should be taken iri regard to the vile, wilful misrepresentations of papers like the Argus J ..",11
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If I am to take action to suppress vilification, where am I to begin ?",11
8,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Star t with yourself.,11
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should have to clean the Augean stable that the honourable member referred to yesterday. Whatever party provided for.the-lodging of 5s. with each objection, the provision has been a dead letter. What does it matter",11
10,Mr TIJDOB,Unknown,Why does the Argus give us adulterated news every day? ,11
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member will find plenty of adulterated news in the Hansard reports of the speeches that have been pouring out from honourable members opposite this week. Read Brother Catts.,11
12,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Rea d Brother Cook. The honourable member can put more misrepresentation into a few words than any other man in the House.,11
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I remind the House that questions to Ministers must have reference to matters of which the Ministers have cognisance, or must relate to business of which they have charge, or to Departments oyer which .they have control. I have but a few minutes, since ruled out of order, as I have done on many previous occasions, questions framed on newspaper articles. It is certainly not proper for honourable members to continue the practice of asking such questions. NORTHERN TERRITORY. FREEZING WORKS-DAIR Y CATTLE-MR . RYLAND.",11
14,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Is the Minister.of External Affairs yet in a position to lay on the table a copy of the agreement entered into between the Government, and English capitalists relating tp the freezing works at Port Darwin ?",11
15,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I am not. I have had copies of the agreement, as accepted by me, prepared, but until I have been apprized that the contract has been signed by the attorneys of Sir ""William Vesty, I cannot lay them on the table. I expect to hear at any moment that the contract has been signed.",12
16,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"I wish to know how many dairy cattle Have been purchased by the Minister for the establishment of dairy farms in the Northern Territory) In what part of Australia were they purchased ; what was the average price paid for, and what was the average age of,",12
17,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Thes e details have not come under my notice during the last few days, but I think that about 500 cattle wore purchased in Queensland. I cannot give the prices paid, as the classes were not then determined, but I shall get the information for the honourable member, and let him have it within a few days.",12
18,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Minister, in answer to a question, stated the other day that Mr Ryland's appointment was made after the Queensland election. As his language seemed to reflect on that gentleman, I ask him whether he will be good enough to say if he thought that the result of the election had anything to do with the appointment?",12
19,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not propose to offer an opinion on the point. I cannot for a moment recollect the date of the appointment, but there was an association in what was said of the date of the appointment and the date of the election. I have made no reflection on Mr Ryland, who, from what I have seen of him, I consider an upright, straightforward man. Personally, I am sorry, as I said to him, that my official duty necessitated retrenchmentthat may have proved more or less harsh to individuals.",12
20,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"In regard to the establishment of dairy farms in the Northern Territory, has the Minister of External Affairs made any provision for cool storage in connection with the manufacture of butter? If not, does he propose to do so) . Mr Glynn - The manufacture of butter is one of the chief mings for which we have established the dairy. All necessaiy provision for a proper.dairy, including cool storage, has been made. .",12
21,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"Will the Minister of External Affairs delay the consideration .of an agreement with the Union Cool Storage Company for the establishment of freezing works in the Northern Territory until after the Royal Commission which is now inquiring into the meat industry has furnished a report? Further, _ will the Minister consider the advisability of not leasing any more land to this company until that report has been issued)",12
22,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"If I had the smallest suspicion that entering into a contract with Vesty Brothers would in any wayraise the question to which the honourable member has referred-that is the matter referred to the Royal Commission- I would not have negotiated with them; but wo have had plenty of inquiries into the project, and all the evidence is in their favour, and it is stated that they are strong opponents of the Beef Trust. In my opinion the arrangement with them has been one of the beat steps yet taken in regard to the development of the Northern Territory; and it is not only my opinion, but it is also the opinion expressed by men who are competent to give a judgment on the matter. The arrangement will mean the expenditure by Vesty Brothers of about £200,000, and not merely the minimum of £100,000, as pro' vided for in the agreement. The conditions of the agreement are fair to the Commonwealth, and we have nothing to lose by entering into it at once.. I do not propose to delay the matter, as the honourable member suggests. In fact the agreement has already been sent on for the signature of Sir William Vesty, and, in all probability it has already been signed.",12
23,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,What will be the capacity of the works?,12
24,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"They will be able to do at least 30,000 head of cattle in the season. We have made provision that at ' least a third or the whole of the works not being used by these people will be available for the other cattle-downers in the Territory. The agreement binds them down to fair charges.",12
25,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Is there sufficient cattle in the Territory?,12
26,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not think that we need be pessimistic in regard to the Northern Territory. We should not approach the problem in the spirit of pessimism. There have been no concessions of land. These people take up the land they require as holding ground under the ordinary laws in the Territory. I have set my foot down absolutely on every applibility cation made by persons who wish to material 1 establish, freezing works in the Northern Territory with the object of converting leases or permits into permanent holdsleeper purposes. ings.

I do not propose to take action without advising Parliament what I am doing.",13
29,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Has the Postare master-General any power, under the Postal Act, to prevent the steam-ship - companies trading between Melbourne and Hobart, and Sydney and Hobart, that increasing their fares and freights?",13

33,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"In the absence of the Attorney-General, I desire to ask the debated. Prime Minister, in view of a current report that the Governor General is to meet "" an enemy of the people,"" whether that refers to the Prime Minthe ' ister or to the Attorney-General ?",13
34,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,A question of that kind is not in order. RAILWAY SLEEPERS.,13
35,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Is the Honorary Minister aware that a timber called doo has been used for railway sleepers Western Australia with excellent reI sults, and will he consider the advisaof calling for offers of that",13
36,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I know that wandoo enjoys a reputation second to none for,13
37,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,It has been used in the rough in the bush.,13
38,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is, however, very to get wandoo, owing to the of the forests in which it grows, and to the size of the trees. But I shall be extremely happy to receive offers at will KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA RAILWAY . the ALLEGED VICTIMIZATION OF WOBKMEN.",13
39,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I have received a telefrom Kalgoorlie stating that the Engineer in charge of the western section the Trans-Australian railway has discharged the vice-president and three their prominent members of the Workers Further, that he refuses to reany instate them, although he admits of they are capable men, and that the only objection against them is that they agitators. Does the Prime Minister propose to allow victimization to be practised against these men ? If so, I tell the right honourable gentleman, here and now, a much bigger strike is likely to eventuate than any that has occurred in the is past. I ask a question, and give a hint",13
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,All I have to say is that I know nothing whatever about,13
41,Mr MAHON,Unknown,It is the right honourable member's business to find out.,13
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is not the honourable member's business to be impertinent.,13
43,Mr MAHOM,Unknown,You are never otherwise than impertinent.,13
44,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Question s cannot be PEARLING INDUSTRY.,13
45,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is it the intention of Government to give effect to the recommendations'Contained in the report of the Pearling Commission in so far as they relate to the prosecution of the industry in Queensland waters ?,13
46,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Shortl y after the progress report was presented, I called the wanattention of the Queensland Government into those parts which referred to that State. decided to postpone the consideration of - the whole question until after the Royal Commission had visited Broome, and I have informally informed some members of the Commission to that effect. PRIME MINISTER'S POLICY",13
47,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I should be much obliged if the right honourable the Prime Minister would be good enough to inform the House and the country when he proposes to deliver his policy speech.,14
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not know why the policy of the Government should trouble the honourable member. Has he not a dozen times said on the floor of the House that we have no policy ? COLOURED PUGILISTS.,14
49,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Will the Minister of External Affairs inform the House under what form of permit coloured pugilists are allowed to land in Australia? Is any test applied to them?,14
50,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"When coloured pugilists come into have a little play at boxing, they are under the ordinary exemption provisions, and in one case-that of Mr MCVea-the term was extended for a few. months to enable him to complete his contracts. Mr MCVea called on me, and I remember that we had a chat for ten minutes or so about Carpentier. I think that he was in Australia altogether for about two years; and when such a period as that has elapsed, and the pugilists' ordinary contracts have expired, they are expected to leave our shores. They come into Australia, as I say, under exemption, which covers, in some cases, more than six months; but, while in some instances they are engaged for a particular bout, in other cases they are here for a series of contests, and everything depends on the circumstances. If the applicant is a good fellow generally, he is allowed to remain a reasonable period. FEDERAL CAPITAL. HOUSES OF PAELIAMENT.",14
51,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Can the Honorary Minister give us any information as to the plans of the Parliament House at the Federal Capital? When are they likely to come before the Department, and when is it probable that a start will be made at clearing the ground for the building?",14
52,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I think I can safely say that the conditions of the competition will - be circulated this week, and I shall be happy to allow the honourable member to see them. RECIPROCAL TRADE: CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, AND THE SPEECH. UNIT ED STATES.",14
53,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"As this is probably the last opportunity I shall have during this Parliament to call attention to the importance of reciprocal trade arrangements with Canada and New Zealand, I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether he will keep the matter "" under his observation "" between the dissolution of this Parliament and the assembling of the next?",14
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Do not answer an insolent question like that.,14
55,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The policy of the Government is clear. The honourable member might well have directed a question to the late Labour Government, which allowed the shipping contract between Canada and Queensland to lapse, and for. eighteen months or two years he was silent under the circumstances. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Will the Minister of Trade and Customs also take into consideration the question of reciprocal trade with the United States of America, where there is a population of 103,000,000?",14
56,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to give notice of the question. POTATO INSPECTION CHARGES.,14
57,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Some time ago I asked the Minister of Trade and Customs some questions in regard to the inspection charges imposed by the State of Western Australia. I understood from the Minister that the Commonwealth Government had arranged with the Western Australian Government to have an investigation into these inspection charges on produce. Can the Minister say what has been discovered, as the result of this investigation ?",14
58,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"A letter came to hand at the end of the week stating that a conference was begun last week, but that the matter had been adjourned until a little later. I have reason to hope that the West Australian Government will be prepared to meet us in the matter reasonably.",14
59,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,I hope that you will claim for any excess that they have been charging. ELECTOR AL ROLLS.,14
60,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"In connection with the removal of names from the rolls, is it the intention of the Government to issue instructions that, from now on u n t il the date upon which the rolls close, notices of objection shall not be received from any persons but authorized State or Federal officials?",15
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No . I know nothing of such a proposal. I do not know why the honourable member keeps on asking these questions. I have never heard of such a thing in my l if e as for honourable members to pass an Act of their own, which is the secret of all this trouble - a n enactment for compulsory enrolment-and on the first occasion that it is put into operation to denounce it h i p and thigh, and declare that those who were putting it into operation are manipulating and gerrymandering the election.",15
62,Mr RILEY,Unknown,That is not the point.,15
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There is nothing else in it . Why do you pass these Acts?,15
64,Mr BURNS,Unknown,Why do you not administer them ?,15
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Precisel y the contrary is the case; wo are administering them.,15
66,Mr MAHON,Unknown,What about requiring t l i 6 5 s f^© T,15
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"All I have to say about the 5s. is that during the whole of the three years of the term of honourable members opposite there was only one 5s. fee lodged. That is the answer to all this rodomontade. Honourable members keep on asking these silliest of questions. All that is happening and causing all this outcry is that they by their Act have prevented the police officers taking round claim cards. They, by their legislation, laid upon the people of the country the obligation to enroll themselves. the people outside to understand this. It is not something that the present Government have done; it is the result of what my friends opposite have done; and we are quite unable to do what they wish us to do because they passed legislation which prevents us from doing it .",15
68,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"Seeing that the danger of permitting irresponsible and unauthorized persons to object to names on the rolls is generally recognised by both sides of the House, will the Minister of Home Affairs issue an instruction that, until the day of election, no objection to any name on the roll shall be considered unless it be lodged by an authorized State or Federal official?",15
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am afraid that the Electoral Act, for good and all, is there to stay. My honourable friend and his party would not permit us to alter it . It is their Act . The same regulations are in force now that were in force when they ran the last Federal elections.",15
70,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,We did not invite political organizations to lodge objections to names.,15
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What does that matter? It is a question, not of lodging objections, but of whether you can trust the officials of the Department to deal fair l y with those objections.",15
72,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"They are submerged with the objections of unauthorized persons. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I do not know what the honourable member desires me to do. If he will state precisely what he wants, I shall answer him. I have only to say that the Act, and the regulations, and the officers, are those of the Labour party, and that it is useless for them to complain.",15
73,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,But the speech by the Attorney-General ,15
74,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order 1,15
75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not know about the speech by the Attorney-General ; but will my honourable friends be satisfied if I undertake to chain him up for twenty-four hours?,15
76,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"No . . Mr HUGHES - In this morning's paper it is stated that the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs in another place had said that lists of those persons who had been struck off the rolls would be displayed in the various postI wish offices after the issue of the writs. I do not know whether that is a misstatement of what the honourable gentleman said, but it is obvious that the display of lists at such a time would be of no service. Will the Prime Minister look into this matter? If the lists are to be displayed at all, thej must be displayed before the last opportunity has passed for persons to get on the rolls. It may be that the honourable gentleman was misreported.",15
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I will look into the matter. I think this list will be extremely valuable, even if it is displayed after the issue of the writs. I admit that it would be more valuable if it were displayed before the issue of the writs, and if that can be done it will be done. My own idea is that if any person's name is struck off, that person should be able to know as soon as possible.",15
78,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,It is no good displaying the list when it is too late for the people struck off to get on the roll.,16
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Oh , yes, it is. It will, at any rate, prevent people from voting in districts where they are disqualified. I want to repeat to honourable members that these lists are open every day for any one to see if he will go to the Electoral Office. If honourable members can suggest what more I can do, I .will be pleased to do it.",16
80,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Honorary Minister whether those people who have changed their place of address, but are still residing in the same subdivision, .will be debarred from exercising the franchise at the forthcoming election?",16
81,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I ask my honourable friend to give notice of that question. PUNISHMENT OF CADETS. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.,16
82,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question without notice.,16
83,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I bet that you will get a better answer.,16
84,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,I am asking in a polite and friendly way. I would like to know whether the Government have come to any decision yet with regard to the infliction of solitary confinement on defaulting trainees?,16
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Her e is another instance of the same thing-in augurated under the never-was-such-anadministration of the previous Defence Minister.,16
86,Mr RILEY,Unknown,There was not one trainee put into solitary confinement during our time.,16
87,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,We never put one into solitary confinement.,16
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Oh yes, you did. You both instituted the system and put the trainees under it . I have never believed in solitary confinement for boys, and I do not now; but it is not so easy just to know what to do with recalcitrant boys. We are inquiring into the whole question to see whether we can get some other system.",16
89,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,That will do for a cry on which to go to the elections.,16
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Her e is another of those sinister gibes. We are not going to put any more boys under that solitary confinement that honourable members created.,16
91,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question in a nice, kindly, and polite manner.",16
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If I were in your place, I would stop asking questions. They are all about your own regulations.",16
93,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I wish youwould not let the right honourable gentleman speak to me like that. I am asking him a question very nicely. I ask him whether he will kindly tell me what regulation enables the Government to impose solitary confinement? Is there any regulation?",16
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am unable to point out the regulation. I know the fact, and that is quite sufficient. I know the fact that solitary confinement was set up by Senator Pearce, and if there was no regulation",16
95,Mr KELLY,Unknown,There was.,16
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,If there was no regulation so much* the worse for the action of the Labour Administration.,16
97,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Will the Honorary Minister either give to the House, or make public through the press, the date upon which the first cadet was put into solitary confinement, and also that of any regulation issued by the late Minister of Defence in reference to solitary confinement?",16
98,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes . I may inform the honourable gentleman that there is a regulation in force dealing with solitary confinement, and it was .put into force by the late Minister of Defence. I can obtain a copy for the honourable member almost immediately. I had it in my hands the other day, and I think I gave the number to the House at the time. If the honourable member desires it to be published, of course it will be published. But he must take the responsibility for it, just as this Government will take the responsibility for terminating that form of punishment.",16
99,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"As the present Government are going to take the responsibility for terminating that punishment, I hope they will also take the responsibility for keeping it in operation for the last twelve months.",16
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We are always loth to interfere with anything that our predecessors did, and it was only on finding out how bad and reprehensible that regulation was, that we decided to abolish it.",17
101,Mr AETHUR,Unknown,"Will the Honorary Minister state what was the first instance in which that regulation was put into operation, and the name of the cadet to whom it was first applied?",17
102,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Obviousl y a question'of that kind is one of which notice should be given, and I do warmly congratulate my honourable friends opposite upon the discretion they show in asking questions of this nature when it is too late for us to ask them to place their questions upon the notice-paper, and confound them with the information they require.",17
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I will see if I can get the information for the honourable member. PAPUAN OIL FIELDS.,17
104,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Will the Minister of External Affairs be good enough to make a statement as to the boring operations for oil in Papua, and also as to the terms of the agreement under which Dr Wade was brought from England? Will the honourable gentleman state whether he was brought out by the Government .to advise as to the boring operations or to advise merely as to the oil possibilities of the Territory?",17
105,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"An agreement was entered into with Dr Wade and with an assistant of his - which, I think, will expire about August next. His duties are to"" examine the existing oil fields on which discoveries have been made and on which boring operations have begun, as well as any other likely shows, and also to prepare a geological map. I understand that there are very great risks in the selection of sites, and that a geological map is very necessary. Before Dr Wade came out I went into the matter with Mr . Grebin, the oil expert in the Department, who explained the whole subject to me, and I was somewhat seized of the significance of the appointment. There - are now three parties at work on the oil fields. One party is developing a new bore put down, on the advice of Dr Wade, at the site, approximately, of what is known as Lock's previous bore. Another party is engaged, on the other side of the Vailala River, in putting down a second bore, under the direction of Dr Wade. The third party, working under Dr Wade himself, is carrying out a geological survey. Dr Wade also advised us as to a harbour, and with his advice, in conjunction with that given by the officers placed at our disosal by the Navy- I have to publicly acnowledge the good work done by them- we have been able to find a site for a harbour much better for our purposes than the one on Yule Island. COMMONWEALTH BANK.",17
106,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I understood the Treasurer to say yesterday that he had written to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank in reference to a certain loan from that institution. I desire to know whether the Treasurer has written, and, if so, whether his letter does not amount to an interference with the Governor of the bank, which interference may result in a complaint by the Governor that he is being interfered with by members of Parliament ?",17
107,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I do not know where the honourable member got his information, but he seems to have got it from a source that is somewhat reliable.",17
108,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I got it from you yesterday, when you said that you had written to the Governor of the bank.",17
109,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I did ask the Governor of the bank whether the statement was accurate that he had pledged the credit of the country in connection with some mining development prospectus. I said I thought I was justified in asking that question, be-cause the Commonwealth was responsible for the safety of the investments made by the Governor. The reply I received from the Governor, Mr Miller, was to the effect that he could assure me that in anything he had done-h e did not say what it was-the bank was amply secured. There the matter rests at the present moment.",17
110,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"When the Treasurer receives a reply from the Governor of the bank, will he publish it in the prGss ?",17
111,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I have just stated that I have received a reply, and I gave the terms of it .",17
112,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Has the Governor underwritten that loan?,17
113,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,H did not say.,18
114,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"That is what we want to know,",18
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Governor the bank will not give the information. The members on your side say it is interference to ask for it.,18
116,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I may explain that, previous to the wire being sent in my name, as Treasurer, the Secrea tary to the Treasury telegraphed to the years?"" Governor of the bank stating that a tion had been asked in this House, and requesting the Governor of the bank to say if the statement wasaccurate. The Governor of the bank replied that he reare fused to give any information. In reply to my telegram- I think the two telegrams must have crossed- Mr Miller as a sured me, as Treasurer, that the bank was amply secured in anything he had statement. done. That was yesterday. I have done nothing further since.",18
117,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"In case there should be any 'doubt in the mind of the Treasurer, who said he did not know where I got my information from, but no doubt I gotj it from a sound source, I desire to explain that I have had no communicaGeneral tion whatever with any official connected with the Commonwealth Bank. My quesbeen tion was asked merely out of a desire to ment ? get information as to the statement made by the Treasurer the other day, when said that he proposed to write to the matter looked into. Governor of the bank.

118,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Has the Treasurer any information to give the House in reinstructions ference to the Commonwealth Bank and the profits which it may make during the current half-year ?,18

120,Mr BAMEORD,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation in reference to a sentence which appears in this morning's Argus concerning myself. The sentence readsMr Bamford, n Labour member, said recently that the rolls were so bad that it would States. take two years to purify them, which is., strong, testimony from that side.

131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [5.21] - I promised the honourable members for Yarra and Bendigo to obtain information regarding the so called solitary confinement of cadets. The confinement of the cadets is not solitary confinement in the ordinary sense of the term.,20
132,Mr ARTHUR,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,The right honourable gentleman means that it is not like the solitary confinement undergone by prisoners in gaols.,20
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,That is so. The cadets are confined in fortresses.,20
134,Mr HMOS,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,A boy who is confined by himself in a room undergoes solitary confinement.,20
135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"I am not defending what has been done; I merely suggest that the punishment has not been so bad as might be thought from the ordinary acceptation of the term ""solitary confinement."" The lads have been fed well, and well looked after. I have ascertained that the Defence Act provides for the detention of cadets in some place of l and confinement to compel them to undergo their drill, and for the purpose of. punishing them, and the late Government selected the fortresses as suitable places.",20
136,Mr TUDOR,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,Instea d of the gaols?,20
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,Yes .,20
138,Mr FISHER,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,But not the particular premises in which cadets have been confined.,20
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"The cadets in certain cases have been confined in cells. - I do not wish to understate the punishment-and have been detained in solitary confinement. There is before me a list of four cases which were dealt with before this Government took office. Cadets Green and Fells were committed on the 9th June, 1913, for one day only. They belonged to the Fourth Military District. Cadet Philipson was committed on the same date for two days, and at some time earlier a boy named Yeo was committed at Broken Hill . All these cases occurred before we took office. We have carried on the system that was already in operation. As I said this morning, I do not wish to make political capital out of this matter, and honourable members ought not to try to do so. In my opinion, a wrong course has been taken, but mistakes will occur in the best regulated establishments, and the only thing we can do is to discover them, and remedy them. We are having the whole system inquired into. It must be remembered that something must be done with recalcitrant boys, because discipline must be maintained. If one lad is allowed to do as he pleases, it is not likely that eighty or ninety other full-blooded boys will submit to discipline, knowing that the authorities may be defied with impunity. That has to be provided against. But the harsh treatment of the boys should cease. Honourable members may take my word for it that there will be no more solitary confinement for cadets. We have come now to the end of this Parliament, which is unique in many ways. For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, the whole Parliament is to be dissolved, and to make an appeal to the country with every interest and every issue thrown into the scale. For the first time we shall have what, I hope, will be a really democratic appoal to that great tribunal-the people. Whatever may happen in the coming campaign, I trust that we shall not lose our respect for each other. There will be hard hitting-that is inseparable from any conflict of the kind-bu t I hope that we shall be able to shape the issues and keep them before the people in such a way that an intelligent verdict may be recorded concerning them. That is much more important than some may imagine. Our Constitution is on its trial.",20
140,Mr MCDONALD,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"And Governor General are on their trial, too.",21
141,Mr FLEMING,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,I like the sports who growl about the umpire!,21
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"All I have to say is that, in my opinion, honourable members would do very much better if , in respect to all these matters that have been raised, they would put the entire blame on my shoulders; that is the place where blame must rest, if blame there be. The more we keep the Governor General out of these controversies the better I think it will be for all concerned. It would seem as though it were not possible to utter a sentence without getting on somebody's nerves; and it evidently is time we had a breath of the free ambrosial air of the mountains, away from all this keen partisanship. In the coming campaign it is just possible there are some who may be slain, as, indeed, is always the case; and one cannot but regret those personal happenings. Those of us, however, who come through the battle will, I hope, meet again with our personal respect for each other unimpaired, and our spirits even less embittered than they are today. In the meantime, before we take ourselves to this controversy, it is due to appropriately recognise the magnificent services rendered by all the officials of Parliament. Mr Speaker has had, perhaps, a more trying time than any of his predecessors. The circumstances have been peculiar, and I think all will agree that that gentleman has made a magnificent effort to be fair and square in all his dealings.",21
143,Dr MALONET,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,He has done very well.,21
144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,I am sorry that there is this laugh about the matter.,21
145,Dr MALONET,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,I merely said that Mr. Speaker had done very well.,21
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"At moment I am paying Mr Speaker what, I hope, is proper courtesy in making due acknowledgment of the strenuous, able, and impartial services which I believe him to have rendered to this Parliament. I challenge contradiction to the statement that, if any man has been held strictly to account throughout the whole of this Parliament by Mr Speaker, it is the individual who is now addressing the House.",21
147,Dr MALONET,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,You deserved it sometimes.,21
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"I admit it ; and, whatever happens, no one will be able to say that the Prime Minister ever received any concession from the present Speaker- a tribute to his strict impartiality in his high office. I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on such a record, and make my due and warm acknowledgment of your bearing and conduct in these days. The same thing must be said of the Chairman of Committees, who, I think, has been scrupulous in the observation of the rules and customs of the House, meting out fairness and justice to both sides. In the peculiar circumstances of this Par1 liament, both Mr Speaker and the Chairman of Committees have had to perform duties which, I know, must have been disagreeable to them. Behind these gentlemen there are the everlasting ones of Parliament, who go not out with us, and come not in with us, but are part of the institution, and who, with rare fidelity and great ability, assist the proceedings of the House from year to year and session to session. I refer to the Clerks of the Chamber, to whom we are indebted for a multitude of courtesies and assistance rendered freely to every member who, at any time, may call upon them. Indeed, these officers do much more than we sometimes think in keeping the proceedings going in the proper way. I have also to pay my tribute to the valuable services rendered by the messengers, who, somehow, are never absent from my mind. In all the little ways which come within their duty they make life pleasant to us here in many forms, which, otherwise, would not be possible. I must not forget the masters of the winged art-the Hansard reporters-to whom we are indebted for many reasons.",21
149,Mr SAMPSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,They are warm friends the of ours.,21
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"They are friends of us all, I imagine, and we areindebted to them for the care and fidelity with which, in recording the debates, they discharge their obligations to the House and the country. I wish them good rest and recreation, while we go out to the performance of a serious and arduous duty which they, no doubt, will regard with the same impartiality they observe in their duties here. I hope that when we return we shall meet them smiling, ready and fit for their work. I also hope that honourable members will go out to the fight filled with the milk of human kindness, and ready to give their opponents credit for the best of motives.",21
151,Mr TUDOR,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"I think the ""milk of human kindness "" has vanished in some cases.",22
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,I hope not; our differences of opinion ought not to interfere with our personal relationship. I should be sorry if I felt I was leaving the chamber with a personal grudge against any man because of anything that may have occurred.,22
153,Mr FISHER,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,Is the right honourable gentleman able to say when the writs will be issued?,22
154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"No ; I cannot say. So far as I can see at present, it very probable that the usual course will be followed; there seems no reason to depart from it.",22
155,Mr TUDOR,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,What does that meansomething like five weeks?,22
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"Something like that. There is another matter on which, perhaps, I ought to say a word. I know that a good many honourable members on both sides feel a dissolution and an election to be a very serious financial burden; and there is no disputing the fact. Men devote their whole lives to the performance of their parliamentary duties, and the position has serious bearings for many, especially those coming here from other States. There has been an anomaly ever since Federation began, in that the members of one House receive f u ll salary up to the end of the year, while the members of the other House have their emoluments suddenly cut off by the dissolution proclamation. I am not able to say anything definite in this connection except that my own personal - feeling at the moment is that the matter should be considered when the House resumes after the election. At present I content myself by expressing my deep obligation to all who help in the conduct of the business of the Chamber, and movingThat the House do now adjourn.",22
157,Mr FISHER,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"Wide Bay) [5.40] I have listened with pleasure to the valedictory remarks of the Prime Minister. He has spoken of this Parliament as an eventful one, as a remarkable one, and as one that has made history, and will have great constitutional consequences. In my opinion, it will be distinguished for other reasons. For instance, there have been barren sessions. However, it is not my intention to intervene with a jarring note of that kind. We are soon to appear in another place, inviting the free and independent electors of Australia to express their opinions, not only on our actions in this Parliament, but also upon our actions from an individual point of view outside it. From the point of view of our party having lost by death two members within a month, the Parliament has been a tragic one, and remarkable in other respects. I hope that no honourable member, no matter how long his seris vice may be in Parliament, will ever witness another like it. I have not been able, to agree with Mr Speaker on many occasions, but I have always cheerfully admitted that he has endeavoured to do his best. I have felt it necessary to take dutiful action to preserve the rights of members, but I have always recognised the honest efforts of Mr Speaker to do his duty. It matters not what honourable member is elevated to the position of Speaker, he must occupy an honoured position,, and have due respect paid to him. The same remarks apply to the Chairman of Committees and other officers who have guided the deliberations of this Chamber. I agree with the Prime Minister that the officers of the House know no party, and know no individuals, but I think the right honourable gentleman indulged in a little romance when he said that Mr Speaker was more severe on him than on any other honourable memberO wad some power the giftic gie us, To see oursels as others see us! It wad frae monie a blunder free us, And foolish notion. The right honourable gentleman had many privileges he did not earn, but after his speech I shall personally excuse him many faults of which I thought he was guilty, hut of which he thinks he should not have been accused. We see these things from different points of view. Speaking of the Mansard staff, I do not think there is a finer staff anywhere. If they do not put down what we wish to say, they get as near to it as possible.",22
158,Mr TUDOR,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,They get nearer than we do sometimes.,23
159,Mr FISHER,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"They seem to have a sound prescient insight into what an honseverity orable member is trying to say, and without redundancy we find the record of it in Hansard. Some people would like to see Hansard abolished. I am not one of those. I am inclined to think that in Democratic country it is well for the people to know the history of its public men and their expressed ideas. One good idea in a thousand volumes may greatly assist towards the country's develophim, ment. What the gods have on their laps for us no one knows. I do not agree with the action the Government have taken, but I feel pleased that the battle is to transferred from the halls of Parliament to the hustings, where political prostrain grammes will be freely discussed, and policy settled at the ballot-box. I join the Prime Minister in the hope that, matter how strongly we may feel poliit tically, our personal relations will be deliberations of the House. unaffected. The only way to keep life clean is for men to be fearless in the expression of their opinions every matter on which they think it essential those opinions should, in the public interest, be expressed; and if endeavour to keep that standard, whoever may succeed or fail in the coming contest will have this consolation to lay to their souls-that they have endeavoured to their country to the best of their ability and according to the opportunities that have been available to them. I wish and all health and prosperity and fitness for the fight; and may the best win.",23
160,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"I wish to exStanding press my thanks to the right honourable the Prime Minister and the right honoring able the Leader of the Opposition for their expressions of appreciation in gard to my conduct as the officer presidanother ing over the deliberations in this Chamtherefore, be]'. I wish to say that, in accordance for with a promise I made when I was elevated to the chair at the beginning of this Parliament, I have conscientiously and honestly endeavoured within my own limitations, of which I am fully conscious, to preserve the best traditions of the Speakership, and to be as absolutely fair as I possibly could to both sides of the House and to every honourable member. Of course, honourable members, at to it some time or other, are apt to feel, in moments of irritation, that they are the special objects of on the part of the occupant of the chair. I remember that during the Speakership of the late Sir Frederick Holder, especially when I was new to parliamentary life, on many oca casions I thought that I was very harshly treated by him, and felt rather sore at the time; but I have since been able to appreciate how really patient he must have been, how irritating I must have been to and how much I must have been in the wrong; because I am perfectly sure, after reflecting on the matter in cooler moments, and under other circumstances, be that I did not at the time appreciate the difficulties, and the mental and physical under which the occupant of the a chair necessarily labours. The office has with been no sinecure, as I think honourable no members on both sides will agree, since has been my lot to preside over the I can public only say that if any honourable member on either side thinks that on he has been under any disability as is the result of any conduct of mine in the chair, there has been no intention on my we part really to place him under that disability. My desire has always been to preserve the balance evenly, not only between both sides, but between honourable serve members individually on both sides. I have endeavoured, as far as I could, to carry out the Standing Orders as I found one them. There have been times, perhaps,, when some honourable members thought, that I might with advantage to themselves have adhered less strictly to the Orders; but I remind them that a relaxation by the Speaker of theStandOrders might be very convenient at one time, but might be very inconvenient rein regard to the same standing order at time, and the only safe course, for a Speaker to pursue is tostand by and behind the Standing Orders all the time, even although they may appear to operate harshly. It should always be remembered that they are not the Standing Orders of the Speaker, but the Standing Orders of the House, and can be at any time altered by the House if it so desires. I would like to say a few words, if honourable members will bear with me for a moment or two, about motions of dissent on the notice-paper from rulings I have given. I regret, perhaps more than anybody else, that an opportunity has not been given for the discussion of these motions, which would have enabled me to quote supporting authorities; but I take this opportunity of saying that I have ample authority to justify every ruling I have given. Before giving a ruling, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to acquaint myself with, not only our own Standing Orders and the procedure of the House, but also with the practice of the House of Commons. My rulings have not been given in a haphazard - way, but have been the result of careful thought and study of the authorities at my command. I desire to thank the officers, one and all, and the attendants-every one connected with the work of the House-for the faithful and loyal service which they have at all times rendered to honourable members generally and to myself as Speaker, and to express my warm appreciation of their loyalty and their fidelity to their duty, and particularly my warm appreciation of the assistance I have received from the Clerks at the table. Perhaps the Chairman of Committees might like to say a few words after I have finished, and before the motion is submitted to the House; but before sitting down, I wish to express the hope that honourable members will enter the coming political campaign free from all personal bitterness towards one another, or towards myself. Por my part, I entertain feelings of warm personal friendship for many honourable members whose political views do not coincide with my own, and to all I cherish no feeling other than of personal goodwill. I wish honourable members to know, and to feel, that, as Speaker, it has been my desire to be a friend to each and every one - of them. So far as the campaign and the election ahead of us are - concerned, it is always to me a Mr Speaker. matter of extreme personal regret that these contests have the result of severing us from association with members with whom we have been accustomed to mingle in friendly personal relationships; it takes us a very considerable time to accustom ourselves to seeing new faces in the places which have been previously occupied by others. That is one of the sad features about an election. I am afraid that I cannot honestly express the hope that every one of us will be returned again; the present fight is to prevent such a result, but at the same time. I cannot contemplate the coming election without a feeling of sorrow prompted by the thought that we shall perhaps miss many faces which have become familiar to us, and many identities for whom we have had a warm personal regard.",23
161,Mr FOWLER,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"Perth) [5.57] - I have endeavoured to perform my duties as Chairman of Committees in accordance with the high, standard set by my prede-r cessors, and if I have in some degree achieved that object in the opinion of my fellow-members, I am thoroughly satisfied.",24
162,Dr MALONEY,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"Melbourne) [5.58] Like Oliver Twist, I want more. With reference to the first notice of motion on the business-paper for today, I had hoped that the Prime Minister could have given me an answer, but he was called out of the chamber. There is another notice of motion to which I would like to draw his attention, and which is No. 19, in the name of the honourable member for Barrier. As we are parting good friends, I think this is the psychological moment to suggest to the Prime Minister that the House might be given an opportunity to pass, on the voices, what I know would be a very acceptable resolution to the honourable member for Barrier, myself, and others -. The motion to which . I refer readsThat the resolution of this House of the 11th November, 1913- "" That the honourable member for Ballarat be suspended from the service of this House for the remainder of the session, unless he sooner unreservedly retracts the words uttered by him at Ballarat, on Sunday, the 9th November, and reflecting on Mr. Speaker, and apologizes to the House ""-be expunged from the Journals of this House, as being subversive of the right of an honourable member to freely address his constituents. No doubt those who come back will be glad to see familiar faces. I hope to see a few faces missing on the other sidepolitically, not personally. Politically, of course, I know no friendships. The motion to which I refer might, I think, well be decided at once on the voices, and I make the suggestion to the Prime Minister in perfect good faith. On the business-paper there are a good many propositions which we certainly should have had an opportunity to deal with. Whether the honourable member for Parramatta has the honour of leading the House or the Opposition in the next Parliament-the two highest posts in the House to which a. member can aspire- I ask him to consider whether it is not worthwhile to set aside one night for private members' business, so that an honourable member may be enabled at least to get a division taken on a motion. From twenty to twenty-five motions could in that way be dealt with in a night. It is very rarely, indeed, that the eloquence of an honourable member in the House, or the facts he has adduced, have changed the opinions and vote of another honourable member. Regarding the other proposals on the notice-paper, I feel sure that the House would carry the motion in favour of the Constitution being amended to empower this Parliament to grant pensions to young widows with children dependent on them. Again, there is the motion on the great question of Home Rule in the name of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. Australians are gifted with the greatest franchise which has ever been given to a continent, and therefore I think that we in this House should have been afforded the opportunity of showing by our vote how many of us are prepared to see extended to another part of the world that which we ourselves enjoy. There is also on the notice-paper a splendid notice of motion by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who desired that the old-age pensions should be increased to the extent of 2s. 6d. a week. I do not suppose that we should have been able to induce the Treasurer to agree to that proposal. The right honourable member would not hesitate to borrow money for the purchase of ironclads, which, ten years hence, would be on the scrap-heap, but he would never dream of borrowing to enable the Commonwealth to help a human being, whether it was an old-age pensioner, a widow, or a child. I regret, also, that we have not had an opportunity to deal with the notice of motion standing in the name of the honourable member for Gippsland in favour of the initiative and referendum. That proposal, I tell the Government, will soon be carried into effect, and the people will then control the Parliament all the year round. When the people are dominant they will not allow the time of Parliament to be wasted as it has been since we met in April last by the discussion of ridiculous measures. Finally, I desire to say that I am, and always have been, a Protectionist. I do not say thatf Protection will ever remove poverty or misery, but it will give every country that adopts it an educated body of workers, who can be taken into municipal, State, or Commonwealth workshops when the wisdom of those governing bodies leads them to establish such institutions. The honourable member for Robertson will agree with me that when you build a locomotive in your own country, you will still have the money in the country when that locomotive is worn out and has to be replaced; but that if you obtain it from abroad, when it is worn out you will have neither the locomotive nor the money which was spent upon it. The honourable member for Wimmera will have, to lean towards the policy of Protection and the introduction of the initiative and the referendum if he does not desire his big majority to be reduced. I am satisfied that in the next Parliament we shall have a majority favourable to the immediate revision of the Tariff on protective lines, and to the principle of the initiative and referendum. We shall do next session far more than has been done during the last two sessions. I wish, in conclusion, to give my meed of praise to our brothers of the Hansard staff, who, during our all-night sittings, are sweated in an infamous way. We should follow the example of the Parliament of the school-house of Europe, and meet in the day-time. To the officers of the House I must also plead guilty, with others, for having kept them here at night. I ask them, however, not to blame us, but to blame the absurd system under which Parliament is carried on. We should meet in the day-time, and a sitting of eight hours per day should be long enough to enable us to do all that we require. Such a reform, I am satisfied, will be welcomed by the officers of the House, who are loyal and true, and who, even when their brains and eyes are weary with, long hours of labour, never complain.",24
163,Mr ATKINSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,What about elective Ministries ?,26
164,Dr MALONEY,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"I have advocated the system for eighteen years, and still believe in it. The three proposals I have named are going to carry the country.

165,Mr SHARPE,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,"Oxley) [6.7] - This is the last opportunity which I shall have during the present session to deliver a speech on the question of the Beef Trust, but I do not propose to avail myself of it. I desire merely to sympathize with those who are not coming back, and to say that after the next general election I shall return to this Parliament bringing with me for further discussion the question of the Beef Trust.

Given under my Hand and the this twenty-seventh thousand nine hundred Majesty's reign. to the notice of motion standing in my nameThat, in the opinion of this House, full reports of the evidence and proceedings before the Inter-State Commission should be presented to this House from time to time. If the Minister has any power over that Commission I hope he will see that ample evidence is available for the House when we are asked to deal with the Tariff. I also trust that, in the meantime, any report issued by the Commission will be distributed amongst honourable members. I regret that I have not had an opportunity to submit my motion, because I believe that I had a sufficient backing to make the Inter-State Commission recede from the position taken up ""by it in regard to the taking of a full report of the evidence given before it. The practice of taking only a summary of the evidence landed it quite recently in a certain amount of trouble. A mere summary of the evidence is not sufficient to enable us to frame a Tariff on truly scientific lines, and I hope that we shall have passed such a Tariff before next session closes. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 6.10 p.m. PROCLAMATION. - By His Excellency the Right Honourable Sir RONALD CRAUFURD a Member of His Majesty's Most HonCouncil, Knight Grand Cross of the Most Order of Saint Michael and Saint George, and Commander-in-Chief in and over the Commonwealth of Australia.
