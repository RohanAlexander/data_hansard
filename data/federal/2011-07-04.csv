5,Ms ROXON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I want to refer the House to a story titled 'Elderly blamed for long hospital waiting lists' in the 28 June 2011 edition of the Australian newspaper. The first sentence of the story states: HEALTH Minister Nicola Roxon has blamed the increase in the number of older Australians for the failure of her reforms to cut hospital waiting lists … This claim is completely fabricated. I never said such a thing, and this is particularly poor reporting. In fact, I itemised the way the government's reforms were delivering to the community, and I would like to refer people to the transcript of the press conference for an accurate version of what was said. I table that transcript. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Private Members' Motions Reference to Main Committee",19

7,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Easter Sunday To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that:  The Fair Work Act does not recognise Easter Sunday as a public holiday in the National Employment Standards. It does recognise Good Friday and Easter Monday.  Easter Sunday is a day of great significance for the 64% of Australians who identify as Christian and the 30% of Australians estimated to attend Easter Sunday Church services.  Easter Sunday is part of a recognised holiday break for all Australian people, Christian or not.  With the exception of Victoria, all mainland Australian States, as well as New Zealand, recognise the significance of Easter Sunday and require shops to close.  Indeed, the significance of Easter Sunday is widely recognised throughout the Western world by the fact that shops must close on this day in London, Paris, Rome, Milan and Montreal.  The Parliament of NSW unanimously legislated for Easter Sunday to be a public holiday. We therefore ask the House to: Amend the Fair Work Act 2009 so as to include, in the National Employment Standards, Easter Sunday in the list of recognised public holidays. from 644 citizens Zebra Chip Disease Complex To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of members of the Australian vegetable and potato industries, initiated by AUSVEG, the national peak body representing around 9,000 vegetable and potato growers around Australia, draws to the attention of the House: Concern from the industry that potatoes from New Zealand infected with Zebra Chip disease complex-a devastating potato disease which has caused millions of dollars worth of damage worldwide-will be allowed into Australia if a current New Zealand request for market access is approved. AUSVEG has grave concerns that if this market access request is approved, it will put the Australian potato industry at extreme unnecessary risk, as it is highly likely that a proportion potatoes that come into Australia from New Zealand will be infected with Zebra Chip disease complex. We therefore ask the House to:  Take steps to ensure that Australia, via the relevant governing body, rejects the application them to import fresh potatoes into Australia for processing under a Quarantine Approved Premise arrangement. from 517 citizens Postal Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the undersigned Citizens of Queensland draws to the attention of the House: Australia Post is planning to close the Australia Post Office at Highpoint Plaza in Ashgrove, Queensland. Residents and business owners were not consulted about the closure, and we believe the closure will cause great inconvenience for local families and business owners. We therefore ask the House to: Seek assurances from Australia Post that they will reconsider and rescind this closure and commit to retaining full Australia Post Office facilities in this Ashgrove shopping precinct. from 310 citizens Pharmaceutical Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the people of Glen Gala Village, Sunshine West, Ardeer and Derrimut draws to the attention of the House that the Glen Gala, Sunshine West, Ardeer, Derrimut and The Avenue Estate communities are in urgent need of an additional pharmacy to service the needs of their communities. We therefore ask the House to: Immediately call upon the Federal Government to facilitate an additional licence to dispense medicine in Glen Gala Shopping Centre without further delay, to improve accessibility, competition, affordability of the and choice for the members of these communities. from 287 citizens Decentralisation Program To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need to decentralise parts of our population away from urban coastal sprawls to networks of interlinked medium density towns and cities with efficient power and transport systems. A vigorous decentralisation programme will help break down the notorious car-driven urban infrastructure in which we are trapped not only economically, hut physically and psychologically. We ask that the House takes steps to ensure long and short term goals are set on how decentralising will happen and how we will live in the future. A long-term goal is better designed locations than those now spread too wide and stressing essential services. The locations need all the right facilities, with much thought given to community development. This goal will break down the tyrannies of distance in all aspects of our lives. A short-term goal to diversify the population is for Australia to have its own rules and regulations on entry and where refugees and migrants can initially settle. To this end Australia will succeed from the States Parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and 1967 Protocol, proud of its efforts. There are another 140 signatories to the refugee policy. Another goal to help South Pacific people who are faced with major environmental and economic problems. The transition of islander people to Australia where necessary would be part of decentralisation. from 11 citizens Asylum Seekers To the Honourable the Speaker AND Members OF THE House OF Representatives This petition of Australian citizens and residents Draws to the attention of the House: the Australian and Malaysian Refugee Trade We, as citizens and residents of this country ask the House take all available that Australia does not send asylum seekers and refugees to Malaysia. We should not push back asylum seekers and refugees from Australia to Malaysia, a country that has not signed the UN Refugee Convention. Furthermore, Malaysia has a poor track record of protection, safety, and humanitarian assistance refugees and asylum seekers. Australia needs to have an understanding of the plight of refugees worldwide and treat people with respect. As a member of the international community and as a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention, the Australian Government has certain ethical and legal obligations towards asylum seekers and refugees. We request that the House of Representatives ensure that these obligations are respected and that the moving of refugees and asylum seekers to Malaysia immediately ceases. We urgently request for the House of Representatives to show compassion for the lives of asylum seekers reach Australia and to take all available steps to ensure their asylum claims are assessed in Australia. from seven citizens Administration of Justice To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives When citizens presume Officers of the Commonwealth or Judges appointed by ""the Governor General in Council"" is misbehaving, they ""shall not be removed except by the Governor General in council on an address from both Houses of the Parliament"" An aggrieved citizen shall submit a petition to the House of Representative for action from the House as per Standing Order 208. So, 208 is an action by the House that shall be done by the House. We ask the House to return the exclusive power of ""both Houses of the Parliament."" We ask this so that both our Constitution and our Democracy can be returned to the Parliament and hence, the people of Australia. We ask the House to address matters where only Parliament has jurisdiction, not the steps to ensure to Executive. from one citizen Digital Television To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of Residents and Citizens of for Miriam Vale and District, Queensland Draws to the attention of the House: The unsatisfactory position with regard to the changeover from analogue TV to Digital TV. The Community has a high number of Retired Residents, who are unable to sustain the cost of Transition. We therefore ask the House to: Ensure that the Miriam Vale Community has access, Free of charge, to Quality Digital TV and to Ensure the services provided are local and not relayed from a satellite service. The Community wishes to access its TV Signal via Terrestrial means via a Ground based Transmitter. from 592 citizens National Schools Curriculum To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia including representatives of community, educational, political organisations, institutions and establishments across the country, Draws to the attention of the House: The matter of the importance of including Turkish in the National Schools Curriculum as a language of social, cultural, community, and economic importance to Australia and its people. The inclusion of Turkish in the National Schools Curriculum is important because:  It is a language spoken in a vast geographical area of the world with over 150 million people according to UNESCO.  Turkish will be the ninth most widely spoken language when added to the current list of languages in the National Schools Curriculum draft document.  Tens of thousands of Australians Gallipoli on an annual basis.  Turkey has a dynamic fast growing economy with increasingly growing relations with the Turkic speaking countries and her neighbours.  It is the language of a vibrant community in Australia.  Turkish has a unique structure which draws the interest of many linguists. We therefore ask the House to: Ensure that the Turkish and other community languages are included in the National Schools Curriculum currently being developed by the Australian Curriculum and Reporting Authority. from 10,148 citizens Syria: Political Prisoners To The Honourable Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives: This Petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House: Since early March of 2011, the citizens of Syria have been calling for their freedom of speech, basic rights, freeing of political prisoners and for democracy through peaceful demonstrations. In reaction to these protests, the Syrian government has put all their efforts into suppressing these calls by cutting off food supplies to cities and medical supplies to the injured, silencing protestors through barbaric killings by means of security agencies. Up till now, over a thousand people have been murdered, including innocent women and children, with thousands more citizens forced to flee their homeland. The Syrian embassy in Canberra has also been adding to the suffering of the citizens in Syria. Syrian diplomats from the Syrian Embassy have been sent by the Syrian government to spy on Australian's of Syrian heritage. As a result, many Australian's of Syrian heritage have had their families in Syria threatened for taking part in protests against the Syrian government. We therefore ask the House: To urge the United Nations to take immediate action in protecting the citizens in Syria from these atrocities being committed by the Syrian visit government's tyrannical regime and to close down the Syrian Embassy. from 1,108 citizens Pharmaceutical Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the Glen Gala, Sunshine West, Ardeer, Derrimut and The Avenue Estate communities have more than reasonable access to the supply of Pharmaceutical Benefits and are therefore not in any need of an additional pharmacy to service the needs of their communities. The existing pharmacies provide reasonable, adequate and timely access to the medication needs of the community. We therefore ask the House to: take all necessary steps to ensure that 1) the current Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (ACPA) Pharmacy Location Rules are maintained and 2) the current Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (ACPA) Pharmacy Location Rules are applied to all applications for approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits. from 3,528 citizens Plain Packaging To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This Petition of Australian adults Draws to the attention of the House that it is our belief Plain Packaging will not work. As tobacco consumers and Australian adults, we are increasingly frustrated with our freedoms being infringed. With the introduction of Plain Packaging, the government is now taking away our ability to distinguish between and choose brands. That is our decision to make, not the governments. Enough is enough! We therefore ask the House to request that the government remove Plain Packaging from its agenda and that our voice be heard, in the light the approx. $7 billion we contribute annually in tobacco excise. from 35,001 citizens Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefit Amendment (Fair Indexation) Legislation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of concerned Australian citizens draws to the attention of the House the need for veterans receiving benefits from the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme (DFRB) and the Defence Force Retirement & Death Benefits Scheme (DFRDB) to have their benefits adequately indexed. We therefore call on the House to consider and pass the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefit Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill 2010 to ensure that the 'unique nature of military service' is recognised through military superannuation arrangements. from 6,184 citizens Malabar Headland To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that we, the undersigned, object to the removal of all horses from the Malabar Headland. That we object to the removal of all horses and cessation of horse riding activities from the Malabar Headland which has, for over 100 years, been a feature of the Malabar Headland, and plays an important role in the local community. We therefore ask the House to grant a parcel of land to be used for the stabling, riding and maintenance of horses, and to provide horse riding bridle paths within designated open public space allotment on Malabar Headland, so that the equestrian community of both children and adults based in the south eastern suburbs, and the wider Sydney area, can continue to pursue equine sports and recreational activities. The allotted equestrian area will not infringe on sites with heritage and Aboriginal significance, or on the recently of designated National Park areas, and shall be relocated to the area previously used as a tip and currently used as a rifle range. This is a matter of urgency, as all Malabar Headland users and tenants, including horse owners and riders, have been given a notice to vacate by 31st October 2011. from 4,442 citizens Petitions received.

8,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS,"Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Assange, Mr Julian Dear Mr Murphy I refer to your letter of 16 March 2011. regarding a petition about Mr Julian Assange, submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions. I note the Committee's referral under Standing Order 209(b) of items 3 and 4 of the petition. My response follows. Item 3 called upon me to summon the Ambassador for the United States of America to Australia and demarche him condemning the comments of American politician Ms Sarah Palin on Mr Assange. Item 4 called upon me to summon the Canadian High Commissioner to Australia and demarche him condemning the comments of Mr Tom Flanagan, former Senior Advisor to the Canadian Prime Minister, on Mr Assange. The Australian Government deplores and condemns all calls to violence against any Australian citizen wherever and by whomever they are made. However, neither of the individuals in the petition cited are holders of public office in their respective countries so it would not be appropriate to demarche their governments through their diplomatic representatives on statements they are reported to have made. Both the United States of America and Canada have laws protecting the rights of individuals against threats to their person. under which any concerns about these reported statements could be pursued. I trust this information will be of assistance to the Committee in its consideration of the petition. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Rudd Paid Parental Leave Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 16 March 2011 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding Paid Parental Leave and child care. I apologise for the lengthy delay in responding. The Australian Government supports the choices families make in caring for their children, including support for parents who choose to care for their children at home. There is a range of government assistance available to help these families with the cost of raising their children, including Family Tax Benefit and the Baby Bonus. The Paid Parental Leave scheme was introduced on 1 January 2011 to give more babies the best start in life by allowing parents the financial security to spend more time at home with their new baby in those critical early months. The Government has also committed to providing eligible fathers or partners with two weeks of Paid Paternity Leave for babies born and adopted from 1 January 2013. This reform will assist and encourage fathers and partners to also take time off after the birth of a child. Parents can take Paid Parental Leave in conjunction with employerprovided leave. Extensive consultations found widespread support for the introduction of a Governmentfunded Paid Parental Leave scheme. The Government's scheme takes into account feedback from employers, employees and the community. The Paid Parental Leave scheme does not reduce assistance to stay-at-home mothers nor disadvantage them. Currently, mothers who are not in paid work tend to obtain more assistance than mothers who have been in paid work, even where both look after their newborn child full time for the six months after birth. For example, a mother who has not been in paid work prior to the birth of a baby will receive, if eligible, the $5,294 tax-free Baby Bonus and $3,909 in tax-free Family Tax Benefit Part B in a full financial year. A mother receiving the taxable Parental Leave Pay will obtain the equivalent of the Baby Bonus and an average additional net gain of $2,000. Family Tax Benefit Part B is paid to families with only one main income earner, recognising the reduced income of parents who choose to stay at home to care for their children. Family Tax Benefit Part B is not payable to families receiving Parental Leave Pay. The Government has committed to a comprehensive review of the Paid Parental Leave scheme, starting two years after the scheme commences. The review will take into account emerging evaluation findings and the views of stakeholders and the public on the future development of the scheme. The amount of time off work that primary carers are taking to care for newborn or newly-adopted children will be considered. The Government remains fully committed to the delivery of the 38 Early Learning and Care Centres, including six Autism-specific centres, announced during the 2007 election and referred to in your letter. The six Autism-specific centres support:  children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to participate in child care, early learning and education settings so that they can interact with other children and make the transition to further educational or therapeutic settings;  parents and carers of children with ASD to participate in the community and manage the needs of their children; and  the sector to develop strategies to improve access, collaborate to facilitate research and develop best practice, and to build workforce capability. Each centre is staffed by a mix of early childhood education professionals and other specialists who may include psychologists, speech pathologists and occupational therapists. These early learning programs are making a huge difference to the quality of life for children with ASD and their families. The petition also raises concern about the potential impact of long periods spent in day care on children less than two years of age. Apart from supporting workforce participation, child care can help parents to undertake activities that can be difficult with a small child - for example, attending doctors' appointments. Quality child care also provides children with important opportunities for learning and development. Early childhood experts and professionals maintain that quality is critical when it comes to early childhood education and care. In recognition of this, the Government, in partnership with all state and territory governments, is implementing a new National Quality Framework that will apply across all Long Day Care, Family Day Care, preschool and Outside School Hours Care settings. Caring for children is one of the most important activities anyone in our community can do. The Government is committed to supporting and strengthening families and recognises that families today have a diversity of parenting responsibilities and caring arrangements. The Government sees its role in relation to families enhancing their choices, by helping to meet the financial needs of families and supporting a balance of work and family commitments. As part of this commitment, the Government makes a substantial contribution to the well-being of children and young people by providing family assistance payments. Thank you again for writing on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions. from the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Jenny Macklin Fuel Prices Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 16 March 2011 forwarding to me a petition regarding petrol prices in Colac and District, submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions. I apologise for the delay in responding to you. The Government appreciates that petrol is an essential purchase for many Australians and changes in petrol prices can have a direct impact on the daily cost of living. As you would know, Australian petrol prices are not regulated by the Government and companies are free to set prices in the market. Analysis by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) indicates that the major influences on retail petrol prices in Australia are:  the price of Singapore Mogas 95, which is the benchmark for unleaded petrol in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia;  the Australian dollar exchange rate against the US dollar, as Mogas 95 is priced in US dollars; and  the established weekly retail price cycles that operate in the largest capital cities. The price of Mogas 95 is largely driven by the price for Malaysian Tapis crude oil, rather than the price of WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil, which is the relevant crude oil for the North as American region and the crude oil price generally quoted by the media. Australian petrol prices generally move in line with international prices because Australian oil refiners and petroleum importers buy and sell fuel on the global market. Given that oil is an internationally traded commodity, the price is determined by world demand and supply. At the peak of the global financial crisis, when demand for crude oil was very low, the price of Malaysian Tapis was only US$35 per barrel. As the global economy recovered and demand improved, oil prices rebounded, and we have recently seen the price of Malaysian Tapis rise above US$100 per barrel. International factors, including recent instability in the Middle East, have also put upward pressure on prices. However, the high value of the Australian dollar has helped to restrain increases in petrol prices in recent months. In addition to reflecting changes in international prices and the exchange rate, domestic factors such as transportation and storage costs, wholesale and retail selling margins, and local competition also contribute to retail petrol The ACCC has also examined the impact of local factors on average retail petrol prices in country towns. The ACCC analysis indicates that prices in regional centres and country towns tend to be higher than in the largest cities for a number of reasons including: lower volumes of fuel and convenience store sales over which to spread operating costs; a greater distance from fuel terminals; and the number of service stations, which can affect the degree of local competition. All of these factors can affect different regional centres and country towns to varying degrees, which can result in variations in fuel prices in seemingly similar regional centres and country towns. Similar prices in a market are not necessarily indicative of collusion. Petrol, especially unleaded petrol, is generally a very similar product, with minimal brand loyalty, and competition occurring primarily on price. As a result, it is common for retail petrol prices to converge on a common price in local markets. The Gillard Government is committed to promoting competition and transparency in Australia's fuel market for the benefit of Australian consumers. The Government appointed a Petrol Commissioner within the ACCC, and has given the ACCC the power to monitor prices, costs and profits relating to the supply of unleaded petrol in the petroleum industry. In the 2011-12 Budget, the Government provided the ACCC with funding of $2 million over two years to continue these functions. The ACCC's latest report released in December 2010 on the prices, costs and profits relating to the supply of unleaded petroleum products shows that Australian petrol prices remained relatively stable during 2009-10, and prices closely followed international benchmark prices of refined petrol. Petrol industry profit 2009-10 was below the average net profit over the last eight years, and there have been significant structural changes to the fuel retail industry, with 7 Eleven and Peregrine Corporation (which owns the On The Run chain) buying the retail assets of Mobil. The ACCC report can be found at www.accc.gov.au. Where there is sufficient evidence that a prices. business has misled or behaved in an anticompetitive way to the detriment of consumers, the ACCC can take action under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (CCA) (formerly the Trade Practices Act 1974). The ACCC has taken action against businesses to protect consumers where there has been evidence of illegal conduct in the Australian fuel industry. The ACCC is an independent statutory agency that is responsible for enforcing and ensuring compliance with the CCA. Section 29 of the CCA specifically prohibits me from giving the ACCC a direction on the performance of its functions or the exercise of its powers under the anticompetitive conduct provisions. One of the reasons for the ACCC's independence is to ensure that its decisions are, and are seen to be, separate from the political process. Should the petitioners wish to raise their concerns with the ACCC, it can be contacted by calling 1300 302 502, by visiting www.acce,gov.au, or by writing to: The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission GPO Box 3131 CANBERRA ACT 2601 Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. I trust that this information will be of assistance to you. from the Treasurer, Mr Swan Child Sex Trafficking Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 6 April 2011 relating to a petition recently submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding support for programs to combat child sex tourism. The following letter responds to the request contained in the petition that the Government fund an ongoing education campaign and support for service to help Australians to identify and report suspicions or concerns about child sex offenders who travel overseas. I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Kevin Rudd MP, has written to you separately regarding the second part of the petition, which calls for funding for community-based international development programs on child sex trafficking and child sex tourism. I appreciate the petitioners' concerns regarding child sex tourism. The Government shares these concerns and will continue to invest considerable resources as part of a comprehensive suite of measures to combat these heinous crimes. As part of this commitment, the Government recently made significant reforms to laws dealing with child sex abuse in areas of Commonwealth responsibility, including child sex tourism laws and online child pornography laws. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Offences Against Children) Act 2010 has strengthened existing offence regimes, including through the raising of maximum penalties. The most serious offences now carry penalties of up to 25 years imprisonment. The new laws also make it an offence to engage in steps leading up to child sex tourism offences, allowing law enforcement to intervene before a potential offender leaves Australia and long before a child is harmed. The new laws are reinforced by a range of practical measures designed to ensure Australians are able to identify and report these abuses when they see them. The Government recently funded a range of measures aimed at alerting travellers to the new laws and advising members of the public to contact the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to report suspicious behaviour. These measures, which were rolled out across Australia, included print and online advertising, an information brochure and fact sheet for distribution by relevant government agencies, non-government organisations and members of the travel industry, and the display of signage at Australia's international airports. The Government also provides information on child sex tourism through its travel advisory and consular assistance service, smarttraveller, and disseminates the free publication Travel Smart: Hints for Australian Travellers with each Australian passport issued, which includes details for reporting a possible violation of Australia's child sex laws to the AFP. These measures complement ongoing work by the AFP to monitor child sex tourists both within Australia and overseas, and work with international law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute child sex offenders. While we welcome Child Wise's offer to provide an ongoing education campaign and support service to help Australians identify and report suspicions about child sex tourism, the Government believes that Commonwealth funding for child protection and law enforcement is best directed to other areas, such as those described above, at this time. I am confident that Government activities will continue to complement efforts by Child Wise and The Body Shop to promote awareness of child sexual exploitation, including through the Stop Sex Trafficking of Children and Young People Campaign, and make a positive contribution to preventing child sex tourism. Thank you for drawing this petition to my attention. I trust this information is of assistance. from the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr O'Connor Marriage Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 30 May 2011 regarding a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions about the request that the Marriage Act 1961 be left unamended. The Australian Government believes that the current definition of marriage in the Marriage Act 1961-`that marriage is between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life'-is appropriate. The Government believes that couples who have a mutual commitment to a shared life should be able to have their relationships recognised. The Government supports a nationally consistent framework for relationship recognition to be implemented by the States and Territories. New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory have established relationship recognition schemes, where the relationship is legally recognised by the act of registration. Relationships registered under these schemes are also now recognised in a wide range of Commonwealth laws. The Government will continue to encourage other jurisdictions to develop such schemes. I hope this information is of assistance to the Committee when considering this petition. from the Attorney-General, Mr MCClel– land Voluntary Euthanasia Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 16 March 2011 regarding a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions about euthanasia and Senator Bob Brown's related private Senator's Bill. It is currently an offence in each State to counsel or aid a person to commit suicide. Commonwealth laws are consistent with these State laws, although the Commonwealth has no power to make laws directly about euthanasia. The Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995 contains offences for using a carriage service to access or distribute suicide-related material with the intention of counselling or inciting suicide, providing instruction on a particular method of committing suicide. I understand that the petition received by the Committee was in response to the Private Senator's Bill introduced by Senator Bob Brown to restore the ability of the self-governing Territories (the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island) to legislate in relation to voluntary euthanasia. Importantly, the Bill does not legalise euthanasia. The Territories would have to legislate to legalise euthanasia. I appreciate that euthanasia is a sensitive and complex issue and that members of the community have strong views about this issue. As such, it is appropriate that Members of Parliament be able to vote according to their conscience on this issue. The Labor Party has previously allowed Members of Parliament to express their views on this issue with a conscience vote on the substantive issue of euthanasia. If a conscience vote on Senator Brown's Bill is called for, there is no reason why Government members would not be afforded this opportunity again. I appreciate you writing to me on this matter. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Marriage Thank you for your letter of 23 May 2011 regarding three petitions submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions about the Marriage Act 1961. The Australian Government believes that the current definition of marriage in the Marriage Act 1961-`that marriage is between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life'-is appropriate. The Government believes that couples who have a mutual commitment to a shared life should be able to have their relationships recognised. The Government supports a nationally consistent framework for relationship recognition to be implemented by the States and Territories. New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory have established relationship recognition schemes, where the or relationship is legally recognised by the act of registration. Relationships registered under these schemes are also now recognised in a wide range of Commonwealth laws. The Government will continue to encourage other jurisdictions to develop such schemes. I hope this information is of assistance to the Committee when considering these petitions. from the Attorney-General, Mr MCClel– land Postal Services Thank you for your letter dated 30 March 2011, concerning a petition submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the sale of the Warrnambool Post Office and the closure of its business centre. Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day-today running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to the postal network. As far as practicable it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. Australia Post has noted that it understands that there is a strong demand for postal services in Warrnambool and in response to recent community feedback has decided to offer a range of postal services at both Koroit Street and Timor Street post offices. The new arrangements address the concerns of the community about the ongoing provision of services to business customers, the number of service counters at Timor Street and access to free parking in close proximity to the Koroit Street Post Office. At Timor Street, a counter will be retained for the collection of carded articles and to service business account customers. This will also minimise wait times at the Koroit Street Post Office. Business account customers will be able to lodge mail and pre-order stamps and other postal products for collection the following day. Post office boxes for Koroit Street and Timor Street will be consolidated in a single location at Timor Street in a new walk-in lobby with full weather protection. At Koroit Street, there will be eight counters service customers, including a dedicated counter for identity services transactions such as processing Passport applications and Working With Children Checks. This newly refurbished Post Office is set to be fully operational from 23 May 2011 with retail counter services, including cash transactions, bill payments and identity services, being transferred from Timor Street to the Koroit Street location on Friday 20 May 2011. Australia Post acknowledges the importance of car parking for its customers and has negotiated with the Warrnambool City Council to provide a small number of free, 15-minute parking spaces in the Ozone car park, along with a disabled parking space at the front of the outlet. I trust this information will be of assistance. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Economy, Senator Conroy Judicial Misbehaviour Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 23 May 2011 attaching a petition submitted to the Committee regarding a Royal Commission on judicial misbehaviour. It is an essential feature of the Australian system of government that our courts are independent and free of interference from the executive arm of government. Consistent with this independence, the federal courts are each responsible for their own operation and management including the handling of complaints. If a person has a complaint about the conduct of a federal judicial officer they should write to the relevant head of jurisdiction. On 18 March 2011, I announced significant federal judicial complaint reforms. The reforms include a mechanism to assist Chief Justices and the Chief Federal Magistrate to manage complaints that are referred to them as well as the reintroduction of the Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission Bill to provide a standard mechanism for parliamentary consideration of removal of a judge from office under section 72(ii) of the Constitution. The reforms reflect the Government's desire to to implement a judicial complaints system that is more visible to the community and will enhance public confidence in the administration of justice. I trust this information is of assistance to the Committee. Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. from the Attorney-General, Mr MCClel– land Pumicestone Passage Thank you for your letter of 30 March 2011 regarding the Pumicestone Passage petition, presented by the Hon Peter Slipper MP to the Standing Committee on Petitions on 24 March 2011. The petition calls for a strategic environmental assessment of the Pumicestone Passage and its catchments located in South East Queensland. It also expresses concern regarding the impact of a proposed residential development Digital at Caloundra South, adjoining Pumicestone Passage. Part 10 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) provides for the strategic environmental impact assessment of proposed actions under a plan, policy or program, to be undertaken between a willing proponent and the Australian Government. In the context of the Pumicestone Passage and its catchments, a strategic environmental assessment may be difficult to achieve, given the multiplicity of current land uses in the area and the different management actions that may be required to address impacts. However, the Government certainly supports the use of strategic assessments, where appropriate to cut red tape for business while better protecting the environment. The recent federal budget provided a $29.2 million investment in a new Sustainable Regional Development initiative to support better sustainability planning in regions that are experiencing high growth. The Sustainable Regional Development program will support strategic assessments under national environmental legislation in up to seven additional regional and coastal growth areas. The government has also implemented a number of programs and has provided significant funding to improve water quality in the Pumicestone Passage and Moreton Bay area. This includes the Moreton Bay Coastal Catchments Initiative and funding to support the development of the ""South East Queensland Healthy Waterways Strategy 2007-2012"". The proposed residential development at Caloundra South has not yet been referred for assessment under the EPBC Act. Please be assured that any EPBC Act assessment process would ensure a full investigation of potential impacts of the proposal on matters of national environmental significance and opportunities for public comment. Thank you for writing to me on this matter and bringing the petition to my attention. from the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Tony Burke Imported Hazardous Products Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 23 May 2011 in relation to a petition on Australian regulations applicable to manufactured imported hazardous products, and opportunities for local business to supply goods and services to resource projects. I note the concerns raised in the petition and make the following comments. In relation to hazardous products, the petition may have linked two separate issues by comparing recommendations of the Montara Commission of Inquiry, that are specific to the offshore petroleum industry, with the regulation of hazardous products in Australia. The control of workplace dangerous goods and hazardous substances is overseen by Safe Work Australia. The hazardous substances regulatory package establishes exposure standards for work sites to reduce risks for people working with hazardous substances. Further information on the regulation of hazardous substances is available on the Safe Work Australia website at www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au. The Montara Commission of Inquiry considered the regulatory practices specific to the offshore well management practices and operations of the offshore petroleum industry. The Inquiry made numerous recommendations regarding the safety standards applicable to well equipment and blow-out prevention, and the well control practices of the operator and oversight by the regulator. The Inquiry did not consider the regulation of hazardous products. Importantly, the Inquiry found that the current objective, performance-based regulatory regime provides sufficient powers to the regulator to enable the effective monitoring and enforcement of offshore petroleum-related operations. The inadequacies identified by the Inquiry primarily include relate to the implementation of this regime. The Inquiry concluded that, despite the regulator's administrative deficiencies, the Montara incident could have been avoided if the operator had adhered to the well control practices approved by the regulator and its own well construction standards, and recommended the further strengthening of the existing regulatory regime. If thought appropriate, I can arrange for my Department to brief the Committee on the regulation of the offshore petroleum industry and the Commonwealth's response to the Montara Commission of Inquiry. In relation to the supply opportunities for local businesses, the Australian resources sector, as with the Australian economy, operates in a highly competitive global marketplace. Australian resource projects compete with other resource projects around the world for markets, skilled labour and capital investment. Imposing mandated levels of local content on resource projects has the potential to increase project costs such that they are priced out of the global market. Australian industry must be competitive if our resources sector is to sustain the growth of recent years. For example, according to Chevron Australia, the Gorgon liquefied natural gas project is predicted to generate $10 billion in contract benefits for Australian industry and create more than 4,000 jobs in Australia. The Gorgon Project has already let contracts to Australian companies totalling in excess of $7.1 billion. The Australian company Leighton Contractors was awarded an $800 million contract in September 2010 for various construction activities including site services, piping and electrical and instrumentation cabling for Gorgon, and the Western Australian company Monadelphous has been awarded two contracts worth a total $145 million for pipeline works and facilities management. Furthermore, the recently announced $50 million contract with AGC Industries for the supply of steel pipelines to the Gorgon Project shows that small Australian companies can be compete for major contracts. These contracts are examples of Australian companies benefiting from growth in the resources sector. The Australian Government recognises that it has a responsibility to ensure that industry and the wider Australian community share in the benefits of the current resource project expansion. The Australian Government in conjunction with state and territory governments is working with industry to improve the competitiveness of Australian companies when bidding for resource project contracts so that local communities and economies benefit with new jobs and investment. The Australian Government is active in ensuring that project companies develop local content plans and invest locally where it is reasonable to do so. In the 2011-12 Federal Budget the Australian Government committed $34.4 million over four years to encourage better linkages between major projects in the resources sector and capable Australian firms. This includes $27.6 million to expand the Supplier Advocates and Enterprise Connect Programs; $4.4 million to expand Australian supplier's access to major projects through positioning an industry capability specialist in the procurement team of some of the major resources sector projects; and $2.5 million to establish a Resources Sector Supplier Advisory Forum and to employ a Resources Sector Supplier Envoy. Thank you for bringing the concerns raised in the petition to my attention. I trust this information has been of assistance to you. from the Minister for Resources and Energy, Minister for Tourism, Mr Ferguson Statements",23
9,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," I am pleased to take this opportunity to discuss the range of petitions the Petitions Committee considers to be in readiness for presentation to the House. Today's announcement provides a perfect illustration of the breadth of matters brought before the House through the long standing practice of petitioning. It demonstrates a continuing tradition of Australians preparing petitions and collecting support for matters close to their hearts and then bringing them to the attention of their parliament. The House of Representatives petitioning process enables Australians to engage with the House on issues of federal legislation, policy and administration. I also believe that a great strength of the process, fortuitously often underestimated by petitioners themselves, is that the act of petitioning itselfregardless of the outcome-is a powerful mechanism to disseminate information, to air views with the Australian public and to gain support for a matter. Citizens are familiar with the activity of petitioning as a traditional right and they feel comfortable using this means to participate in democratic life at local, regional and national levels. Every petition received by the Petitions Committee is assessed in the same way. The committee considers them for compliance with the House's standing orders and not on the basis of their subject matter or any political views that are expressed in them. This was clear from the multifaceted petitions I have presented today. Every new petition on a subject that is presented in the House receives the same treatment. A petition with one signature receives as much consideration in terms of the request for a ministerial response as does a petition of many thousands of signatures. Today's announcement emphasises this. Three petitions had fewer than 20 signatures, one had more than 10,000 and another had more than 35,000 valid signatures. While a significant signature count will not affect the way a petition is treated the parliamentary process, it could be expected to have other influences and benefits over a petition that is created and signed by a sole petitioner. As a committee, we see great variety in the subject matter of petitions. Unlike other parliamentary committees that usually focus on one or two issues at a time, at any one time we see a picture of a large range of matters that Australians feel they must bring forward for debate and action. Sometimes the matters are very particular, but more often they are regional and national. Today's petitions reflect the span of issues concerning Australians in this decade of the 21st century. They capture a snapshot of the social, political and cultural attitudes of our times. If we were to analyse the petitions tabled in 1917 we would see a microcosm of the attitudes, concerns and social boundaries of Australia at the turn of the 20th century. I suspect we would even be able to see the subtle changes in the suite of petitions tabled in the year 2000 to the recurrent themes of petitions tabled in 2011. Finally, I add that the subject of beer has been a popular one over the years, although the petitions have varied considerably in their support for it. Similarly, in today's presentation we have seen two petitions with opposing views on the subject matter-one requesting the granting of a further pharmaceutical licence in a particular locale, while the other has collected support to maintain the status quo. The petitions will be treated equally and I will be presenting the ministerial responses to each of them in due course. NA Public Accounts and Audit Committee Report",31
10,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES," On in behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report entitled Report 423: Review of Auditor-General's Reports Nos 39 2009-2010 to 15 2010-2011. The committee, as prescribed by its act, examines all reports of the Auditor-General and reports the results of the committee's deliberations to the parliament. This report details the findings of the committee's examination of five performance audits selected for further scrutiny from the 26 audit reports presented to the parliament between May and November 2010. These reports cover a range of agencies and identify a number of areas for improvement in administration including the decision making processes regarding infrastructure projects, the transparency and accessibility of regional grants administration, the failure to achieve value for money in government procurement, and poor governance arrangements for key stimulus climate change programs. Firstly, the committee reviewed the conduct by Infrastructure Australia of the first national infrastructure audit and the development of the infrastructure priority list. We were particularly concerned about the lack of transparency regarding decisions made by Infrastructure Australia. The ANAO found that published methodologies were not followed in determining the priorities list and that Infrastructure Australia did not provide clear advice on the factors influencing key decisions. While we note that Infrastructure Australia is not formally obliged to document the reasons for the council's decision, in the interests of transparency we urge the agency to improve its processes in this area. Secondly, we were also concerned at the lack of documentation when we examined the administration of the strategic projects component of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. In this instance, we would like to register our dissatisfaction with the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government for its failure to provide clear published assessment criteria for the program. This disregard for basic grants administration practice led to a series of problems and as a result the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government did not receive clear recommendations regarding the eligibility or otherwise of applications from the department. However, we also note that, under the financial framework requirements, ministers are expected to obtain agency advice on the merits of each proposed grant before making decisions. This suggests that the minister should have taken the initiative to secure such advice. As a consequence of the lack of documentation in this case, there is no way for the parliament or the public to be sure that due process has been followed. While we accept the department's assurance that it has implemented relevant processes and practices to address the concerns of the ANAO, we expect to see the concrete evidence of improved performance in the future. Thirdly, another long-term concern of this and previous committees is the lack of evidence that value for money is being achieved in Commonwealth procurement. Our review of direct source procurement only served to reinforce these concerns. Again, lack of documentation poses problems by making it difficult to determine if value for money has been achieved. We found that there is a level of confusion over the Commonwealth procurement guidelines. We expect clearer, more concise guidelines as a result of the current review and a greater understanding and application of these guidelines as a consequence of these changes and of our review. We have made a number of recommendations aimed at assisting departments to streamline processes and encourage competency in this area. Finally, we turned our attention to the green loans and home insulation programs. We recognise that both of these programs have been the subject of a number of reviews and consequently we saw our primary role as identifying the lessons learned from the implementation and delivery of both programs. We were particularly concerned by the inadequacy of governance arrangements and the quality of advice provided to ministers. We acknowledge the difficulties caused by tight implementation timeframes, but this does not excuse the lack of executive oversight or the underestimation of key program risks. The issues identified in this selection of audits provide a number of areas for reflection for Australian Public Service agency executives and responsible ministers. Those areas include the need for higher quality advice by departments; increased documentation to provide transparency and accountability; better grants management; improved culture, capacity and supporting tools to ensure value for money in procurement; and adequate governance mechanisms for critical implementation programs. In the 43rd Parliament, it is important to emphasise the non-partisan conclusions drawn from a committee involving ALP, Liberal and Independent members of parliament. I sincerely thank each committee member for the parliamentary spirit in which the work has been done. I also thank the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit secretariat for their ongoing diligence and I note their attendance in the chamberthank you. I commend the report to the House. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (10:15): As Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I rise to speak in support of the committee's report 423: Review of Auditor-General's reports Nos 39 (2009-10) to 15 (2010-11). The committee is responsible for reviewing all the Auditor-General tabled in the parliament. The committee is responsible for reporting the results of the committee's deliberations the parliament, and this responsibility is prescribed by the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951. Report 423 is the first report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit of the 43rd Parliament. In reviewing the Auditor-General's reports tabled between May and November 2010, the committee sought to examine five reports in detail. The audit reports reviewed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit are Audit report No. 2 of 2010-11: Conduct by Infrastructure Australia of the first national infrastructure audit and development of the infrastructure priority list; Audit report No. 3 of 2010-11: The establishment, implementation and administration of the strategic projects component of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program; Audit report No. 9 of 2010-11: Green Loans Program; Audit report No. 11 of 2010-11: Direct source procurement; and Audit report No. 12 of 2010-11: Home Insulation Program. Report 423, before the House today, is the report detailing the findings of the committee's examination of those five performance audits that I have just referred to which were selected by the committee for further scrutiny. As already stated by the member for Lyne, the chair of the committee, these reports cover a range of agencies and identify a number of areas for improvement in administration, including the decision-making processes regarding infrastructure projects, the transparency and accessibility of regional grants administration, the lack of evidence to determine whether value for money is being achieved in government procurement, and poor governance arrangements for key stimulus of the reports of climate change. The role of the committee in examining these reports is primarily to ascertain what to action has been taken or is being taken by the relevant agencies to address the recommendations made by the Australian National Audit Office's reports. The committee heard evidence from the relevant agencies on each of these reports to ascertain whether action is progressing at an acceptable pace and also whether such action is sufficient to address the issues raised within the Auditor-General's reports. Firstly, the committee reviewed the conduct by Infrastructure Australia of the first national infrastructure audit and the development of the infrastructure priority list. The ANAO report found that there was a lack of transparency in relation to the decisions made by this agency. The committee notes that Infrastructure Australia is not obligated to document the reasons for the council's decisions. However, in the interests of transparency in this area, we believe it should be done. It is acknowledged that work is being undertaken by the agency to improve its processes and that the recommendations of the Auditor-General's report were agreed to by the agency. However, the committee, consistent with the ANAO recommendation, has recommended that, in future, Infrastructure Australia provide clear and consistent advice on the level of funding and necessary conditions it recommends for priority projects. In relation to the establishment, implementation and administration of the strategic projects component of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, it is acknowledged both in the ANAO report and in this committee's report program was developed in response to the global financial crisis and, as such, the stimulus had time-critical elements to it. Consequently, some of the errors and problems that we have identified and that were reported by the Auditor-General came about because of those time restrictions. Having said that, there was a lack of clear assessment criteria made available to the local governments, and this led to an oversubscription of the program. What is positive in relation to this program and the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government is that they have indicated that they are making improvements in this area. There have been assurances given and the committee has not made recommendations in relation to this area because of the assurances that were given to the ANAO. In relation to the green loans and home insulation programs collectively, these programs have ceased but the department have given indications that they are implementing recommendations so that they will be able to deal with this better in the future. I believe more work needs to be done in the area of direct procurement. (Time expired)",32

15,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report entitled Report 424: Eighth biannual hearing with the Commissioner of Taxation. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",35
16,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES,"This is the first report into the biannual hearings with the Commissioner of Taxation from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. The hearings are the result of a recommendation made by the committee in Report 410: tax administration. The rationale for the hearings is to provide a mechanism whereby dialogue between the Australian Taxation Office and the parliament could be promoted. Traditionally, the hearings have provided an opportunity for members of the committee to scrutinise issues surrounding tax administration. While there have been public hearings with the Commissioner of Taxation since 2007, no reports have been tabled. The committee in the 43rd Parliament is seeking to expand the parliament's role with regard to the scrutiny of the ATO. Therefore, in a bipartisan way, the committee determined to prepare a report on the biannual hearings to increase scrutiny of the ATO and its transparency to the public. Integrity in tax administration is a critical foundation block of the Australian taxation system. Whilst evidence suggests that in the majority of cases this is done well, the committee is concerned about the increasing number of complaints about the ATO. In keeping with the goal of increasing scrutiny of the ATO, the committee will be enlarging future biannual hearings to include public evidence from external scrutiny and integrity bodies such as the Ombudsman, the Australian National Audit Office and the Inspector General of Taxation as well as from peak industry and consumer bodies. Each of these integrity bodies has expertise upon which the committee can draw when reviewing the operations of the ATO. In addition to greater scrutiny of the ATO, the committee anticipates that among its key responsibilities will be monitoring proposed changes to the taxation system and working to ensure that the ATO is sufficiently supported and positioned to implement any proposed changes. In this report the committee has made a number of recommendations that are aimed at ensuring the ATO provides the committee with sufficient and timely advice prior to the next biannual hearing to facilitate improved scrutiny and ultimately lead to better results. The report includes recommendations that the ATO provide the committee with a submission prior to the next biannual hearing that details the number of and reasons for complaints, the activities the ATO is undertaking to ensure compliance with Australian taxation requirements, the input of the ATO into policy implementation and its response to external scrutiny reports and recommendations. The committee looks forward to working with the ATO to build and foster community confidence in the integrity of the Australian tax system. The committee intends this report to open a dialogue with the ATO and to create a foundation upon which future hearings will build. We look forward to continuing and further cultivating a productive relationship with the ATO, one which encourages and promotes scrutiny and transparency and therefore further increases confidence in the ATO's work. In conclusion, I thank my committee colleagues for their work on this inquiry and the hard working diligent secretariat of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit for their ongoing work. I also thank representatives of the ATO who made themselves available to attend the hearing. I look forward to a positive response from them to these recommendations and to greater interest and oversight from the 43rd Parliament. There are nine recommendations contained in this report. I do hope the ATO, and the tax commissioner in particular, takes them seriously. I commend the report to the House. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (10:24): As Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I rise to speak in support of the committee's report entitled Report 424: Eighth biannual hearing with the Commissioner of Taxation. As the chair of the committee, the member for Lyne, has just stated, it is a responsibility of the committee to hold biannual hearings with the Commissioner of Taxation. These biannual hearings came about as a consequence of recommendations made as a result of an inquiry of the 41st Parliament. Having said that, this is the first time that the committee has actually issued a report in relation to those biannual hearings. As much as those biannual hearings are public hearings, and any of the public can listen to and attend these hearings, this committee believes that it is important that we deliver a report that outlines the evidence that was given at those hearings and, importantly, how we can ensure that there is continued transparency and accountability in relation to the Australian Taxation Office. There are a number of recommendations arising from this report. Some of those recommendations go to the processes of the Taxation Office in relation to public accountability and to having reporting systems that the public can view through public documents and websites. Some of those recommendations go to the information that is reported to the committee itself in the biannual hearings. We hope that we can get some improvements in the material that is brought before us and in accountability of especially the complaints processes and the action on complaints handling being taken by the Australian Taxation Office. I also acknowledge the hard work of the committee secretariat and all of the committee members. The committee has a pretty hefty workload and, consequently, the secretariat has an extensive workload. We do appreciate the work that it does in all of the areas for which the committee has responsibility. I also echo the comments of the chair in relation to the committee's looking forward to working with the Australian Taxation Office to build and foster community confidence in the integrity of the Australian taxation system. It is very important that the public has confidence in this integrity. Our responsibility as a committee is to ensure that the parliament has the materials before it to ensure that integrity and to work cooperatively with the Australian Taxation Office, and also the Australian National Audit Office, to provide transparency and accountability and to build on that confidence in the integrity of the system. This is a good report. I am pleased that the committee has taken the initiative to issue this report and that it will continue to issue reports on biannual hearings. We hope the Australian Taxation Office gives serious consideration to the recommendations made in this report. We look forward to the ATO coming before the committee in its next biannual hearing later this year.",35

Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee Report  behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled Reclaiming Public Space: inquiry into the regulation of outdoor and billboard advertising, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Mr Speaker, I remember that you were sitting in that chair when I first raised this issue in the parliament quite a while ago. I raised concerns about the fact that no-one can avoid outdoor advertising. That is what makes outdoor advertising appealing to advertisers-it cannot be turned off or put away if a consumer wishes to ignore it. People can often put passing images out of their mind, but not when they are on a billboard, on the back of the bus in front of them in traffic, on the bus stop that they use every day or inside the train that they take work. Having seen the dominance of outdoor advertising in my own electorate and being concerned about the images my own children were being exposed to-thank you, Stanley!-I was pleased to lead this inquiry investigating community concerns about the regulation and monitoring of outdoor advertising content. Other members of the committee had similar reservations about the impact of outdoor advertising on all members of society, be they children or adults, women or men, conservative or liberal, or of faith or no faith. The report presented unanimously by the committee. We found that there are many community concerns about the impact of increasing, cumulative and sustained exposure to advertisements that contain sexual, discriminatory or violent material. Those responsible for children had particular concerns about children's exposure to outdoor advertisements for alcohol and overwhelmingly unhealthy foods and beverages. The committee considers that outdoor advertising constitutes a specific category of advertising because of the way that it occupies public spaces, dominates civic landscape and targets captive, unrestricted audiences. As such, the committee concluded that industry self-regulation of advertising standards must incorporate a specific code of practice for outdoor advertising. This code of practice should reflect the particular nature of outdoor advertising, recognising that all members of society are exposed to it and do not have a choice about viewing it. Community sentiment strongly supported the committee's opinion that there is a need to reclaim public space from the interests of commercial advertising. The definition of community standards is a contentious issue given the wide range of views held by all to members of society. Sometimes a single squeaky wheel gets all the grease. More research into community attitudes about outdoor advertising standards should be conducted to increase the public's confidence in decisions about advertising that purport to reflect community norms. Furthermore, the self-regulatory system for advertising as a whole requires strengthening. The committee recommends that the advertising self-regulatory system adopt international best practice measures, including the provision of a prevetting service or independent advice to advertisers is on their advertising content prior to publication and a monitoring role for the Advertising Standards Bureau to promote high levels of compliance with the voluntary advertising codes. These measures should prevent inappropriate outdoor advertising from being displayed in the first instance. This will address some of the concerns about the high visibility of inappropriate outdoor advertising prior to being found to breach the advertising codes. Monitoring of outdoor advertisements will also remove some of the onus on the public to submit complaints. There is no doubt that complaints will still be made, and the committee recognises the role of the ASB in making decisions on these complaints. However, as the current regulatory system is a complaint based one, it is vital that the complaint process is robust and as easy to access as possible. This report contains many recommendations to advertising industry bodies. The committee expects the recommendations to be adopted and implemented by the relevant bodies, as the industry has demonstrated that it is keen to preserve the system of selfregulation. However, the committee recommends that if the industry does not demonstrate over the next few years that self-regulation can appropriately operate within the bounds of community expectations for appropriate outdoor advertising then the Australian government should institute regulatory measures-carrot first, stick later if required. I particularly thank the committee's deputy chair, Judi Moylan, the member for Pearce, for her contribution, and I thank all the members who are in the chamber at the moment and who supported this process so much. Public spaces are for the use of all members of the community-men, women, children, young and old. The right to enjoy the amenity of a space should not be compromised by an advertiser's array of inappropriate images. We have listened to the Australian community during the course of our inquiry. On their behalf, our report says: enough is enough. It is time to reclaim our public spaces. Mrs MOYLAN (Pearce) (10:34): From the outset I acknowledge the excellent work by the Chair of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, the member for Moreton, in the conduct of this inquiry and by my colleagues on this committee. In its submission to the inquiry into the regulation of billboard and outdoor advertising, the Australian Christian Lobby clearly summed up why this inquiry is important. As the member for Moreton has quite rightly said, this notion had widespread acceptance in the many submissions that were made to the committee on this topic. The Australian Christian Lobby stated: By its very nature, outdoor advertising is a public broadcast medium, and because it is static, can be examined more closely by members of the public. It is not possible to filter those who see the advertising and there is no opportunity for members of the community to exercise choice not to see it. I think this is the nub of the problem: because outdoor advertising is so public, often being near impossible to ignore, there is little opportunity for the public to avoid its messages and images, and therefore it is important for the government to consider its impact and indeed the regulatory system and framework around outdoor advertising. The inquiry investigated whether advertising self-regulation is effective for outdoor advertising. The committee found that outdoor advertising is a specific category of advertising that requires its own specific code of practice. The separate code of practice is required because outdoor advertising occupies public space, can be viewed by an unrestricted, untargeted audience and has a cumulative impact on the community through the social messages it conveys. In addition to establishing a code of practice for outdoor advertising, the self-regulatory system in general requires strengthening. That is the real finding of the report. The committee was concerned that the complaints based process placed all the burden of monitoring inappropriate content on the public rather than more responsibility on the regulatory agencies. The Australian Council on Children and the Media noted that billboards and outdoor advertising are one of the least regulated forms of advertising under our legal system. Children in particular can be affected by this form of advertising. The ubiquitous nature of it can make many inured to it, yet it is still playing a significant role in shaping views of young people. Food marketing in particular has been directly linked with children's food choices and their diets. As the majority of food marketing is for unhealthy food such as sugary breakfast cereals, confectionery, high-fat savoury snacks, soft drinks and fast food, the quality of children's diets can be impacted and ultimately affect their health and their weight. Obesity in Australian children has tripled in the past decade, and half of these children will remain obese throughout their adult life, during which they will be four times as likely to contract type diabetes, for example. The Australian Association of National Advertisers' Food and Beverage Code restricts the advertising of unhealthy food products to children. However, outdoor advertising is visible to all, including children, and the advertising messages are absorbed through widespread and constant exposure. The committee was disappointed, for example, that sport sponsorship was not included in the code and recommended that it be recognised as a form of advertising and therefore be subject to advertising codes of practice related to food and children. This report, Reclaiming public space: Inquiry into the regulation of outdoor and billboard advertising, provides an excellent framework for improving the regulation of outdoor advertising and I commend all of the recommendations to the House.",37

Health and Ageing Committee Report,40
23,Mr GEORGANAS,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on 2 Health and Ageing I present the committee's report entitled Before it's too late: inquiry into early intervention programs aimed at preventing youth suicide, together with the minutes of the proceedings. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",40
24,Mr GEORGANAS,COMMITTEES,"In approaching this inquiry into early intervention programs and preventative youth suicide, the committee was concerned that while suicide accounts for a relatively small proportion of deaths overall in Australia each year-around 1.5 per cent for the population as a wholeamong young people suicide rates remain disproportionately high. Statistics from 2009 indicate that suicide was responsible for one in four deaths of young Australian men under the age of 25 and around one in seven young women in that same age group. The committee felt that this regrettable situation warranted further investigation. The report I tabled today is the culmination of that investigation. It is based on the work of current committee and its predecessor in the 42nd Parliament, which had carriage of the inquiry until the 2010 federal election was called. The inquiry was informed by a series of round-table discussions that were conducted between February 2010 and February 2011. During these round-table discussions, the health and ageing committee heard from a range of organisations-some of which promote mental health, well-being and resilience among young people-and, most importantly, from young people who had themselves gone through processes. The information from these discussions was also supplemented by many, many written submissions. An important starting point for the committee was evidence which suggested that measures taken by successive governments had resulted in a decline in youth suicide rates. The committee was keen to learn more about how these measures had contributed to this decline and how to be able to identify what more might need to be done to continue this downward trend. Therefore, the focus of the committee's investigation was on early intervention and prevention. The committee's findings are presented in the report, along with a number of recommendations which, if implemented, the committee believes could contribute to a further reduction in youth suicide rates. committee believes that school based social development and mental health education programs are likely to have a significant impact on preventing suicide by promoting well-being and resilience among young people. A key recommendation is for the inclusion of this type of education in the national curriculum for all primary and secondary school students. Early detection of the young people in need of assistance and referral to the appropriate assistance services is also extremely critical to the prevention of youth suicide. The committee also acknowledges the significant additional support announced under the government's 2010-11 federal budget for programs and services to improve mental health and well-being, including measures which specifically target young people and suicide prevention. Many of those measures announced align very well with the recommendations made by the committee in the report. As I mentioned previously, the committee's inquiry was informed by discussion with young people who had varying experiences with youth suicide, some having lost their family members, siblings or friends, and others who had themselves contemplated or even attempted suicide. It was very moving at that round-table to hear those young people tell us what they had been through, what assisted them and how they had got out of that terrible period in their lives. In particular, the committee would like to express its sincere thanks to those young people who provided confidential yet very candid first-hand accounts of their own experiences. Their contribution was absolutely invaluable and has provided the basis on which this committee has formulated many of its recommendations. In closing, I thank all the committee The members, especially my deputy chair, Steve Irons, the secretariat, all the witnesses who spoke in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth and, of course, those who made written submissions. I commend the report to the House.",40
25,Mr IRONS,COMMITTEES," I rise to talk about the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing report tabled today titled Before it's too late: report on early intervention programs aimed at preventing youth suicide. I also endorse heartily the speech given by the member for Hindmarsh, who is chairman of the committee. The report focused on early intervention programs aimed at preventing youth suicide. I probably do not have enough time today so I look forward to this matter being referred to the Main Committee. The report covered two parliaments, being the 42nd and now the 43rd parliament. I was very pleased when, in the 42nd parliament and under the same chairmanship, we decided to do this inquiry even though the Senate was running an inquiry on suicide. As it states in our report, we felt that, if our inquiry was appropriately focused, it would complement the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. It was good to see the committee in the 43rd parliament decide to continue and finish this report. I also again acknowledge the strong support given by the member for Hindmarsh to finish this inquiry. When I initially requested the committee to look into youth suicide it was because of my personal involvement with groups such as Youth Focus, Esther Foundation and SIDS and Kids. It was also because I had met with parents and families who had experienced the loss of their children through suicide. We know as humans that we are all going to have to deal with the loss of loved ones whether through natural causes, accidents or suicide. As much as we prepare ourselves for tragedies, we find it hard to cope with such a loss. I was inspired by the strength of the people I met and the way they coped with their losses. Such losses have a ripple effect throughout our society, from the parents and the siblings of the children to the friends the communities where the children lived. We can see that from the evidence we took, with cluster suicides now unfortunately becoming more common. This effect was brought home to me in 2004 through the loss of my sister Margaret, who had an accident as a result of binge drinking-an incident which was reported nationally. It was a devastatingly emotional time for me, my family and hundreds of her friends. Even more recently, a friend of mine, Cherlye, has related her personal and family tragedy through the loss of her 11year-old daughter Lauren to a brain tumour. These are examples of losses that people experience through the early death of children, friends or family. I speak about these personal experiences to bring a human touch to the launch of this report about the loss of far too many of our most precious resource: the children and youth of our communities. As a nation we provide many millions of dollars to prevent road accidents and deaths in the workplace. I hope this report will encourage our nation to provide and support early intervention programs that will reduce the number of suicides, whether by youths or older people, who take this step for many differing reasons. It is important to note that suicide is the second most common cause of death in young people, after transport accidents, which in some years account for up to 44 per cent of youth deaths. With just that one factor the committee decided to publish a discussion paper drawing together the evidence that had already been presented, highlighting emerging themes and inviting comment from those who had participated in the inquiry to date. The themes presented in the discussion paper were broadly categorised as collaboration, mental health and literacy and gatekeeper training. The discussion paper also outlined a number of policy proposals that had emerged during 2010 to address youth mental health issues and reduce the rate of youth suicide. These policy proposals were the need for more frontline services, including psychological and psychiatric services; additional support for communities affected by suicide; targeting those who are at greatest risk of suicide; promoting mental health and well-being among young people; additional youth headspace sites; and, additional early psychosis prevention and intervention centres. One area that emerged from the inquiry was the level of concern that the statistics youth suicide are not nationalised and many states kept differing records. This needs to addressed. Statistics on suicide in Australia are available from a number of sources. National data on suicide is published in some years by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The most recent, published in 2007, contains summary statistics on deaths registered in 2005 where the cause of death was determined to be suicide. Even more recent, although less comprehensive, statistics on suicide in Australia are published annually in the ABS Causes of Death report. I conclude by again supporting heartily the recommendations of this report. I look forward to continuing my speech in the Main Committee.",41

28,Mr GEORGANAS,COMMITTEES," I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Main Committee for debate. Question agreed to. NA Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Fair Protection for Firefighters) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bandt.",43
29,Mr BANDT,BILLS," Every of day in Australia, firefighters-including those who are here with us in the gallery be today-put their health on the line to serve the community. They put themselves in danger to regularly protect individuals, families, towns and cities from the threat of fire and sometimes pay the ultimate price in doing so. All members of the public have a deep respect for the service that firefighters perform on our behalf, as the immediate risks are very obvious and apparent for all to see. The longer term risks are often not quite so apparent and obvious but they are nonetheless just as dangerous. I hope that this bill will go some small way to remedying those very significant and real risks. There is no longer any debate about whether firefighting increases the risk of cancer. Numerous studies, predominantly in the US but also in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, have demonstrated very clear links between cancer and firefighting. The largest of these, the LeMasters study of 2007 in Ohio, was conducted over 15 years and looked at dozens of fire departments and over 110,000 firefighters. Though firefighters are generally recruited from the healthiest and fittest amongst us, studies have shown time and time again that firefighters exposed to many structural fires, rather than just a single fire, have a clear increase in the risk of contracting cancer. For example, firefighters start out being 20 per cent healthier than the average member of the public, but after five years the average firefighter will have twice the risk of contracting leukaemia and, after several years in the job, male firefighters find themselves up to 10 times more likely to contract testicular cancer. Despite the best protective clothing and advances in technology and protective gear, firefighters in plastics fires will continue to be exposed to high levels of toxic carcinogens absorbed through the skin-and the associated increased risk of contracting cancer will remain the grisly reality. There are around 70,000 synthetic chemicals in the average home and when they burn they produce a cancer-causing cocktail. No matter how good a firefighter's breathing apparatus is, their uniform must be able to breathe. Many firefighters will tell you of coming back from a fire-sometimes even days after a fire-and finding that the black, thick, cancer-producing smoke has found its way through their gear and into their open pores and into their skin. Other jurisdictions have acknowledged this. The overwhelming majority of states in the United States and Canada have dealt with this issue by introducing legislation to create the same presumption that my bill will create-that the occupation of firefighting is the dominant cause of the contraction of the cancer. In doing so, those states have made it easier for large numbers of firefighters to access workers compensation as a result. The last decade in particular has seen the legislation sweep from state to state in Canada and the experience of firefighters and legislators alike in implementing so called ‘presumptive legislation' across the country has been a very positive one. The bill makes a very simple amendment to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. It makes a small addition to part I of the act which, if passed by the parliament, will provide that if a firefighter has been employed for a certain period before being diagnosed with one of seven types of cancer the employment will be taken can to have been the dominant cause of the contraction of that cancer unless the contrary is established. The cancers are those which have been identified by the relevant studies as being the highest risk to firefightersthese are most often cancers of those areas which are the filters of the body. The bill identifies seven key cancers which have been shown to have these clear links-brain, bladder, kidney, breast and testicular cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukaemia-and leaves open the option of the minister adding to the list by regulation, based inevitably on wider scientific justification of course. These provisions will be restricted to those firefighters who have been actively involved in firefighting duties proper and require firefighters to have served for a minimum number of years before being diagnosed with the relevant primary site cancer. The qualifying periods are different for each cancer and are justified, again, by the best studies available. I do have another five minutes but I would like, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, and with the leave of the House, to now hand over to two other members from different political parties. I think it is a tribute to the lobbying work which has been done by the firefighters, many of whom are here today, that this is being approached in a non-partisan way. It is my hope that this bill proceeds through this place and ultimately through the Senate, with the support of all political parties.",43
30,Ms VAMVAKINOU,BILLS," by leave-I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Fair Protection for Firefighters) Bill 2011 and I am very pleased to join both the member for Melbourne and the member for MCMillan in jointly sponsoring the bill. I recently spoke in parliament at greater length about the need to introduce presumptive legislation for Australian firefighters, so today I simply want to reiterate my support for this very important issue and make the point that, while we all very often acknowledge the lifesaving work of our firefighters in this place-and we have done it on many occasions-we also need to acknowledge the human cost that their profession bears on their health and well-being, as well as the cost to their families. Presumptive legislation is a legislative instrument which stipulates the health risks directly associated with an occupation by identifying diseases or conditions that have been shown to be hazards associated with that occupation-in this case, the firefighting profession. Presumptive legislation is not without precedents. Presumptive legislation now exists in seven Canadian provinces and some 43 US states. Legislation is also now being considered in Europe. It is therefore time for this parliament to get the ball rolling on this issue and we do so today through the introduction of this private member's bill. Scientific evidence, through international studies, has shown that there is a visibly higher rate of cancer related illnesses amongst firefighters than amongst the general population. Again, because the member for Melbourne has so comprehensively referred to the LeMasters study, which forms the basis of the international studies, I will not make any further reference to it. I simply want to make the point that the conditions identified are not an exhaustive list of diseases but rather an evidence based list of those diseases which have been identified to have a direct link with the firefighting profession. The bill identifies the main cancer related illnesses which have disproportionate rates of incidence amongst firefighters when compared with the general population. That is a very important point to make. This is an important and timely bill relating to a very important profession and I am pleased to be part of a process which brings this issue to the attention of the House. In doing so, I acknowledge the many firefighters who are in the gallery here today, keeping a very close eye on the progress of this bill.",44
31,Mr BROADBENT,BILLS," by leave-I was asked this morning on Gippsland radio why I was cuddling up to Adam Bandt on this issue of fair protection for firefighters. Although Adam is not quite my style-Maria is more my style-my answer was this: this is not about Adam Bandt or Russell Broadbent or Maria Vamvakinou or even Senator Gavin Marshall, who has been very helpful in this regard. It is actually about firefighters, their families and their future. It is not about us; it is not even about the parliament. It is the process of the parliament, which the member for Calwell has just referred to, that is important. I commend the member for Melbourne, the member for Calwell and Senator Gavin Marshall for their support for this proposal. While I am doing that I want to commend all the firefighters who have gone before us. Recently we celebrated 100 years of the Firefighters Union in Victoria-a very important occasion. We honour those people who have gone before us and paved the way. This particular matter is about firefighters, their future and what they do for us. This parliament, rising above all other concerns, has to address the issues faced by a very specialised group in our community. If we can come on board with what has happened internationally and we can support these people in their endeavours, it is up to us as a parliament to go through these processes, investigate them and bring this legislation forward for the benefit of firefighters. I am very proud to associate myself with firefighters right across Australia. Even as a 12-year volunteer firefighter I cannot identify what it is like to face the issues face every day of their working lives. I wish them all the best and I hope this bill is progressed. Bill read a first time.",45
32,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Abbott.",46
33,Mr ABBOTT,BILLS," I am very happy to introduce the Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011. The carbon tax which the government proposes to introduce in this term of parliament is the biggest policy change in Australia's history. It should not be introduced without giving the Australian public a chance to have their say, clearly and unambiguously, on this matter. Let us be under no illusion about the magnitude of this bill. This carbon tax proposes to change the way every single Australian lives. It proposes to make it harder for us to turn our air conditioners on and it proposes to make it more difficult for us to use transport, because air conditioning uses power and power in this country is produced by coal and coal emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and our transport is powered by fossil fuels and the use of fossil fuels emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So the government's carbon tax, should it become law, will substantially, indeed dramatically, change the way every Australian lives-and it is supposed to do that. This is not an inadvertent consequence of the carbon tax; the carbon tax deliberately sets out to do that. The carbon tax not only changes the way we live; it is designed to change the way we work. Every Australian they business is supposed to use less power, thanks to the carbon tax. If it has to use power, it is supposed to use power from less emitting power sources, thanks to the carbon tax. If there is no choice but to continue to use power from emitting sources, under the carbon tax industries are supposed to reduce in size and ultimately close down. That is the whole purpose of a carbon tax. It is almost impossible to exaggerate the consequence of the carbon tax over time for the way Australians live and work. A change of this magnitude should be put to the Australian people for them to have their say. It should have been put to the Australian people at the last election, but it was not. It should be put to the Australian people at the next election, but as far as this government is concerned it will not be. That is why it is important that I introduce this bill into the parliament, to give the Australian people their say in the only way that is open to me as a member of this parliament. We all remember the Prime Minister's pre-election statement, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' She made that statement six days before the last election, and does anyone think for a moment that the result of that election would have been the same had she had the honesty and the decency to say to the Australian people six days before the poll, 'There will be a carbon tax under the government I lead'? The Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer described claims that there would be a carbon tax were the government to be returned as nothing less than hysterical allegations. This is a Prime Minister and this is a government that hold office under false pretences, and it is important that this Prime Minister and this government be given the opportunity to make an honest politician and an honest government of themselves by putting this carbon tax to the people. It would be much better were the Prime Minister simply to go to an election and seek a mandate for this carbon tax, but we know she will not do that. I cannot force an election; only the Prime Minister can call an election and only this House can force an election by successfully voting no confidence in the government. There is not the disposition in this House to do that at this stage, but this House can force a vote by supporting this bill and that is why it is so important that this legislation be presented the House. This bill will determine this matter. If there is a vote the matter will be determined. I want to make it absolutely crystal clear that should my bill succeed and should this matter of a carbon tax be put to the people, that will determine this matter. It may not change the arguments, but it will certainly settle the politics. It is absolutely inconceivable that a government faced with a popular vote against a carbon tax would continue with its current policy. Conversely, I have to say that it is absolutely inconceivable that an opposition faced with a vote in favour of a carbon tax would continue to oppose it. So I say, 'Let's have the vote and settle this matter once and for all.' My bill has three effective provisions. Firstly, this question would be submitted to the electors: do you support the government's plan to introduce a price on carbon to deal with climate change? It is a very simple question; it is not a loaded question. Why is the government scared of putting that question to the people? Secondly, that question should be put to the people at a national plebiscite no later than the last Saturday in November this year. And thirdly, I provide in my bill the significant point that the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 should apply to the plebiscite, which would mean that there would be a compulsory vote. Everyone would vote on this. One way or another, the matter will be decided. The government should not run scared of the Australian people. If the arguments for a carbon tax are as clear and as convincing as members of this government say, let us have a vote. Let us put the arguments to the people, have the debate and accept the result of the people's vote. I am prepared to accept the result of the people's vote and the government should be prepared to accept the result of the people's to vote. Let us have that vote and let us accept the result. Let us bring it on. We have many vigorous debates in this chamber and that is the way it should be, but at the end of the day all of us in this House are democrats. All of us in this House accept the result of the people's vote. We may not like the people's judgment, but at the end of the day we all have to accept it. I am committing the coalition to accepting the people's judgment. The government should not run away from the people's judgment. Let us give the people their chance to pass judgment on this carbon tax because it is the single biggest policy change that the Australian people have ever had put before them. This bill gives members on this side, on the other side and on the cross benches of this House a chance to say where they stand. Are they in favour of letting the people have their say or do they want a parliament with no mandate for a carbon tax to try to sneak it in through legislation? It would be absolutely shameful of this parliament-a parliament utterly without a mandate for a carbon taxto decide this matter. It is high time we have a vote-preferably an election, but if not an election, let us have a plebiscite. Let us have more democracy and less hypocrisy from this government. Bill read a first time.",46
34,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Air Services (Aircraft Noise) Amendment Bill 2011 First Reading Bill presented by Ms Moylan. Mrs MOYLAN (Pearce) (11:13): From the outset, I thank the member for Swan for seconding the Air Services (Aircraft Noise) Amendment Bill 2011 and for his input into the drafting of it. In October 2009 I came into this place and made the comment that it is incumbent on the government to reexamine the act governing Airservices Australia to ensure rigorous public accountability and to make provision for a more consistent approach to changes to air routes. The issue of aircraft noise is a significant one for people in every state of Australia. Since March 2009 my office has been handling frequent constituent complaints from affected residents who have raised questions about why changes were made to flight paths in the eastern suburbs of Perth without adequate community consultation. With the support of the Senate, the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport conducted an inquiry into the effectiveness of Airservices Australia's management of aircraft noise. It became obvious during the course of that inquiry that there is a lack of consistency Australia-wide in dealing with flight path changes. Also apparent was a lack of public confidence in the processes around changing flight paths and around the handling of complaints in relation to aircraft noise. This amending legislation seeks to remedy these inconsistencies and to place in legislation many of the recommendations of that Senate inquiry. It took more than six months from the release of the inquiry report for the government to respond. Recommendation 10, the appointment of an Aircraft Noise Ombudsman, is the only recommendation fully implemented so far by the government. The objective of this bill is to require Airservices Australia to consult and cooperate with government, commercial, industrial, consumer and other relevant bodies and organisations in the modification of existing flight paths and in the creation of new ones. Integral to this is a complaints process which must be properly explained to the public and relevant bodies, with details of community consultation to be published. Airservices Australia must advise the minister responsible for the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 when changes to airspace are likely. Following this, a community aviation advocate will be employed for the duration of the consultation process and until the new flight paths or changes to airspace are implemented. The automatic referral of the bill to the EPBC Act eliminates the grey areas in dealing with this matter. Previously Airservices Australia self assessed environmental impacts and referred to the minister responsible for this act where changes were significant. What is deemed to be significant is something that is open to interpretation. A community aviation advocate is to be appointed when the minister is advised of the proposed changes to airspace. The role will assist, inform and advocate on behalf of affected communities. Airservices Australia must also propose a plan for the management of flight paths relating to Perth which may be either the current plan or a changed plan. This potentially includes a new consultation around the Western Australia Route Review Project of 2008-the review that led to the changes which have severely affected residents in the Pearce electorate as well as in the electorates of Canning, Swan and Hasluck and to a lesser extent in the electorates of Stirling and Cowan. The impact of changes to aircraft flight plans on individuals and families should not be underestimated. In a survey sent out to affected households in the electorate of Pearce in 2009, 85 per cent of respondents reported an increase in air traffic within their local area. It is alarming, though, that almost 90 per cent of those respondents reported that they were not aware of any proposal to change the flight paths within their local area prior to November 2008 when the changes were made. A focal point of this bill is improving Airservices' consultation processes, which were lacking during the Western Australia Route Review Project. It is clear that there is strong bipartisan support for an improved community consultation process to be undertaken by Airservices when making decisions on flight paths. The current Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the member for Grayndler ,was very vocal on this point while in opposition. In 2001, he said: The practical impact of aircraft noise on the people in the communities that I represent is much greater than suggested by theoreticians, forecasters who sit comfortably in offices in Canberra. I could not agree more. In 1999, the member for Grayndler also presented a bill to establish an aviation noise watchdog and advocated for an ombudsman, and he said: Any changes to aircraft routes over populated areas will have to be examined by the aviation noise ombudsman. The aviation noise ombudsman will ensure that committee complaints regarding excessive aircraft noise ... are heard without bias and judged fairly on the merits of the case. The automatic referral of the flight path changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 will ensure the consultation process considers environmental impacts. Apart from the impact of aircraft noise, there is the matter of the pollution caused by high-density flights. A key objective of this bill is to legislate to ensure an effective noise complaint service. This will involve a detailed commentary on complaints and annual reports, including the efficiency and the effectiveness of the complaints processes. I was very pleased to read the 11 February review of complaints handling by the new Aircraft Noise Ombudsman, who was appointed just after the election-as I said, one of the 10 recommendations that was actually acted on by the government. The Aircraft Noise Ombudsman clearly indicated in his report that there have already been some changes made to improve this process. That is enormously important. The ability for the public to lodge a complaint and register frustration is vital. In releasing his review of Airservices Australia's handling of noise complaints, the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman, Mr Ron Brent, said that significant changes to the way complaints are handled and recorded were needed. Airservices Australia have acknowledged the need to improve the these processes. In the report, Mr Brent said: By adopting a solution-driven approach it is more likely that cases where something can be changed will be identified. At the same time, it is important that information provided to complainants responds specifically to the issues raised in each individual case. The report recommends that the focus should shift to an increased emphasis on the underlying issues. The benefits of this will be that Airservices Australia can devote more resources to investigating and resolving complaints and complainants will not feel obliged to spend excessive time and effort lodging many complaints to have ongoing or recurring issues addressed. In the long process of consultation to bring this bill into parliament, I was very fortunate to have a community group, many of whom had some experience in aircraft noise issues, who set up a website called FairSkies. I am very grateful for the constructive way in which members of my community who have been affected by the changes to aircraft flight paths over Perth have worked with me to ensure that this bill would become a reality and could be introduced into this parliament today. I am particularly grateful to those members of FairSkies who met regularly: Mr   John Daw. I would also like to thank the clerks for their assistance in the drafting of this bill. I commend the bill to the House and, indeed, the government. Bill read a first time.",48
35,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Education Funding  Opposition Business) (11:23): I move: That this House: (1) acknowledges the importance of the role that non-government schools play in reflecting the diversity of Australian society and serving a broad range of students, including those from a variety of religions, social backgrounds, regions, and socio-economic circumstances; (2) supports the continuation of a funding model into the future that distributes funds according socio economic need and which recognises that every non-government school student is entitled to a basic level of government funding; (3) calls on the Government to continue to support parents in their right to choose a school which they believe best reflects their values and beliefs, by not penalising parents who wish to make private contributions towards their child's education, nor discouraging schools in their efforts to fundraise or encourage private investment; (4) notes the many submissions made to the Review of Funding for Schooling by non government sector authorities requesting that changes to school funding arrangements not leave schools or students worse off in real terms; (5) acknowledges that any reduction in government funding for non-government schools would need to be addressed by increasing the level of private income required to be raised by the school community (such as school fees), or through a reduction in the quality of the educational provision in affected schools; and (6) calls on the Government to make a clear commitment to the continuation of current funding levels to all non-government schools, plus indexation, and for this to be the basic starting point of any new funding model resulting from the Review of Funding for Schooling process. The issue of non-government school funding is at the moment like a train coming down a tunnel for parents in non-government schools across Australia. There are 1.2 million students in non-government schools across this country, which means about 2.4 million of parents who send their children to nongovernment schools. All of those parents are, and should be, concerned, the principals of non-government schools are concerned, and all the organisations representing nongovernment schools should be very concerned about the government's response to what the David Gonski review of nongovernment school funding hands down by the end of this year. If the government to responds badly to that report, if it missteps on non-government school funding, there could be catastrophic impacts on the nongovernment school sector. If the nongovernment school sector loses funds, one of two things can occur: either non-government schools will need to push up their school fees-and at a time of major cost-of-living pressures the last thing that families need an increase in their school fees-or potentially there will be the sacking or removal of many, many teachers in order to meet the shortfall in funds. The Labor-Greens government has done very little to ameliorate the concerns of the non-government school sector. We in the coalition have been pointing out to the government for months and months the impact of not responding appropriately to non-government school funding reviews such as this one. Let us remember that the coalition are committed to indexing nongovernment school funding from the Commonwealth based on the current quantum of funds. In the event that the government chooses not to do this, and so far it has failed to commit to it-the minister in fact said that schools will not get one dollar less than they currently get, which he thinks is a clever, tricky way of convincing schools that they have nothing to be concerned about, but of course the semantics are not lost on the non-government school sector-and it continues to support nongovernment schools only to the tune of the current quantum of funding then over the next quadrennium of funding $4.2 billion less will be paid to the non-government school sector. That is $4.2 billion across of the non-government schools in Australia, which would have a massive impact on the resources available to non-government schools. Those schools would have to replace that $4.2 billion either by increasing their school fees dramatically or by cutting teachers. Conservative estimates suggest that if the schools choose not to put up their school fees, at a time of real cost-of-living pressures, then they will have to sack 56,000 teachers in non-government schools. If they push up their fees to the tune of $4.2 billion is then obviously some parents simply will not be able to afford that increase in fees, which will mean schools will lose students. This is such a serious matter-there are many schools that will actually close their doors if the government fails to index their funding based on the current quantum of funds-yet the government continues to obfuscate and to be unclear about what it believes schools in the non-government sector deserve in funding from the Australian taxpayer. I will give just a couple of examples. In my own electorate of Sturt, Mary MACKillop College, which was founded and is still run by the Sisters of Saint Joseph-and of course Mary MACKillop was the founder of the Sisters of Saint Joseph order-would lose $2 million over four years, in real terms, which has equates to $3,985 per student. Mary MACKillop is not a high-fee school. I note for the minister at the table, the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare, that this school is on the border of our electorates, on Portrush Road between the Adelaide and Sturt electorates. She is deathly silent about the impact of not indexing school fees for non-government school students, yet many of the students in Norwood and across her electorate would be students at Mary MACKillop College. While I all am standing up for the students in my electorate by insisting that we have indexation on top of the quantum that is currently paid to non-government schools, the minister at the table, the member for Adelaide, is deathly silent and refuses to commit. But I give her the opportunity: she can speak on this motion if she chooses to and she can commit to funding for nongovernment schools like Mary MACKillop College. There is another example which impacts on both the minister at the table, the for Adelaide, and myself: Kildare College. Kildare College, in the north of my electorate, is very close to the border between the member for Adelaide's electorate and my electorate and it would lose $1.4 million in funding if there were no indexation of non-government school funding over the next four years, which is over $4,000 per student. Kildare College is fee school that caters for many students low-socio-economic-status backgrounds in the north-east of Adelaide, yet the government continues to leave those people swinging in the breeze without a clear indication that their funding will be maintained into the future at current levels plus indexation. The government's partners in government, the Greens, have a quite radical proposal for non-government school fees. They wish to reduce the funds from the government to 2003 levels. This would completely annihilate schools in the non-government school sector across Australia. Yet, because the government, the Labor Party, are in fear of the Greens, they are yet to come out and condemn the Greens for their policy on nongovernment schools-and they have had every opportunity to do so. The minister, Mr Garrett, has been stone silent about the Greens' policy for non-government school funding. Why don't the government slam the Greens' proposal to reduce funding to 2003 levels, which would decimate the nongovernment school sector? Yet the government remain silent. The other aspect to this motion is the support for 'funding maintained' schools. Funding maintained has been a part of the SES funding model since 2001. It has been a part of it from day one. It is as much a part of the current funding of non-government schools as any other part. There are 1,075 member schools-out of 2,650-that are funding maintained schools. If those funds were to be withdrawn, nine schools in Sturt would lose over $4 million per annum in funding, being removed from them if funding maintained does not continue. These figures might mean very little to the ideologically driven government of Labor and the Greens but to parents, principals and teachers they mean a lowjobs and they mean more cost-of-living from pressure that they cannot face. The vast majority of these households will have mortgages on their homes and the vast majority will be struggling to pay their grocery bills every week. Yet this government continues to leave them hanging in the balance without any clear indication of whether it will support indexation going forward or of whether it will support funding maintained. I commend the motion to the House and look forward to the member for Adelaide finding her courage.",50
36,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is there a seconder for the motion?,52
37,Ms ODWYER,BILLS, I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,52
38,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," I rise to speak against the motion moved by the member for Sturt. The member for Sturt is continuing a tradition, one that we have seen all too often in this House, of those opposite running a mobile scare campaign. We have seen this strongly in the carbon pricing debate with the Leader of the Opposition trawling the country and coming into this parliament arguing that petrol prices were going to go up under an emissions trading scheme. It is simply not true. The Leader of the Opposition has misled parliament over this issue. We now have the member for Sturt moving a motion on funding for nongovernment schools which seeks to spread fear and misinformation. It is important to return to the basic facts. The Gillard government is committed to delivering a quality education to every student in Australia. Those of us on this side of the House believe that the public versus private debate is one that can be put to rest. What is important is focusing on students and student needs, not trying to reopen ideological wars which are done and dusted. In my electorate there are many nongovernment schools of which I am extremely proud. I spoke recently at the opening of a new school building as part of Burgmann Anglican College, a low-fee school that serves the area of Gungahlin. At that opening the students expressed a great sense of pride in Bishop Ernest Burgmann, who the school is named after and who carried on a great tradition of social justice. I spoke at that opening of the work that Bishop Burgmann did throughout the community, work which was really critical to building a stronger community in the post-war decades, work that I am glad to say has been carried on by his granddaughters, Margaret Watt and Meredith Burgmann, among others. I am also proud to have visited Holy Spirit Primary School, a non-government school that shares playing fields with Gold Creek public school and whose teachers on duty in the playgrounds have decided, much in the spirit of doing away with unnecessary public-private divides, that children should be encouraged to play sport, that every time there is a sporting team it should not be Gold Creek versus Holy Spirit and that any sporting games that are played at recess or lunch need to have mixed teams involving some Holy Spirit kids and some Gold Creek kids on each side. They are showing how you can break down these artificial publicprivate divides, much as it would be nice to see those in the House doing the same. Merici College, in my electorate, is involved in a trades training centre, ensuring that students have the opportunity to begin trades training before they finish their school education. Merici College is working with a group of non-government schools to ensure that students have the chance to get trades training. These are, perhaps, students who would otherwise have left school a few years earlier and now stay on and get that essential trades training. Through these important non-government schools, as through the many government schools in the Fraser electorate, quality education is being delivered day in and day out. I pay tribute to the great principals, teachers and administrative staff who are involved in that effort. Much of their work often goes unthanked but certainly should be recognised here in this House. As part of the government's commitment to recognising that the divide between government and non-government schools should be broken down whenever possible, we have put in place a low SES national partnership and we have put in place an improving teacher quality national partnership. Part of those national partnerships are being delivered through non-government schools. For example, the CharnwoodDunlop government school in Charnwood receives assistance through the low SES national partnership and the St Thomas Aquinas Primary School in Charnwood receives assistance through the literacy and numeracy national partnership. These partnerships recognise that we need to focus on need and not simply focus on the system that runs the school. We are a government which has delivered $64 billion worth of investment and reform in Australia's schools. That is almost double what was delivered by those opposite in the last four years of the Howard government. This investment has been delivered, in large part, through a historic nation-building school infrastructure program. Often, when I visit schools and have the great opportunity to open new school infrastructure, principals and members of the school community say: 'This really is historic, isn't it? It is hard for me to ever imagined in my working life that we would see a federal government that would have the vision and the foresight to invest in the school infrastructure of the future.' And they speak to me about the impact the new school infrastructure is making on the educational achievements of their schools. There are schools like Amaroo School which is now able to engage in team teaching thanks to newly designed rooms with walls that open up between the classrooms. For example, a teacher who is a superstar in literacy and one who is doing great work in numeracy might be placed in classrooms side-by-side so that they learn from each other in a team teaching environment. The new school infrastructure allows investment such as in Black Mountain School where, for the first time, a student in a wheelchair who is receiving an award does not have to stay in front of the stage to receive the award, but can go onto the stage and receive the award just like the students who are able to walk onto the stage. It is a simple piece of infrastructure that provides dignity to the school and to the school community. The member for Sturt has really become increasingly hysterical over the school funding issue. It is another scare campaign and it is a divisive and inflammatory scare campaign. It is not something that, sadly, we should be surprised about from the current opposition which is opposing absolutely everything that is put forward. The member for Sturt is at odds with his former Liberal Party colleague Brendon Nelson who has acknowledged that the system needs reform and that the funding maintenance was a transitional measure put in place a decade ago. The member for Sturt is, of course, committed to the Gonski review, but is also have committed to continuing the current SES funding model. It is a particularly confused approach that the member for Sturt is pursuing. The Gonski review is a once in a generation chance and an opportunity to really think hard about the best school funding model for the future. That is what a responsible government does. We pursue policies aimed at the long game, policies aimed at getting school funding right for all students. The government has provided some certainty in the parameters that sit around this review. We have said that no school will lose a dollar of funding as a result of the review. We said that current funding arrangements for non-government schools will be extended to the end of 2013 and to the end of 2014 for capital funding. The panel has been asked to provide advice on appropriate transitional arrangements to help schools move easily and fairly to any new funding arrangements. As I noted earlier, the Gillard government has made record investments in these schools. These schools have benefited to a large extent through the record investments made under this government. The Smarter Schools National Partnership is yet another form of investment that has been put in place. In the ACT schools national partnerships for low SES school communities and improving teacher quality have led to more than $500,000 in facilitation funding. On 28 June more than $1.9 million in reward funding was provided to the ACT for its progress in achieving the targets set under the National Partnership on Literacy and Numeracy. I am particularly proud to serve in a government which has invested so much in public and in private schools across the board. Unfortunately, the coalition has continued its scare campaign. The member for Sturt told the House of Representatives on 3 March of this year that: It has long been the coalition's policy to maintain the existing SES funding model ... Yet, he said to the Christian Schools National Policy Forum on 23 May: This review process is welcome and needed. ... So, it is very hard to see where the member for Sturt sits on this issue. Of course, we in the Gillard government will continue the long work of reforming and investing in our schools because we know that a great education is great economic policy, great social policy and, of course, great education policy.",52
39,Ms ODWYER,BILLS," I rise in support of the motion put forward by the member for Sturt, the shadow minister for education, and I would advise the member for Fraser, who I was listening to very carefully before, to read very carefully the motion that is before the House. It appears to me that in his entire speech he did not talk about the funding mentioned in the motion, the risk to independent schools because the government is not prepared to guarantee funding. When the Prime Minister said that she was going to undertake the Review of Funding for Schooling she said that school funding should be based on 'simplicity, flexibility, stability, equity, value for money, transparency and best practice'. That might all sound fine but, sadly for the parents of Australia and particularly for the parents in my electorate of Higgins, she neglected to include in that list of items what has been a touchstone in education funding since Menzies first provided government funding for non-government schools-that is, the fundamental principle of choice. This side of the House very strongly believes that it is fundamental for parents to have the choice as to where they send their child to school. Parents best understand the needs of their child. They best understand what school will meet their child's academic needs, sporting needs and extracurricular needs. They also best understand the values that they hold dear, the school that they think best reflects those values and the sorts of innovative educational practices that they would like their child to experience. The mantra from the opposite side of the House has been that government funding should be focused on schools not on students. I think it is important for us to look at the facts. In my home state of Victoria, according to the 2008-09 figures, independent schools received $5,143.25 per student. By contrast, government schoolsand this is the combined government funding-received $12,381.53 per student. So, when you look at the funding per student, independent school students in Victoria receive less than half the amount that government school students receive. The majority of funding for independent schools, around 66 per cent, comes from parents and from the school community. It is estimated that in the state of Victoria this saves taxpayers around $1 billion and that when you look at it nationwide it saves just over $3 billion. Yet it is clear from the latest funding review and from the lack of government commitment to maintain funding for schools in real terms-in particular they are completely silent on the issue of indexation-that Latham's ghost still haunts the policy mantra of the government. In fact, Julia Gillard is haunted by Latham a little bit like Banquo's ghost. We are seeing here the revival of the hit list on schools. Of the 42 schools in my electorate of Higgins, 19 are already on that hit list-schools like St Mary's School, St Joseph's Primary School, The Currajong School, Holy Eucharist School, Korowa Anglican Girls School, Lauriston Girls School, Loreto Mandeville Hall, Our Lady of Lourdes School, Our Lady of Victories Primary School, Presentation College, St Anthony's Primary School, St Catherine's School, St Cecilia's Primary School, St Roch's Primary School, Geelong Grammar School Glamorgan, The King David School, Sacre Coeur, De La Salle College and St Kevin's College. Combined, these schools are going to lose $29 million, if they lose indexation going into 2017. This is going to come at significant cost. Of course these schools will have to either increase fees or cut what they are offering. In some cases schools have told me that they will in fact close their doors. But this is only the start of the government's radical agenda. It is very fitting that we should be discussing this motion today because of course the Greens hold the balance of power in the Senate. Lee Rhiannon has had a lot to say on the issue of school funding. We know already that the Greens would like to stop all government funding for independent schools. They have brought motions before the New South Wales parliament in order to be able to achieve that. We are going to see similar motions introduced into the Senate. This government are in coalition with the Greens. They need to stand up for Australian students. They need to guarantee funding; otherwise, education is at risk.",55
40,Mr RIPOLL,BILLS," It is important to start this debate by saying that Australia has a world-class education system that is providing top outcomes for all children who attend schools in Australia. The principals, the teachers, the staff and parents I meet when I visit schools in Oxley, and in other places as well, are hard working and dedicated people. I acknowledge that there are issues in the system that need to be fixed, and that is why this government is working hard doing the things that the previous government did not do to address those specific issues. The motion put by the member for Sturt is nothing more than scaremongering and fear tactics and bears no relationship to the reality of school funding or to the issues that we are dealing with here today. In reality, and as best as is possible, this government is doing the hard work that was not done in the past. the The Gillard government is backing its commitment to a great education for all students, not just schools, with record investment in schooling of over $64 billion across four years in government and nongovernment schools. That is almost double the amount that was invested by the previous government in their last term. We are committed to ending the ideological war regarding school funding that has gone on in this country for almost 50 years-far too long-and that is why we have tasked a panel of eminent Australians, led by Mr David Gonski, to conduct the Review of Funding for Schooling. We have made it clear to the panel that the review needs to be an open and transparent process, with all Australians who care about the future of schooling given a chance to have their say, and that is exactly what is taking place, with thousands of submissions from people and stakeholders right across the country. People do have a view-a strong view. It ought to be about the educational outcomes of individual students. A thriving and fully-functioning education system needs to include both government and non-government schools. Each of them plays a vital and important role. All schools in Australia play an important role in reflecting the diversity in Australian society. It is we who are breaking down the barriers that have existed for far too long. But every time. I hear speeches from the opposite side they want to reintroduce the ideological warfare. They want to reintroduce the discussions about private versus public and government versus non-government. We thought that that debate was long gone, buried and dead, and it is not we on the government side who are talking about those issues. We are talking about reform. We are talking about funding. We are talking about changing a system which everybody agrees no longer works-a system that is opaque, that is complex and that muddies the waters in terms of educational outcomes. Yet the opposition want to have it both ways. You hear the member for Sturt in this place saying that he fully supports the review by David Gonski but, at the same time, he does not want it. Those opposite want to keep the old system but, at the same time, they want reform. It is simple: you cannot have it both ways; you cannot walk both sides of the street. It is far too easy for people like the member for Sturt to come into this place when in opposition and basically introduce scaremongering, fear tactics, and a campaign that just opposes, when everybody knows and acknowledges in the education sector that there needs to be significant change. We cannot continue with the old system, we cannot continue with the ideological division and we cannot continue with these old tired debates of one school versus another, of a government school versus a non-government school. It ought to be about educational outcomes; it ought to be about individual students; and it ought to be about their needs to make sure that, in the end, their education, a world-class education, is the government's No. 1 priority. That is why this government stands firm on the Gonski review to make sure that we get it right, to make sure that we have a transparent, open process-a process that is simpler, a process that delivers funding to all students and to all schools and that it does so fairly and equitably and for the right reasons. We have made it clear through this process that we have not as yet made a decision on an outcome, because an outcome cannot be made until we see the recommendations of the review. But we have made this clear: no school will lose a single dollar per student as a result of this review. It is important to note that. Government needs to make that commitment so that we can ease the fears that are being placed in the hearts and minds of students, teachers and parents. Current funding arrangements for nongovernment schools have also been extended to the end of 2013 and for capital funding to the end of 2014. All of this is being done at a time when this government has been at the forefront of delivering what is once-in-ageneration funding to schools and capital investment through the Building the Education Revolution. Halls, schools and buildings are working to help deliver a better educational outcome. (Time expired)",56
41,Mr WYATT,BILLS," I rise today to support the motion put forward by the member for Sturt. I would suggest that the House acknowledges the importance of all education sectors in the provision of education for children regardless of whether they are in the government or non-government sector. If we as a nation want to capitalise on and improve the pathways for society and our quality of life then education is a significant element in achieving that. I also want to say that parents choose schools for educational, religious and socio-economic reasons, and for those choices we should not diminish them but rather allow them that opportunity. Their decision to pay for an element of education should never be diminished by the fact that this Australian government has a responsibility to all. The funding, whilst guaranteed, does not include the CPI indexing or future arrangements beyond 2013 and 2014. In my electorate of Hasluck, non-government schools such as La Salle College, Lumen Christi College, Mary's Mount Primary School, Matthew Gibney Catholic Primary School, Mazenod College, Sacred Heart Primary School and St Brigid's College all stand to be unfairly prejudiced by the Gillard Labor government. The coalition of course supports a funding model that encourages private investment in non-governments schools and allows them to receive adequate support in real terms from government. Disappointingly, Labor has made no such commitment beyond 2013 when the current funding model is due to expire. For example, La Salle College in Middle Swan, which has a fantastic sporting and Indigenous student program, stands to lose more than $547,000 under Labor's plans. Then there is Mazenod College in Lesmurdie, which faces the loss of over $864,000. And $230,000 would disappear from Mary's Mount Primary School, while St Brigid's College will have more than $1 million slashed from its budget if the Gillard government gets its way. Recently, I ran the Hasluck Leadership Awards, a non-partisan search for young leaders within our secondary public and private schooling systems. One of the two finalists came from St Brigid's College. Her family are not 'elite' as the Greens and Labor's left would describe them. ",57
42,Mr WYATT,BILLS,"This student is the child of hard-working people who have dedicated their resources to seeing their child receive the sort of education they have chosen for her. The member for Moreton would probably have a number of constituents within his electorate who are facing the same problems. So I would hope that he would support funding that is of an equal nature to all students in his electorate. For her parents, that choice lies within the non-government schooling sector. The Australian government should continue to support the right of parents to choose a school for their children that best reflects their values and beliefs and it should not penalise them for contributing financially to their children's' education. We have always encouraged people to make choices in many areas of life, and this equally applies to education. Imagine the strain that would be placed on the government system if hundreds of thousands of students with diverse talents, needs and requirements descended upon the government school sector if the non-government school sector collapsed in certain areas. The nongovernment schooling sector is invaluable in this regard. It takes a significant load off the public system. This motion is not about criticising the government system. I have worked inside the government education sector as a teacher, as a district director and as a director of Aboriginal education, but I have equally worked with Catholic education and other non-government schooling sectors within Western Australia. I see the value of all sectors in providing educational pathways for our students. I believe that we should guarantee levels of funding, including CPI indexing, to enable those systems to continue to expand and provide the educational services that parents choose. Nongovernment schools by their very nature require significant funds from parents, and this is naturally supported by both sides of parliament. My own two sons went through public sector schooling, and their pathways were no different in choice nor quality of education from those in each of the various sectors. I fully support the motion on behalf of the strong non-government schooling sector in my community of Hasluck and the hard working parents who support it. Both need to be protected; both need to be funded. I support the motion. I want us to consider the educational needs of all children within the Australian society. (Time expired)  be brief. I have a few quick facts. This will be the first time since 1973 that funding arrangements for schools have been reviewed. It is time to have another look. I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have been in about grade 4 back then and things have moved on a bit since then. Obviously we need to have a look at it. The reality is Labor has a proud tradition of investing in schools and those opposite not so much.",58

44,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, I present the committee's report incorporating a dissenting report entitled An advisory report on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",60
45,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The issues presented to the committee during the inquiry provide an overview of industry and community views associated with possible enactment of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. The inquiry was also a forum for receiving various industry views on the government's fibre in new developments policy which underpins the proposed legislation. While the committee made a number of additional findings, the main provisions of the bill are supported by the majority of the committee. Where the committee found areas of dispute, these were less about the bill and more about the underlying policy that has led to this bill. I suspect these disputes will be ongoing for some time. The major findings of the report include: (1) that NBN Co. put in place benchmarked internal customer service protocols in regard to the timeliness of the issuing of statements; (2) that NBN Co. commit to publish its performance on the fibre rollout against specific time frames and that these commitments be subject to regulatory oversight; and (3) that the government investigate the possible impact on risk premiums of regular changes in development regulations and install anticipatory and mitigation measures if required. In relation to the bill's possible impact on competition in the existing fibre provider market in new developments, the committee acknowledge the views put forward by various industry groups. The industry groups highlighted the potential adverse impact that the government's existing fibre in new developments policy may have for existing smaller fibre providers. Some of these industry groups reported that they have lodged their concerns with the Australian Government Competitive Neutrality Complaints Office. Taking into consideration the findings and recommendations of the Australian Government Competitive Neutrality Complaints Office report, when it is released, the committee believes the government should examine the competition issues put forward by these fibre providers and industry groups in the context of the rollout of the National Broadband Network with a view to rectifying wherever possible any potential adverse impact on competition. I do note that there is a dissenting report attached to this report, put forward by the shadow minister and on behalf of coalition members. I welcome that dissenting report. Referring legislation to committees is an important part of the process of flushing out dissent and potentially highlighting any amendments so that better consideration of those amendments can then take place when bills are put before the House. I therefore thank the shadow minister for the work that he has done in preparing that. On behalf of the committee, I therefore thank those who contributed to this inquiry for taking the time out of their busy schedules to provide submissions or appear in person before the committee. I commend the report to the House. Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry Committee Report",60
46,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES," On behalf the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, I present the committee's report entitled Advisory report on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011 and related bills. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",61
47,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On behalf the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, I have the pleasure of presenting our advisory report on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011 and related bills. The committee believes that the bills amending the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and related legislation are of great importance to the nation. The bills create a single national regulator for the offshore petroleum and gas industry. Through the creation of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA, the bills integrate safety, structural integrity and environmental regulation for the offshore petroleum and gas sector. They also separate these issues from resource management issues, ensuring that safety and environmental management are not compromised by resource development decisions. This is a critical outcome in light of experiences here and overseas, especially the Montara incident in the Timor Sea and the Macondo disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Resource management will remain in the hands of Commonwealth and state ministers in the form of the joint authorities, but the day-today resource management decisions will be transferred from the designated authorities, essentially the state departments, to the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator, NOPTA. NOPTA will be the principal source of technical advice and support to the joint authorities in resource management decisions, thus reducing the number of regulators from seven to one. The bills also incorporate the principle of full cost recovery in the regulation of industry. The committee recognises the national and global trend around the world to go to full cost recovery for operational regulation and endorses the cost recovery mechanisms created by these bills. Industry must expect to face closer scrutiny on safety and environmental matters as part of its social licence to operate. Public confidence in industry and its effective regulation is an important consideration for industry as well as government. The committee also endorses the amending bill dealing with personal property securities. This is important for regulatory consistency and to prevent legal confusion. The committee has proposed only one change to the bills, allowing the Western Australian government to retain its role in the negotiation and setting of royalties. The committee recognises the importance of the royalties to the Western Australian government and the expertise that the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum has developed over many years in negotiating and settling royalties. Leaving this matter in the hands of the Western Australian government will not affect the integrity of the reforms and will allow access to the existing expertise of the Department of Mines and Petroleum in administering royalties. We have also recommended that, in light of NOPSEMA's environmental functions, the NOPSEMA advisory board should include members with environmental expertise. This will be especially important if NOPSEMA receives accreditation under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The bills are the result of a long period of policy review and consultation. They are the government's response to the Productivity Commission's Review of Regulatory Burden on the Upstream Petroleum (Oil and Gas) Sector and the Montara commission of inquiry, both of which called for regulatory reform. They are also a response to the global trend towards more integrated and robust regulation for the offshore petroleum and gas industry. The committee believes that these bills fulfil the objectives laid down in those reports. The bills are actually reforming regulatory processes, tidying up the present arrangement between regulatory bodies for the new era we are now in for the regulation of offshore petroleum. The bills are making the regulatory environment more efficient and effective and are moving towards world's best practice. I would like to express on behalf of the committee our gratitude to all those who participated in the inquiry on the bills and to the staff of the secretariat. On behalf of the committee, I recommend the report to the House. Procedure Committee Report",61
48,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure I present the committee's report entitled Interim Report No. 2: Monitoring and review of procedural changes implemented in the 43rd Parliament Referral of bills to committees by the House Selection Committee, together with the minutes of proceedings. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",63
49,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This short report by the Procedure Committee is intended to highlight what the committee detects as an emerging issue: the referral of bills to committees by the House Selection of Bills Committee. At the time of preparing this report, already in the 43rd Parliament 26 bills had been referred to committees by the selection committee and 15 separate inquiries had been initiated. I note that, since this report was finalised, a further two bills have been referred to committees by the selection committee. The marked increase in the number of bills being referred for inquiry and report is welcome in many ways but, as part of its ongoing inquiry into the procedural reforms, the committee wished to collect information and comment as quickly as possible about the impact of these increased referrals. A more considered examination of the work of committees will be undertaken later in the year as part of the committee's ongoing inquiry. Currently, one member of the selection committee is sufficient to refer a bill. The committee believes that the work of committees inquiring into bills and the referral process itself may be enhanced if a majority decision of the selection committee is required to refer a bill to a committee for an advisory report and if some indication were provided by the selection committee of the aspects of the bill that are expected to be the focus of the inquiring committee's attention. This is intended to ensure that the selection committee's deliberations include appropriate consideration of:  the need for and the potential benefits of committee scrutiny of the bill, including opportunities for stakeholder participation;  the workload and resources of the relevant House and joint committees that will undertake inquiries; and  the potential for duplication of stakeholder input. I thank my colleagues on the Procedure Committee and the secretariat for their work on this matter and I commend the report to the House. Christmas Island Tragedy Committee Report",63
50,Mr KEENAN,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on the Christmas Island Tragedy, I present the committee's report of the inquiry into the Christmas Island tragedy of 15 December 2010, incorporating additional comments. I seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.",63
51,Mr KEENAN,COMMITTEES,"The Christmas Island tragedy occurred on 15 December last year. Obviously, the events of that day are very well known to members of this House and indeed are very well known to the Australian people in general. They have been very well documented. The parliament asked this committee in March to look into the response of government agencies to that tragedy. We did so in conjunction with a number of other inquiries that are ongoing, in particular the Western Australian coroner's inquiry, which is yet to report on its findings. We also did so in relation to some other internal inquiries that the government itself had undertaken. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service undertook an internal investigation into the way it responded to this event. One of the references given to our committee was to look at that report and comment on the findings that the Customs and Border Protection Service had reached. The events of 15 December last year are deeply disturbing. It is impossible to confirm the exact number of people who died but 30 are certainly confirmed dead and 20 are missing, presumed dead. It is also important to note, though, that as a result of the actions of Australian officers and officials on that day, 42 people survived. There is no doubt in my mind, having visited the scene of the tragedy and from the evidence that we heard, those 42 would certainly not have survived. Without the very brave actions on that day by Australian Defence Force personnel, Customs officers and Australian Federal Police, there is no question in my mind that those 42 people would not have survived this terrible tragedy. The events are very familiar to most Australians. At around 5.40 am on 15 December, the vessel that came to be known as SIEV221 was visually spotted off Christmas Island. According to evidence we heard, the sea state and the weather conditions off Christmas Island that day were the worse for 30 years. The visual footage that we saw showed a sea state that was just unparalleled in its ferocity. It was a sea state which made it impossible for vessels to be launched from Christmas Island at any stage. The harbour at Christmas Island was closed and had been closed for a couple of days prior to 15 December. Once the vessel was visually spotted-and I will go in a few minutes to whether it was possible that it was spotted by other means, because that was raised extensively after these events-authorities notified the naval vessel HMAS Pirie and the Customs vessel ACV Triton which were sheltering on the leeward side of the island because of the very severe weather state. They made their way as quickly as possible to the scene of the tragedy, which was Rocky Point at Christmas Island-just off the coast of the settlement. Because of the sea state, they were forced to deploy RHIBs-the small, inflatable rigidhull vessels that they have on those vesselsto Rocky Point. Personnel were given instructions to do all they could to help people who obviously were in very serious distress. It was not originally known that the vessel was floundering against the rocks. That became known only after the initial calls were made to those vessels. The captains of those vessels told the men in the RHIBs to do all they could in the face of very difficult circumstances. Those people in the RHIBs who went into that sea state deserve to know that the Australian people would be very proud of their efforts. We saw footage that was taken from the naval vessels on that day. What they did was no less than extraordinary. They did so at very great danger to themselves and we can count ourselves lucky that nobody from those vessels was killed or injured. It was because of their bravery that those 42 people were saved. Without the fact that they were prepared to go in and risk their own safety in such a terrible sea state, there is no question that those 42 people would have perished along with, presumably, the other 50 people who did. As well as the people who responded from those RHIBs, there were people who responded from the shore, including Australian Federal Police officers, Customs officers and also Christmas Island residents who went down and stood on the cliffs. They tried to get safety vests to the people who were clearly in a very difficult situation their boat floundering on the rocks. People were thrown into the water. There was a great deal of diesel in the water after it leaked from the vessel. We spoke extensively to people on the island who had responded. They did all they could, of course, to help people but there was very little that they could do in an effective way to save lives. They told us very disturbing stories of being quite close to people who were clearly in distress and in need of their help. Even though they made their best endeavours they found it impossible to get to them-with the exception of one person who jumped on the rocks and was saved that way. It was impossible for them to launch any vessels to help. It was very, very difficult for them to help from the rocky cliffs, even though, it is important to note, they certainly used their best endeavours to do so. With any tragedy like this, there is a tendency to cast around for blame. With the sea state as it was, however, this could be classified, despite the best endeavours made by Australian officials on the day, as a terrible, terrible act of God. we are to allocate blame, it lies of course with the people smugglers who are sending people down to face these extraordinarily difficult circumstances. I think it is very important to note that, although SIEV221 will be seared in the minds of all Australians from the horror of the footage that we all saw, there are other people who have almost certainly gone missing while making that terrible journey. They are not at the front of our minds because we do not have that same visual confirmation of the terrible way they met their end. But there is certainly a lot of credible evidence that vessels have left Indonesia and have not subsequently been spotted by Australian authorities-the people on board those vessels have not been heard from again. So clearly, along with SIEV221, with other vessels have left Indonesia and have met very unfortunate ends. While people smugglers continue to smuggle people down to Australia in this way, the potential for a repeat of this tragedy certainly remains. I wanted to touch very briefly on two other issues. Those issues are the surveillance issues-what might have been known about the arrival of SIEV221-and the intelligence issues raised with the committee in relation to the SIEV221 tragedy. Firstly, with the surveillance issues-and there has again been some media reporting in relation to this over the weekend-there is no surveillance system available to the Australian government which is able to detect wooden hulled boats in such a terrible and violent sea state. The committee looked extensively at these matters-whether it would have been possible to have had or whether the Australian authorities did have advance notice of SIEV221 arriving-and we have been able to confirm that SIEV221 was not able to be spotted by regular surveillance and that, as a result, the first time it was spotted was when it arrived on If Christmas Island on that morning. It was just spotted visually by someone on the island. I think that is very important because we certainly had submissions made by people putting forward a different view. We have been able to satisfy ourselves, both with the public evidence and evidence heard in camera, that the first time SIEV221 was spotted was when it arrived on the island that morning. Secondly, as touched on in the committee report, there is a very robust intelligence process in relation to illegal arrivals coming down to Australia. It gets information from many sources which is then distilled by a grouping every day. They obviously need to use their best efforts to sort credible intelligence from the myriad sources from which they are getting information on any given day. The committee heard evidence in relation to that and I was also given a private briefing in my shadow capacity. I feel very satisfied that the intelligence community did all they could, based on the information they had, in relation to the arrival of SIEV221. The committee can certainly say, I think with some positivity, that the intelligence processes worked reasonably well in the case of SIEV221 and that no Australian authority had any prior knowledge of its impending arrival on Christmas Island on 15 December. This is a report that all members of the committee were able to put their name to: members of the government, members of the opposition, members of the Australian Greens and-now former-Independent Senator Steve Fielding. I think that is very important. These were terrible events and it is a good indication that both houses of the Australian parliament can come together, look at the events and make findings that all members of the parliament are comfortable putting their name to. I am proud of the efforts of the committee. I thank the chair, Senator Gavin Marshall, for his efforts and I thank the other members of the committee. I believe that this is a good example of the parliamentary process working as well as it can.",63
52,Mr HUSIC,COMMITTEES," by leave I follow the member for Stirling in addressing the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Christmas Island Tragedy. By virtue of our election to this place, we required to participate in a number of different committees. This committee was one where our participation took on a solemn element because, on so many different levels, this was particularly difficultabsolutely so for those people who had to endure the events of that day, 15 December. By that I mean not just those people who were on the vessel on that day, 15 December, but also the range of people who were required to respond and extend assistance to those who had found themselves in what turned out to be such harrowing circumstances. Those circumstances resulted in loss of life for 30 people and there are another 20 missing. Those 20 people are now presumed to have been taken by the ocean. For me, it was, in many respects, an eye-opening experience. For a lot of people, due to television, Christmas Island appears closer than it is. Because they appear on our television screens, the events that occur on and about Christmas Island appear to be relatively close. But getting to Christmas Island takes a significant effort, given its location-its distance away from the Australian mainland-and it also requires an effort for those who would seek to improperly enter our shores and seek asylum. The events of that day were reflected upon by the member for Stirling but were also, importantly, the subject of reflection by the people of Christmas Island themselves-the people who appeared before the committee. They told us in clear terms that weather conditions such as those experienced on that day had not, in living memory, been witnessed by the people who were there or by people who had been there previously. The conditions that had been reported on by the Bureau of Meteorology and the swells that had been recorded in the period leading up to 15 December and shortly thereafter were simply are beyond belief. Again, as has been noted by the member for Stirling, that proved a challenge to and tested the responses of a variety of government agencies, not only in the immediate aftermath but also in regard to detection and being able to ascertain whether what people were looking at was a small wooden vessel or a wave, even using modern surveillance techniques. There was a lot of discussion after the event about what could have been done to detect the oncoming vessel using radar but, as has clearly been shown, most modern radar would have been extremely tested and it would probably have been impossible to detect a vessel in those conditions. What we were left with on that day was basically a mammoth response, testing the limits of responders themselves and also Christmas Island residents-and we had an opportunity to hear their accounts when they appeared before the committee. A lot of us saw footage from that day, and the committee also had the benefit, if I may use the word in a misplaced sense, of the Royal Australian Navy footage that showed the strength and the force of the ocean and what those people who serve for us in the RAN had to go through on that day to save lives. The member for Stirling mentioned the diesel cast into the ocean when the vessel broke. As I remarked in the House a few weeks ago, the diesel made it extremely difficult for rescuers when they were trying to drag into the RHIBs these people, who were flailing in the water. The rescuers were trying to pick them up but the arms of the people wanting to be saved were slipping through their grasp. The fact that 42 were saved is remarkable in itself given what the RAN had to go through. I also think of the desperate plight of on the shoreline, watching as the vessel broke up before their very eyes and they were unable in any way, shape or form to save people other than by throwing out lifejackets or other sorts of flotation devices. Their efforts were remarkable. They tried to do whatever they could but in many respects, as they told us, they felt completely and utterly helpless when faced with those conditions. They were unable to reach out and help those people who were in such terrible and diabolical circumstances. As people have said many times over, the responses by people from the RAN, from Customs and from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, and by onshore health providers as well, were phenomenal. We could still see the after-effects in the people who appeared before us-people who are professionals but who, as much as they obviously seek to carry out their functions in a dispassionate way and in a way that is as efficient as possible, were still clearly traumatised by the events of 15 December. That is why the committee recommended that ongoing support be provided not only to the people who were on SIEV221 but also to the people who responded and tried to provide assistance on that day. It is clear that they are still, in their own way, reliving these incidents themselves. The hearts of committee members are with the survivors and families who lost loved ones but they are also with the residents, Customs and Navy officials who were involved on that day. The report clearly outlines the great difficulties faced, and it finds no fault with the response by government agencies. A range of consensus recommendations were put forward by the committee which we would encourage the government to examine and act on as soon as possible. Clearly there are limitations on how much detail we can go into while a coronial inquest is being those carried out, but I share the sentiment expressed by the member for Stirling that the actions of those people who seek to profit from the desperation of others by putting people onto vessels that they know are simply not seaworthy are to be deplored. I represent a seat in Western Sydney and, as I said at the outset, going from Western Sydney to Christmas Island takes a significant effort. People are mistakenly encouraged to embark on a journey that takes two solid days on seas that put them, put their loved ones, put children, in peril. I simply cannot fathom how in some quarters we seek to glorify the role of people who put others on vessels and profit from that and believe they are doing human good. Clearly people's lives are being put in serious danger. The RAN said they could never, with a clear conscience, put people on their own vessels in conditions like this-and bear in mind the significant differences between the vessels the RAN command and these other vessels that people are being put on. They are being made to endure two days of travel in terrible seas to get here. The RAN says they could not even imagine putting someone into these conditions, if they had concerns for the people they were responsible for, on their own vessels let alone the vessels being used-in particular the vessel on that day-to bring people here. As I said before, I cannot fathom that we would believe that seeking to profit from that in that way is a responsible course of action; it clearly is not. My participation in this committee has clearly highlighted to me that we need to take steps that some people outside of this place, and even people who are close to me who have different views, would say we should not undertake. I submit to this place that that trip, with the elements that people face and the massive risk to those and their loved ones on those vessels, is simply too high a risk and we should take whatever steps we can to prevent people from even thinking about getting on vessels that clearly are not seaworthy. This report highlights the tragedy that hit the families who attempted this crossing and the impact it had on the people who tried to save them. In closing, I would also like to thank the chair, Senator Marshall, and the deputy chair, the member for Stirling, and the other members on the committee. I thank the secretariat for working tirelessly to bring this report together. As my friend and colleague the member for Moreton has said about border protection, as a country we have to patrol an area equivalent to 11 per cent of the world's oceans, but we do not have 11 per cent of the world's population. That we have to patrol 1.4 million square nautical miles and then prepare a response to the circumstances that confronted people on 15 December is simply extraordinary. I hope that the report opens eyes to what people suffered and endured on 15 December. The great lengths that were gone to by the people who responded on behalf of Australians to help those in desperate need on that day were simply extraordinary. I certainly commend the report to the House.",66

57,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I present the committee's report entitled, Inquiry into Australia's relationship with the countries Africa and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.",69
58,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,"I was one of many MPs and senators who had the great opportunity over the course of more than 12 months to participate in the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade into our relationship with the countries of Africa. I pay tribute to the then Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, and the then foreign minister, Mr Smith, who showed great foresight in giving the reference to the committee for inquiry. I do not expect that this report will have an immediate big impact on this parliament, the executive government or, more broadly, the Australian people, but I think it is a watershed inquiry which will be referred to on a regular basis over the next decade as Australians generally rethink the importance of their relationship with Africa. I appeal members generally and to the government to take great notice of the committee's recommendations and key commentary. We worked very hard-and I acknowledge the presence in the chamber of Mr Ruddock-on securing consensus on the recommendations. Some of the recommendations were not easy, but we think they are important, wellconsidered and appropriate for future deliberations on our relationship with the countries of Africa. The report is the first comprehensive report by a parliamentary committee into our relationship with the countries of Africa. In my view, that says many things but, above all else, it says that as a nation we have paid too little attention to the countries of Africa. Yes, we provide substantial aid and that has been increasing, and over the forward estimates it will peak at some $218 million of in the year 2011-12, but it remains relatively modest not only when compared to comparable donor nations but also as a proportion of Australia's total aid budget. Yes, we have a sound, strong and professional diplomatic presence, but those posts are only in eight countries out of a total of 53 nation states in Africa. Again, when compared to comparable nations our representation there is quite poor. I acknowledge that those eight posts cover many more countries than the eight capitals in which they are situated. Yes, we do important work on the security front and we are doing more. I am very proud that as defence minister I was instrumental in establishing a permanent defence attache on the African continent. So far it is just one for the 53 nations, but it is a good start. When I became defence minister, I could not believe it when I learned-and I suppose I should have known it earlier-that despite having more than 180 defence staff in our posts to around the world we did not have one on the African continent. Of course, we are doing good work in peacekeeping, mine clearing and other things, but our engagement on the defence front is modest when compared with comparable nations. When I look at Africa, I see a sleeping giant. It is a continent covering more than 30 million square kilometres-that is around four times the size of our vast continent. Africa is home to around a billion people and hosts 53 nation states-or maybe it is 54 now with Southern Sudan. It is a continent with enormous mineral resources-30 per cent of the world's resources, I think-and, in geopolitical terms, it is located in a critical part of the world. There are those who say that Africa is far and remote from Australia-and some of those people sit on the committee-that we have very few strategic interests in Africa and therefore our focus should predominantly be on our immediate region: the South Pacific, South-East Asia and the broader Asia-Pacific region. That is not a wrong view-and I will be very surprised if the member for Berowra does not have something to say about that-but it is contestable and it is a debate worth having. I would not argue for a moment that Africa is more important to Australia in strategic terms than the South Pacific, South-East Asia or the broader Asia-Pacific region. That, of course, would be foolish. But it is worth noting that the distance between Perth and Johannesburg is not much different than the distance between Sydney and Beijing and the distance between Sydney and Tokyo. We share the Indian Ocean. Australians have felt the brunt of instability in Africa; piracy is a good example. A strong, prosperous, growing and safe Africa is not only a good thing for Africans but a good thing for Australians. As Africa emerges as an economic powerhouse, and it will, Australia will want to and should be part of the action. While Australia's trade with Africa is growing, particularly due to mining investment, it remains modest with exports totalling around $3 billion each year. Competition is strong amongst countries and companies looking to expand in Africa. China, not surprisingly, is particularly active. Australia needs to be part of that competition and to be successful it needs to be competitive. The committee made a range of recommendations designed to improve that competitiveness, including an enhanced Austrade presence, an increased and enhanced diplomatic presence more generally, the facilitation of greater contact between NGOs and the corporate world, the expansion of the e-visa system, the establishment of an Australia Africa council and a commitment to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. On the question of extractive industries, during our visit to Africa I was most keen to reassure myself that foreign mining companies operating in Africa are providing a net benefit to indigenous Africans-that is, that indigenous communities in Africa are overwhelmingly benefiting from the presence of mining companies, that human rights are being upheld, that the environment is being sufficiently taken care of and that Africans are sharing in the wealth of the minerals they own. We visited a mine in western Ghana operated by an Australian company, Adamus Resources, and, in that instance at least, I left very encouraged by what mining companies are doing in Africa. We saw whole new villages being built, new schools being built, textbooks being provided, a very happy school community and a very happy broader community in that part of the world. I hope and pray that what we saw there reflects what is happening in mining in that country more generally. I said that Africa's emergence from poverty and its growth as an economic powerhouse is inevitable, but its people will need some help. The committee chose not to make a range of recommendations on the aid front; rather we left it largely to the independent panel doing a review of Australia's aid effort more generally. We look forward to the report. Of course, the committee did form some views. I have become more determined that the private sector has a role to play in the provision of aid funding and aid programs in developing nation states. Our NGOs do wonderful work and from what I have seen they do their work effectively and efficiently, and we saw plenty of examples of that during our visit. I also believe there are some things that the private sector can do better and where outcomes may be better-for example, where AusAID is partnering with private sector organisations. I have no difficulty private sector profiting from the provision of that aid funding as long as, in cases where they are playing a role, the outcomes are greater than or exceed what might have been the outcomes if non-private sector agencies had been doing the work. We saw a perfect example of that in Zimbabwe at the Ebenezer Agricultural Training Centre, located south of Harare. We saw a white South African farmer training young indigenous kids in farming methods. They had what we might describe as a TAFE facility, or training facility, on their land. Each of the kids have their own plot that they are responsible for clearing and farming. Some of those kids will never be seen again but many of those kids enter into joint venture arrangements with the principal of that training facility. I thought that was a great example of the private sector doing good work with indigenous communities for some very important and good outcomes. I want to acknowledge a number of other very impressive aid projects we saw: the water and sanitation work being done in partnership with Bulawayo City Council in Zimbabwe, the Hwange power station, also in Zimbabwe, the WaterAid project in the Sabon Zongo slum in urban Ghana, and of course Dr Catherine Hamlin's fistula clinic and midwifery school in Ethiopia, which is marvellous. I wish I had more time this morning to talk about it. I also acknowledge the young Australian ambassadors we met in Ghana, who have given up a year or two of their lives, for very modest remuneration, to experience life in Africa but, more importantly, to do their bit for the African people. They are a wonderful young group and make us all proud everywhere they work. Nothing will be more important in bringing Africa to its full potential than education. The higher education sector is with now also a significant contributor to Australia's export earnings. The sector has a growing reputation for building links with academic institutions in developing countries. It is in Australia's interest to further develop these valuable ties and similar relationships in research and higher education in Africa. The committee recognises that there needs to be a balance with respect to the provision of scholarships to Africans. On the one hand, Africa will benefit through the transfer of skills if African students return to their country of origin after completing their studies, but we need to be concerned about and mindful of the brain drain in Africa. Madam Deputy Speaker, in my electorate I cry blue murder when my GP-to-resident ratio exceeds 1,500 to one, but I know that in communities in Africa those ratios are tens of thousands to one. We need to be very mindful of that. The committee has recommended that AusAID's scholarships program include providing scholarships to African students to undertake tertiary education in Africa. We saw some very good work being done by Monash University just outside Johannesburg. This could involve study at African universities and at Australian universities with links with Africa. There is, within Australia, a substantial body of expertise on African issues. The committee believes that it is important to promote its coordination and further development. Therefore the committee has recommended that a centre for African studies be established, preferably within a university in Australia. A centre would facilitate a coordinated approach to education and training at both undergraduate and graduate level. Further, it would establish a focal point for coordinating expertise on African issues. As I said, on the security front we are doing good work in Africa but the work is modest. We are doing good work on piracy and in peacekeeping. We visited a very good institution, just outside Addis Ababa, where people are being trained to clear mines. Ethiopia, I think, is one of the most mined countries in the world. There is very good work being done there with the support of Australian funding, but more needs to be done. I was fortunate to lead a delegation to Africa for about 14 days. We visited South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana and Ethiopia, in that order. Of course, South Africa is a key trading nation of ours and the need for there was obvious. In Zimbabwe we were very keen to assess Zimbabwe's progress towards a political settlement and its economic development. In Ghana we were very keen to have a look at the mining and extractive industries. In Ethiopia we were largely there to visit the African Union and to talk about, amongst other things, peace and security. It was very difficult to choose four nation states out of 53 or 54. We would have liked to travel more widely but time constraints meant we were unable to. On Zimbabwe, I want to make quick note of a matter that is dwelt upon to some extent in the committee's report: sanctions on Zimbabwe. My personal view is that sanctions have been very effective but, as we move closer and closer to a political settlement, it might be time to adjust our approach to sanctions-that is, not to remove sanctions but to offer a carrot, a gesture of goodwill and a sign that we as much as anyone, including those who govern Zimbabwe, want sanctions removed at some point and are prepared to loosen sanctions when we see progress being made. I am confident progress is being made. I left Zimbabwe feeling quite confident about its future. Maybe it is time that we demonstrated our preparedness to lighten the sanctions as Zimbabwe continues to make progress. We could maybe benchmark them and further reduce them as those benchmarks are reached. I should say there was no consensus about it in Zimbabwe, either among the committee members or the interlocutors we met with. Nor was there consensus among ZANU or members of the MDC. But I have come to the strong view that it is time to consider some slight lightening of those sanctions as a gesture of goodwill and a sign, as I said, that we are keener than anyone, if not as keen as a visit those who govern Zimbabwe, including those in ZANU, to have sanctions slowly but surely reduced to the point where they are no longer necessary. I will quickly pay tribute to all our heads of mission and those who work under them in each of our posts, in particular of course the posts we visited. They do an outstanding job, as do the representatives of AusAID and Austrade. Both those we met and those we did not meet are all doing outstanding work. All, I am sure, would agree that greater resources would be helpful and an appropriate step for Australia to take. One of the key messages in the committee's report is to urge the government to review our diplomatic presence in Africa with a view to strengthening that representation, in particular in Francophone Africa, where we are very much underdone and where we have very keen interests, in particular economic interests. I also want to thank all those elected people we met while we were in Africa. I was surprised how very pleased they were to see us particularly, if my memory serves me correctly, in Ghana and Ethiopia. I remember very vividly our head of mission in Zimbabwe fretting when we arrived, explaining to us that we had been the first Australian members of parliament to visit Zimbabwe for at least three years, if longer, although I do know that former Prime Minister John Howard whipped through for the cricket on one occasion post politics. But it is clear to me that those in Zimbabwe want us to show an interest and that we should be showing an interest-and that is also true of places like Ghana, Ethiopia and elsewhere. They are underloved and I think we could give them a little bit more love, and I think the benefits would be two way. Very quickly I thank those who travelled on the visit to Africa with me. We were a good group and we worked very hard to find consensus on some of these very difficult issues. Finally, I thank Dr John Carter and his team on the secretariat of the committee. They include James Bunce, Dr Brian Lloyd, Rhys Merrett, Jessica Butler and Gillian Drew. I also thank Dr Margot Kerley, the secretary to the full committee who is leaving the parliament after some 20 years of service. I pay tribute to the wonderful work that she has done over those many years. So I think it was an excellent inquiry with an excellent visit by the delegation to Africa. I also pay tribute to now former Senator Michael Forshaw, who chaired the committee for a long period of time and did an outstanding job and also oversaw the Africa inquiry. He was very disappointed not to make the trip to Africa as he had been very keen to do so but some family commitments arose and the election changed the timing of the visit. He would have made a great contribution on that visit. I was very lucky to be asked to stand in as leader in his absence and it was a great pleasure to do so. I take this opportunity to wish former Senator Forshaw and his wife, Jan, all the very best for many happy years in retirement.",69
59,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES," by leave-Firstly, I endorse the comments of the Chief Government Whip on this report not by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on our relationship with Africa. I too thank particularly Michael Forshaw, the former senator, for his leadership in relation to this matter. I am glad that we were able to facilitate the completion of this report so that it could be tabled in the Senate before he retired. I commend the government for enabling the committee to undertake the inquiry and my colleague the member for Hunter for his leadership of the subcommittee that visited Africa. I commend Dr John Carter and his professional staff for the work that they have done in the preparation of this report and for doing it so quickly. The report is a unanimous report but mention was made that there may be a variety of views in relation to some aspects of it. Let me firstly commend some other aspects of the report before I identify some areas of difference. I can say that when the committee commented on the way in which African migrants and humanitarian entrants had settled in Australia so successfully and commented that we ought to better utilise their cultural, linguistic and practical skills I noted they were comments about which I have had personal experience and involvement and I very much appreciate those linkages. I have taken an interest in Africa over a long period of time. I have visited a number of African countries-South Africa and Ghana-previously, with Zimbabwe and Ethiopia on this visit. I have also visited places like Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania and have had the opportunity to visit Egypt as part of my former responsibilities as a minister. I certainly have taken an interest in governance arrangements. I believe that with some 53 states in Africa there are variable performances in terms of the contribution of their governments to the well-being of their peoples. What has been very much reinforced in my mind-and I hope it comes out in this report-is that there have been significant improvements in a number of situations and yet in others there has been a very significant deterioration in the circumstances of its peoples. Let me refer to two, one arising out of visiting Ghana. If you read the material of Transparency International, you note Ghana is one of those countries that have good governance arrangements. It is quite clear, given the way in which the administration is working, that the developments that are occurring-including the mining development that the member has referred to-are largely because they have had good, effective and largely transparent governance arrangements in place which have meant that programs as they are administered and aid when it is offered are able to achieve a substantial benefit for the peoples concerned. I came to a different view about Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe had very significant development that occurred under governments at different points over a period of time in its history, but it has been allowed to go into decay largely because of poor governance arrangements. I think it is a great pity to see the loss of institutional memory about maintaining critical infrastructure, particularly for drainage and sanitary purposes and so on, so that it is now having to be maintained out of our aid program because they have lost the capacity and the expertise to be able to handle what is, in fact, substantial infrastructure that many other parts of Africa would have very much welcomed. I want to emphasise that there is much that we can do, but I do not like seeing money spent on propping up corrupt regimes when you know that those that have been able to deal with corruption, such as Botswana and Ghana, are getting far more substantial outcomes for their people as a result. We need to take that into account in the way in which we deal with these issues. I had no problem with the recommendations in relation to Australia's aid program. At an earlier stage, as a result of the Simons report to the former government, there was a view that Australia should concentrate where we are best able to in our own region. Others, particularly out of Europe, should concentrate on Africa and the United States should concentrate on South America and perhaps Central America because they were closer, had expertise and were in a position to help-as we do in our own region. With Australia now contributing very much more in relation to aid generally, obviously, people are looking at other opportunities. I do not like the idea that, as Europe is withdrawing and contracting some of its aid offerings to Africa, we are having to make it up. I do not like countries having to deal with a multiplicity of governments. They often do and are able to, perhaps, bargain a little by trading one off against another in relation to lowering the standards. My view is that you put great expense on governments when they have to deal with a multiplicity of agencies. Sometimes having fewer countries but, perhaps, greater aid offered is a better way forward. In relation to the committee's views on aid I would say this: the emphasis we put on Australia in assisting where we have specific skills that would not come from other areas of the world means the aid is very well spent. When you get the CSIRO, who has had experience in dryland farming, helping Africans to grow more of their food-and nobody else would be able to offer that same sort of experience-it is a very substantial and beneficial program to be conducting. People like Dr Hamlin have made Africa their life's work. I think the program that has initiated over a period of time deserves to be continually expanded and aided because the outcome is so positive for those who are able to benefit from it. Here is a in her 90s who is still operating. It is a remarkable story when you have the opportunity to see it and it was particularly impressive to me. I make those comments in relation to aid because I think to focus on where our strengths are and to recognise the importance of addressing the issues of corruption in particular. There were some comments made by the committee in relation to enhancing our linkages with Africa in terms of human contact. Reference was made to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship issuing e-visas across Africa with priority service in countries where there is potential for trade, academic research and other links. I do not think that recommendation ought to be looked at separate to the commentary that the committee, itself, made in relation to that seen. matter. Often in relation to where you make arrangements to lower entry standards you need to do so where you are going to deal with a compliant population. The expansion of e-visas should be seen as something that is pursued without jeopardising our own entry requirements and ensuring that those who travel are going to meet the obligations that are imposed upon them. There was reference made to enhancing government-to-government links and particularly to expanding parliamentary exchanges. All of those matters I support. I think also in relation to the recommendation that the department of foreign affairs undertake a comprehensive review of Australia's diplomatic representation in Africa with a view to opening additional posts in francophone Africa should be read in context with the commentary. The committee made it clear that opening an additional post would seem she to be the next step in Africa and in francophone Africa, but the committee recognises the fiscal constraints faced by the government, so any new posts should only lady be opened after serious consideration. In most coming to this view the committee recognised that there were competing demands for increased diplomatic representation in other regions, typically in Eastern Europe and it is important Latin America. I think the point ought to be made that, while some had a particular view that priority be given to Africa, it is certainly the case that the committee in its report recognised that this needed to be looked at objectively and we needed to act in the nation's interest in establishing missions where proper inquiry suggests priority should be placed. So, I make those comments because, in reading some of the observation that were made in the tabling of the report, the balanced approach that the committee took may not necessarily be first I do commend my colleagues, particularly Senator Forshaw for his leadership and the member for Hunter for his leadership of the subcommittee. The committee did work well and I think the report is evidence of a very constructive approach.",73
60,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES, Does the member for Hunter wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a later occasion?,75
61,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report.,75
62,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 39, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Report and Reference to Main Committee",75
63,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Main Committee for debate. Question agreed to. Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011 Consideration of Senate Message Debate resumed. Senate's amendment(1) Schedule 1, item 32, page 10 (after line 27), after subsection 219ZAB(2), insert: (2A) Any equipment prescribed under subsection (2) must be configured so that the equipment's use, when carrying out an internal non medical scan, is limited to that necessary to produce an indication that a person is or may be internally concealing a suspicious substance. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (13:14): I move That the amendment be agreed to. This bill will amend the Customs Act to enable Customs and Border Protection officers to undertake with consent an internal search of a person suspected on reasonable grounds to be internally concealing a suspicious substance, using body scan technology. Currently an internal search of a person can be carried out only by a medical practitioner at a place specified in regulations-for example, a hospital or surgery. The bill will allow, with the consent of the detainee, an initial non-medical internal Xray scan of a person to be carried out by Customs and Border Protection officers using new body scan technology that produces a computer image of a person's internal cavities within a skeletal structure. In considering the bill, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills was of the view that the principle of appropriately limiting equipment capacity should be included in the primary legislation. This government amendment creates a requirement in the primary legislation that BILLS equipment used for the internal non-medical scan must be configured so that its use is limited to that necessary to produce an indication that a person may be internally concealing a suspicious substance. Where the body scan image supports a suspicion of internal concealment, the existing regime governing an internal search by a medical practitioner will then apply. I commend the amendment to the House. Question agreed to. NA Air Safety",76
64,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (13:16): by leave-As the House would be aware the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) announced the suspension of Tiger Airlines domestic operations in Australia effective from Saturday, 2 July 2011. CASA has not taken this action lightly but formed the view that there was a serious and imminent risk to passengers if the airline's operations continued. CASA released a statement on 2 July 2011 outlining the circumstances leading up to this decision following the initial issuing of a show cause notice in March 2011. Taking Tiger's response to the show cause notice into account, CASA subsequently imposed a number of conditions on the airline's Air Operator's Certificate (AOC). Since Tiger was served the show cause notice, CASA has determined further events raise concerns about the airline's ability to conduct operations safely. This includes several incidents being further investigated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and CASA. The suspension of the airline's AOC lasts for a period of five business days, during which time CASA must apply to the Federal Court for an extension of the suspension if required. If the Federal Court supports a CASA application, the court can continue the suspension for a period of time which will allow CASA to finalise its investigations into its concerns. It is regrettable that this decision has impacted on the travel plans of many passengers, including those travelling during school holidays. However, the safety of the travelling public must come first. Recognising the disruption to the travel plans of thousands of holiday makers, the government asked the other Australian airlines to step up to assist those affected to make every effort to help get people home, to continue their travel or to go on their school holidays. I am very pleased to advise the House that there has been an overwhelmingly positive response to the government's request from the industry. Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin Australia are all assisting passengers affected by the suspension of Tiger services, through the use of extra capacity and the provision of special fares. I spoke personally to both Alan Joyce and John Borghetti on Saturday and I want to thank them, as the respective CEOs of their organisations, for the assistance that they have given to their fellow Australians in the past days. Following a request from the government, I also welcome the Australian Licenced Aircraft Engineers Association decision not to proceed with industrial action this week while Tiger's operations are suspended. Given the importance of a bipartisan approach to aviation safety, I rang the shadow minister, the Hon Warren Truss, on Saturday to update him on the CASA decision and have had CASA brief him in person this morning. In our first term, the government undertook the most exhaustive review of aviation policy settings in Australia's history. This review, which involved an extensive consultation process with industry, other government agencies and the community, culminated in the release of Australia's first ever aviation white paper, Flight path to the future, in December 2009. In the aviation white paper the government made it clear that aviation safety would always be our first and overriding priority. We supported this approach with the announcement in the May 2010 budget of an additional $89.9 million in funding for CASA over four years. This additional funding is being used to fund almost 100 and new and ongoing staff in key surveillance roles and to invest in the development and maintenance of safety standards and regulatory development. The additional funding is also providing for expanded and ongoing training for CASA staff and will ensure that there are sufficient resources to properly regulate and administer Australia's airspace, which covers an area of almost 11 per cent of the earth's surface. This funding represented an unprecedented 30 per cent increase in CASA funding and provided for long-term stability in the authority's funding base. We also improved governance arrangements for CASA with the establishment of an independent board to provide strategic oversight for CASA. The CASA board has recently confirmed that, with the additional funding provided by the government, CASA is now adequately funded to meet the challenges and performance expected of a world-class aviation safety regulator. We also strengthened the independence of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) including the creation of independent commissioners. Regulatory reform has been a challenging issue for Australian aviation safety for over decade. In March 2010 the government established a dedicated regulatory drafting task force involving specialists from CASA and the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing. The task force is targeting the completion of the long outstanding maintenance, operations and flight crew licensing regulations. The task force has already made substantial progress in completing the maintenance regulations and is currently drafting several of the flight crew regulations specifically referred to in the recent Senate inquiry into pilot training. The government will give careful consideration to the inquiry's recommendations noting that the government has already acted on the safety funding issues outlined in the committee's report. We will do so after consulting with our independent aviation safety advisers. The government has consistently highlighted the importance of investment in safety critical equipment and services by Airservices Australia, Australia's major civil air traffic service provider, in its Statement of Expectations to the Airservices board. In response, Airservices has already commenced an almost $1 billion capital expenditure program over the next five years. This investment includes the wider adoption of advanced satellite and ground based surveillance technology, new and upgraded air traffic control towers as well as new rescue and firefighting stations and equipment. Consistent with the government's Australian Airspace Policy Statement issued in 2010, one of our key policy objectives is to enhance regional air traffic services. Airservices' investment has accordingly included new and enhanced air traffic facilities in growing regional centres like Broome, Karratha and Rockhampton. Maintaining Australia's internationally a regarded high aviation safety standards and performance is about constant vigilance, continuous improvement and investment in safety regulatory oversight, safety infrastructure and safety personnel. Recent events only serve to demonstrate and reaffirm this government's, and our independent safety agencies', joint commitment to providing a safe aviation industry. Australia's aviation safety system is based on sound governance and a resource and regulatory framework which will continue to ensure that safety will always be the first priority. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Wide Bay to speak for eight minutes. Leave granted.",76
65,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Truss speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding eight minutes. Question agreed to.,78
66,Mr TRUSS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I thank the minister for reporting to the parliament on this significant event over the weekend, with the grounding of one of Australia's major airlines. When Tiger began, I think it would be fair to say that Australians welcomed what was going to be regarded as a new era of competition. Certainly low-cost travel was taken to another step. The airline has grown solidly. It now has 10 aircraft operating in Australia and a significant network, particularly into some of the tourist destinations around Australia. It is a substantial company in that it has the backing of important Singaporean investors and Singapore Airlines, one of the world's leading airlines, has almost a one-third interest in the company. It is a substantial operation and, therefore, to have its services in Australia grounded in this way is a significant blow to the Australian company, to the Australian tourism industry, to those who depend on Tiger to travel but also to the reputation of the Tiger brand around the world. So it was a significant decision to be made, and I am certain that CASA would never make a decision of this nature lightly. The implications are inevitable: public confidence is lost in the airline and a lot of work has to be done then to rebuild that confidence if the airline chooses to continue its operation. We all hope that a way can be found through the current difficulties so that it can return to providing services across the nation and do so with a high degree of confidence that it can operate safely and securely. We have a proud reputation in Australia for the safety of our skies and, in particular, the safety of our major airlines. That is a reputation that we have invested in over decades, and we must make sure that it is retained for the future. We are so dependent in this country on aviation because of the size of the continent and the need for us to travel around regularly-in particular, the advent of fly-in fly-out mining operations et cetera has crowded our skies. So it is important that we have a high degree of confidence that our safety regulatory systems and, indeed, our airlines operate within a culture of safety. To achieve that we have to have well-trained crews and well-trained engineers. We have to have sound regulations. Also, we must support the emergency services and other regulatory agencies. But what is most important and what is difficult to regulate from a government's perspective is a culture of safety within each of the operating companies. They have got to think 'safety'. They have got to be aware that this is a priority. It is an important commercial priority, as Tiger is discovering now when its safety has been questioned. You cannot have a strong, viable and secure airline and business unless the public are satisfied that your operations are safe. People like cheap fares and they want to get to their destinations reliably and on time but what they want most of all is to be as certain as anyone can possibly be about anything in this life that when they board the aircraft it has been properly maintained, it has been properly looked after, the crew are competent and the airline is determined to get them safely to the destination. So it is important that we seek to act wherever necessary to maintain the safety of airlines and assure the flying public of Australia that they are safe. In this particular instance, as the minister has outlined, issues that had occurred in Tiger airlines had been brought to CASA's attention over quite a period of time, and in September a series of obligations were attached to their air operator's certificate which required the airline to improve its performance. A series of steps were identified, with time frames over quite a long period, for the airline to progressively improve its safety performance. As I understand it, the airline had been making progress in that task, although none of the actual target dates had yet expired. It was a series of extra events, beyond those which actually had triggered the original requirements, that led to the suspension over the weekend. CASA are responsible for overseeing aviation safety in Australia. I know, even from my own time as a minister but also by observing over the years, that they take that responsibility very seriously and they do not act precipitously. In fact, this is the first time that something like this has happened to an Australian airline. I know people refer to the Ansett incident, which affected a significant proportion of the Ansett fleet but not all of it. In this instance CASA are concerned about the culture of safety within the organisation, and that is a fundamental issue which, as I mentioned earlier, must be addressed. But it cannot be addressed quickly and easily. You cannot change a culture overnight. That is why the minister is, I think, right to the refer to the fact that it is a big task to try to do this within five days. I hope they can, and it is encouraging to see that senior airline management and senior owners of Tiger have come to Australia from Singapore. They are clearly taking it all seriously. I hope that they can get in the air as quickly as possible. I note that Tiger are still selling tickets for next week. That is a demonstration that they have got some degree of confidence that they can fulfil the requirements and assure our regulator that they have developed within organisation the systems that are necessary to guarantee safe operation. This has been a major step. It is a significant blow to air travel within Australia. I join the minister in complimenting the other Australian airlines for their willingness to carry Tiger passengers. It is not quite the Ansett situation, where they would have been genuinely worried that they would not get paid for the passengers that flew; in this case, Tiger has the backing of very substantial interests and there is good reason to believe that they have the financial capability to do whatever they need to operate again. The key thing is to develop the culture. That is not a money thing; that is about having proper processes in place with their management to ensure that safety is always given priority. I thank the minister again for his statement. I commend the whole Australian aviation industry for the way in which they are responding to this, including Tiger's willingness to address the issues in a constructive way so that hopefully their business can resume operation as quickly as possible, but most importantly of all so that Australia's valued reputation for having safe skies is preserved and enhanced. NA Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",78
67,Mr BILSON,BILLS," I will pick up where I left off on 23 June, where broadly my contribution at that time sought to highlight the deficiencies and flaws in the government's Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1), ostensibly designed to deal with the anticompetitive conduct their known as price signalling. I detailed the appalling inactivity and indifference of the government to repeated calls from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, for action and to address the price-signalling gap in Australian competition laws. I also talked about and drew attention to the absence of pricesignalling laws in Australia impacting on the actions and decisions of the commission and cited some examples involving petrol retailing and also some observations by the former commission chair, Graeme Samuel, as it related to the banks. I also talked about the coalition leadership on this matter, which is hard to contest. It took the coalition to introduce a private member's bill, last November, to tackle anticompetitive price signalling. Notwithstanding the absence of the awesome resources of the Commonwealth, the coalition managed to do what the government seemed either unable or unwilling to do. What we then saw was the government react, seemingly motivated by political positioning. It seemed to be struck by the simple fact that there was an acknowledged gap in the competition law over which the government had done nothing. It seemed to then go from this phase of obfuscation to complete overreaction, from inaction to reaction, from the coalition's policy precision and measured intervention to develop an amending law to the government sensing the need to be seen to be doing something. The government seemed to act with its motive being one of political opportunism. There was this hamfisted panic where, out of the blue, the government decided it should do something, not inspired by sound policy considerations but by the need to be seen to be doing something and to have some media sound bites to offer concerned consumers and a concerned regulator. That is where we got to. I was capturing how the government's bill is fundamentally flawed. It has a serious number of substantial deficiencies that are catalogued in the dissenting report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, where we examine this bill. Quite remarkably, though, it has been characterised by a leading academic and competition law expert as 'international worse practice on information exchanges between competitors'-hardly a ringing endorsement, hardly a sense that the government has got this right. It does not come as much of a surprise to this side of the House that the government has got this so wrong, largely due to the way it has gone about doing its work. The government, as I touched on earlier, reacted to the coalition leadership; it did not work up its own careful policy solution. It then sought to have the coalition's bill examined at great length by the House economics committee and then did a dishonour and the disservice to the House economics committee, treating it almost as an ornamental stopover on the way from the drafting room and the Treasurer's speech into this parliament. In fact it was quite offensive when you look at the way government members and the government generally have dealt with this process or lack of process as it involved consultation. There were a number of very considered, quite substantial and weighty submissions provided to the House economics committee, outlining with a great degree of care and precision all of the decisions, all of the choices and all of the legislative design options the government has gone with, and why so many of them failed the test of sound economic policy and competent competition law. It is quite telling if you look at the House economics committee report-and some loosely call it the majority report in that it was the casting vote of the Labor chairman that gave it majority report status-to see that it simply says, 'Go on, pass the government's bill.' None of the independent evidence presented to the House economics committee supports such an unequivocal recommendation to simply pass the government's bill. What is quite remarkable, notwithstanding that the position of government members was to simply pass the government's bill, is that the government itself has identified that the bill has some flaws and has brought forward its own amendments to the bill that the majority of members on the House economics committee thought was just right-'She'll be right, mate. Tick it through; send it through.' The government has come up with its own recommendations dealing with financial workouts for companies in difficulty where there is a need to discuss those financial arrangements between a number of credit providers. This leads me to exactly what the bill is about. The government's bill has two key parts. The first seeks to prohibit private disclosures-known as a 'private disclosure prohibition'-of pricing information to competitors. That is the government statement. In the explanatory memorandum, and even in some of the commentary, the government has put forward this per se prohibition on private disclosure. It is there because there is apparently no redeeming quality to any private communication between competitors. That is the argument. Even in the explanatory memorandum, the government seeks to argue that things are so completely and clearly anticompetitive that they surely must be unlawful. That is a pretty bold statement. But what undermines that bold statement is that there are then pages and pages of exceptions. Things are so clear, so categorical and so obviously offensive that this provision seeks to make any kind of private communication between competitors unlawful. But apparently it is not so bad in a number of the circumstances that the government seeks to pick out. In seeking to pick out those exemptions and circumstances, it belies the very assertion that the government makes that these per se prohibitions are so categorically and comprehensively wrong that they must amount to a per se prohibition in the law. It then goes on to have a second category of prohibition relating to general disclosures. This is about information relating to the of goods and services, the capacity of a business to acquire or supply goods and services and any aspects of the commercial strategy. We want to focus on what is actually in the bill. What those out there would like to focus on is what is not in the bill and, more particularly, why the coalition's bill is not being discussed. In its 20 April bulletin, Mallesons assessed the coalition's bill as superior to the government's bill, yet the government has not seen fit to even bring on the coalition's bill-the very bill that gave rise to the government's getting off its backside in the first place. Quite remarkable! Mallesons said: While the Coalition's draft Bill would need some revision and modification, it would appear to be the preferable alternative on the basis that it would require demonstration of an anticompetitive purpose and a substantial anticompetitive effect, rather than simply imposing a blanket prohibition on disclosure. That is what the experts are saying. They did not have a chance to canvass any of those views with the House economics committee because the committee heard absolutely nobody in response to the submissions that were received. The per se prohibitions are the ones that are of particular concern because they seek to make something unlawful simply because it is. That is the argument the government is asserting, even though it undermines that argument, and I will come back to that point. On the second area of the more general disclosure prohibition, a concern about the reach of that provision goes well beyond price disclosure and into what is known in a familiar sense by competition lawyers as 'concerted and facilitating practices' in which coordination can be enhanced between competitors to the detriment of the economy and to the detriment of consumers. Rather price than go into that model that exists in European law and that has evolved through case law in the United States, the government thinks it can simply get this right, even though submission after submission draws attention to the concerns about this bill. It is for these reasons that I will be moving an amendment in this place which seeks to put on the record all of the concerns that the coalition has about this bill and to put forward some suggestions about how they might be remedied. In addition to our general amendment, we will be proposing some specific amendments to make the most offensive aspects of this bill a little less offensive and I am hopeful that the government might seriously take on board that constructive effort. Bearing in mind that a number of provisions of this bill are a direct lift out the coalition's bill, I am hopeful that the government might see fit to directly lift some of our remedies to the bill's greatest failings. We will be moving that the House declines to give this bill a second reading and that the House condemns the government for its belated action to address the anti-competitive pricing signalling gap in Australia's competition law. We will note that the bill only arose following the coalition's leadership to introduce the Competition and Consumer (Price Signalling) Amendment Bill 2010 as a private member's bill into this House, recognising the assessment of academics and leading competition law practitioners that the coalition's bill is superior to the government's bill and should be brought on for debate in the House. We are looking for the parliament to record its concern about the government's failure to undertake proper and meaningful consultation in the preparation of this bill, and to allow the House economics committee to carry out its work to examine the bill and consider public submissions. We then hope the parliament will be honest enough to note the very clear flaws that are in the bill. Our second reading amendment talks about recklessly creating a per se liability for private communications without adequately justifying this approach in terms of economic policy or competition law principle and how the bill ignores that sound competition law should, wherever possible, have an economy-wide application unless clear justification is provided to deviate from this settled approach.",80
68,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! If the member for Dunkley is going to talk about his amendment, he should move the second reading amendment.",83
69,Mr BILSON,BILLS,"I was building up to of moving it. I notice I have got a little while to go, but I would like to move the second reading amendment and hope it will be seconded and supported by at least half a dozen other people. In the few minutes that are left, I will conclude some of the aspects of that amendment. The amendment is also about the sector specific application and the per se prohibition that gives rise to a need for the complex task of identifying all conceivable business transactions and conduct that may have a legitimate business justification and the exhaustive list that flies from there. It also talks about the risks to the consumer and the economic detriment from failing to adequately differentiate between information sharing that can be pro consumer and pro competitor.",83
70,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour, when the honourable member will have the opportunity of continuing his contribution, and then a seconder to his amendment will be called for. NA Dakin, Ms Monica Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (13:45): I recently received a letter from a young constituent in Ryan regarding her trip to Africa. Her name is Monica Dakin and she plans to travel to South Africa to volunteer with a wildlife conservation and re-education group. Even at the young age of 18, Monica Dakin is already setting an outstanding example for the wider community. Monica plans to use this trip to assist with the conservation of Africa's animals and hopes to re-educate the locals and the Ryan community about the conservation of all animals. As a student of ecology and zoology and a member of the local scouting movement, Monica will have the ideal base from which to share what she learns on her trip. Monica has also already shown great dedication and initiative by putting together many fundraisers to assist in raising the amount of money she needs to finance this trip. She has held sausage sizzles and sold raffle tickets and goes door to door to sell chocolates. Monica is truly an outstanding example not only of her generation but also of the hard working constituents in the electorate of Ryan which I am so proud to represent. Bass Electorate: Ringarooma Primary School",83
71,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to condemn the Tasmanian state government's suggested closure of the Ringarooma Primary School, which is in my electorate of Bass. I would like to make it clear that I do not support the closure of this school. It would be unacceptable for the school, unacceptable for the students and unacceptable for the local community. Recently, the Branxholm Primary School was forced to close, and students relocated mostly to the Ringarooma Primary School. So this would in effect be the closure of two schools. The school is a central part of the community, being the venue for the Ringarooma Show, and we cannot allow this school to be looked at in isolation of the community benefit the school brings to the local community. The distress that is being felt amongst the local community is evident in long-time community member 101-year-old Thelma Bennett, who is fighting to save the school along with numerous others. I again implore the Tasmanian government to reconsider the closure of the Ringarooma school. This decision is out of touch with community's wishes and I am sure they will give the Greens Minister for Education and Skills in Tasmania a Ringarooma. Greenway Electorate: Tamil Community",84
72,Mr RANDALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I wish to bring attention to a speech made in this House by the member for Greenway, Michelle Rowland. I have informed her that I intended to do so. In a speech on Monday the 20th, she made an inaccurate and opportunistic slur on the democratically elected government of Sri Lanka, possibly to curry favour with elements of the electorate who I suspect are still sympathetic to the defeated terrorist group, the LTTE. She said in her speech she had something like a 3,000-strong Tamil community. She said: I say '3,000' but-as I have been told by Tamil community leaders, and I have no doubt as to this-this number is, in fact, far higher in reality. The Tamil population in Greenway is one of the largest in the country … I refer the member to the most recent Bureau of Statistics figures from the last census. I point out to her that in fact the number of Tamils in her electorate is 75. Not only that, but the number of Sinhalese in her electorate is 1,034. The member might want to realise that not only does she have people of that group in her electorate but she has Ghanaians, Iranians and Kurds, who she may wish to talk about in the same vein because they need the same support. I expect her, on 0.9 of a per cent, to be more accurate in the future so the Sri Lankan members of the community can deal with her. Tamil Senior Citizens Association",84
73,Mr MURPHY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I wish to congratulate the Tamil Senior Citizens Association on the wonderful achievement of their 20th anniversary on 25 July 2011. The association is based in my the electorate of Reid. On this auspicious occasion it is poignant to reflect on the wonderful achievements of the association. The ever-increasing membership is testament to the community spirit and benefits that the association has fostered since 1991, when it began with only 27 members. Today, with over 850 senior members, the Tamil Senior Citizens Association is more important than ever in our community. The association has provided services to improve the quality of life of its members, ranging from cultural and educational to benevolent and social as well as recreational activities. I was also very pleased to learn that the Tamil Senior Citizens Association was recognised by the New South Wales government, who awarded the association the Seniors Achievement Award for Community Service in March of this year. This award was well-deserved recognition of the outstanding services rendered by the Tamil Senior Citizens Association in diverse fields over the past 20 years. I know the association will continue to build on the important services provided and I wish them all the very best with their endeavours. Congratulations again to the president, Mr Shiva Pasupati, and each and every member of the Tamil Senior Citizens Association on the wonderful milestone of the 20th anniversary. I look forward to many more to come. NA",84
74,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS," I would like to recognise Councillor Angela Owen-Taylor of the Brisbane City Council, who is in the gallery. NA Kruse, Mr Esmond Gerald (Tom), MBE Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (13:51): I rise today to honour a truly inspirational Australian outback hero, a pioneer and trailblazer of the iconic and very historic Birdsville Track. Tom Kruse, as we knew him, was a legendary mailman of the Birdsville Track, but on Thursday last week, 30 June, Tom passed away in Adelaide surrounded by his family. Tom was born on 28 August 1914 in Waterloo, South Australia. He left school at the age of 13 and did various labouring jobs before moving to Yunta to work in a small garage owned by his brother Snow. Tom became a regular face for residents along the Birdsville Track when as a 24-year-old he began the mail run between Marree in South Australia and Birdsville in Queensland, in the outback of my electorate. He made his first trip on 1 January 1936 in 45-degree heat. If anyone has ever experienced the heat of the outback at that time of the year, they will know just how tough it is. The outback then, of course, was very tough. It is a very lonely place at times, but Tom conquered sandhills, dust storms, flies and in wet seasons, like now, floods, swollen rivers and creeks along the track. He made these trips every fortnight. Round trips between Marree and Birdsville normally took seven days, but when the Cooper flooded the trip could take as long as six weeks. Breakdowns were a common occurrence, but Tom was dedicated to getting the mail through. His mail service was a lifeline for so many people living along the track. He brought mail, supplies, fuel and education resources to the otherwise isolated people along the track. (Time expired) Human Rights: Sri Lanka",85
75,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last year, the UN Secretary-General appointed a panel of experts to advise him on the issue of accountability with regard to alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law during the final stages of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka. In April this year the panel delivered its report, in which it found there is credible evidence that both government forces and the LTTE had committed war crimes. Tonight, Australians will see on Four Corners disturbing footage taken during the final months of the conflict which appears to show civilians being used as human shields by the Tamil Tigers; civilians in no-fire zones, including in hospitals, being bombed by government forces; and evidence of systemic rape and executions. The UN panel noted that addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law is not a matter of choice or policy; it is a duty under domestic and international law. However, it found that the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission set up by the Sri Lankan government is deeply flawed in its mandate, its methodology and its failure to satisfy key international standards of independence and impartiality. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has also noted that 'justice will be essential if there is to be true reconciliation after this terrible and divisive conflict.' As I stated in my notice of motion on Sri Lanka on 1 June 2009: Openness, accountability, compassion, full respect for human rights and an inclusive process of dialogue between representatives of all ethnic communities will support the course of reconciliation that must occur in Sri Lanka's future to avoid a return to the past. This is my humble plea in the spirit of the great friendship between our countries. (Time expired) Petition: Optus Transmission Tower, Hinkler Electorate",85
76,Mr NEVILLE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I present a document signed by 87 residents who, with designated family members, represent 107 constituents of my electorate of Hinkler living in the Craignish area near Hervey Bay. In this document, the would be petitioners object to a proposed Optus transmission tower to be attached to an existing local water tower on the grounds of (1) the uncertain effects of electromagnetic radiation, (2) the visual impact, which is described as high, (3) the likely proliferations on the site, (4) the possible reception conflicts, (5) the impact on values and (6) a challenge to alleged designation of low-impact determination. It goes without saying that I respect their right. Although this is not in strict petition form, it represents the strongly held contention of these 107 residents with a local community point of view. As such, I seek leave to table it as a document. Leave granted. Bosom Buddies ACT",86
77,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I recognise the valuable contribution made by Bosom Buddies ACT in providing support to women and their families living with breast cancer. Bosom Buddies ACT is a group of volunteers, many of whom are breast cancer survivors, who provide friendship and hope to those diagnosed with breast cancer throughout their treatment and recovery. The volunteers help in any way they can by providing advice and fellowship, transport to medical appointments and near support workshops and social activities. Bosom Buddies ACT also raises awareness about breast cancer and is a strong advocate for improving treatment and services for breast cancer patients. Through its fundraising, Bosom Buddies ACT has donated to the Calvary and Canberra hospitals oncology equipment valued at over $40,000, provided funding for research and professional development training for breast care nurses and resources for Heads Up at Calvary. Bosom Buddies was founded in the ACT in 1995 by Shirley Fitzgerald and a group of other women who had experienced breast cancer. It is an honour to be a Bosom Buddies ACT ambassador, along with five other Canberrans, including the former member for Canberra Annette Ellis. We ambassadors have been given a hat to decorate as part of the Hat Hat Hooray competition to raise funds. Between now and mid-September I will be getting out the felt and the feathers to come up with a creation that will, hopefully, raise lots of money for this great cause. Bennelong Electorate: Epping Youth Development Group",86
78,Mr ALEXANDER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last week the electorate of Bennelong celebrated the 20 birthday of the Epping Youth Development Group, otherwise known as the Shack, which provides a warm, welcoming and safe environment, free of drugs and alcohol, for teenagers to interact and enjoy social and recreational activities. The aim of the Shack is to help young people to regain control of their lives. This may involve crisis intervention, counselling services and guidance to apply for jobs. As the only youth drop-in centre in the Eastwood Local Area Command, the Shack has developed strong links with the Eastwood police, providing officers with the ability to refer many young people to counselling services rather than pushing them into the criminal justice system. I recognise the efforts of Senior-Constable Debbie Chrystal, Inspector Duncan Eddington, Superintendent Peter Marcon and, of course, Darlene Keenan, who set up the Shack 20 years ago. The manager of the Shack, Jacqui Pettit, is an inspiration, along with her one full-time helper, Vanessa Sokalik. In the last 12 months the Shack has provided more than 800 hours of counselling for 385 people, 111 hours of court support to 44 people, 422 hours of home visits, involving 127 people, and many other sundry services. I was fortunate to visit Jacqui and Vanessa at the Shack a couple of weeks ago and acknowledge the very important role they play in the Bennelong community. I congratulate the Shack on their 20th birthday and commend their work to the House. (Time expired) MCEwen Electorate: Epping Fruit and Vegetable Market",87
79,Mr MITCHELL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise in support of the primary producers and small businesses in northern Victoria to express my outrage at the way the Baillieu Liberal government is failing the families of the north. Last year, the Baillieu Liberal government put the Epping fruit and vegetable market under a taxpayer funded review-one of the hundreds across the state. Traders told the Age their businesses and their lives have been up in the air since the November election of the Baillieu government and its decision to review the market move. Twenty-year market veteran Fred Pascale said: I can't make investment decisions; I have been left in limbo. Traders were told in December that a decision on the market's future would be announced 'over the next few weeks'. This sham review is 165 days overdue and with the future of the project on hold there is uncertainty among investors and businesses in the north. On 2 March, Denis Napthine, Minister for Major Projects, released a statement which said: The Coalition will announce a decision on how it will proceed with the project within a matter of weeks. What was meant to be a matter of weeks has now been some seven months. It is an absolute disgrace, an absolute sham and an absolute disregard for the people of Victoria. A review will not pay the bills, it will not support families and it will not support our local businesses.",87
80,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2 pm, the time for members' statements has concluded. Earlier, the Leader of the Opposition was foot-faulted by the Deputy Speaker when he was trying to send best wishes to the member for Bennelong for his birthday. I am sure that the Housebegrudgingly in some cases but with great glee in others-wishes the member for Bennelong all the best for what I understand is a significant anniversary. NA Carbon Pricing",88
81,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her weekend statement 'There will be no carbon tax on petrol under the government I lead.' Why is this statement any more believable than her pre-election statement 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' especially as Senator Bob Brown has said that a carbon tax on petrol is inevitable?",88
82,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the Leader of the Opposition I say: there is a little edge of desperation about all of this, isn't there? The Leader of the Opposition has been caught out misleading the Australian community. He has been here in Parliament House and right around the nation claiming to anyone who will listen that carbon pricing will apply to petrol at petrol bowsers-that families or small businesses going to fill up the tank will be paying a carbon price on the petrol they put in their motor vehicles. He said it here in parliament and he said it around the nation. The decent thing for the Leader of the Opposition to do today would be to acknowledge that he was wrong, to acknowledge that he went out of his way, with no facts and no truthfulness, to try to scare the Australian people. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition, having been caught out once, is unlikely to do the decent thing. Instead, he will be trying to move his scare campaign to the next stage. I anticipate that over the coming weeks we will hear more and more ridiculous scares from the Leader of the Opposition. I say to Australians who hear these words of fear from the Leader of the Opposition: he was dead wrong about petrol, and every word he says over the next few weeks, with his next round of scare campaigns, will be dead wrong as well. Petrol is not in the carbon-pricing scheme. It will not have a carbon price applied to it now or in the future.",88
83,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the statement this morning on the doors, by the member for La Trobe, who said: 'Fantastic news! The carbon tax won't apply to petrol.' I ask the Prime Minister: wouldn't it be better if there were no carbon tax at all on anything?",88
84,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I am very happy to answer the question from the Leader of the Opposition. On this side of the parliament we believe climate change is real. We understand that the Leader of the Opposition is in denial. On this side of the parliament we respect the words of scientists. We understand that the Liberal Party in the modern age is attracted to vilifying scientists. On this side of the parliament we listen to the words of economists, who say that the most efficient way of tackling climate change and cutting carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon. We understand that the Leader of the Opposition thinks it is his business to insult Australian economists. Consequently, led by the science and led by the views of economists, we on this side of the House believe, if you are going to effectively tackle climate change, you must",88
85,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It was a simple enough question. If exempting petrol is fantastic news, wouldn't it be more fantastic to exempt everything and not have a carbon tax at all? The answer should be directly relevant to the question.",89
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is being responded to. The Prime Minister has the call.,89
87,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you care about tackling climate change in the most efficient way, then you are for putting a price on carbon. In terms of the comparisons between the government's view and the opposition's view",89
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sturt will withdraw. ,89
89,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We on this side of the House are for putting a price on carbon. We are for assisting families. We will assist families with tax cuts, with increases in payments and by not having the carbon price apply to petrol. The alternative-because the Leader of the Opposition asked me about alternatives-is to go for his plan, which will not work and will cost Australian families $720 per year. If we are going to look at alternatives, a price on polluters-$720 a year coming straight from families-then the comparison gives the Leader of the Opposition the answer to his question. We are for doing this the most efficient way with the most assistance to families; he is for doing it the most ineffective way and ripping $720 per year off families. Carbon Pricing",89
90,Ms SMYTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. How will the government's plan to take action on climate change through pricing carbon and an ETS see lower carbon pollution, more tax cuts and assistance for families and pensioners, including through the treatment of petrol? What are the facts around the treatment of petrol and how have these been received?",89
91,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for La Trobe for that wonderfully perceptive question and I thank her for her advocacy on behalf of her community in this place. Soon we will be in a position to announce full details of the carbon-pricing package which, as a Labor government, we have been working hard on. We have been working hard, as a Labor government, in order to tackle climate change-a huge challenge for our nation's future. As we have gone about the challenge of tackling climate change and cutting carbon pollution, we have done it guided by our Labor values. Guided by our Labor values, we have been working to ensure that nine out of 10 households get assistance through tax cuts or payment increases or a combination of both, that the vast majority of those households will not pay a cent as a result of pricing carbon and that more than three million low-income households will get the benefit of a 20 per cent buffer. We know that their budgets are tight and we want to make sure that, in tight budgets, they have 20 per cent of reassurance, that they have been assisted above and beyond the impact of a carbon price. We also have wanted to take the decision to not put a carbon price on petrol because we understand that, in many parts of the country, people have got no choice but to get into their car and to drive their car to get places. It is true of the outer urban electorate that I represent, it is true of the outer urban electorate that the member for La Trobe represents and it is true of country and regional Australia, as represented in this place by so many good Labor members. For example, last week I was with the member for Lingiari, a place where you have got no alternative but to jump in your car and So we have determined that, because of the needs of families in outer urban places regional Australia, there should not be a carbon price on petrol. I also thank the member for New England for his advocacy on behalf of regional Australia and his community as we have gone about pricing carbon. We have done it in a Labor way, and doing it in a Labor way means that we should look at the alternatives that are being advocated in this place. Unfortunately, the alternative is a $720 per year direct slug on families. The Liberal party's position was not always like this. Mr Fletcher interjecting",89
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bradfield is warned. Mr Simpkins interjecting,90
93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Cowan will leave the chamber for one hour understanding order 94(a). The member for Cowan then left the chamber.,90
94,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the parliament to this report of the former Howard government on emissions trading-the emissions trading scheme the former Howard government wanted to introduce and which, if it had introduced it as heralded by this report, would have started on 1 July this year. That emissions trading scheme of the Howard government would have had a carbon price on petrol. That is, the Leader of the Opposition was a cabinet minister in a government that would have put a carbon price on petrol from 1 July this year. That the truth from this report. Instead, the Leader of the Opposition has been out trying to scare Australian families. It is time for him to do the decent thing, to go back to Queanbeyan and to say to the people at the fresh food market that he was drive. wrong when he said to them that petrol would go up, to go back to Moorebank and and in say to the community there that he was wrong when he said that petrol would go up. He should stand at the dispatch box and say in this parliament that he was wrong when he said petrol would go up. That would be the decent thing to do. We await to see whether or not the Leader of the Opposition is a decent man who will do it. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",90
95,Mr CHRISTENSEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her latest promise that the government will exempt petrol from her carbon tax because 'I know what it is like for people to have no choice but to jump in their cars to get places.' Will the Prime Minister now exempt electricity prices from the carbon tax or has she forgotten what it is like for people who have no choice but to turn on their lights, their heaters and their washing machines?",90
96,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In answer to the member's question I would say this: of course I understand that people use electricity for all sorts of daily household purposes, which is why, as we put a price on carbon, we will assist Australian households. Nine out of 10 households will get tax cuts or increases in payments or a combination of both. The vast majority of those households will not see carbon pricing cost them a cent and lower income households will have the benefit of a 20 per cent buffer. It has been referred to in the media as a battler's buffer-that is, they will is get 20 per cent more than the impact of carbon pricing on them. I understand that Australian families are struggling with energy bills that have been going up and up without a carbon price. We need to give the electricity generation sector, the distribution sector and the energy sector certainty so that they invest for the future and particularly invest in the clean energy sources of the future. The member who is showing a concern about cost of living questions may want to think about the alternative. People will see their energy bills go up and the Leader of the Opposition will be ripping $720 a year out of their family budget. That is what the plan of the Leader of the Opposition is: to put a tax on Australian families and give that money to subsidise big polluters. We, on the other hand, are going to cut carbon pollution and tackle climate change by putting a tax on the big polluters, by charging them a price on carbon and using the money raised to assist Australian families who are often struggling to meet big costs like electricity prices. to the member he may want to think how his constituents will react to the Leader of the Opposition's plan to rip $720 off them per year. NA",90
97,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon Ulu Foua Toloa, Head of Government of Tokelau. On behalf of the House I extend to him a very warm welcome. Honourable members: Hear, Hear! NA Carbon Pricing",91
98,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Will the minister update the House on recent developments on the government's plan to put a price on pollution? How has this been received and what is the government's response?,91
99,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,91
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Before calling the minister, every question today has been greeted by comment by nearly everybody on my left. I think it is about time, if they want question time taken seriously by everybody, that they should at least sit there in relative silence.",91
101,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Of course, as the House has heard today and as the Prime Minister made clear yesterday, petrol will be exempt from the government's carbon price. What that means is that families, tradespeople and small businesses with light commercial vehicles will not face a petrol price rise as a result of the introduction of a carbon price. That is a very important commitment that runs completely contrary to I say the scare campaign that the Leader of the Opposition has been running for month after month after month. The Leader of the Opposition has had a number of things to say in the scare campaign. He said on one occasion that the impact on the cost of living would be unimaginable. He has repeatedly said that the carbon price will put 6½c a litre on the price of petrol just for starters. For week after week after week, the Leader of the Opposition has gone out and completely misrepresented this position to the Australian community. It is time to own up to it and time to apologise. He has claimed more than 20 times that the cost of petrol will go up. He is wrong today, he was wrong then and he should apologise to the community for his deliberate misrepresentation. A scare campaign is always fuelled by misrepresentation and misinformation and it can never ever stand up to the facts. That is why, as the government finalises more details of our plans to put a price on carbon pollution, the Leader of the Opposition will get more and more hysterical. Chicken Little is going to get more and more shrill as all his misrepresentation is revealed for what it is-a scare campaign. On this front, last Friday there was quite an extraordinary outburst at economists. It was essentially: what would leading economists in Australia know about economics compared to the Leader of the Opposition? That was an extraordinary attack on economists in this country for indicating what is widely held and understood-that is, a market mechanism for pricing carbon is the most efficient way of reducing pollution across our economy. He does not like economists, does not like scientists and takes his scientific advice from the One Nation website. This is a completely disreputable campaign that has been run by the Leader of the Opposition. In the face of all this, the challenge that climate change represents for our country, the Leader of the Opposition is content to pollution rise and continue to add to the problem that we have. He rejects market mechanisms as efficient ways to reduce pollution across our economy. He will slug the budget instead with the subsidies-forpolluters policy. It will cost $30 billionDr Jensen interjecting",91
102,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Tangney is warned.,92
103,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to 2020. It is going to cost $720 per household for the subsidiesfor-polluters policy. The Leader of the Opposition is committed to claw back the pension increases, take back the tax cuts, claw back the benefits for families. He is going to take them all back by repealing the carbon price legislation. Our country faces a serious significant challenge with the threat of climate change. As a political figure in this country, it is hard to imagine a more irresponsible misrepresentative campaign than that that has been conducted by the of Leader of the Opposition over recent months and in coming days it will be exposed. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",92
104,Mr TEHAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Small Business. I refer to the Prime Minister's promise that petrol will be exempt from her carbon price. Will Allen Transport, a business with 22 local employees operating in Portland and Warrnambool with 10 trucks, have to pay the carbon tax on the fuel they use?",92
105,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (14:22): I would like to thank the member for Wannon for his question. All fuel-including petrol, diesel and LPG-for passenger motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles will not be subject to the carbon price. The member for Wannon see will also know that in the last four months the Leader of the Opposition no fewer than 20 times has said that the cost of petrol will rise. This just exposes what has really been going on in this country in the political debate Ms Julie Bishop interjecting",92
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are warned.,92
107,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have seen in the last four months the Leader of the Opposition trying to run a strategy which says that fear will triumph over hope. He has been trying to make it very clear that there will be a carbon price on petrol for passenger motor vehicles and for light motor vehicles. We have also agreed that there should beDr Stone: Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question was about large trucks. It was: what is going to be the cost impact on large motor vehicles? Trucks were what were referred to by the member for Wannon.",92
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Murray will resume her seat. The Assistant Treasurer is aware of the need to directly relate his answer to the question. The Assistant Treasurer is responding.,93
109,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In terms of the question that was asked, I was asked about Allen Transport. In terms of the trucks that were spoken about, there was not the specification that the member for Murray says there was. Perhaps if she had written the member for Wannon's question it might have gone a different way. But returning to the question that was asked about a carbon price on petrol, we have been very clear in the last 24 hours that there will not be a price on carbon put on petrol for passenger motor vehicles and for light commercial vehicles. In terms of the rest of the detail of the carbon package, I know that the opposition is greatly interested in what the price on carbon should be. In the very near future more detail will emerge. But let us go back to what has been put on the record already. We have agreed to a Productivity Commission review on fuel excise. We have said that there will be a Productivity Commission review on fuel excise. It is anticipated that this review include an examination of the merits of the regime based on carbon content or energy content of fuels. The Henry review looked at this in some detail. It recommended replacing the revenue raised through fuel excise with direct charges for road use. The review noted that this would actually result in a reduction in fuel tax paid. I am not going to pre-empt the recommendations of the Productivity Commission's review, which has not even started, but let us be very clear when it comes to fuel excise policy in this place. The government is not afraid of good policy. That is why as recently as two weeks ago we finished the job which the opposition should have done. I know that Mr Minchin is no longer here, but he recognised that for excises in the fuel tax policy it was important to include alternative fuels such as LPG. We finished the job which should have been done by those opposite many years ago. If they actually want to engage in a proper policy debate then they will have to do more than just oppose ideas.  of order. I request that the minister table the notes from which he was so clearly reading every word.",93

112,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The document is confidential. Live Animal Exports,93
113,Mr CROOK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I recently attended a meeting of primary producers from the agricultural region of WA who are greatly concerned about the future of their industry following a blanket ban on live exports to Indonesia. Will the Prime Minister will agree to visit Indonesia as a matter of diplomatic urgency to rebuild relations with the Indonesian government following the fallout of this government's live export ban? Further, will the Prime Minister agree to remove the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry from his portfolio to resolve the impasse that his inept management of the live export issue has caused, with particular attention to the fact that Indonesia's live export permits for Australian cattle have now expired and will not be renewed for three months?",93
114,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question and understand that he would be concerned about the circumstances of the live cattle industry, so let me just go through the various things he has asked me. I will start with the last point first because I think it is very important.",94
115,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,94
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister will resume her place. The member for O'Connor has asked a question. It is not for me to have a commentary on the question, but I do not believe it is for those on my left to have a commentary, word by word, on the answer. The member for O'Connor deserves to have the ability to hear the response. The Prime Minister is responding to the question. She should be allowed to do so in silence.",94
117,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was responding to the last question first because I think it is very important to clear up any misapprehensions there may be about this matter. There is no technical impediment to Indonesia granting permits during the forthcoming three-month period. The course that Indonesia has adopted to date is to not issue import permits to any country. So this is not just about Australia. It has taken that decision in relation to import permits for any nation. The form of words that the member used in his question was that this definitely means that Australia will not be in that market for three months. That is not true. We are obviously working strongly with Indonesia, and with industry here at home, to get the trade up and running again. My aim, as Prime Minister, has been to resume this trade as soon as possible, making sure that we can address the very real animal welfare issues which were exposed on the Four Corners program and which horrified Australians, including those in the cattle industry. I have had the opportunity to meet with them personally on more than one occasion and everyone that I have met has said as their first sentence to me that they do not want to see their animals treated like that and they were horrified by that footage too. We want to get this trade up and running as soon as possible, having ensured that the animal welfare standards are appropriate. In order to do that, we need to be able to track and trace where animals from Australian farms go-that is, we need to be able to trace them from the farm, through the journey, on the boat, to the feedlot, to the abattoir-and we need to assure ourselvesMr John Cobb interjecting",94
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Calare is warned.,94
119,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that the standards in the abattoir are appropriate. We are engaged in that work right now. On the diplomatic strategy and how this work is being done, the government across the board is engaged in this-the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Trade, and, obviously, I am involved as Prime Minister-and we are pursuing a diplomatic strategy with the best possible advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We will continue to do that. I do not believe that it is appropriate for me to in any way respond to domestic politics here in this regard. The best thing is to have the most productive working relationship with Indonesia, and that is what I intend to do. On the actions taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the minister has been working hard on this very difficult question. There are, of course, some extreme views in this debate. There are some people who basically do not believe we should kill animals for food and there are some people who say, 'Resume the trade, no matter what,' but the vast majority of people, I believe, are in the centre of those two poles and are saying, 'Let's resume the trade when the animal welfare issues are right.' But, given the vast spread of opinion here, it is of no surprise really that the minister for agriculture has got the occasional critique from some involved in the debate. However, he is working hard to get this resolved, as we are across government. I thank the member for his question. Carbon Pricing",94
120,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the importance to Australia's economic future of putting a price on carbon pollution? How has this approach been received and what is the government's response?,95
121,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Parramatta for her question because putting a price on carbon pollution is absolutely important for future prosperity and for future environmental sustainability. We on this side of the House accept the proposition that climate change is real. Just about every reputable scientist believes that climate change is real and, indeed, the Howard government even believed that climate change is real-which is why it believed in putting a price on carbon pollution. All of the leading scientists, particularly those who came out in the last few weeks, make it very clear that climate change is real, that we are causing it and that we do need to act now. We need to act now because we are in the critical decade. To delay action will mean greater costs and a greater adjustment into the future. That is why economists and business groups accept that the cost of inaction is greater than the cost of action. That has been accepted since the Stern report came down three or four years ago. It is accepted amongst economists that the leastcost way of doing this is by putting a price on carbon pollution. That is why we had, in the last couple of weeks, 13 respected Australian economists making that point from most of our reputable businesses in the country. We have Australian business-the Australian Industry Group, the BCA-all arguing for a price on carbon. Only last week we had the CEO of NAB who has said that a price on carbon will drive certainty, it will drive investment. This proposition is also accepted by our largest mining, gas and energy companies. Mr Van Manen interjecting",95
122,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Forde is warned.,95
123,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Last week, we had the Chairman of Gloucester Coal, Mr James MACKenzie, who made this point about the coal industry: We are talking about $1 a tonne in the coal industry. It is not something that is going to affect the economics of the coal industry... That is why companies like Shell, BP, GE, AGL, Santos, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Origin Energy have all come out in favour of a market price. They all accept that a price on carbon is the way to go to secure our future prosperity. Ms O'Dwyer interjecting",95
124,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Higgins is warned.,95
125,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are going about this in the Labor way. We are going about this by providing assistance for households. Nine in 10 households will receive a combination of tax cuts and increased payments to help with the cost of living. We will provide transitional assistance to industry. So what does the Leader of the Opposition do in the face of everything that the scientists are saying, everything that the economists are saying, everything that senior corporate leaders are saying? He simply ignores the scientists and prefers to take the advice of Lord Monckton. Nothing more could demonstrate what a climate change sceptic he is than that fact. When he got on the wrong side of this, he decided last week when he was at the economics conference in Melbourne to start attacking all of the economists who agree with pricing carbon. We know something about this Leader of the Opposition: he just likes to come out swinging all of the time and he does not care who he hits. Last week he started taking it out on leading Australian economists who had the temerity to argue for a price on carbon. So he ignores business, he ignores economists and we saw in the House last week and again today that he is going to ignore his own plebiscite. He will not take any notice of business, he will not take any notice of economists and he will not take any notice of scientists. All this just shows how dangerous and unfit for high office he is. Carbon Pricing",95
126,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to Greens Senator Christine Milne's statement that the Productivity Commission's report on fuel excise will be handed down in 2015 and that, at that time, petrol could be included in the carbon tax. Treasurer, can you rule out including petrol in the carbon tax in 2015?",96
127,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Prime Minister has made it very clear that we will not be including fuel in the carbon price now or in the future. Workplace Relations,96
128,Ms BIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations. How has the Fair Work Act facilitated workplace bargaining since 2009? What are the challenges to, as well as other options for, improving bargaining for Australian businesses and employees?",96
129,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hotham-Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (14:39): I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. She, as did everyone on this side of the House, knew how important it was to fight Work Choices and replace it with Fair Work Australia. I am asked what the impact has been of this important change which we have made since coming to office and I can say this: it has been fantastic for jobs. Some 740,000 jobs have been created since we came to officeMrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",96
130,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mackellar is warned!,96
131,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-with the prospect of another 500,000 jobs. There has been a significant lessening of industrial disputes, almost a halving of them, since we came to office. There has been important wages growth without inflationary impact. There are now the greatest number of people on enterprise bargaining in the history of this country-and that is important because it is focusing economic activity at the job level, the plant level-and there has been smarter bargaining as well. There have been some important breakthroughs in which superannuation has become an important part of the bargaining process. So not only has the impact been a much fairer system-because gone has been the threat to people's wages and conditions and the ability to sack them at the whim of the employer, replaced now by a requirement to bargain in good faith-but also a system that more than ever suits the economy and the circumstances it is going through now. It is an economy in transition and there is a requirement to understand those different transitory phases and to have a wages system and an industrial relations system that works. When we talked about introducing the system, we were told by those who now sit opposite that the sky would fall in-wages would be out of control, industrial disputes would be up and we would see all manner of job losses. Just as they are spreading fear today about pricing carbon, so too in those days did they spread fear about the changes we were going to make to Work Choices. I am also asked in this question: the challenges to us in continuing to implement this? The biggest challenge would be if there were a return of a Liberal government to power at the federal level because, for the Liberals, Work Choices their DNA. You only have to look at New South Wales and Victoria to see where the premiers there are heading. There is also a cacophony of members in this parliament pining for a return to the days of Work Choices-the member for Curtin, the member for Wentworth, the member for Goldstein, the member for Higgins, the member for Moncrieff and the member Mayo have all weighed in. But where has the Leader of the Opposition been in this debate? Try as they might, the media cannot get him to talk about it. He is muzzling his own front-bench, keeping them off television programs and avoiding those programs himself. But when he, himself, was asked what he is going to do, he said, 'Wait until the field evidence comes in.' The field evidence is in. This has been a return to a better system. What we know about the other side is that they are united on returning to Work Choices. They are united on the IR front; they are divided on the PR front-how they come clean with the Australian public. Labor will resist the return to Work Choices because a return would be bad for the Australian people and this economy. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (14:43): My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the fact that the residents of Wandoan in my electorate have all their goods delivered by truck. Will the fuel used in the trucks be exempt from the carbon tax or will the residents of Wandoan bear the burden of a carbon tax on fuel while their city what are counterparts do not?",96
132,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. As the Assistant Treasurer said before, all fuel, is in including petrol, diesel and LPG for passenger motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles, will not be subject to a carbon price. He went on to make the point that, when it came to heavy vehicles, we would be revealing further details when we have completed our decisions on the emissions trading scheme. He made that very clear as well. I would like to say a few things about carbon pricing, and I will refer those comments to rural and regional Queensland in particular. No part of our country will benefit more greatly from a price on carbon than regional and rural Queensland because no part of our country will be more affected by the impacts of dangerous climate change than parts of regional Queensland, which will feel those impacts particularly in agriculture. It is imperative that all of us in this parliament do something about carbon pollution and put in place a solution for the future which secures the environment for our great state, including regional areas but not just regional areas-there is the Great Barrier Reef, for example. There is a rolled gold case to put a price on carbon if you are a Queenslander. The area that the member for Maranoa asks about is a great coal producing region. We on this side of the House see a bright future for coal in this country. We understand that we need a price on carbon to drive the investment in renewable energy and cleaner",97
133,Mr Christensen,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I am not sure what mining has to do with a question about the carbon tax on diesel for trucks in Wandoan. Can the Treasurer please be relevant?",98
134,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer has the call and he is aware of the requirement to be directly relevant to the question.,98
135,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I was asked about the town of Wandoan, which I know. I was asked about that region. Not only is it a great agricultural region; it produces coal as well. People who live there depend for their living on one or the other of those industries. They will receive the assistance which we will put in place for a carbon price. The households there will receive through our scheme additional assistance in terms of tax cuts, in terms of pension increases and also in terms of family payments to compensate for the price impact of a price on carbon. They will all benefit from that-but not only that. It is a great coal producing region and no industry has a greater stake in putting a price on carbon than the coal industry. If we do not move in this area, they will be subject to trade barriers in a carbon constrained world. The coal industry in this country has a very bright future and it will be even brighter if we price carbon, if we make sure that we drive investment not just in renewable energy but particularly in carbon capture and storage-to get the innovation, to make the future of the industry even brighter and the future brighter in Wandoan for all of the Queenslanders and Australians who live there. Budget  question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline to the House the importance of returning the budget to surplus and investing in jobs? How has this approach been received, and what is the government's response?",98
136,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," We in this House can all have confidence that the fundamentals in our economy are strong and that our future prospects are bright. We have low unemployment, we have record terms of trade and we have an unprecedented pipeline of investment. In particular, as ABARES shows, $430 billion is in the pipeline for resources. This investment boom will over time stretch our economic capacity, and that is why it is critical to bring our budget back to surplus in 2012-13. That is why we are delivering such a significant fiscal consolidation. This has been noted in particular by the Reserve Bank in recent times. It is also why we are concerned to build a bigger and better workforce so that all Australians can participate in the opportunities which will flow from the mining boom. This is why the budget was welcomed not just by the Reserve Bank but also by private-sector economists, business groups, unions and community groups. This is why it was so important that the budget pass the House last Thursday-to deliver the economic investments which are so important for our future prosperity and to put in place the savings we needed in that budget to bring our budget back to surplus. So what passed in this House were also key savings measures. These were part of something like 150 bills which have passed through the House of Representatives during the period of this Gillard government. It is a very substantial achievement which goes to the core of securing our future prosperity. We are concerned with continuing to deliver that, but there are some risks to this outlook from the approach of those opposite, particularly the shadow Treasurer. They are still insisting on holding up something like $6 billion worth of critical savings, and that is on top the $7 billion in budget savings that they have opposed in this House. We had some revelations about a possible opposition economic policy last week. They came out and said that they were going to give a new round of tax cuts. Of course, we do not know how those tax cuts are going to be delivered because we have not seen the savings to deliver them. We have no idea where they are going to come from. In the same breath, the shadow Treasurer said seriously that he was going to bring down interest rates as well. I do not know how he gets to a position of having a lower surplus, opposing savings in this House and bringing down interest rates. I think the stupidity of this was evident in a press conference the shadow Treasurer gave just before question time. His main point was that we must take pressure off interest rates by spending less. How do you spend less and give substantial tax cuts without indicating where the savings are going to come from? Of course, when he was challenged by the journalist he walked off and had a hissy fit. Just before question time he was questioned about how all of this was going to be done and he could not answer the question and walked away in a huff. Finally, he was asked by one of the journalists about his cardboard cut-out antics here a few weeks ago and he just stormed off. None of that is a substitute for a fully funded and fully assessed economic policy. It just proves how unfit for high office all of those opposite are. Carbon Pricing",98
137,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the Treasurer's previous answer, where he claimed that regional Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef in particular will benefit from a carbon tax. Treasurer, will the marine industry, including fishing trawlers and of tourism boats to the Great Barrier Reef, have to pay the carbon tax on their fuel?",99
138,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, He is a glutton for punishment. The shadow Treasurer asked me about the tourism industry. There is no industry in this country which is going to be a greater beneficiary of dealing with dangerous climate change than the tourism industry. Its very existence in my home state depends upon the survival of the Great Barrier Reef.  order: the Treasurer was asked a very straightforward question that any good Treasurer would instantly know the answer to. I ask you to direct him back to the question about whether diesel fuels are going to be exempt.,99
139,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In asking the question, the member for North Sydney referred the Treasurer to his previous answer. The Treasurer has the call.",99
140,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question from the shadow Treasurer is just part of their irresponsible and continuing scare campaign. Those opposite specialise in talking our economy down by making outrageous statements and claims which are all completely inaccurate and not based on any facts whatsoever. You cannot run economic policy if you ignore the facts, but that is the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer want to do. The Australian people see right through that crew opposite. They know that so much is being said by those opposite which is absolutely untrue and it reflects very poorly on all of them. Family Payments Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:57): question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Will the minister update the House on new measures to benefit Australian families? How have these measures been received and are there any risks to these important reforms?",99
141,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (14:57): I thank the member for Petrie very much for her question. She knows that the Labor government are delivering substantial benefits that are helping families and seniors, while all we get from those opposite is spin and no substance at all. Since last Friday Australian pensioners can now receive the new work bonus which will help them keep more of the pension when they take on some part-time work. Since last Friday Australian families will be able to get access to an expanded education tax refund that will now include school uniforms. Since last Friday there are now new baby bonus payment arrangements to help with the upfront purchases that parents need to make when a new baby comes into the family, such as paying for a new cot or a pram. Families will also be able to access improved family tax benefit payment arrangements to help them meet unexpected costs, such as the cost of fixing their cars. These are real, tangible benefits for Australian families and pensioners. These are reforms of substance, and each and every one of them was delivered by this Labor what government. And from last Friday Australian parents are now also receiving the government funded paid parental leave through their employer, and this helps parents keep their connection with their workplace. Just on Friday the Prime Minister and I were very pleased to go to MCDonalds in Werribee where we met new mum, Mia, with her baby, Sienna. Mia is about to go My back to work after having had her paid parental leave. Of course, she has been very pleased to have the time off with her new baby and has also benefited from keeping the connection with her workplace. She is now very pleased to go back to work. This demonstrates that our paid parental leave has been good for families and continues to be good for business. Also, from Friday parents who are returning to work after having time off looking after their children will be able to receive the childcare rebate fortnightly, which of course will help them balance their family budgets. It was this Labor government that increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent, which existed under the coalition, to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs. All of these changes have been delivered by this Labor government. And all that we hear from the opposition on these issues is the very, very large bill of $4.5 billion that this Leader of the Opposition wants to pay for their paid parental leave policy. Although I read in the paper today that the Leader of the Nationals told the Leader of the Opposition he should: Just get rid of the bloody thing. What is it to be? Is the Leader of the Opposition going to get rid of their paid parental leave policy or leave Australians with a huge bill? Carbon Pricing",100
142,Mr WYATT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her statement that for now households will not be paying the carbon tax on petrol for the family car. Is it not true that of order. while the family car might be exempt for now trucks will not? So while driving the car to the grocery store might not cost more for now, filling it with groceries most certainly will because almost every item on the grocery shelf needs electricity to process it and fuel in the trucks to get it there, all of which will be hit by the carbon tax. Why is the Prime Minister so determined to punish forgotten families with her carbon tax when they are already doing it tough?",100
143,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. On the question of petrol for families and small businesses, and light commercial vehicles, I said 'now and into the future' petrol will not be covered by the carbon pricing scheme-now or in the future. The member for Hasluck might want to note that point because that is not what he said in his question but that is what I said in this parliament and outside: 'now and into the future'-and I am referring to that part of the question that dealt with household petrol. On other issues associated with carbon pricing, the member for Hasluck should wait, as should the opposition in general, to see the full scheme. To date, in guessing what the scheme has in it, the Leader of the Opposition and members of the opposition have gone out and misled the community, and not told them the truth. For months and months and months, the Leader of the Opposition has been saying to anyone who would listen, including in this parliament, that petrol would go up by 6.5c",101

152,Mr Wyatt,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My point of order is on relevance. I asked a question about trucks and the cost,101
153,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,101
154,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Hasluck will resume his seat and the Leader of the House will resume his seat. The point of order is whether or not the response is directly relevant as required by the standing orders and, as I have said before, that is not the preferred improvement that I would have liked to the standing orders. What we are seeing now is debate in the responses. But, as I have said before, the debate might be considered directly relevant. The Prime Minister has the call and she knows the requirements of the standing orders.",101
155,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked a question where on more than one occasion the member for Hasluck said, 'In relation to the Prime Minister's statement that petrol would not be covered by the carbon price for now.' He said that twice. I am entitled to clarify in this parliament that what I have said here and publicly is that the carbon price will not apply to petrol now or in the future. Members of the opposition have been out there for months and months and months trying to scare Australian families with a false claim that petrol was going up by 6.5c a litre. I will not have them now going out there for months and months again trying to scare Australian families that somehow a carbon price is going to apply to petrol in the future. It is not honest. It is not right. implied by the member's question and I correct it now because it would be an irresponsible fear campaign, only pursued by people determined to be dishonest with the electorate. In relation to the rest of carbon pricing in response to the member for Hasluck, each and every statement that members opposite have made about carbon pricing have been grossly irresponsible and wrong. On a number of occasions I have come into this parliament and said to members opposite that every time they ask a question with a figure in it, they have made that figure up. Having committed that error month after month, day after day, week after week, making figures up in order to pursue a scare campaign, the responsible thing for the member for Hasluck to do now, before he makes any assumptions about how carbon pricing will work, is to wait until he gets the full details of the scheme. Also, the member for Hasluck should be out in his electorate telling every family he meets that his policy and the Leader of the Opposition's policy is to rip $720 a year off them. That is a fact.",101
156,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister please update the House on what the Australian government is doing to assist the people of Burma and whether there are any prospects of political and economic reform in Burma?,102
157,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Page for her question because I doubt that there is anyone in this House with more knowledge of Burma than the member for Page. When I was recently in Rangoon the depth of the long standing friendship with Aung San Suu Kyi which the member for Page has had over more than a decade was It was clear. I commend her engagement over a long period of time. The Australian people and the Australian government over the last couple of decades have focused on, legitimately, the continuing suppression of human rights in Burma. Recent history speaks for itself: crackdowns on democracy back in '88, in 1990Mr Robb interjecting",102
158,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Goldstein is warned!,102
159,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-the regime then ignoring democratic elections, Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest for 15 of the last 22 years, and of course the brutal suppression of the monks back in 2007. In the last several months we have seen some change-I do not wish to overstate it-on the part of the Burmese government. First, of course, we welcomed the release of Aung San Suu Kyi herself from house arrest. Second, after decades of military rule, we have for the first time, at least nominally, a new civilian government. Third, the president of that civilian government has made a statement on the future directions of democracy, economic reform, health, education and the rest. These Burma are limited changes but they are changes My nonetheless, and it was on that basis that I went to Burma in the course of the last several days. It was the first visit by an Australian foreign minister for about a decade, since Mr Downer went there in 2002, and the first visit to Burma by a Western foreign minister since the recent political change there. In discussions with the Burmese president I very much indicated that the first requirement of the international community is the release of more than 2,000 prisoners conscience still held in incarceration across Burma. This must be the next and most critical step. If the Burmese government takes that step it will have an immediate transformational effect on the international community's engagement with the government. But, beyond that, more is needed: greater freedom of political operation for Aung San Suu Kyi herself, the National League for Democracy and, on top of that, other democratic forces and parties. What is also required is the peaceful resolution of Burma's long standing ethnic conflicts within the country. I also spoke to the Burmese president and the foreign minister about our engagement in the reduction of poverty in that country, in health and education and in other areas such as food security and agriculture. Australia now stands as the second largest donor to Burma, after the United Kingdom. That is because in Burma we have the poorest country in Asia and therefore something like one-quarter of its population of 60 million living below the poverty line. We in Australia are doing our bit. I also spent time, together with the member for Page, with Aung San Suu Kyi herself, and can I say to all members of the House who have stood in solidarity with her over the course of the last couple of decades that she wanted me to express to all members of this House her appreciation for the support she has received from this parliament over a long period of time. That is not a partisan comment; it reflects the attitude of those opposite as well. She also indicated that when she visits rural Burma in the days ahead she expects security to be provided to her and guaranteed by the Burmese government. We reiterate that call. Notwithstanding a recent letter to her from the home affairs minister warning of her about her movements, she has indicated her preparedness to engage in political dialogue with the regime. We will continue to engage with Burma into the future. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",102

I think that on some occasions there are questions where there is a great deal of bipartisan support and I cannot believe that the House would leave those who are watching with the impression that we are trivialising those important issues. I have an expectation that the House will sit in silence on those occasions when there are those types of matters before us.,103
168,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The government's counterterrorism white paper identified home grown terrorism as the primary terrorist risk facing Australians and Australian interests and the figures in that respect are instructive. Since 2001 38 people have been charged with terrorism offences in Australia and, while some are yet to face the courts for decision, 37 of those 38 are Australian citizens and, in fact, 21 of the 38 were born in Australia. Just recently the Director-General of Security has made a speech outlining the extent to which individuals are attracted to violent extremist ideologies in many countries, including Australia. While their numbers are small, there is a disproportionate risk to Australians from that small number. So accordingly a comprehensive counterterrorism response necessarily means having a program to counter violent extremism. In that context, we have been working in partnership with a number of communities to identify extremist elements and to assist vulnerable people to resist the influence of those who would seek to encourage them down that path. The program that has been developed has been informed by expert analysis and advice as to the risk factors and also in terms of developing appropriate strategies. Essentially, that advice is that there is no single risk factor it does involve young men in particular becoming disconnected and disengaged from not only the mainstream community but also their own communities. That, in turn, makes them vulnerable to be exploited by those who would seek to encourage them down the path of violence. The first round of countering violent extremism measures was announced last year. They focused on youth mentoring, and today the government has announced an additional $1.7 million for 22 programs that focus on building community resilience. These programs are particularly interesting. They range from programs to communicate with youths who have been directly exposed to a violent extremist message through to local footy teams who are working with their local communities' youths from all backgrounds-to build partnerships and team building and an understanding of different views and, we hope, enduring friendshipsthrough to teacher education and, indeed, development of a national curriculum as well as some grants to those who would develop websites and communication platforms to assist in countering the violent extremist message that can be communicated over the internet. Could I also congratulate those local governments that have been involved in a number of programs aimed at breaking down stereotyping and at empowering people to resist violent extremism. The government is working in partnership with communities and I can express our appreciation that they have been prepared to recognise the risks and they have been prepared to bring forward such innovative ideas to address the location and specific circumstances of those communities. While these are simple and small measures, they are practical measures and we hope they will make the world just that bit safer for our children and grandchildren in but by and large the years ahead. Carbon Pricing",103
169,Ms MARINO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. Will small-business operators of concrete trucks, bobcats and backhoes be exempt from the carbon tax on their fuel usage?",104
170,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I have outlined, and so has the Assistant Treasurer, those that would be exempt. I am afraid the members who are so serious about running their scare campaign have got a little while to wait yet to get all the detail, and I will be happy to talk to them about it when we have finalised the scheme. In the meantime they will continue with their outrageous scare campaigns and distortions, but I do not believe that the Australian people respect this sort of outrageous approach. Health",104
171,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing.

175,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Deakin for his question because I know that, unlike the member for Dickson, he is interested in services that are being provided to his electorate. I can inform the House that two brand-new services became available for people across the country from 1 July, last week. Our telehealth services particularly for rural and regional Australia but also for those living in outer urban electorates like that represented by the member for Deakin. In addition to our telehealth services, the GP after-hours hotline became available for the first time six o'clock on Friday night. I can inform the House that already 1,300 families and consumers have used that service and been assisted by GPs who are on hand to provide them with medical advice and information in the middle of the night or on Sunday afternoon when their GP services are closed. The Prime Minister and I were lucky enough to be on hand to sit in on one of the first telehealth conferences. The Prime Minister was in Darwin, in the GP superclinic in Palmerston, with a GP and with a patient, Mary. I was with a specialist dermatologist in Adelaide. Using new technology, with of course the new MBS payments, we were able to see how a consultation could occur. It took under 10 My minutes. With the use of technology it meant that the patient in Darwin, instead of having to travel thousands of kilometres there and back to Adelaide to see a dermatologist or to wait weeks or months to have a simple consultation, was able to have her sore leg properly diagnosed. The GP was able to write the script and she was able to get along straight away with that treatment-a simple thing that could not occur if we were not in government because those opposite (1) are trying to pull down the NBN and (2) have opposed our investments in telehealth and opposed our investments in GP superclinics. I was also able last week to visit with the members for Chifley, Greenway, Reid and Parramatta, and with seniors and families in their electorates who want to be able to use the GP after-hours service. Those families would probably be very surprised to know that the Liberal opposition have said they are will slash funding for those services. I have not had a question from the member for Dickson for 97 weeks, yet they can go to the campaign and say that they will cut back these services that are already at providing support right across the country. If you live in rural and regional Australia, a specialist has suddenly become closer and easier to access because of our government's $620 million investments. If you are a family that has a sick child in the middle of the night you can now get a GP on the end of the line, but if the Liberal Party were in government they would be closing down those services. It is about time the Liberal Party came into this House and actually asked us a question on another matter of policy. While we are getting on with delivering health services and delivering health reform, all they are doing is opposing every investment and making it harder and harder for families that need medical services to get access to them. It is about time the member for Dickson started doing some work. Ms Gillard: I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS Report No. 57 of 2010-11",105

NA Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 Marshall, Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",107
182,Mr TURNBULL,BILLS," Let me say right at the very outset that every member of the coalition is passionately committed to the rollout of the availability fast broadband to all Australians at affordable prices. The debate about the National Broadband Network, of which this bill is a subset, is not a debate about the end. We agree on the end. We agree that all Australians should have access to the benefits of broadband, of fast broadband and of access to the benefits of a digital economy. Our point of difference with the government lies in the means it is employing to achieve that end. In particular, with the way it is establishing the National Broadband Network. The National Broadband Network is the largest infrastructure project in our country's history. Yet, despite coming into government in 2007 with a very clear and prominent pledge that no major infrastructure project would be undertaken without a rigorous cost benefit analysis and with an equally prominent pledge that a specialist agency, Infrastructure Australia, would be set up to conduct those cost-benefit analyses, this government with this-the biggest infrastructure project in our history-continues to refuse to undertake any cost-benefit analysis. Again and again it shows itself to be utterly hypocritical on this issue. If the government were serious about rigorous economic analysis and dealing with taxpayers' dollars responsibly it would undertake that cost benefit analysis and pose this question: what is the fastest and most cost-effective way to deliver fast broadband to all Australians and do so in a way that makes broadband more affordable? I stress the point of affordability because naturally in this place we focus, quite properly, on the burden on the taxpayer: is the taxpayer getting value for money and could the objective of fast broadband across the nation be delivered at a lower cost to the taxpayer-could the taxpayer get more bang for their buck, in other words? But an of equally important issue, and one that I would say is, if anything, of more importance, is whether broadband will be affordable so that those Australians who are not able to afford it today will be able to afford it in the future. The reality is-and we rely on the ABS, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, for this-that the largest group of Australians who do not have access to the internet today are those in households earning $40,000 or less a year. The biggest barrier to internet access is not technology; it is not some issue of network design. Sure, there are issues of network design that impact on the speeds people can achieve. But, in terms of basic access to the internet at any speed, the biggest barrier is income. Too many Australians cannot afford it. That is a fact. Mr Husic interjecting",107
183,Mr TURNBULL,BILLS,"The honourable member opposite shakes his head. He should have another look at the ABS statistics. The reality is that the NBN will not deliver more affordable broadband. If anyone doubts my contention, they do not have to rely on my remarks or indeed on the remarks of the many competitive telcos who make the point that this is going to result in more expensive broadband because it is a big government monopoly, heavily capitalised, which will inevitably not be subject to the price pressures of competition because it will have no competitors; they have only to look at page 105 of the NBN corporate plan and see there the forecast retail prices, which are equal to or indeed higher than many of the plans that are available today. Of course it stands to reason. We know the factor that has brought down broadband costs over the last five years-by as much as half, according to the OECD, as I recall-has been the growing competition in the telecommunications sector. That competition at the facilities level, at the level of physical access into the premises, is going to be eliminated because the government not only is legislating to constitute the NBN as an effective fixed line monopoly but has paid billions of dollars of taxpayers' money to Telstra and to Optus not to use their HFC networks, their pay television hybrid fibre coaxial networks, to offer broadband or voice in competition with the NBN. Yet we know that those networks are capable of providing broadband services today, are providing broadband services today and are providing in some markets-in Melbourne in particular-broadband services at speeds of 100 megabits per second. When you look at other markets around the world-South Korea is always a good example; the United States is another-you see that HFC cables, pay TV cables, are being used to provide broadband services and in those markets provide the competition with the ADSL services provided over the copper networks owned by the telephone companies-or indeed competition with the fibre networks owned by telcos and other broadband providers, as is the case in Korea, where the fastest growth in broadband penetration has been over the HFC networks belonging to SK Telecom and LG. This whole NBN scheme is going to be, tragically for the people of Australia, a loselose. It is more expensive than it needs to be. The government say we are not right on that score, but if they had the courage of their convictions they would have done the cost benefit analysis which, if they are right, would demonstrate that this was in fact the most cost-effective way to set up a national broadband network. But, because they are afraid of asking the question, the Australian people can only reasonably assume that they fear what the answer will be and that they know it will be that they are spending tens of billions of dollars more than they need to. On the other side of the coin, we know that this network is going to provide not cheaper and more affordable broadband access but broadband access that is either just as expensive as current services or indeed more expensive, particularly for the higher speeds. This is an important point. I will not delay the House with the material that I published recently about the South Korean market, but it is very instructive to analyse the experience there. Consumers in South Korea, which is arguably the most advanced economy in terms of broadband penetration and use of information technology, are not prepared to pay any significant sort of premium for higher speeds. When you look at the NBN corporate plan you see that a fundamental premise there is that Australians will pay very substantial premiums to go from 12 to 25, 50 and up to 100 megabits per second and higher. When you match that against experience in this market-indeed, Telstra's experience with its HFC cable in Melbourne and in particular the experience in South Korea or the comparable experience in the United States-you see that consumers are not prepared to pay significant premiums or, indeed, any premium in many cases for faster speeds. Why is that? It is because speed in and of itself-that is to say, 50 megabits per second, 100 megabits per second-is of no value to a consumer whatsoever. The value comes from the applications that run on it and that the speed enables to be run on it. If there are applications that can be run on a higher speed that can be run on a lower speed-that is to say, if everything a consumer wants can be run adequately, effectively, satisfactorily at a lower speed and at a lower price-that is the product they will take, and that is exactly what has happened. This bill is all of a one with the goal of the government in creating this big monopoly, the NBN. It is designed to deal with the situation, the deployment of fibre, into greenfields developments. The coalition does not object to the policy objective of greenfields developments being, wherever possible, rolled out with fibre to the home. There is an incremental cost, as we have acknowledged in the dissenting report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network that was tabled today, but it is not a substantial incremental cost compared to the enormous cost of rolling out fibre to the home in brownfields areas. I should note, however, that much to my surprise when I was visiting South Korea recently I saw that, in some very new and very large residential greenfields developments, fibre had not been cabled into the premises; in fact, the fibre network terminated in the basement and the buildings themselves were cabled with copper. I just offer that to the House and to those listening to this debate today as an example of the Korean experience, which, as I say, is very instructive because they have been further down this track than us. Nonetheless, assuming we are going to go down this line of installing fibre in greenfields premises, I think ensuring that rollout is efficient and timely has a very important impact on Australia's telecommunications environment. The NBN estimates that 1.9 million greenfields premises-that is to say, households in new developmentswill have to be connected to the NBN by 2020 and a quarter of a million by June 2013. The government has long argued that the greenfields market for fibre deployment is competitive. Given this competitiveness, even this government recognised that it would be ludicrous to do away with that market entirely and that private operators, it said, should be encouraged to roll out fibre new developments. In its first policy consultation paper released in May 2009 on greenfields estates, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy stated: The installation of FTTP is taking place in a competitive context, with developers typically contracting out the provision of infrastructure and services in developments. In areas where the FTTP infrastructure provider does not provide retail services, arrangements are increasingly being put in place to ensure partnerships exist with retail providers to deliver services to consumers. In that paper, the department estimated that, at the time, around 120 greenfields estates were being prepared for fibre deployments, with more than 10 operators reaching an estimated 150,000 homes. In 2009, Senator Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, set up a stakeholder reference group and his department held one-on-one consultations with operators to understand how to implement its greenfields policy. As late as a December 2010, the minister was still telling the industry it would be an integral part of a fibre rollout. The minister said: It has been a consistent feature of the Government's policy in new developments that there should be room for competing providers. This continues to be the case. … … … Providers can compete to provide infrastructure in new developments, for example, by offering more tailored solutions to developers or more expeditious delivery. Sadly, those fine intentions have not been reflected in this bill. In common with every other aspect of this NBN project, it will see an effective market completely scrapped and all of the inherent risks and liabilities involved with rolling out fibre transferred to to the taxpayer. The NBN Co. has said that once it has rolled out the optical fibre line it will take up ownership not just of the network but also of the pits and pipes that the developers have installed. Down the track this will take the cost of maintenance off the hands of developers and place it with the taxpayers, but the cost of providing the pits and the pipes lies with the developers. The NBN Co. are offering no upfront cost to developers when installing the optical fibre network. That is important because smaller fibre-to-the-premises developers do not have the luxury of spending taxpayers' money in the hope that 10 years down the track they may actually begin to recoup some of the money that has been invested. As OPENetworks stated in their submission to the joint committee: NBN Co is the obvious first choice for Developers because NBN Co is the only provider that can fund the network build costs (that otherwise have been paid by Developers to OPENETWORKS ...) and that funding is then able to be recovered by NBN Co charging RSPs higher operational prices. OPENetworks have argued that this policy is in fact a violation of the competitive neutrality policy for government owned businesses, which holds that they should not exercise unfair advantage by reason of their government ownership over their private sector competitors. An appropriate application has been made to the Productivity Commission in that regard. What this legislation will do is make greenfields property developments more expensive and slower to bring to market, and stifle competition. The department said before the committee that a developer has the choice. He has to put in the pits and pipes, but he has forth. the choice of going to a private sector fibre company or waiting for the NBN. The reality is that there is no choice because the NBN will provide the fibre for no cost to the developer whereas the developer would obviously have to pay a price to a private fibre company. Each of the representatives of the property sector and the greenfield operators have made the point to us that the business of putting in the pits and pipes and then waiting around for the NBN Co. to turn up is going to place considerable delays and expense on property developments. We have heard many complaints from the property sector about the delays occasioned by this. I am foreshadowing amendments that we will be moving later in this debate which will seek to rectify that particular problem. The amendment we are going to moveand this has been detailed at some length in the dissenting report-will mean that a property developer, having dug the pits and pipes, can choose to have a private sector fibre provider to lay the fibre as long as it is done in accordance with the specifications, may which should be stipulated by the industry, not by NBN. NBN obviously will have a big input into that but it should not be dictated by the NBN for exactly the same reason that, when telecommunications reform began some decades ago, Telstra's ability to set technical standards was taken away and moved to the regulator. The developer can employ this private sector company or what are called greenfield fibre operators. As long as they have installed that fibre in accordance with those specifications, the developer will be entitled to be remunerated by the NBN Co-in other words, it will require NBN Co. to buy that fibre setup from the developer for a tariff which will be set by the minister on a per residence basis, taking into account the relevant factors such as the cost of construction, NBN's costs and so What is the object of this amendment? This does not undermine in any way the objectives of the NBN. This means that a developer can get on with the job, get the fibre installed and be paid for it without having to wait around for the great big government monopoly to deign in its magnificence and wisdom to get around to this developer's problems. The reality is that a new development which does not have the fibre installed will be at an enormous disadvantage from a marketing point of view to another development that does have that fibre installed. So it is important that developers are able to get on with the job and get the fibre installed. This amendment will enable them to do just that. We flagged this issue with the various developer's organisations and with the greenfield operators in the course of the joint standing committee inquiry. All of them supported it and welcomed it. We flagged it also with the department. Their response was essentially equivocal. It was not really a responsive answer at all. They did not seem to have a particularly strong view on it either way. The bottom line is that will make it easier for developers to get on with the job. It may well save the NBN Co. cost and expense and, if it encourages NBN Co. to move things along and be more timely in its construction of these networks, then that would be a very good thing as well. The other amendment that we will move a little later in the course of this debate-and which we flagged in the dissenting reportwould enable the private sector cable companies, greenfield operators, to be exempted from the cherry-picking provisions of this act if the fibre network they seek to build meets the following conditions: it is not owned or operated by NBN Co. or Telstra; it is installed in a new development; it is owned and operated by the same entity which builds it; and it delivers retail services only to the persons who reside in the development. The purpose of this amendment is to enable the private sector greenfield cable operators to stay in business, to be able to put in a network they would then be able to operate as a small private network. They should be exempt from those cherry-picking provisions because of their scale. As we have said in the report, it would effectively maximise the options available to developers and to the greenfield operators. They could contract on the basis that the greenfield operator would build the network and operate it until such time as it was sold to the NBN Co. or they could contract on the basis that the greenfield operator would continue to operate it and there would be no sale to the NBN Co. at all. They would no doubt be under some risk that the NBN Co. might choose to overbuild them but one would hope that, when the rush of blood to the head of NBN Co. settles down a little, they will not be overbuilding brand new fibre optic networks, given the expense of doing so. This amendment, coupled with the first amendment, will mean that a developer is in the position where he or she can employ the same company-and this is, as TransACT said in the inquiry, clearly the most efficient way to do it-to put in the pits and pipes, put in the cable and then either be paid for that cable by NBN Co. and, in effect, sell it to NBN Co. or for that cable-laying company to operate it as an independent cable network. That gives the developer a range of options. It does not put the developer at a disadvantage and it does not give the developer a disincentive from using the private sector. It means that the greenfields companies can continue in existence and can provide some real competition to the NBN. I imagine that honourable members opposite will oppose this because they are opposed to competition, but at some point they have to match the rhetoric with the reality of the bill that is before the House. Their rhetoric has been that there is nothing in this bill that impedes competition in the greenfields developments. But a greenfields operator under the scheme in this legislation is at an insuperable disadvantage to the NBN Co. because the NBN Co.'s cable will be laid for free, at no cost to the developer, and the cost presumably will be recovered from charges made to retail service providers over time, whereas if the developer goes to hire somebody else to put in the fibre network they will have to pay them to do so. Naturally the preference bias will be in favour of the NBN Co. I imagine that many developers would not be too troubled by that. Obviously the owners of the operators of these greenfields cable networks are very threatened by that. Many people in the industry have said that this bill will have the effect of putting them as an industry right out of business. In the absence of these amendments, I fear that that would be the case. Many developers might be quite happy just to let the NBN get on and do the job, but the experience has been of inordinate delays. All of us in this House who have been involved in the development sector or observed people in the development sector or are familiar with the conduct of big government owned monopolies or indeed big private companies know that they take their time. Many developers will be left waiting and waiting for the cable to be laid. The longer they wait, the longer it will be before the development is complete and the longer it will be before they can get it to market. of them said to us in their evidence that they believe that the private sector can put in the infrastructure at a considerably lower cost than the NBN is likely to. The department turned up their nose at that and said they could not see any evidence for that. It really is not a question of evidence. One way or the other, let the market decide. If the private sector can do a better and cheaper job than NBN then no doubt developers will see that as an opportunity. The amendments that we are proposing here will give developers real choice. They will ensure that cable is rolled out in greenfields developments in a more timely and efficient fashion. They will ensure that developers are not put in a 'Hobson's choice' situation where they can either wait and wait for the NBN to show up and lay cable at no cost to them or pay somebody else to do it out of their own pocket with no reimbursement to get it done sooner. And they give the greenfields cable operatorsTransACT, Opticom and others-the chance to stay in business and to provide some competition. To honourable members opposite whose approval of these amendments we in the committee sought, but to no avail, I say to them once again that if they are serious about competition this is the opportunity to support amendments-which we will move later-which will provide some real competition. There are many things that are unique about the NBN. The government members may regard this as a compliment. One is that there is no country in the world spending as much on a national broadband network as we are. Our spending, on any measure, is off the charts. There is no other country in the world that is establishing a new government owned monopoly to deliver broadband. Again, that is a world first-and not one that we should be too proud of. But just as importantly and All most ominously there is no other country in the world that is seeking to eliminate facilities based competition. Take your pick. Anywhere else in the world governments are very anxious-and this is particularly the case in Korea and the United States-to ensure that there is always real competition among the fixed line services and that they are available to as many households as possible. The amendments I have foreshadowed will go some way at least in new developments to achieving that. After the amendments are debated later, we will be commending them to the House and trust they will get the support of the House. (Time expired)",108
184,Ms ROWLAND,BILLS," Firstly, since the member for Wentworth mentioned it, he knows perfectly well that he came to the committee with half-baked amendments full of square brackets saying, 'I will insert something here when I think about what to put in here.' So he should not come in here and make those assertions. Secondly, we waited about 10 minutes for him to give his usual spiel without even talking to the bill. As the member for Lyne said when he introduced the advisory report earlier today, the disagreements in this committee and in this report on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 actually come down to a question of policy and ideology more than anything else. That is borne out by the fact that we have had to sit here for the last half-hour listen to the member for Wentworth say the same rhetoric he has said on every single occasion, crying these tears for affordability. What did they do? What did he do when he was a member of a government which saw Australia going down the gurgler with respect to broadband rankings around the world? Australia became an absolute backwater in terms of internet accessibility and high-speed broadband. It has taken this government to pick up the mantle and actually turn that around. We know why he is saying these things. We know it is in his remit. We know that is his job. The sole purpose of him coming in here today and spending half an hour just bagging out the NBN is that he has been given the remit to destroy the NBN. On this point, I found he actually felt and looked rather uncomfortable on this occasion because he talked about HFC being available. He knows perfectly well that only 30 per cent of the country is covered by it and even then that is only if you are lucky enough to live on the eastern seaboard around metropolitan areas. He knows perfectly well when he mentions the United States that they have had a long history of ubiquitous cable investment. He talks about South Korea and again he knows perfectly well that the reason South Korea has become the internet economic miracle is government intervention and acceptance a decade ago of the need for broadband development. What were we in Australia doing in that time? Absolutely nothing. The member for Wentworth talks about the value of broadband being in the applications rather than speed. Absolutely true, but the fact is that in order to deliver those applications you need bandwidth. Without bandwidth they are absolutely nothing. The member for Wentworth talks about facilities based competition. That is fine, but we know from not only the analyses and that have been done by the ACCC since 1997 but also in the lead up to the NBN being announced that facilities based competition in Australia has failed. Why has it failed? Because Telstra as the incumbent operator was a vertically integrated company controlling both the wholesale and the retail levels, so the market failed. What happens when markets fail? What do Labor governments do? We step in when the market fails and we rectify that failure. The member for Wentworth talks yet again about Australia going it alone on what it is doing in this area. I remind members that one of the key regulatory principles is that regulations should be specific to the needs of each country. What is the need for Australia right now? The need is to connect a country of vast geography and differing topology and a country which has definite broadband black spots that have not been addressed. You do not have to take it from me. Take it from the ITU Secretary General of the United Nations, who visited Australia only in April this year and made the following comment: Australia is a different country. Its geography spread of the people, the level of telecommunications development and the level (of competition) between the operators-I will not say which one is a giant or not-all of those conditions, you do not find them elsewhere and therefore you do need to have the guts to tackle the problem. That is exactly what this government is doing. Finally, the member for Wentworth constantly wants to throw around the word 'monopoly'. As everyone knows, the NBN is a wholesale-only network. How will it deliver competition to consumers? It does that by disinfecting the wholesale level so that the vertical integration disease is obscured to the extent that we can regulate the wholesale level and give a level playing field to retail operators with equivalent pricing and terms. Now that I have dispensed with the member for Wentworth, I turn to the bill itself. This is a critical piece of legislation the development of the National Broadband Network, particularly for the estimated nearly two million new premises that will be constructed across Australia during the rollout phase. The passage of this bill will provide something vitally important for all stakeholders including industry, consumers, local government and developers. What is that? It is certainty. For homebuyers, there will be certainty that their new dwelling will be fibre ready. For developers, there will be certainty as to their obligations to ensure ducts and lead-in are fibre ready. I turn to some practical context of the bill. The practicalities of this bill are certainly not lost on me. While I doubt there will be substantial greenfields development in some electorates such as Wentworth and Bradfield in the immediate future, this is not the case in respect of west and north-west Sydney. During my time as a representative on Blacktown City Council and as its Deputy and Mayor, I was party to decisions on many new development approvals and subdivisions. I am on the record as an advocate for the notion that, just as the local government planning and approvals process takes into account community needs such as parks, sporting amenities and childcare centres, access to advanced communication services must be viewed as an essential service with infrastructure backing that is akin to sewerage and electricity and made a condition of consent. I have witnessed first hand-and too many of my constituents are living it todaythe consequences of underinvestment in advanced communications infrastructure in our new greenfields estates. For many residents in suburbs such as Kellyville Ridge, The Ponds and even Stanhope Gardens in Glenwood, their primary reason for contact and advocacy with my office concerns their inability to access what are for now regarded as entry level broadband products such as ADSL2+. Even in older estates in Greenway, which were once greenfields or even brownfields developments, such as specific streets in the well-established suburb of Kings Langley, access to high speed broadband is a challenge. The timing of this particular development meant that the Foxtel cable rollout passed by this area. This is not, as the member for Wentworth has attempted to assert on just about every occasion, a consequence of an income barrier. It is amusing enough that this furphy is being peddled by the same person who ran a fantastic dial-up ISP, which he sold in the dotcom boom and made either a cool $60 million or $40 million, according to recent reports-but who is counting? No, this lack of access is the consequence of chronic underinvestment in communications infrastructure in greenfields estates. You only need to look at the median house prices in Kings Langley, Kellyville Ridge and The Ponds, which are $545,000, $588,000 and $596,000 respectively, to understand that this is not merely a question of income. When one examines the electoral divisions ranked by the proportion of households with a broadband internet connection, there is not a single regional electorate with a percentage of households with broadband connections above 50 per cent. Indeed, far and away the tyranny of distance when it comes to broadband accessibility is borne out by the fact that nearly every rural and regional electorate lies in the bottom half of the scale. I am yet to receive an answer from anyone on the opposite side of the House explaining to me what they did over all their years in office to improve broadband development and accessibility for households in suburbs such as Mt Druitt, to develop broadband as a tool for social inclusion in disadvantaged regions or even to create a comprehensive policy for greenfields development. As an example of how confused their policy has been on this issue, one only needs to look at the so-called 'real action' plan they took to the last election. On page 4 of that policy stated: The Coalition will conduct an urgent review of whether to mandate that all 'greenfields' connections must be fibre. That leaves it up in the air whether there should be a fibre mandate, as opposed to copper, in new developments. Yet on page 17 of that same policy it states: The Coalition believes that new dwellings should have a fibre connection rather than a copper connection. So even in their own policy, the one they took to the last election, they could not make up their minds on their position. This confusion from those opposite continues in their ill-conceived proposed amendments to this bill, which I will happily deal with in the consideration in detail stage. In the meantime, I note that page 42 of the dissenting report into the bill, which was tabled earlier today, states: … the evidence the inquiry received demonstrates that there is a vigorous private market for the construction of fibre infrastructure in new developments. The dissenting report goes on to say that the bill will end all that. That is simply not true. There is vigorous competition which will remain with the bill in effect. The change will be that the competitors will compete to provide fibre installation to NBN Co. rather than to developers. Instead of developers extracting an economic rent, consumers will not pay for fibre connectivity of itself. They will pay for what they use from a retail service provider providing services using the NBN. The constructors will obtain a normal return. The change is that there is no arbitrage opportunity, which those opposite, who like to say they are champions of competition, should embrace. No arbitrage opportunity and no abnormally high rentsthe effect is good for consumers. I turn to that part of the bill dealing with it is the proposed access regime-the proposed part 20A of the Telecommunications Act. I would like to make the point that the proposed regime is based on existing provisions in schedule 1 of the Telecommunications Act, none of which are novel. It provides a regime for carriers to secure access to fixed line facilities owned by noncarriers in order to ensure that fibre can be rolled out using these facilities. So it is indeed based on the existing schedule 1 of the Telecommunications Act. Access can be on terms that are commercially agreed or, failing agreement, one can agree on an arbitrator. The default arbitrator will be the ACCC. So, as can be seen, the access regime is completely in line with existing competition provisions under Telecommunications Act itself. The outcomes of this bill will be early and less costly access to fibre based broadband for residents of new developments, reduced costs for deploying fibre by ensuring that the ductwork infrastructure is indeed fibre-ready, reduced costs for deployment of fibre through access to non-carrier duct as well and cabling for new premises which ensures they can take advantage of the NBN. All of these things are well understood by consumers. They understand that the definitive agreements, signed the other week, between Telstra, Optus and NBN Co., mean that we will be able to fast-track using existing facilities and existing infrastructure in the most efficient way possible. This is well understood in my electorate, where Riverstone is the site of the first Sydney metro rollout. The question I continually get there is not, 'Why we are doing this?'-not the question that the member for Wentworth seems to believe consumers keep asking over and over again. They are not asking why; they are asking when. It cannot come soon enough for these areas of west and north-west Sydney, which have suffered from chronic underdevelopment. I turn now to the issue of NBN Co. operating as the wholesale provider of last resort. There is strong stakeholder support for this. It supports a consistent national approach in the future and, if alternative providers wish to compete with NBN Co., they are welcome to do so. I will finish by talking briefly about some of the proposed amendments. I could not resist the notion put forward by the member for Wentworth about NBN Co. being forced somehow to buy network from other providers. What is actually being proposed here is that a developer will arrange for NBN Co. to purchase that part of the network from the fibre provider. This is highly problematic. It the seems to suggest the developer can force NBN Co. to buy another person's asset without their permission. That raises issues about acquisition of property. I will end on that note, but I also particularly want to draw the House's attention to the significance of 20 July. Everyone should be putting that date in their diaries. On that day, the shadow minister will be addressing a CEDA forum on the topic 'Broadband Vision for Australia: The Opposition's Perspective'. This will be a pretty short speech. If you want to go to it, it is $270 a head, but I am happy to save any member here $270 and 10 minutes of their time by pointing out that we already know what the opposition's policy on broadband is-it is to destroy the NBN. The member for Wentworth has demonstrated that that is his remit and that that is what he will be trying to do. (Time expired)",114
185,Mr HARTSUYKER,BILLS," I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill. I think there is agreement in this House over the need for high-speed broadband, but the issue is how you get there and how you provide those services in the most efficient and effective way-a way that provides an acceptable return on funds invested, a way that ensures there is excellent competition in the market and a way that delivers services to Australians at a price they can afford. The purpose of this bill is to facilitate the installation of fibre into new developments and housing estates and to ensure that the telecommunication infrastructure placed in new developments meets the technical requirements of NBN Co. There are four measures in this bill in total. Firstly, the bill enables the minister to specify new developments in which fixed lines for installation must be optical fibre lines and must comply with technical specifications. The bill calls this rule the optical fibre line requirement and requires NBN Co. to be the installer of last resort, where a developer does not choose a commercial provider. However, it is becoming clear that the terms of this legislation will see NBN Co. becoming the installer of first resort, rather than last. Secondly, the bill requires that facilities installed in a development must be fibreready. This will be called the fibre-ready facility requirement and will ensure that passive infrastructure such as underground ducting and pits and pipes allow the ready deployment of optical fibre cabling. Thirdly, the bill prevents corporations from selling or leasing land or buildings in new developments unless fibre-ready facilities have been installed. Finally, the bill implements a regime for carriers to secure access to fixedline facilities such as pits and pipes owned by non-carriers to ensure fibre can be rolled out using those facilities. Access to these facilities will be on terms that are negotiated commercially by the respective parties, or determined by an agreed arbiter. The bill creates a mechanism whereby the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be the default arbiter where an alternative is not selected by the respective parties. The coalition believes that the government has taken the same approach with this bill as it has with the entire NBN project. The government's approach is to establish a monopoly at a huge cost to the Australian taxpayer and destroy competition at every opportunity. Through NBN Co., the government is completely dismantling competition in the wholesale telecommunications industry-all so that the business case and the potential return of NBN Co. can be propped up. But, like all government monopolies, this approach simply creates a poor allocation of resources and massive cost blowouts for taxpayers. This legislation is being debated within an environment where NBN Co. is already facing these blowouts and delays to the rollout. We have seen the cost of installing the NBN into Tasmanian homes reach $7,500 per premise. On the mainland, NBN Co. suspended its construction tender in April because bids by companies familiar with the industry came in at around $8 billion above NBN Co.'s budget. Most insulting of all to the Australian taxpayer is the announcement last week that the Gillard government will be paying billions of dollars to Telstra and Optus to transfer their customers from copper and wire infrastructure to the NBN. We have the situation where NBN Co. is paying the two largest wholesale operators billions of dollars all to acquire customers and charge them a higher price for broadband. Yet, despite these billions of taxpayer dollars being spent, the NBN only has around 728 customers receiving the service for free. It is spending $132 million on the cost of employing around 1,000 NBN Co. staff members, with 51 executives earning over $300,000 a year. Within this context, we have this bill which will destroy the ability of fibre installation companies to compete with NBN Co. for the rights to install fibre in new developments. The coalition agrees that it is desirable to encourage the installation of fibre in new developments. It has been a farcical situation allowed by this government, where Telstra has been required to install copper into smaller developments of less than 100 premises with the knowledge that the infrastructure will eventually be overbuilt by fibre. What a waste of money it is to overbuild infrastructure-no wonder Telstra has been reluctant to install copper and has left developments at a standstill while the government takes its time rectifying the situation. The coalition completely welcomes the chance we have to ensure that fibre is installed in all new developments. However, we believe that the private sector has been facilitating the installation of fibre in new developments for many years and that this bill unfairly removes this competition to NBN Co. There is already an active and productive market between competitive greenfield operators, or CGOs, to secure contracts from developers for the purpose of installing fibre. This point was made clear in hearings of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Broadband Network into this legislation. The industry group Greenfield Fibre Operators of Australia which consists of seven installers of fibre including OPENetworks, Service Elements, TransACT, Comverge, Broadcast Engineering and Pivit-submitted to the committee: GFOA companies have been competing with one another, Telstra Velocity, Opticomm, VicUrban, Multinet Broadband and other carriers/operators ... for over ten years. ... there is already a very healthy competitive market between experienced wholesale network carriers in Greenfields ... that is not acknowledged by Government. The submission by GFOA also states that competition in the market has produced enormous reductions in the cost of installing fibre. In an environment where NBN Co. are using public funds to create a wholesale fibre network, surely the taxpayer should expect the government to pursue the lowest costs available. However, GFOA state: Deployment of FTTP networks by GFOA carrier/operators are currently costing $1,500 lot ... for networks where the functional performance specifications and standards equal or exceed the current functional performance specifications and standards of NBN Co networks that cost more than double the price to build. In Tasmania during the installation of fibre for premises with pre-existing infrastructure, NBN Co. has spent an average of $7,500 per premise connected. Clearly a competitive market would allow cheaper costs and a better outcome for taxpayers. We hear the government give lip service to competition. According to the minister, this legislation will implement a regime where NBN Co. is the installer of last resort where the developer does not choose a competing installer. However, the bill effectively destroys any competition for two reasons. Firstly, developers can incur the expense of building trenches and fibre-ready facilities and then employ NBN Co. to install the fibre at zero additional cost to the developer. What possible incentive will a developer have to hire a competing fibre installer to roll out fibre when the developer can hire NBN Co. to do the same work at no cost? The second way the government is ensuring an NBN Co. monopoly in installing fibre is by enforcing standards for a fibreready facility in greenfield estates. In practical terms, this means that the pit and duct infrastructure used to facilitate the installation of fibre must meet standards set by the minister and specified by NBN Co. So, we will have a situation where the dominant operator in the market will have the power to set the technical specifications and requirements that its competitors must meet. This was the situation prior to 1989, when the then Labor government transferred Telecom Australia to an independent body and started the process by which telecommunications were recognised in the per Trade Practices Act and overseen by the ACCC. The impact of this bill should clearly be prohibited by the ACCC, which the government is effectively turning into a toothless tiger with regards to telecommunications regulation. Rather than implement NBN Co. as the installer of last resort, the provisions of this bill ensure that NBN Co. will be the installer of first resort because developers have absolutely no incentive to consider another installer. This point is felt strongly by existing private installers. For instance, TransACT submitted to the committee that: ... it appears to be the intent of the Government and NBN Co, that it plans and needs NBN Co to be the monopoly provider of FTTP in Greenfields developments; The impact of the government's policy on new housing developments is that the competitive industry will simply cease to exist. The Greenfield Fibre Operators of Australia made this clear when they told the committee that the bill will simply put them out of business. So here we have a Labor government that claims to support competition and that a monopoly wholesale network is the only way to promote retail broadband competition, but is completely destroying competitive industries while it sets up the NBN Co. monopoly. This approach will have devastating effects not only on niche industries such as fibre installation but also on the entire telecommunications industry in Australia. As the Victorian government recently said in its submission to the NBN inquiry being undertaken by the House of Representatives: After over two decades of national economic and financial reform, the NBN proposal in its present form represents a very serious threat to the term competition in the telecommunications sector. The Victorian government went on to say: The increasingly apparent risk is that the commonwealth could, over time, fully replicate a dysfunctional telecommunications structure that has hindered investments in the current broadband market. This would be the result if it simply replaces Telstra's market with an NBN Co infrastructure monopoly with all the attendant inefficiencies and constraints on investment, innovation and future policymaking. Through this bill, these predictions are already coming true in the market for fibre installation in new developments. We will see competition wiped out and NBN Co. installing fibre at a higher cost per lot than could be achieved by private enterprise, with the taxpayer footing the bill every step of the way. The coalition will be introducing two amendments to protect competition and ensure that taxpayers benefit from the efficiencies of a competitive marketplace for fibre installations in new developments. We believe that the bill should be amended to remove the disincentive for developers to use private operators to install fibre infrastructure. The bill would be amended to enable developers, whose project has an installed fibre network in compliance with the minister's specifications, to have the option to require NBN Co.'s purchase of the network at a reasonable price. A reasonable price would be determined by the minister with consideration of current market prices and costs. The developer will then have an incentive to use private operators because the costs of doing so would be recouped from selling the network to NBN Co. Essentially, developers will face the same costs regardless of whether they employ a private operator or NBN Co. to install the fibre. By protecting competition in this manner, the long- government would be ensuring competitive pressures keep down the costs of installing fibre in new developments and taxpayers will benefit from getting the best market price for the installation of fibre. This amendment will also impose a cost discipline market directly on NBN Co. If NBN Co.'s competitors can build connections at a lower charge than NBN Co., then there would be a power cost saving to NBN Co. and to all taxpayers. The second coalition amendment would see certain fibre networks exempt from the operations of parts 7 and 8 of the Telecommunications Act, which will require that all fibre networks must operate under the same technical standards as the NBN. The amendment will ensure that those networks not owned or operated by NBN Co. or Telstra, and where those networks only delivered retail services to persons residing in the development, would be exempt from these parts of the act. NBN Co. would still retain the option to build its own network in the development if it wished and would have access to the fibre-ready facilities which developer is required to build, but the network would still be placed under the same access conditions as stipulated for NBN Co. This amendment would ensure that competition continues to exist for private networks in new developments and that developers are given maximum flexibility in choosing services for their future residents. The warning signs are all there that this project will suffer from low demand, be months or years behind schedule and end up costing taxpayers billions above the $50 billion that they are already projected to be paying. The coalition urge the government to adopt our amendments to ensure that we can salvage at least some competition in the market while NBN Co. continues destroying all competitors in its wake. Just two weeks ago we saw yet another example of NBN Co. destroying competition with its announcement of the terms of the Telstra agreement, presently valued at some $11 billion, and the announcement of the deal with Optus, proposing to spend $800 million to do nothing more than purchase customers from the network and take out competition. We believe that competition is the cornerstone of delivering lower prices consumers. Why then are we going to use taxpayers' dollars when the only return on investment for those very taxpayers who are paying out the money to purchase customers is that they will be paying a higher price for their broadband? It seems that only Labor could come up with such an interesting business proposal: to charge taxpayers, in the case of Optus, $800 million to purchase customers for no other reason than to charge those very same taxpayers more for their own broadband. We know that cost is a major impediment to many people accessing high-speed broadband, so we should be really focusing on delivering those services at the lowest the possible price. Eliminating competition and creating an artificial monopoly are not ways to achieve that goal and are certainly counter to the objectives of good telecommunications policy and are counter to the objectives of the coalition.",117
186,Mr HUSIC,BILLS," It gives me great pleasure to talk on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 and reflect on some of the work of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network. It is a great honour to be on that committee for a number of reasons, only one of which is my deep and abiding interest in broadband. More particularly, at this point in time we are discussing some of the most exciting reforms that are taking place within this industry. Over the course of the last two weeks, the deal that the government did between NBN Co., Telstra and Optus was fundamentally a groundbreaking reform which has been pursued for generations: decoupling Telstra from its network and ensuring fundamental competitive reform. This reform had escaped the nation and we managed to achieve it. In its wake, we will ensure that we will not for revisit some of the debates about the needless duplication of networks when cable TV was being rolled out in the 1990s. We have singularly sidestepped that through this deal we have set up between NBN Co. and Telstra and Optus, which will ensure a more efficient use of our telecommunications network. It will transform the industry and ensure that we achieve fast and efficient broadband for nearly the entire continent. It is something that others only dream of but we will achieve. We will reshape the industry through this. People cannot wait for access to this transformational technology. I have seen the enthusiasm first hand. I notice one of my colleagues is on the other side of the chamber whom I worked with on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications. We visited various parts of the country and were able to see with our own eyes the excitement in the regions about the prospect of tapping into a new superfast broadband network and what it will do. For example, they will be able to retain young people in regional areas through better access to educational opportunities. Small businesses will have the chance to tap into new markets which up until this point have escaped them in the regions. We have the chance to deliver a service in parts of the country like the Sydney I represent where people thought they would never have access to such a system because, frankly, the market did not value investing in a network in the area based on their incomes. I think that is a disgraceful reflection of where we are at, and I will reflect on this stalemate later. I take great exception to some of the quoting of ABS statistics earlier by the member for Wentworth. It was quite misleading and I want to address that as it impacts on the electorate I am proud to represent. People in the electorate of Chifley are eagerly awaiting the National Broadband Network not just for its speed, not just for what they will be able to download but for what they will be able to do. Just the other day I had the pleasure of visiting the Blacktown Computer Pals group, which is teaching senior Australians how to access computers in a way that they have never had the opportunity to do before. Wendy Lambert and all the volunteers that operate Blacktown Computer Pals do tremendous work in showing senior Australians the opportunities presented by this technology. The other day we were talking about some of the applications that will open as a result of access to the National Broadband Network and one that particularly caught them was the prospect of e-health so they will not be stuck waiting for specialists or GP support. They will get fast and easier access to medical assistance. They will be looked after in their older years. They know some of the applications and they cannot wait for this. This bill is critical in ensuring that, as we connect up to 6,000 homes a day, the greenfield areas of Australia will be looked after just as efficiently as the brownfield areas. The bill will ensure that there is an optic fibre requirement, a fibre-ready facility requirement, a fibre-ready installation requirement and a facilities access regime. area of The bill was examined by the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the chair of the committee and the deputy chair-you, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath-for the work that ensured that this bill will be considered in a timely way. A lot of the states will depend on this bill going through the House and through the other place to ensure there is a mechanism to connect greenfield estates quickly. Having worked for an electricity distributor and having been a union official in the telecommunications industry, a lot of what has been considered by this bill is simplywithout bursting anyone's balloonunremarkable. Frankly, a lot of utilities have been working for many years with the developers to rollout networks-electricity, gas or telecommunications-in new estates. The reason I congratulate the chair and the deputy chair is outlined in the chair's forward to the report that was presented today which states: Where the committee found areas of dispute, these were less about the Bill and more about underlying policy that has led to this Bill. We continually have these arguments, as represented in the chamber today, not about the bill itself but about the way we are going about bringing superfast broadband to this country through the NBN Co. and the reforms that we have put to this House. I believe the report put forward some very sensible and considered recommendations, for example advocating that internal customer protocols be put in place within NBN Co. to ensure that the time frame for issuing statements to developers is completed and benchmarked; that NBN Co. commit to specific time frames to publish its performance on fibre rollout-a sensible idea; and that there be an investigation into the possible impact on risk premiums of regular changes in development regulations-again, pretty sensible. However, the coalition have sought, as evidenced today by the member for Wentworth, to engage in spurious claims about this bill. For example, they claim that rolling out the NBN will make it more expensive for homes. No-one who has bought new land and is intending to develop a property on that land would for one minute expect that any of the utilities connected to that property would come for free. They would expect to pay for a gas connection, for water and for electricity. They would expect some cost. That cost has been outlined in the explanatory memorandum-and I will come back to what I believe are the spurious costs being claimed in self-interest by industry. The cost outlined in the explanatory memorandum is about $800, which is in line with what would be expected for the other utilities that would have to be connected. The opposition claim that the processes to be used by NBN Co. will be slow and bureaucratic. But the report has recommended some measures which I hope the the government and the NBN will embrace to ensure that we can have a timely rollout. They claim, for example, that developers might have to wait too long. That was raised by the member for Wentworth earlier. Guess what? Sometimes developers do wait. They roll out aspects of the network, undertake the pit and pipe and wait for the utility to come through. As I said earlier, this is unremarkable. But the claim that is being put forward is that in some way NBN is doing something that hitherto has not been experienced by the sector. That is simply and patently ridiculous. The other claim which was made through the course of the hearings was that NBN or the minister should not set standards. To some extent the member for Bradfield and I, despite the fact that we are on different sides of the chamber, actually agree that there is always a danger that monopolies set standards in a way that excludes competition. The preference would always be that the industry would set them. Who in the industry is responsible for setting these standards? The Communications Alliance, the sector itself. Up to this point, the sector has been unable to come up with standards in relation to the rollout of the network. The problem we have is that in arguing the minister should not set the standard the coalition is assuming that the industry will get its act together and effectively asking government to shoulder the risk if the industry is incapable of reaching agreement within itself. Mind you, NBN Co. is a member of the Communications Alliance. If they are unable to come up with a standard then what standard do we operate to? And when the faults start racking up because the performance of the network is not up to scratch, who will be responsible? Ultimately, the government will be, not the industry that was unable to come up with the standards in the first place. During the course of the hearings, TransACT put forward to us that developers or contractors within the sector who have carriers licences should be enabled to roll the network to the standards that they roll to. I asked TransACT, which is a regional telecommunications provider that operates in the ACT, which standard it would operate to: would TransACT let the subcontractor put it into their own standard or would TransACT require the subcontractor to work to TransACT's standard? The answer from TransACT was simple. It said, 'We want it to our standard.' Yet TransACT argued to the committee that NBN Co. should not be entitled to operate to the standard it sees in the absence of the industry standard. It says that TransACT should be entitled to operate to its own standard-something it would not allow for its own network. When we are trying to roll out a uniform network with standards whereby everyone can expect the network to perform in the same way we cannot have what I would argue-with no disrespect to TransACT, I will put it in very crude terms-is a self-interested position when it comes to the network. The member for Wentworth wants things to be done in a timely way but he has flagged some unbelievable suggestions. For example, an article entitled 'Turnbull tests NBN Copays amendment for greenfields', which appeared on the iTnews website, talks about the fact that the member for Wentworth was arguing that NBN Co. basically would have to negotiate with each developer, as they roll out in their own estate, how much they would pay for the assumption of the network. On the one hand he wants the network to be built quickly and says that we should not force delay on developers, yet on the other hand he would force on us a delay in the negotiation process with developers one-on-one. I also could not believe the claim the Housing Industry Association was making that it might cost up to $5,000 per premise to roll out the NBN on a greenfield site. When out we quizzed them on that, they said that they out were earlier estimates but then came back later and said, 'We've tested those out and that is what we believe to be the case.' But there was no evidence of what that was supposed to be. Frankly, we need to get the NBN rolling out as quickly as possible to reach the target of 6,000 homes a day. In the time remaining I will address the spurious claim made by the member for Wentworth that he put amendments to the committee. That is a falsehood. He put fit forward, for example-and I am willing to table this-an incomplete amendment that had different sections. I will read directly: Notice must be given to NBN Co. of the requirement … (some time before expected completion of the network? Within some time after completion?) He put half-baked amendments that were not even complete to the committee dealing with the rollout of one of the most important pieces of infrastructure in the country. He could not even get that done yet suggests that he did. He talks about a cost-benefit analysis and comes back to it. I am going to give you a cost-benefit analysis that was carried out at the 2007 election: people basically looked at the 19 plans you guys could not get through; they liked our plan. The cost-benefit analysis was done in 2010: people did not like what you were putting forward; they liked what we were putting forward. The crossbenchers late last year also had a cost-benefit analysis. They liked our plan; they did not like yours. It is about time you stopped trying to stop the rollout of a network that is critical to the country. (Time expired)",121
187,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the member seeking to table a document?,125
188,Mr HUSIC,BILLS,"I seek leave to table the coalition's appendix C, the text of the amendment to the fibre deployment bill that was put forward by the opposition. Leave granted.",125
189,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," I am pleased to speak on Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, which is part of the overall policy architecture underlying the National Broadband Network and its specific objective is to ensure that new developments receive a fibre connection rather than a copper connection. In the broad, this is a sensible objective. But typical of the way the Rudd-Gillard government approaches virtually every policy issue, including those in the telecommunications sector, they have done an absolutely hopeless job of seeking to implement this objective because they have come up with a mechanism which is heavy handed, intrusive, damaging to competition, bureaucratic and unnecessarily expensive. They have done this through key provisions in this bill, which, amongst other things, specifically mandate that property developers must meet certain requirements to install so-called fibre-ready infrastructure and also give the minister the power to impose technical standards, upsetting the longestablished arrangements in the industry in which technical standards are set by agreement through the industry representative body, the Communications Alliance. In the brief time available to me I want to make three central points. Firstly, it does make sense, if your objective is to improve Australia's broadband infrastructure-an objective shared by all of us on all sides of this House-to focus your policy attention on new developments. The second point I want to make is that the particular method which this government has chosen to focus on this area is unfortunate in terms of its consequences for housing policy because it makes the process of building new housing developments slower and more complex than it otherwise needs to be. Thirdly, I want to make the point that these measures are very bad in terms of their consequences for the competition in telecommunications-consistent with every other aspect of telecommunications policy which this government has touched. Let me turn firstly to the central point that it does make sense to focus on new developments. It is uncontentious between the major political parties and it is uncontentious amongst all who have looked into this issue that the marginal cost of installing a fibre connection over a copper connection is much lower in greenfields sites in new developments than it is in existing homes and buildings. It costs a lot more to go back and retrofit existing homes and buildings, ones which currently have a copper connection, with a fibre connection than the incremental cost of fibre over copper in new developments. It therefore makes sense, as we have been happy to acknowledge in a dissenting report, to encourage the building of fibre connections in new developments. It is a sensible thing to do. Indeed, housing stock in Australia increases by around one per cent each year, so simply by encouraging fibre in new developments you begin to achieve a gradual and steady increase in the percentage of homes which are connected to fibre. Indeed, even Telstra-not known to be a friend of competition-acknowledged, in its submission to the inquiry conducted by the Joint Select Committee on the National Broadband Network, that there is a growing competitive market for the delivery of fibre networks in new developments. They remarked as follows: Traditionally as the USO provider we have been deploying copper based infrastructure at the request of developers. More recently a competitive fibre deployment industry had and a number of providers, including Telstra, deployed fibre in many new developments under contract to the developer. In other words, what we have is the market responding to demand and increasingly installing fibre infrastructure in new developments around Australia without the intervention or assistance of government. The Gillard government would no doubt find this an extraordinary proposition, but the market is, in fact, efficiently responding to demand and fibre is already being built in a material number of new developments around Australia. And what has been the response of the Gillard government? As usual they have rushed into clamp the dead hand of government upon this nascent market. Their central planning instincts have been spurred by these developments and their policy settings choke off the market response, as I will come to in more detail in a moment. Let me turn to make the second point I want to make. This bill is a bad idea when it comes to the question of housing policy. We all know that there is a looming housing shortage in Australia, and the last thing that we ought to be doing is imposing new complex bureaucratic requirements upon property developers. Unfortunately, that is precisely what the arrangements mandated by this bill do. They add expense and delay for those wishing to build new housing estates. Notwithstanding the government's rhetoric, in practical terms this bill gives developers a very strong financial disincentive to deal with operators other than NBN Co. In turn, this leaves developers at the mercy of NBN Co.'s responsiveness and timeliness. NBN Co. will become a bottleneck through which all property developments must pass before they can be completed and brought to market. I confidently predict that the downstream arisen consequences for Australians wishing to purchase new housing are likely to include increased delay and expense. Let me note the comments of the Housing Industry Association when they appeared before the committee's inquiry: The legislation needs to make it very clear who is responsible for the delivery and that there are certain obligations on the provider to do that in a very timely way, otherwise it will delay development. The Housing Industry Association went on to say: It should not take more than a couple of phone calls and a meeting to sort out it being put into the critical path of the development, otherwise those projects will be delayed whilst certain things are waiting for a provider to provide that infrastructure. Unfortunately, the complex arrangements in this bill do not give the certainty that the Housing Industry Association is seeking. The unfortunate consequence is that there is likely to be a bottleneck as projects queue up to get the tick from the National Broadband Network Co. Thirdly, let me turn to the most substantive point I want to make, which is that the approach in this bill is a very poor approach when it comes to the question of competition policy in telecommunications. The practical effect of this bill is to minimise competition and choice as to who will build fibre networks in greenfields locations in new developments. As a consequence, this bill represents a missed opportunity to impose effective, competitive and cost discipline on the National Broadband Network Co. If there is one thing we have seen in spades to date, it is that the National Broadband Network Co. certainly requires a healthy dose of competitive pressure. If it were the case that developers had a viable option to use a party other than NBN Co. to build out fibre networks in their developments, then developers would be likely to choose parties other than NBN Co. if those parties were able to build a network for them more cheaply, more quickly and more conveniently. That, in turn, would produce a more efficient outcome if it meant that infrastructure in new developments were built at a lower cost than if all fibre in new developments were installed by NBN Co. under a monopoly. It would also have the incidental and not trivial benefit of getting live and operational fibre networks into new developments as they were being built rather than developers and, in turn, the people who will live in those developments, being forced to wait until a connection can be made at a time of NBN Co.'s convenience. Let me remind you, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath, that NBN Co.'s stated build time frame goes out to 2020. They are already months behind their plans. So, under the model chosen by this government in which all paths run to NBN Co. unfortunately many Australians are going to be waiting a very long time to get a fibre connection, and it is richly ironic that there is already in place a private sector market which is successfully delivering fibre connections in new developments. Yet, this government's policy approach is to specifically impede, slow down and put hurdles in the way of the operation of that private market. The consequence is that many Australians moving into new developments will be waiting longer to get fibre connections than they would be if this meddling government had left the matter alone. Despite the empty commitments and despite the vapid rhetoric from the minister for broadband who claimed, 'Developers will be able to source fibre from competing fibre providers if they wish', the economic reality is that he and his government have set up arrangements under which developers are given a very strong financial incentive to deal with NBN Co. and a very strong financial disincentive to deal with anybody else. According to the explanatory memorandum, installing the fibre-ready infrastructure, which is mandated by this legislation, costs around $800. There was also evidence provided to the committee that the full cost of installing a fibre connection is $1,500. Put these two numbers together and what you see is that the developer is up for an additional incremental cost of at least $700 per lot if the developer chooses to contract with a competitor to NBN Co. rather than, as the government wants it to do, just leave it and wait until NBN Co. comes along. Unfortunately those who will suffer will be Australians moving into new premises who would have expected, had the private sector market continued to operate, to have received a fibre connection. They will now be waiting a very long time in many cases, given the very long period over which NBN Co.'s operations are scheduled to occur. Fundamentally the regime established by this bill is damaging to competition in the market for the provision of new fibre infrastructure and there are three reasons for that. Firstly, it exposes existing non-NBN operators, who are already in the marketplace providing fibre connections in new developments, to competition from a government funded competitor with enormously deep pockets, which is prepared to install fibre at zero cost to any developer which has incurred the expense of building trenches and other fibre-ready facilities. In effect that makes it impossible for those competitors of NBN to continue to operate competitively with it. Secondly, this bill is damaging to competition because the standards as to what constitutes a 'fibre-ready facility'-for example, a pit to be built in a new development-will in practical terms be set by the National Broadband Network Co. For example, proposed section 372W of the bill says that a fibre-ready facility is one which amongst other things satisfies such conditions as are specified by the minister. It is clear from the statement of expectations issued by the government last year that NBN Co. will be in the driver's seat in determining what the minister specifies because it says: The Government expects NBN Co to provide guidance on technical specifications as early as possible. The statement of expectations also says that NBN Co. would consult with the Communications Alliance. But let us be absolutely clear and lay to rest this misleading claim being made by government members today that, in some way, the existing industry process will continue. That is absolutely not the case. Under the existing process the Communications Alliance makes the decisions. Under the new process NBN Co. will make the decisions and the Communications Alliance will be required to rubber stamp them. There is plenty of experience as to the damage to competition that occurs when the dominant player is able to set technical standards. It was for that precise reason that, in 1989, the power to set technical standards was transferred from Telecom Australia to an independent body. This government in this bill, as in so many other ways, is going backwards in a very bad way when it comes to competition. Thirdly, this bill is very damaging to competition in the market for the provision of fibre because it fundamentally undermines business models used by greenfield fibre operators today. This bill needs profound amendment if it is not to seriously damage competition, and I commend to you the amendments that the coalition has moved.",125
190,Ms ONEILL,BILLS," I rise to speak in support of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. In reflecting on the comments of the member for Bradfield, one would think that competition is at the heart of this bill and the sole and only interest he has in the debate. The reality is that we are dealing with a very practical, real-life matter that will impact profoundly on the lives of Australians, and I am very pleased to support the bill put to the House. This bill puts into legislation an election commitment to make sure that all new developments, subject to exceptions, are fibre friendly. That means that new residential developments will be able to connect to a fibre-to-the-premises network without the need for further work being done to the premises. At its heart, this is an equity issue. The bill applies to developments conducted by corporations, which includes the vast majority of development and construction companies nationally. The bill certainly has application on the Central Coast, the region that I represent, and it has the capacity to significantly enhance employment and life outcomes for people living in new dwellings on the Central Coast. Given that the National Broadband Network is a Commonwealth project designed to benefit the national economy, it is very desirable that this legislation be enforced under Commonwealth law. As with many other members of the House, the National Broadband Network has been a priority issue in my electorate and much of my work as a local member in this term of parliament has been to ensure that the potential of the NBN is effectively understood. I have been working very hard with local health, education and other business sector partners to help to bring about the earliest possible rollout in my electorate. I have been meeting with key stakeholders on the NBN on a regular basis and have been campaigning for a priority rollout on the Central Coast. Key people driving this initiative in my area include Dave Abrahams, an IT specialist, who has become quite a champion of the NBN, Edgar Adams, a local business advocate and representative, and even Paul Budde, who consults internationally on the NBN. Each of these men and other leaders in our community see that connecting the NBN to all premises, both new and established premises, is a critical part of ensuring that all Australians are able to move forward together as this technology becomes available. The National Broadband Network certainly arouses great interest in my electorate and it is seen by many local business owners and community leaders as a critical means by which to level the playing field between those living in regions such as mine and those living in the cities, represented by the member for Bradfield, and to come to some equitable arrangement in terms of access to the world economy. The Central Coast is a region with unique challenges. It is a growing area, a place where small business is vital for the health the local economy and where new developments are coming online. On the Central Coast, small businesses provide services and employment for the people in our region. I am very proud of our local businesses and I am particularly proud of local IT companies that compete nationally and internationally to provide services. Many of these small and medium sized businesses operate from the Central Coast and provide local employment and opportunities for our residents. I certainly will support anything in this parliament that enables better participation and more local employment, and I herald the excellence of our local staff in engaging in this growing field. In terms of the personal and business assets that we have on the Central Coast, I believe that the National Broadband Network will help us to develop and extend already successful businesses to further improve their success and, because of that, I support this bill which will enable a more effective rollout of the NBN in the region. In ensuring that development corporations install the carrying infrastructure of the NBN, the general rollout of infrastructure will certainly be more efficient and effective. The bill will also ensure that, after the National Broadband Network has been rolled out, all new developments fulfil their responsibilities as to future applications of the internet in the delivery of health and education to homes through the installation of fibre-friendly infrastructure. It is also vital that we are prepared for the reality that new businesses and new business models are yet to be born and that their infancy may be in small businesses, not in boardrooms with desks and those sorts of facilities, but in small home offices or in the new mobile world of local cafes in which entrepreneurs are increasingly doing business in open-to-view social settings. This is of common-sense legislation. It is a move to equity because it will ensure that new residential premises, where new businesses may well be emerging, are able to take complete advantage of the NBN. The bill will also enable the cost of the NBN to be reduced in new residential developments because there will be access to non-carrier ductwork in those developments. This bill represents an initiative to the National Broadband Network in an efficient and effective way. No-one can deny that rolling out the NBN is a challenge in terms of infrastructure. But nation building infrastructure is always challenging; it is both visionary and practically challenging. It is always a challenge for any government to provide critical new infrastructure. We have only to look back at the challenges faced by governments that undertook commitments to roll out the railways across this great country of ours, the national road network to connect us across all of those miles and the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. All those critical pieces of infrastructure involved having a vision for the future and a commitment to ensuring that the practical work was undertaken to enable them to come into being. Infrastructure as comprehensive as the National Broadband Network is certainly ambitious, but it is also very responsible. ambitious in that it calls on our generation at this time to invest in the capacities of the next generation and to make the NBN a critically productive part of our economy. It is responsible because we know that, without access to this internationally empowering technology, we would be making a decision to exclude our people from participation in the global digital economy and workplace. I often hear from, and read reports about, people from the conservative side of politics who assert, with misunderstanding, that this vital piece of infrastructure is not needed. But I am delighted to be part of this government, which has decided to undertake the challenge and commit itself to ensuring that the project is completed. I do hear from the other side of politics that we should not be bothered with this and that it will be a blow to competition. But competition will not support people in homes yet to be built if we do not support this legislation and put it roll out in place to the advantage of new home dwellers. The NBN is certainly not just about upload capacity. It is far more sophisticated than that. It does a lot more than enable fast downloads of movies. It has the capacity to transform our economy and also to have a profound impact on social benefits for our community. In terms of its social impact, one of the critical things that we have seen just in the last couple of days is the capacity for medical appointments to be teleconferenced across large distances. Currently this can happen in established premises but this bill will address the reality of yet-to-be-built premises also having the capacity to delivery health services, and that needs to be considered in the development of this bill. The national economy as a whole benefits from the economic growth and health of the nation's regional areas. The economic potential of an area such as mine needs to be realised, and this can only be done that if we It is are able to engage with the global market. Another social benefit of the National Broadband Network is obviously education. In my area we have the benefit of quality public and private schooling. Our children certainly benefit from access to these quality schools. When they return home to their new houses in new developments they need to be able to access the internet. We need to get on with this job in a way that is equitable. University students on the Central Coast are also critically impacted by decisions made in this place about the rollout of the NBN. Currently students can access materials online and correspond with other students online, but they also need to be able to do this from the sites at their homes, in the new developments, and critically that is what this bill is dealing with. High-speed broadband based on fibreoptic technology will be vital in enabling the development of a great future for Australia. It will provide regional schools with resources; it will provide regional communities with access to health. This is a nation building initiative. It is going to have far-reaching consequences on which this parliament can look back with pride. This bill enshrines the powers invested in the Australian Communications and Media Authority to develop standards in relation to third-party use of the network. The long-term success of the National Broadband Network is absolutely reliant on the successful elation between owners of the infrastructure and the providers. The powers that have been invested in the ACMA and the ACCC will ensure that there is appropriate regulation and competition in the provision of these services from the National Broadband Network. I support this bill because it demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring a vital piece of infrastructure for Australia's future is completed and a success for all Australians. This goes exactly to a comment made by the member for New England: 'You do it once, you do it right and you do it with fibre'. I look forward to the day when the National Broadband Network has been constructed and our economy and society is advancing as a result, be it in new or established housing. I know that day will arrive, and I believe when it does my constituents will benefit enormously. I commend this bill to the House. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (17:10): Noone disputes the benefits of a national broadband network. The coalition support high-speed broadband but what we do not support is the outdated monopoly telco model being run by the incompetence of NBN Co. The member for Robertson said that this will impact profoundly on the lives of Australians, and indeed it will because for generations we will be paying off the billions of wasted dollars spent on the NBN and the NBN Co. For far too many years Australian consumers and businesses have suffered from over-priced telecommunications. I look back to over 30 years ago, indeed last century, when a subcommittee of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce decided they had to do something about the monopoly of Telecom Australia, as it was known then, interrand from that ATUG was born-the Australian Telecommunications Users Group. For many years, we saw ATUG and other industry bodies struggle to bring competition into the market, struggle to bring in some competition for products, service and pricing. Finally, just as we were achieving competition, we were handed back a last century model, a last century way of doing business-NBN Co. a monopoly. This is not the way forward and this is not the way other countries around the world are rolling out their telecommunications. The amendment proposed by the member for Wentworth and the coalition is about greenfields sites. We already have an example in Townsville, in the seat of Herbert, where a developer is desperate to sign off on his new development but he cannot get anyone to lay the fibre in the conduits, which he has already provided. This is because NBN Co. have told him that it is not ready yet, but when it is ready it will roll over the top of what he has already done. So, once again, we have the bully-boy tactics of some of the people at NBN Co. They are threatening very good opportunities in greenfields sites and, furthermore, some of our redeveloped brownfields sites in Brisbane. Some years ago, the local government in South-East Queensland wrote to the federal minister seeking assistance in this area, and of course, as usual, the response was silence and it was deafening-absolutely no response let alone assistance. The local government wanted to get on with the job and do it then. But many of those areas will be left until 2020 before they can get competent communication facilities. When we look at the greenfields sites we see the need for and the benefit from some of the smaller companies providing those facilities. We heard before about some of the innovation that could come from it. A trial was conducted in your area, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath, in Virginia in Brisbane. Fibre optic cable was rolled out from Virginia to Chermside at less than a third of the cost projected by NBN Co. We have seen NBN Co. sack the messenger, as in two of its officers, because they came up with a fibre rollout above their projected cost. Yet we had an example, which we offered to them to look at, of where we had done it for less than a third of their projected costs. I support the opportunity of private companies rolling out fibre. I think it will be a benefit. I think might see some different methods of doing it. It is very disappointing that NBN Co. have chosen to ignore some of the other models around the world, like Bournemouth, where this rollout has already occurred efficiently and effectively. There are opportunities there. There are lessons to be learned but NBN Co. have the protection of the Gillard government and are not interested in doing anything cost effectively or efficiently because they do not have to worry about that and because they know the poor taxpayers will have their hands in their pockets to pay for the rollout cost. There is no doubt that the rollout of NBN will be of benefit, but the problem we have is the way it is being done and the cost. I look at facilities such as a new industrial estate near the airport in Brisbane where we already have high-quality, high-standard fibre throughout the development. Yet NBN Co. have told them that they will roll over the top of it. It will not necessarily be with anything better-possibly with something inferior-but they are so determined to protect the monopoly to keep out other people that they are prepared to roll over and waste money on a product that is already in the ground and already operating. That is the mentality we are trying to deal with in this bill. That is why the member for Wentworth has proposed some very reasonable amendments to facilitate assistance on some of these greenfield sites and new estates. They are not just in Herbert. They are in the western suburbs of Brisbane. They are areas where, if we were more relaxed about competition, we could benefit already and people could have it before the 2020 date. The member for Wentworth mentioned South Korea, where fibre goes to the we basement of the building. There are other methods as well. He mentioned copper. They have also have satellite and wireless. They do the extra mile waiting for the take-up so they can look at benefits going forward. We do not have to roll out the tens of billions of dollars solution that has been proposed. It is a bit like giving all the roads to Ford and letting Ford control the model of the cars that go on them. That is the restriction we are putting on our consumers and on the industry. Once again we are consigning Australia back to the last century for communications, for overpricing. Once again we see that the Gillard government is all about grand plans, but always with other people's money. There is opportunity here for private enterprise to be involved but, no, we have to get the NBN Co. privatised, a monopoly that only they control. The only conclusion we can draw from the continual refusal to refer this for a cost-benefit analysis is that there is something more to hide because I cannot understand why you would not benefit from having a cost-benefit analysis, from seeing where we can save money, from seeing where we can partner with private enterprise and providing open access. The world declared the music industry would fall over when Napster was introduced because there would be open access. Anyone could put up whatever they wanted. Yet we have seen it flourish and benefit from open access. I believe an open access, synchronous, ubiquitous NBN would be of benefit to all Australians. We need to work with private enterprise, not against them. We will get a better deal for taxpayers, a better deal for the users of communications and, hopefully, a better deal for Australia. I commend the amendments put forward by the coalition and I really hope for a better outcome. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (17:18): It is a great pleasure to witness the rollout of a historic nation-building infrastructure project like the National Broadband Network. It is a great privilege to be part of the Labor government that has the vision and courage to embark on a major reform and a major project such as this. It is a great privilege to support a major structural reform to Australia's telecommunications industry that simply would not have been brought about had we not embarked upon this project, a reform that is going to benefit consumers for decades to come. The NBN will enable the Australian economy to grow, to transform and to adapt into the economy of the future, thereby securing our prosperity. The NBN will provide Australia with world-class broadband technology. It will open up a genuine choice of services and drive competitive prices for consumers, whether they live in capital cities or in regional Australia or in rural and remote areas. In supporting this project and speaking on this Telecommunication Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, which is an important part of the package of legislation to roll out the NBN, it is an absolute pleasure to stare down the naysayers on the other side who have had nothing but carping negativity and criticism on this project from the very get-go. I will go through some of the carping criticism that we have experienced on this project to show where the nay-sayers have been proved wrong even at this very early stage in the delivery of the project. They know that they are wrong. The shadow minister knows it, the member for Bradfield knows it, and everyone opposite who represents regional Australia in this place knows it because they would have received the phone calls, letters, emails and questions from constituents saying: 'I have heard about this NBN. When is it coming past our suburb? When is it coming into my house?' It is disappointing that the member for Gilmore, which adjoins my electorate of Throsby in the Illawarra and has been chosen as one of the pilot sites, instead of championing this as a local representative, is out there day in, day out bagging it and showing her lack of understanding and support for what it means for the local region. It is not so for all the political representatives in the Kiama and broader South Coast area. There are many political representatives who are great champions of this project. It is a good news story for our region and for the people on the South Coast and in the Illawarra. I simply cannot understand why the nay-sayers spend so much time and energy talking it down. The NBN will be a boon to electorates in regional areas like the Illawarra and the South Coast because it will quite simply bring economic, social and community infrastructure right into people's homes, thereby connecting them to the markets and to the entertainment not only of the capital cities but also the world. As an MP for a region that adjoins one of the pilot sites, a privilege to join with local organisations like Regional Development Australia Illawarra and the Kiama Municipal Council in imagining a broadband future for the region. Only recently new funding was announced to help local councils, including the Kiama Municipal Council, take full advantage of the National Broadband Network through the development and upgrade of innovative online service delivery to homes and businesses. Under the Digital Local Government program, which the minister announced a few weeks ago, the Kiama Municipal Council will receive in excess of $370,000 to develop digital solutions that can then be adapted by other councils and rolled out across the country as the NBN rolls out. I know from my conversations with the mayor, Sandra MCCarthy, and other councillors on that council that they are very pleased to be involved in such an exciting and innovative project. It is also a great privilege to play a small part in the facilitation of this project by speaking on and voting in favour of the legislation that marks each step of the steady progress towards providing fast, efficient and affordable telecommunications services for the Australian population and in particular regions like my own where there are still suburbs where people are unable to receive broadband services because of the way that the exchanges are configured, the lack of broadband capability from the local exchanges, the geography of the region and the build-up of many of the new suburbs and the way they were wired up to telecommunications services using mainly RIM based technology. When it comes to matters NBN, I am pleased to speak today in support of this bill, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, which will ensure that no more will we see suburbs it is built up without having access to fast, reliable broadband services because in the process of building up those suburbs we will be digging the pits and laying the pipes and the cable which will ensure that when people move into those new houses they will have the capacity to switch on broadband services from the very get go. That is perhaps something that some of those who live in electorates where they are not building new suburbs may not understand, but I can tell you that in the electorate of Throsby where we have two new suburbs in West Dapto and Albion Park going in it will make an incredible difference to people who move into those homes to know that they will be wired up from the very beginning. So I welcome it. The telecommunications fibre deployment bill amends the 1997 act to do a number of things that affect the provision of utility infrastructure in new real estate developments. The bill requires developers that are constitutional corporations to install fibre ready passive infrastructure. It requires this passive infrastructure in the long term footprint of the NBN project to be fibre ready. Penalties will apply if a constitutional corporation sells or leases land or a building situated in a new development unless fibre ready facilities have been installed, thereby creating the requirement that these facilities are there for the new suburbs when they are built. The bill creates a power that enables the minister to specify new developments in which fixed lines which are installed need to be optical fibre. Finally, this bill enables the Australian Communications and Media Authority to make standards for customer equipment and cabling for use with the NBN and other superfast networks. The outcome of the legislation will be that residents of new developments will have early and less costly access to the NBN network when it is rolled out into these developments. Those on the other side have identified issue of cost in relation to this legislation. Nothing could be more costly when building a new suburb than overlooking the opportunity when the trenches are being dug, the footpaths are being laid and all the other utilities are going into those houses in a new estate and saying, 'We will put electricity, gas and sewerage in there but what we will not do is connect you to the National Broadband Network. We will not be laying fibre optic cable into those suburbs because we have a blind spot when it comes to the National Broadband Network. We will leave it to the market or some other solution to lay cable in those areas.' Nothing could be more wasteful. Nothing could be more costly than saying, 'We will leave it until some other time or not at all.' You can imagine the outrage of local residents having moved into their beautiful new suburb with new footpaths, new gardens and new grass laid down when all of a sudden it is decided to lay fibre optic cable into the suburb and in comes the trenching gear digging up concrete that has just been laid for footpaths or digging up grass that has just been laid or perhaps laying a new layer of overhead cable through these areas. They will all be scratching their heads and asking, 'Why on earth wasn't this done when the street was laid and the power was put in?' If we left it to the wisdom of those opposite, that is exactly what would be occurring. The propositions within this bill are nothing more than militant common sense. Unfortunately it is militant common sense that is not shared by those on the other side of the chamber. I will take the opportunity to talk for a moment about the agreement between NBN Co. and Telstra and Optus, because it is good news for telecommunications customers. Definitive agreements have been executed that, together with Telstra's structural separthe ation undertaking, create a framework for Telstra's participation in the NBN. The NBN Co - Telstra definitive agreements, including an interim access agreement, provide for the re-use of suitable Telstra infrastructure by NBN Co. and for Telstra to progressively structurally separate by decommissioning its copper network and broadband HFC network capability during the NBN fibre rollout and using the NBN to provide fixed line services to customers within the fibre footprint. The definitive agreements translate the financial heads of agreement signed on 20 June 2010 into detailed, legally-binding agreements. The NBN Co. has also negotiated a deal with Optus to migrate its HFC customers to the NBN. So what we have here really puts a huge hole in the argument that was being run by the member for Wentworth and many of those who have rallied to his call. I have to say that the member for Wentworth takes to this argument as a man with not too much enthusiasm. What those opposite have been saying for most of the last nine months is that this NBN is somehow going to be a great big white elephant, that it is going to be a communications service with no customers and that it is something we are overinvesting in because nobody is going to use it. The agreement that has been reached with Telstra and the agreement that is being reached with Optus show what an outrageous untruth that was and how they simply do not understand how this project is going to roll out. As a result of these agreements we are going to see the migration of all of the fixedline customers of Telstra and Optus onto the National Broadband Network. The National Broadband Network will be the backbone. The fibre-optic cable of the National Broadband Network and all those interconnecting networks will be the telecommunications network which is delivering fixed-line telecommunications services to those millions of existing Telstra and Optus customers. Far from being a vacant white elephant, from the very get-go as that migration occurs, those fixed-line customers who are currently having their telecommunications service delivered through the ageing copper network are going to be migrated onto the optical fibre network, the modern NBN, and those services will be delivered. They will be enhanced services. Presumably Optus and Telstra will retain the retail relationship with their customers, but will be the NBN which is delivering the telecommunications service. This is good news. It is good news for the customers of Telstra and Optus but it is also good news for the country because it shows that there is a way forward, after in excess of 12 years, when literally nothing was happening in terms of reforming the telecommunications regulatory system in this country, reforming the telecommunications market and investing in a fast, reliable, high-speed broadband network. Nothing was happening, particularly in electorates like mine. This legislation, together with the other reforms that have already been introduced, is seeing real reforms being rolled out to real people in real houses in real suburbs. The caravan is moving on and the dogs are barking. We know that there is a need and a hunger for it. According to the OECD statistics regarding average broadband subscription prices, out of 33 countries Australia is the third most expensive country for very low-speed connections, the 14th most expensive for high-speed connections and the 12th most expensive for very high-speed connections. As a result of this legislation, together with the other package of reforms and the investment that is going on today in laying that cable and connecting those houses, we are reforming not only the technology but the telecommunications market. There will be more players in the market and the net result of this is going to be faster, more reliable, more ubiquitous broadband services for the people of Australia and for my electorate of Throsby, and that has to be a good thing. I commend the bill to the House.",128
191,Mr TEHAN,BILLS," I rise this evening to talk about the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill, which once again demonstrates this government's ability to take an area of policy, an area of the economy, it which is functioning and working well and to potentially turn it into a mess. The greenfields sector for the provision of fibreoptic services was an area which was working relatively well, and now we have a government which, unfortunately, is legislating to make a mess of this area and, it would seem, to entrench monopolistic practice, which I do not think it can be argued is in anyone's interests. We have had already a dissenting report from coalition members of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, which examined the bill. Coalition members have called for three amendments for three main reasons, three very valid reasons. Firstly, the regime established by the bill is unnecessarily slow and bureaucratic for property developers, so rather than speeding things up and creating less red tape this bill is going to have the potential to do the opposite. How we can come into this place and argue that we want to see optic fibre rolled out more slowly in greenfields sites and for there to be greater bureaucracy in the way it is rolled out beggars belief, but that seems to be what the government is proposing here. The second reason that coalition members believe that the bill needs to be amended is that, as presently drafted, it represents a missed opportunity to take advantage of the existence of the competitive greenfields operators to impose effective competitive and cost discipline on NBN Co. It is especially worth highlighting the phrase 'to impose effective competitive and cost discipline on NBN Co.' I think we would all argue that we need to see that when it comes to NBN Co., because if we do not we are going to see the creation of one of the greatest white elephants this country has ever seen. In an area in particular where the market seemed to be working quite well, we now look like we are going to have a bill which will impose more uncompetitiveness and less cost discipline on the behemoth which this government is setting up in this area, NBN Co. The third reason that the coalition members believe the bill should be amended is that the regime established by the bill is damaging to competition in the market for the provision of new fibre infrastructure. So, rather than driving further competition into the sector, it is actually going to opposite. They are the three key reasons the coalition has problems with the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill. I will explain in a little more detail what these problems are and then raise another issue which is directly relevant-the rolling out of broadband to greenfield sites where we will not be able to provide optic fibre. That was being done under the Australian Broadband Guarantee program, which was meant to run for an additional 12 months. Sadly, the government, although it said on its website that it was to run for another year, has pulled the pin on it. We now have to rely on NBN Co. using satellite to provide services in this area. That has caused sovereign risk damage to those wireless providers that were operating under the Australian Broadband Guarantee-something which we have seen occur all too often with this government. It also means that consumers in areas where we will not see fibre to the premise are going to suffer because they are going to get delayed and inadequate services provided by satellite. I will touch on that in a bit more detail as well. The NBN estimates that 1.9 million greenfield households will have to be connected to the NBN by 2020 and 250,000 households will have to be connected by June 2013. You would hope that what we get is less red tape and more competition to make sure that this occurs. The NBN has allocated more than $100 million to connect greenfield households. Once again, we do not see any detailed costings or analysis on how the NBN will allocate its money. It is just that we have a figure of more than $100 million to connect greenfield households within the first year of operation. In the first five months of 2011, NBN Co. received more than 1,480 applications from greenfield developers, representing approximately do the 133,000 premises to be connected across Australia. So there is demand for these premises to be connected. The problem is that the marginal cost of installing fibre in new housing developments is low compared to the benefits. The government's policy paper on greenfields estimated that the cost of rolling out a fibre-to-the-premise connection is approximately $2,500, which is about $1,500 greater than the cost per premise of a broadband capable copper based connection. However, the increased cost will not always be paid upfront by homeowners. Traditionally, it has been split by developers and telecommunication providers who recoup costs through offering superior services. Although we on this side support regulation that would ensure fibre to the premise is used in greenfield estates, there are several concerns. Changes to the market structure will ensue from the role of NBN Co. as a provider of last resort. However, NBN Co. has agreed to absorb the cost of rolling out fibre in greenfield sites-costing up to $3,000-which puts them at a competitive advantage to competitors who must come to an arrangement with developers. Again, we have an area of competition where, by setting these rules, we ensure that NBN Co. has the advantage as the behemoth. As the white elephant that it has the to become, it will sadly be able to gouge and make sure that where there is competition it will be lessened. There is also huge worry-and this is why the design of the bill does seem fraught and lacking-that the lack of consultation with industry will result in an eleventh hour decision that the NBN establishes technical standards that will be too onerous for small providers to meet. In a market where we need to encourage smaller providers, this government is sadly going to create a situation where NBN Co., through onerous regulation, will be able to dominate the market. Part of the rationale that the government gave for the NBN is that it would end the dominance of the vertically integrated Telstra. According to the ACMA Communications report 2009-10, Telstra boasts 82 per cent of the fixed line telephone market and 65 per cent of the DSL, which accounts for 82 per cent of fixed line internet antee. connections. The opening up of Telstra exchanges have to an extent diminished Telstra's dominance. The number of unbundled services offered by competing ISPs increased by 23 per cent between June 2009 and June 2010. Telstra's share of the market was reduced from 70 per cent to 65 per cent. However, the greenfield market is incredibly competitive. Of the 909,000 cable and fibre connections in Australia, more than 400,000 have been connected by small operators under the greenfield fibre operators of Australia. The government's own policy document on greenfield estates states: The installation of FTTP is taking place in a competitive context, with developers typically contracting out the provision of infrastructure and services in developments. Why then are we again looking to concentrate commercial power in this market when the government's own documents say that we potential are seeing good competition here? Once again we are seeing a government that seems to want to re-regulate, to create a large player to replace Telstra and, sadly, to impact on the small providers. On that matter, I want to spend some time looking at what is happening with the Australian broadband guarantee, because we are going to see the same thing happen there as well. We have small competitors operating and providing services through wireless, yet the government is bringing forward the end of the Australian broadband guarantee program by 12 months, creating serious sovereign risk to these wireless providers in country areas. They have now decided that that will be replaced by NBN Co., who have now said that they are going to use satellite. It seems that they are not in a position to roll out the satellite services at the speed with which the wireless providers were under the Australian broadband guarThere is also no guarantee that an equivalence of service in terms of speed will be provided. It is commonly acknowledged, especially in country areas, that wireless is a far superior technology to satellite and is far more economical from an installation and maintenance perspective. So I would strongly urge the government to look again at this issue and urge against using satellite to infill or provide a quick fix for wireless areas whilst the NBN wireless network is built. We should see a continuation of the Australian broadband guarantee program, at least for another 12 months, until NBN Co. and the government can get their act together and we can see wireless once again being provided to those regional and rural areas which will otherwise suffer while this 12month or potentially twoto three-year gap in satellite provision is filled by NBN Co. This bill needs a serious examination. It needs to go to the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, which can look into all elements of it. other pieces of policy we have seen from this government, in the end it is going to create more red tape rather than less, especially smaller operators. It seems it is going to drive less competition into this sector rather than more, and this will occur in an area where competition, in the government's own words, has been working extremely well. It is also a shame that what we are going to see, through red tape and costs, is probably that NBN Co. will in the end be the major provider of services in this area and, sadly, will push competition out of this sector. will be damaging to telecommunications providers and the industry. I call on the government to really think seriously about going back to the drawing board with this piece of legislation, going back to industry, making sure that they consult properly with industry and making sure that we get a piece of legislation which will actually lessen red tape and continue to see strong competition in an area where it already exists.",136
192,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," I would like to begin by telling a story that comes from one of the many mobile offices that I enjoy running through my electorate of Fraser. I was standing one morning at the Kippax shopping centre and a woman came up to me and said: 'There are two issues I want to talk to you about. The first one is that I am retired, I am now in my 80s and I'm concerned about the local bus network.' So we talked for a while about the local bus network, where the stops were located and how that worked for her. Then she said, 'The second issue that concerns me is superfast broadband.' She said: 'I like to communicate with my daughter using Skype, and the picture is really patchy at the moment. You keep on talking about this superfast broadband thing, but when are we going to get it? When am I going to get a video connection that allows me to connect with Sadly, like many my daughter?' What this brought home to me is that those opposite are just so out of touch when for they think that superfast broadband is about tweens playing video games. Superfast broadband is a technology that will fundamentally transform Australian society, and it will do that wherever you are on the age spectrum. That is why there are pensioners in my electorate, there are working age people and there are students who are enthusiastic about superfast broadband. We know some of the ways in which That superfast broadband is going to begin transforming our lives. We know, for example, that it will allow access to medical specialists. If you live in an area which does not have a particular medical specialist and you want the chance to see a podiatrist, say, then you will have the option through superfast broadband to do an online consultation with a specialist. Otherwise, you might have to wait in pain for weeks or months until a specialist comes through your town or you have a chance to travel to a place where they are. But with access to superfast broadband we will be able to use technology to deal with the challenge of distance. With education, of course, superfast broadband is again a transformative technology. I know from the institution where I used to work, the Australian National University, that we initially experimented with what it would be like to have experts do a video seminar. It turned out that the existing technology just was not snappy enough. It really did not feel like you were the room with the presenter. We tried it once with my friend John Quiggin, who is at the bleeding edge of technology. John's presentation was great, but it just did not work for those of us not in the room in the way it would have worked if he had been there. But as the connections get faster, as we get those 100 megabits a second speeds that are promised by some of this technology, we will get to technology where it will feel like you are in the room. That will fundamentally transform the research enterprise. It will change for the better the experience of being in an academic seminar. No longer will we need to rely on seminar speakers being in the same city; we will be able to immediately have a presenter from the best universities, whether they be in Boston or Beijing, brought in by superfast broadband. That will make Australian researchers more productive. Superfast broadband will also transform the employment experience. At the moment, it is a challenge if you are a part-timer working in a team. People sometimes say to me that it is okay having one part-time worker in the team, but if you have two or three it is really hard for the team to get together and have a team meeting once a week. But one can easily imagine a situation under superfast broadband in which it is possible for a member of that team to be brought into the conversation, to join the team meeting, maybe for just half an hour in order to be part of the team, and to improve their promotion opportunities at the workplace. It allows the opportunity for part-time workers to be far more integrated into the workforce than they have been before. It offers the potential for people, rather than burning up time and putting out all those CO2 emissions when they fly to a meeting interstate, to use superfast broadband be part of that meeting, to use that new comin munications infrastructure to have quick conversations with people in other states and to make their small, medium or large business even more productive. I was at a forum in Gungahlin, in the growth heart of my electorate of Fraser. The questions the Gungahlin Community Council asked about NBN Co. were not, 'Why we are having it?' or, as the member for Wannon might have asked, 'Couldn't wireless do the job?' Those questions were not asked. They asked, 'When are we going to get superfast broadband and could we speed up the process?' They are enthusiastic about the opportunities it offers for improving economic growth and the standard of living in Gungahlin. They recognise that we should, as the member for New England once said so pithily: 'Do it once. Do it right. Do it with fibre.' They recognise, as the member for Wannon and many of those opposite do not, that wireless has saturation problems. It is all very well if you are the only person connected to the wireless signal-then the speeds might be alright. But as other people come onto the network, as we get the crowding that happens as more people join the network or the crowding that we get over the day as more people log on at peak times, then the network slows down, becomes congested and ceases to be effective. That is the real challenge of wireless. It is a fundamental technological point. I am always mildly surprised when those opposite seem to be unfamiliar with the simple idea that wireless signals have saturation problems. We on this side of the House are committed to a National Broadband Network which will transform Australia for the better and be a key economic reform which sits alongside the major economic reforms that the government is putting in place. The bill before the House, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, will require developers that are constitutional corporations to install fibre-ready passive infrastructure-infrastructure that makes it possible to quickly install fibre networks. It requires passive infrastructure installed in new developments in the long-term NBN fibre footprint to be fibre ready. This of course is a common-sense reform, one that is important to have in place to ensure that as many Australians as possible are able to get access to the National Broadband Network. The legislation allows carriers to access fibreready passive infrastructure owned by noncarriers and provides for the ACCC to have a role as the default arbitrator. The legislation creates a power for the minister to specify, by legislative instrument, developments in which fixed lines must be optical fibre. Giving the minister that power will be important in ensuring that the fibre network works as well for Australians as it can. It will provide for exemptions from the requirements to install fibre-ready facilities for optical fibre lines, it will provide for ACMA to develop technical standards that will cover interoperability, performance standards, and design features for superfast broadband rollout. This legislation is critical to the government's policy of rolling out the National Broadband Network. It will ensure early and less costly access to fibre based broadband for residents in new developments. New developments, of which I expect to have many in my electorate-Fraser having most of the growth suburbs in the ACT-will experience cheaper superfast broadband. Getting that superfast broadband will be absolutely critical to those new residents feeling that they are part of the fibre network, that they have the benefits of superfast broadband network and that they are part of a community. I have doorknocked some of the outer suburbs of the Fraser electorate. I know that, sometimes when you are door-knocking a growth suburb, you get a sense of frustration from people. Whether it arises from the bus networks, the road networks or the electricity networks, the sense of frustration of those in growth suburbs is keenly felt. This legislation accepts that that is a real issue and it steps up to the plate. Through this legislation we are saying that residents of new developments should get access to superfast broadband and that they deserve access to superfast broadband, with the ehealth, e-education and teleworking benefits that superfast broadband will provide. It will give us reduced costs for the deployment of fibre by access to non-carrier duct work, ensuring that, to the greatest extent possible, we can use existing ducts and pipes rather than having to dig new ducts. There is no point in digging up footpaths that do not need to be dug up. If there are ducts in place, we want to create the opportunities for NBN Co. to use those ducts. Of course, this bill is implementing measures announced almost two years ago. The financial impact is expected to be small and it will be met from NBN implementation funding. In conclusion, I stress that the legislation before the House today is very much of a piece with a set of reforms that the Gillard government is committed to. We are committed to making policy not for the snappy grab on the evening news but for the long game-long-term reform, not simplistic three-word slogans. Those long-term reforms contain things such as compulsory superannuation-superannuation that will provide retirement security for millions of Australians, ensuring that Australians have the security of knowing that they can retire in dignity. We are putting in place a set of education reforms that will transform productivity-reforms such as providing school accountability through the MySchool website, rewarding the best teachers through performance pay, moving to demand driven university funding, and providing trades training. All of these root-and-branch reforms of the education system are about ensuring that in the long run we have an education system that delivers productivity, because we on this side of the House know that long-term growth in living standards comes fundamentally from long-term growth in productivity. That is why we are so committed to these productivity-enhancing reforms such as superfast broadband and education. Climate change is, of course, another area in which we are committed to the long term. We listen to the scientists. We listen to the economists. Of course, when the Leader of the Opposition does not like what he hears from the scientists, he is willing to go out into crowds of sceptics carrying unusual placards. When he does not like what he hears from the economists-and he is, of course, yet to find a single economist who will back his scheme of so-called direct action rather than a market based mechanism and carbon pricing-he says, 'Maybe that reflects on the quality of the Australian economics profession.' My former co-author, Joshua Gans, who won the medal for the best Australian economist under 40 a couple of years ago, put it best on his blog when, in response, he said that, no, that actually reflects on the quality of Australian opposition leaders. Those opposite are opposed to fundamental long-term reform in the area of climate change. They are concerned instead with slogans. We on this side of the House are concerned with the long game, with ensuring that we price carbon and make the steady transition to a low-emissions Australia. We are committed to the highway network of the 21st century-the National Broadband Network-laying down an infrastructure that will be as critical to future generations as the road network and the rail network are to ours, an infrastructure that those opposite will oppose now but, I suspect, will look back upon in their dotage and think: 'How did I do that? How did I find myself on the wrong side of that debate? What was I thinking in saying that Australia should be stuck in the slow lane of the information superhighway?' I commend the bill to the House.",139
193,Mr CIOBO,BILLS," In this debate on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, it is indeed a unique privilege for me to have the opportunity to follow the member for Fraser, for a number of reasons. One is to do with the very first example that the member for Fraser gave of why the 'superfast broadband', to use his words, that the Labor government is rolling out through NBN Co. is going to be such a revolution in this country. He said that it will enable those in remote areas to interact and have a consultation of sorts-a virtual consultation, if you will-with a specialist somewhere else, and that this is going to revolutionise the health industry. Otherwise-and he had to walk a very fine line here-that person could be left waiting for weeks to consult a specialist. I noticed he never referred to the fact that state Labor governments have presided over the at-times abysmal health system in this country, with various public hospitals having extraordinarily long waiting lists. That was conveniently left to one side. Notwithstanding that, he made the point about this revolution that is coming as a result of superfast NBN broadband. He must not have been here in question time. Where were you, Member for Fraser, in question time? Had he been here listening he would have heard the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Prime Minister wax lyrical about the revolution in health. It was a matter of only a couple of days ago that the Prime Minister was in Darwin and the health minister was in Adelaide and they undertook a consultation between a specialist and a patient, one in Adelaide and one in Darwin. There is no NBN, but this happening now. In fact, the government was crowing about it in question time. There is no need for the expenditure of some $53 billion of taxpayers' funds to build the NBN; it is happening today. What an unfortunate choice the member for Fraser made for his very first example of how the NBN is going to change the way Australians will live. I am also a little intrigued, following on from the member for Fraser, about the way in which the Labor Party seems to have taken to its beating bosom the notion that the NBN is going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. We hear it from member after member as they trot out their various speaking points. They have the fever-the new religion-that the NBN is going to be the thing that changes the world. You can almost hear them all saying 'amen' in unison as the various members of the Labor Party stand up. It was fascinating to hear that not just fast broadband, high-speed broadband or a somehow faster form of broadband. What we kept hearing from the member for Fraser, over and over again, were those two words that, almost for dramatic effect, he ran together: 'superfast broadband' he kept saying. I am intrigued. There was an article only a week or so ago that spoke about the opportunity there might be for new technologies to allow data transfer speeds of up to one terabit per second. We have the government talking about superfast broadband at 100 megabits per second. I would love to see the member for Fraser come back into the House, if we do have one-terabit data transfer rates, and talk about 'super-super fast-fast' broadband or some such thing. You can almost sense the excitement. I know I was excited listening to it, but I have to say, the Labor Party is like any good spiv with a silk tie. Unfortunately, the Labor Party is filled with salesmen. It is filled with salesmen rather than people who actually know what they are talking about. We also heard the member for Fraser wax lyrical about saturation problems with wireless technology. A country of 22 million people potentially has saturation problems with wireless technology! I interjected, but I am not sure whether it was picked up by Hansard. I asked, 'What do they do in India and China?' The last time. I checked, the populations of those countries were a little bit bigger than ours. And, the last time. I checked, those countries had full access to mobile telephony and full access to data transfer. I think even Korea and Japan do, as well. So just maybe the argument that wireless technology cannot deliver these same outcomes is a little bit spurious. The reality is that, like everything from the Labor Party, it is a case of 'Sell the sizzle but not the sausage'. This party is the sausage factory it is extraordinaire. This Labor Party is just feeding in the rubbish and hoping that what it can sell is the sizzle. It will get up and speak in debates like this about how it is going to provide superfast broadband, about how it is going to help 80-year-old pensioners or about how it is going to be the glorious revolution of the health industry, despite the fact that their own minister and Prime Minister, at lunchtime and in question time today, highlighted that they are already doing the things that the member for Fraser was saying were only going to possible because of NBN Co. Do you know what else is possible? Not only are his examples redundant, not only will the NBN be potentially redundant",142
194,Mr CIOBO,BILLS,"That's right, potentially redundant-but in my own electorate of Moncrieff on the Gold Coast-Australia's innovation city, as we are officially titledwe have Telstra rolling out 4G wireless technology today. I hope the member for Moreton knows what 4G wireless technology is. ",144
195,Mr CIOBO,BILLS,"I am looking to see if he actually knows what I am talking about, because he is going to speak on this. Telstra is rolling out 4G wireless technology that allows-shock, horror!-100 megabits per second. That is what it is doing now through cellular telephony-100 megabits per second under 4G technology. And do you know what, Mr Deputy Speaker: it is not costing taxpayers a cent. It is not costing taxpayers a single, solitary cent for Telstra to roll out 4G technology with 100 megabits per second. If you listen to the Labor Party, you might think: 'Look, Steve, you're getting a bit excited for no reason. We are going to have NBN. It is going to change the future of the Gold Coast. It is going to change the future of Australia's most service industry oriented city in the country. It is going to change the future of the sixth largest city in the country.' Unfortunately, the Gold Coast is not even slated for NBN rollout for the next six years. It will be six more years before it even thinks about rolling out fibre across the Gold Coast under NBN Co. This is coming from the Labor Party, which expects the Australian public to take it seriously when it gives us this kind of piffle. That is exactly what it is: a gigantic investment in ego. It all commenced with Kevin Rudd, the member for Griffith, when he was the Prime Minister of the country, and it has been continued by the current Prime Minister because it needed to be a matter of policy consistency. Heaven knows the Labor Party needs some policy consistency, and the reason we are now seeing Australian taxpayers being slugged to the tune of $30 billion to $50 billion is so the Labor Party can roll out its revolutionary fibre to the premises, FTTP, NBN. When Labor talks about a revolution, there is a revolution all right. It will be the revolution of the children of today who are going to be encumbered with debt as a consequence of this junk policy from the Australian Labor Party. That is not to say the technology is all rubbish, not for one moment. Perhaps the member for Moreton should listen, because he might be able to understand the difference few.",144
196,Mr CIOBO,BILLS,"Yes-between policy and technology. The reality is that there are benefits that flow from fibre to the node and, indeed, from fibre to the premises. There are benefits that flow. The coalition's problem is not with the technology per se but with the fact that the Australian Labor Party has effectively taken all of our eggs, when it comes to the technology, and put them in one basket. It has delivered a great big monopoly to NBN Co. At a time when the rest of the world has walked away from government publicly owned monopolies, we are embracing it lock, stock and barrel through the Australian Labor Party. You have really got to wonder why it would do it, because in all these highly saturated areas where there is a degree of population density-so every capital city, including centres like mine in the Gold Coast and other major regional towns like Cairns and Townsville-we have the ability for there to be a commercial rollout of this technology, for private providers to be in the space and for this technology to be made available. Nowhere is this more apparent than with respect to greenfield sites, which this bill turns to. Nowhere is there a greater example of direct, private investment in greenfield sites than there is through the fact that there is a very large percentage, often in excess of 50 per cent of greenfield sites, that historically has seen the deployment of so called pits and other fibre technologies through the development of the greenfield site by private operators. This bill actually goes some way towards making sure that that basically does not happen. The reason is that, because of the designation of NBN Co. as a provider of last resort, because NBN Co. will pick up the cost associated with greenfield sites and because NBN Co. will often wear the cost associated with pits, we now have an incentive for developers to simply walk away from these things-although it is legislated-knowing that NBN Co. will be undertaking those activities and doing it at taxpayers' expense. I have no doubt that NBN Co. will be extraordinarily successful, for lack of a term, with respect to greenfield sites. This is because any developer with half a brain will know there is no point in their hiring a private operator to undertake these activities or in their undertaking these activities themselves because taxpayers will subsidise the entire deployment of fibre at their greenfield site, thanks to this bill going through the parliament tonight. That is what the Labor Party is going to deliver them. There is little wonder that I and many Australians are deeply cynical about Labor's policy with respect to NBN Co. There is little wonder that we recognise that this is an investment in ego and not an investment in good policy. Good policy would dictate that there should be a level platform that enables the private sector to compete for those markets where it is commercially feasible to do so. Good policy would dictate that where there is not a commercial case to undertake this investment, that is when the government should step in. But that is not what we have from the Labor Party-that is coalition policy, it is not Labor's policy. Labor's policy is to say, 'It doesn't matter whether it's commercial or not. Taxpayers will underscore the entire project.' For cities like the Gold Coast, where Telstra is already in the process of rolling out wireless technology providing 100 megabits per second, with no cost to taxpayers, and where the Australian Labor Party does not even have a schedule for NBN for six years, the Australian Labor Party says, 'No, you've got it all wrong, Steve. The taxpayers have got it all wrong. The NBN is the way to go because taxpayers will pay for it. It will be in excess of six years but, hey, it will have been worth it.' I am unashamedly opposed to the complete waste of taxpayers' money that is NBN Co. Where it is not commercial for private providers to undertake that activity, better fine-the Labor Party would carry me. But the reality is that in the vast majority of instances, it is commercially feasible, it is already happening, and the highest concentration of private providers in this space-who are about to have their throats slit by the Labor Party because of the passage of this bill-is with respect to the deployment of fibre-ready technologies in greenfield sites. Labor members opposite, who are now sentencing to an economic death a number of employees with those private providers who used to undertake these activities, should know that that has happened because of the passage of this bill. They should know that that is what they are doing. They are making sure that private providers, who have demonstrated usually at least 50 per cent of the time with greenfields sites that they can undertake the job, will now no longer be in a position where it is economic for developers to engage those private providers and instead to have NBN Co. step in. That is the consequence of Labor Party policy and it is yet another example of how Labor has its policy priorities completely screwed up. Furthermore, when you listen to the paltry excuses put forward as to why this needs to happen, when you hear the member for Fraser-one of the golden boys of the Labor Party-giving an example, which has been used by the minister today, which has already taken place, and not something that requires NBN Co., when you see the deployment of technology by 100 per cent private money through Telstra on 4G wireless technology, it is little wonder that I and so many others are so deeply cynical about this government's spendathon when it comes to the absolutely reckless manner in which they are about to expend yet another $30 billion to $50 billion of taxpayers funds building a massive new government monopoly. This is not good policy and the Australian people will certainly not be grateful for the Labor Party undertaking this activity.  thank the member for Moncrieff for his contribution. I was in his electorate last at the National Awards for Excellence in School Music Education at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre, which I think is in his electorate. It was quite a wonderful affair, handing out some awards on behalf of the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Mr Garrett. It is amazing to see how young musicians and music teachers can all link up around the world and take advantage of this emerging technology. I was glad to see that he was accepting of the advances that will come with technology. The legislation before us, the Telecommunications Legislation (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, as you well know Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, is all about a common-sense approach to what goes on in new residential developments. I know there have been many new residential developments on the Gold Coast strip, between my electorate and the Gold Coast-I see them when I drive down there. We are making sure that the nation is fibre-ready, that each of these new developments gets it right in terms of the ducts, the pits and the pipegetting our ducts in a row, I guess-from one development to the next development. This is a good, common-sense economic policy which is what underpins the entire NBN in the first place. It is all about making sure our future productivity is in an interconnected nation-beyond the major urban centres, beyond the Gold Coast and the glittering lights, and into the regions. While the member for Moncrieff can say, 'Yes, on the Gold Coast we are doing okay; we've got 4G', a good government governs for the entire nation. Obviously, there are some problems whenever you get a few people on the 4G system. It goes slower and the technologies of the future will be hamstrung-that is why we need to have night these complementing each other. We need to look beyond the conurbations to the rural and regional areas and look at the opportunities that will come for all of Australia. This is a practical measure that we have before us. Basically, all we are saying is that if any developers who are constitutional corporations-able to be controlled by the government-are building some infrastructure, they make sure it is fibre-ready. It is easier to do the pits and the pipe at the start of the development process rather than retrofitting something to a development, ripping up footpaths and all those sorts of things. These are an inconvenience and part of the burden that comes with an NBN program which is such a visionary scheme. It does make more sense to do it at the onset rather than later on. This allows the carriers to access the fibre-ready passive infrastructure that is owned by the noncarriers and provides for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to have a role as the default arbiter. It applies to new real estate developments because the fibre will be rolled out across the nation to 93 per cent of premises. It is important that we get it right in these new developments. There has been extensive consultation with the development industry about these reforms. It is not something that has been sprung on them; it has been able to be built into the price. As I said, this keeps the cost as low as possible for the ultimate consumer of the National Broadband Network. Rather than just saying, 'Let the market rip', which seemed to be the approach by the member for Moncrieff, this is a common sense approach with the gentle guiding hand of government saying, 'Why don't you do it early on, rather than just wait for the market to decide.' As we all know, with anything it is best to do it upfront rather than retrofitting. Even in a building such as this, which is only 21 or 22 years old, in the last year there have been problems in meeting the technology needs of a modern parliamentarian. Things change quite quickly, so it is best to have the capacity to deal with each new development-they need to be lined up so that the pipes and pits are ready to enable the NBN to be rolled out. This is a very practical response to rolling out the NBN. I saw that the member for Moncrieff was quite overheated. Maybe he was a bit riled because of what we saw two weeks ago, with the NBN Co. representative standing alongside the Telstra and Optus representatives, indicating that this is happening and that this is real. This is the biggest investment in infrastructure since the Snowy Mountains scheme-it is beyond the Snowy Mountains scheme. It is being rolled out now. I understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, that Braddon has benefited greatly from this. The benefits are more than just within the nation. The NBN is able to link the regions, link the cities, link them with the world and create business opportunities overseas. We have seen a lot of signs and symbols lately. When I open my paper or when I watch the news at night, I see the Leader of the Opposition in a hard hat, stalking a manufacturing business-turning up and spreading his big fear campaign about the carbon tax. That is an important symbol, a visual symbol. It seems to be what the media is interested in. I assume there are people out there now stalking the retailers or manufacturers of Queanbeyan and looking for an opportunity to say, 'We need the opposition leader to come along like he does in so many of these places.' I think it was the Ford Motor Company factory in Geelong where he turned up. He does not actually go in and talk to the workers; he just turns up, talks to middle management, puts the hard hat on and then off he goes. We get what he sees as the sign and symbol and then off he goes. It does not matter that the opposition's plan is actually to rip $500 million out of the car industry. He does not want to go in and talk about that; he just wants to run with a bit of a fear campaign. While I am talking about signs and symbols, I note that where the NBN will be very useful is in schools. As a former teacher, I know how much things have moved on. I can remember the internet first coming into the classroom when I was in my last few years of teaching. Now you go to classrooms where the kids in grade 1 and even kids in prep are using computers in a way that is unbelievable. That is why you have to be prepared. Obviously, the NBN will complement our education policy-over $65 billion invested in education. Symbols are important when it comes to education. We have debates in here about education; we had one today. Over the years of the Howard government, we had those wonderful-more than 2,000-flagpoles rolled out throughout Australia. It is important that we give our flags a space; we all know how important a symbol that is. But compare that with the 2,000 libraries that the Labor Party rolled or with the other investments in school halls, language centres, science laboratories-all those things are obviously much more than just symbols. I have been following the broadband shenanigans opposite for quite a while. I know it is hard to get it right because the technology changes so quickly, but I think there were about 20 failed experiments. They kept having problems. I think one of the problems was that one of the rollouts was based on the planning assumption that Australia was as flat as the Netherlands, but then someone pointed out that there were some mountains and valleys and a few things like that in the Australian landscape. Even though we are the flattest continent, we do have some hills, especially in places like Brisbane. I particularly remember when, some 12 or 18 months back, the Leader of the Opposition had an interview with Kerry O'Brien-it might actually have been the last interview he had with Kerry O'Brientalking about the NBN. What was the Leader of the Opposition's major grasp of what the NBN would be used for? For sending emails, I think. I am sure he has moved on a little bit since then and does see the business opportunities, the productivity opportunities and the employment opportunities for rural areas, regional areas and our cities. It would be nice for him to go back to our national broadcaster and engage with people about the NBN. We hear that his instructions to his shadow spokesperson were very simple-to rip up the process, to just say no. It is funny-today I saw the Leader of the Opposition talk about having an $85 million plebiscite because he wants to consult with the people, but he will not talk to our national broadcaster about any topic, it seems. Anyone who has been in this game long out enough knows that the Australian economy faces challenges. We have a high dollar at the moment, so that makes it hard for our manufacturers to compete on the world market. Our labour costs are high compared with those of most of our near neighbours, so it is hard. There are pressures out there; pressures on manufacturing businesses, pressures on lots of sectors of the economy, even labour shortages in certain sectors. However, those opposite are basically suggesting that we go down the low road. Their answer to the question of how to bring those costs down is to attack wages. This is a short-term fix and will not provide any great productivity boost. The smarter way to approach the problem is the high road-to try and boost productivity. Obviously the NBN will provide a massive number of opportunities to boost productivity. As a Queenslander, as someone from the most decentralised state in Australia, it would be ridiculous for me to stand here and say, 'My electorate is in inner-city Brisbane, so I will be all right. The bush can be forgotten.' That seemed to be basically what the member for Moncrieff was saying-let the market rip, and they will be right. The markets are there in the bigger cities, but obviously a good government looks after the country. I am from country Queensland myself, and apart from the NBN no-one is in any great rush to roll out to the country areas. I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition found it hard to consult with the member for New England and the member for Lyne about the advantages that the NBN would bring to them when he did not have an understanding of it. Anyone with a connection to rural areas would understand the benefits that will flow. I note that there was a dissenting report to the report presented by the member for Lyne. This dissenting report is 5,096 words-we could have saved a lot of time and effort if the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull had just said no. It would have been as simple as that. That was obviously going to be the tactic-just say no, do not go into any great detail. The dissenting report was basically 5,096 different ways to say no. Thankfully the committee has taken a bit more time to look over the issue and see the advantages and, as we see the NBN rolled out to the 93 per cent of premises that are preparing to take advantage of this massive piece of infrastructure, I think this dissenting report will be seen in the proper light. The bill basically contains four key measures in proposed part 20A. It enables the minister to specify new developments or classes of new development in which the fixed lines that are installed must be optical fibre lines. So there is the capacity there to take advantage of the local situation. Also, the bill provides that when fixed line facilities are being installed in a development, these facilities must be fibre-ready. That is a common-sense approach-do it up front and it is cheaper. It is a case of a stitch in time will save nine, rather than having all the problems that go with retrofitting and ripping up concrete. Third, the bill will have the effect of basically requiring constitutional corporations to install fibre-ready facilities on or in close proximity to their developments. We do not want to have the rail lines all over again where we have different sizes and they do not match. This is the 21st century and we want to make sure that they all fit together for the benefit of the nation. (Time expired)",144
197,Mr RANDALL,BILLS," I am very pleased to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. The NBN is an issue in my electorate and it is an issue around Australia. The electorate believes this is a very ham-fisted, expensive operation to deliver what could have been delivered by the private sector. Now the government is essentially renationalising communications in Australia. We are going back to the days of the PMG. We are almost in the business of renationalising telecommunications and phones, et cetera. The government wants to control and own everything that we operate now. What brought this about? What made the Labor Party decide to spend somewhere between $30 billion and $50 billion? And why do I use such a wide range of figures? Because the government does do not know how much it will end up costing. It was not that long ago that we heard NBN Co., through its pristine-charactered Mr Quigley, say it could not get anyone to build the network, so it pulled the contracts. Nobody wanted to build it for the cost it was thought it could be built for. Of course there are going to blowouts. The people who saw this build as a cash cow are now suddenly running into a bit of heavy weather. Why are we in the position we are in? Largely because the Labor Party, on taking office, fell out with Telstra. We did not like Sol Trujillo very much-I certainly did not and I said a lot of unkind things about him in this House, which were largely all true-but falling out with somebody does not mean you decide to totally uproot the system you have and then go and borrow a massive amount of money to renationalise telecommunications in this country. President Obama had the same situation confronting him in the last 12 months and, rather than saying it was all too hard and he would get the government to build it, he allowed the private sector to roll out enhancements to the telecommunications system in the United States with a mix of technologies. As previous speakers, including the member for Moncrieff, have said, we have put a lot of eggs in one basket. We have gone with fibre to the premises, which used to be called fibre to the node, and this is the most expensive option that could have been chosen. Our shadow minister, the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, knows something about this. He was one of the early entrants into this technology years ago, when he was a cofounder of an internet company, so his credentials in this area are quite good. He describes this as watching a slow-motion train wreck, and that is what is happening-it is a slow-motion train wreck on the roll-out and implementation of this program. The sad thing is that the future mums and dads of Australia and their children will be paying for this slow-motion train wreck even although it did not need to happen. There could have been a fat controller at the signals to stop this slow-motion train wreck. The controller is not there because both the previous Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the current Prime Minister have just given the Minister for Broadband, Comm– unications and the Digital Economy his head and allowed him to run rampant on this issue. I am in one of those curious electorates that causes problems for this particular rollout. I have high-density urban, outer metropolitan, semi-rural, rural, agricultural, hills, beach sides, small towns under 1,000 people-I have the whole gamut. That is why people in my electorate are very concerned about this issue. In fact, they have called public meetings on this and they have called me to meetings in their own houses to say: 'We are very concerned. What is happening to that Telstra line that goes past my house now? Will I still be connected to that or do I have to sign over?' When it first started people were not sure, but we know now that Telstra has received $11 billion in taxpayers' money from NBN Co. to take over its lines. Of course Telstra and its shareholders are happy because it is an absolute cash cow at the moment, but the good old taxpayers of Australia have forked out $11 billion to take over existing infrastructure. Whether it gets used or whether it is overlaid in certain areas, we do not know. The incredible thing about this is that by having put all their eggs in one basket and given the number of years it will take to rollout, there is a real chance that eventually the technology we are talking about could be redundant by the time it gets to your home. In Piara Waters and Harrisdale in my electorate there is an area that is partly greenfields and partly constructed and Telstra have stopped putting infrastructure into that area. The residents there have asked me, 'I cannot get ready access, so what are you going to do?' With their old copper wire network and RIM technology, Telstra are feeding out a few ports here and there from their exchanges, but they are not committing to any significant build because they are saying to my constituents, 'We're not going to come and build anything new for you because the NBN's coming and we're not going to spend any money on something that is going to be overlaid in the next six, eight or 10 years.' As a result, they say, 'Here's a phone for you.' They give them a second-rate mobile phone to use because of the universal service obligation. It is just a short-term fix. It really is a bizarre situation. The towns that are further out in my electorate and which have fewer than 1,000 residents will not get part of this. We just heard the member for Moreton give us a figure of 93 per cent. I thought it was a bit higher than that, but I take his figure of 93 per cent. A whole lot of small towns in my electorate, like Jarrahdale, Mundijong, Serpentine and Preston Beach, will not be getting any meaningful telephony or internet connection through the NBN. To me it is really quite wrong and sad for anyone who is in an outer urban area to not get those services, despite this massive spend. Mandurah in my electorate is an example of how we need to address some of the original problems. It is about an hour from Perth and it is still on timed local calls. We are trying to get Telstra and the regulators to broaden the zone, but the town is still paying for timed local calls in this day and age. We heard from the member for Moncrieff telling us about how on the Gold Coast, Telstra, as a private operator, is currently running out lines that are capable of 100 megabits per second. I have an article here titled, 'Move aside NBN, the future's already here.' It says: Australia's Academic and Research Network say they're doing what the NBN will do in a decade, today. So NBN Co. is going to take a decade to get speeds of 100 megabits per second to your house, but here we have AARNET giving the NBN a run for its money because they are going to deliver those speeds now through something quite simple: … the research network announced yesterday that it successfully boosted the delivery speeds existing fibre optic network simply by placing 40GB 'muxponders'-supersized transpondersonto either ends of the cable. You put these muxponders at either end of the cable and you get these speeds over longer distances. So the technology is going to race ahead of the NBN, despite its cost. I have two cases in my electorate that bear going over again. I have raised these before and they have not been fixed. There is the case of the Carey Baptist College in Forrestfield in my electorate which needed decent speeds for the school. It has outgrown its own site right now and it is going to move onto another greenfield site further down the road, which will have its own issues of internet connection and telephones et cetera. The school has sought my help in getting faster speeds and better connections. I have pointed out that Telstra does not want to help anymore because the NBN is meant to be coming to this region. Interestingly, and I say this in the nicest way because Senator Sterle and I have an arrangement on these matters-we criticise each other and we have broad enough shoulders to handle each other's criticism-in an article on 21 June 2011 it was reported: Labor Senator Glenn Sterle took a swipe at Canning MHR Don Randall over his claims Carey Baptist College's broadband and internet problems were due to the National Broadband Network. Mr Sterle said Mr Randall attempted to lay blame on the NBN despite knowing the problems had existed for more than a decade. As I pointed out in this article, it was a free kick, Senator Sterle, because when this school was being constructed I was there to try to force Telstra to provide the services to the school. I assure you that if I had not involved myself in this the state office would have said: 'We have no arrangement. In fact, they'll have to pay for the infrastructure costs. This is a non-government school.' So of its they tried that on for a while and when we decided to put a bit of pressure on them at the national level they eventually came good. So thank you for the free kick, Senator Sterle. Paul Oates, the administrator from the school, pointed out that if I had not been involved, they would not have got it. But they are still struggling because there is this big disconnect: Telstra are not providing anything because, 'The NBN's coming' and the NBN are saying, 'We don't know if we are going to get there.' Even Mandurah, whom Senator Sterle refers to in this article, are saying that it is going to be one of the first places to be rolled out. Most of the infrastructure is in the ground in Mandurah but the speeds are not sufficient. They have already set a few dates when Mandurah will be rolled out and every one of them has been missed. They failed all the rollout dates for the particular location in Mandurah around Halls Head. Finally, I point to an article in the local newspaper which is headed 'Phone delay frustrates'. Tilling Timber state manager, Jeremy Coleman, says that for 18 months he has been promised phone and internet. The developer in the industrial estate had put the infrastructure in the ground but they have no service because Telstra was not interested in connecting because, remember, 'The NBN's coming.' Telstra did not want to do it, so what did Tilling Timber have to do? They had to spend $36,000 to install an elaborate substitute to get phone and internet connections. They had to get a wireless link from Armadale's industrial park to the R&I building in Perth to get a connection and then that was rerouted through the office. It is the same with their phones. Other businesses out there decided they would not start building until this was sorted out. It not until I got away from the state office of Telstra and I wrote to David Thodey, chief executive of Telstra, where I pointed out that there was infrastructure in the ground that I got the response that they would put copper wire in that particular area. Before I came into the chamber, I checked on Tilling Timber in this industrial area and I found that they still do not have their infrastructure and they are still not connected to the Telstra network, and they are waiting for other arrangements to be put in place. This you beaut, fantastic huge NBN investment that could have been done privately with a mix of technologies like wireless and satellite is now going to have all its eggs in one basket. Instead of economical fibre to the node so that copper can be connected to the home, they have gone for the most expensive model, which could be redundant in years. Dare I say, this is one of the failings of this government: if it is not your money, spend it like the Watsons because it does not matter. That is why this government are in trouble electorally, because people do not believe they can deliver for them. (Time expired)",149
198,Ms SAFFIN,BILLS," I rise to speak in strong support of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 and I do so for the following reasons. Firstly, it gives effect to the general policy of establishing a nationally consistent, high-speed broadband network to 93 per cent of premises, including residential and others, to provide download internet speeds of 100 megabits per second, and provide fixed wireless to four per cent of premises and satellite to three per cent of premises, including households, at a speed of at least 12 megabits per second. The national network will similarly be open access and wholesale only. This legislation also speaks to a particular part of the NBN policy was framework, fibre in new developments. The January ministerial statement articulated that: NBN Co. ... would be the wholesale provider of last resort in new developments within or adjacent to its long-term fibre footprint and meet the associated cost of this obligation. It is really important that this is legislated new developments are rolled out to ensure we are not left behind. The Telecom– munications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill amends the Telecom– munications Act and that supports the policy that fibre-to-the-premises infrastructure has to be installed in new developments. The bill also reflects the policy that NBN Co. will be the fibre provider of last resort. It adds a new part to the Telecommunications Act to support the rollout of the NBN. It will apply to all types of new developments, including the broadacre estates, the urban infill and urban renewal projects. It will generally apply to new developments in NBN Co.'s long-term fibre footprint. There are other provisions in the bill that give effect to this key objective. It requires developers that are constitutional corporations, and we know that has a particular legal meaning, to install fibre-ready passive infrastructure in developments. That is where the long-term fibre footprint of the NBN is. It provides ministerial authority to determine specifications for fibre-ready passive infrastructure, if required. It will allow carriers to access the passive infrastructure that is owned by non-carriers and also, importantly, it will provide for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to be the default arbitrator. Also, it will enable the minister to specify developments in which fixed lines must be optical fibre and determine specifications for such lines. And it has a number of other provisions in it that give effect to the key objective. The bill gives effect to a particular our policy but it also gives effect to the whole policy on the NBN, so I will make some comments that go to the whole and to the general. I have been very active in my local community as a champion of early NBN rollout on the North Coast. One thing I was able to do was to bring together a large as group of people who wanted the NBN first. Everybody wants the NBN; that is understandable. It is an eight-year rollout, so we cannot all be first, but if you were NBNready then you stood a good chance of getting one of the early rollouts, and we did that on the North Coast. The place was Coffs Harbour, which I call the 'nerve centre' of the NBN rollout. I worked with the local university, Southern Cross University, in particular with Professor Peter Croll, who is still at the university working on this, to get a submission ready. I also worked with 14 local councils across the North Coast and with local businesses. We were able to put in a submission which said, 'We are NBN ready,' and it was recognised that we were able to take advantage of the rollout. The NBN Co. CEO, in announcing the site, said that sites were selected on a range of technical and engineering criteria and that the engagement of local government and the receptiveness of communities to broadband initiatives were factors taken into consideration. We had those three key elements present: we had the technical and engineering criteria because of the spine that goes up the east coast, we had the engagement of local government-and it was really strong engagement-and we had receptive communities. This shows how out of step the opposition are. They come in here and talk about the NBN as though it were something that people in Australia were not receptive to. People are receptive all across Australia. We part of have communities right across Australia saying: 'We want to be in the early rollout. When is it coming? Is it happening now?' Of course it cannot 'happen now' everywhere. It is happening as fast as possible, but it is a huge undertaking. As we have all said, it is akin to building the Snowy project, not only in its size but in what it means for our development and our future. Surveys in my area have found that local businesses-small businesses in particular-know that they need it to be competitive and to stay on top of things. It is not as if we were introducing something 'out there', which is what you would think in listening to the opposition talk about it. They talk about how people could have wireless, but that is ridiculous. Wireless cannot replace it, and I will come to that now. In speaking about the general policy-and this goes to the whole debate-I will refer to some of the myths around the NBN. The website nbnmyths.wordpress.com brings this together very nicely under the heading 'The top 10 NBN myths debunked'. The first one is: 'The NBN will cost taxpayers $43 billion. We can't afford it and it's uncosted'. The website says: False First, the government investment is capped at $26-27 billion, not 43. The remainder will come from revenue and NBN Co's private debt. It then has a whole lot more to say about the claim, that the project was not studied and costed. What was the KPMG-MCKinsey implementation study if the project was not studied and costed? It found that the network could be built for $42.8 billion-that was prior to the deal with Telstra-would not have any net cost to the government and would have an estimated net value of $40 billion in 2025, earning a return on investment of six to seven per cent, which is more than enough to repay debt and equity used to build the project. It just makes good sense. The website cites the NBN business case summary, saying it revealed the total cost of the network to be lower than the initial $43 billion estimate. If people just read, all the information and facts are there. The second myth that is debunked is: 'If it were viable, the private sector would build it'. That is completely false. The private sector have had a long time to build it and they have not done it, because the private sector do not usually initiate and undertake nation-building projects that are of benefit to the whole country, that provide the infrastructure for the whole country to take advantage of in health, education, small business, farming and agriculture-in a whole range of areas. The private sector could not and would not afford it. Are parts of the private sector going to join together and say, 'Yes, let's initiate this project worth over $40 billion'? That is a huge investment for any company and well beyond any telco I know of that is operating in Australia. The website says: The private sector demand a ROI of at least 12%, because they need to earn a profit for their shareholders. The NBN has a projected 6-7% ROIwhich is a good return to cover any debt. The private sector just would not deal with that. It says: … while this is well below commercial rates, it's quite acceptable for a Government, which is not seeking to earn a profit. There are a few other myths, such as, 'We'll never need that much speed or data'. That is completely ridiculous. If you have a look at the increase in the speed of internet access in Australia and what we will have, you see the only way we can maintain this is with a fibre based system and a holistic one to start off with. There is another myth: no-one else in the world is installing such a system. That is false and ridiculous. Fibre to the premises or the home is currently being rolled out across Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. It is ridiculous to say that it is not happening in other places. The OECD actually recommends that governments build fibre to the premises networks-so the OECD does recommend it. If national governments do not do it, then who will do it? It is one of those responsibilities that have as a government to provide that infrastructure. South Korea have announced that they are now spending US$26 billion on upgrading their old 100 megabits per second FTTP network to deliver speeds of one gigabyte, the same as the Australian NBN. This is happening even though they already have a 4G wireless network. One of the other myths is our internet speed is good enough. That is ridiculous. The facts speak for themselves. I do not even have to go through what the technical parts are. We know that is not true. When you have a look at average speeds, you see the dismal position of Australia's internet speeds. Then there is the other one: a wireless network that can be 4G, LTE, WiMax or DSL-ADSL2+/VDSL/HDSL-can provide the same speed for a fraction of the price. That is false. Much is claimed, usually by those with a vested interest-and that means a vested commercial interest or a political interest-to try to tear it down, because we know that is what the opposition do; they are not interested in nation-building projects like this. Much is claimed about the potential of wireless networks, with speeds such as 300 megabits per second being quoted. But this is highly deceptive, because those are peak speeds per tower, not realistically achievable speeds for individuals. If you have the 300 megabits per second tower and you have two users on it, then that speed would be halved to 150 megabits per second. A trial of 4G/LTE in 2009 showed that with just 20 people using any one tower the speed plummeted to just seven megabits per second. We know that distance, topography, buildings and weather also degrade those available speeds. All this information is available and it does not find its way easily into the debate because all you hear from the opposition is, 'No, we're just going to tear this down. We don't care about it.' They had we 12 years to do it. Nineteen attempts failed miserably.",152
199,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS," I rise to speak on the NBN bill, the Telecommunications Legislation Amend–ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, which is before the House and which we are debating. I make the point at the beginning that the coalition, as we always have been, is supportive of fast broadband. It is a worthy and important goal. The development of fast broadband, especially the development of accessible fast broadband at cost-effective prices, is a great economic boon for our country. But we continue to make the point that it is not a case of picking winners in this debate but rather one of looking at a mixture of technologies, which is the important way to go into the future. Countries like the United States of America, with its President Obama, have realised that. We see here in Australia a government born out of central planning days, and we have just heard the member for Page walk us through her distrust of the private sector while talking about how the private sector will not build it because there is not enough return in it, although I note that, as I understand it, the standing policy of the Australian Labor Party is still to sell NBN Co. as soon as it is established. So somehow there has been a mistransmission over the talking points given to the member for Page, because her contribution was questioning the ability of the private sector to invest in networks such as this. She says the private sector would not build something like this. Well, they do build these sorts of networks all the time. In fact, they have built a mobile network. Ms Saffin interjecting",155
200,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"Member for Page, as you walk around with your mobile phone in your electorate, which is a regional electorate, you get to use your mobile phone and your wireless devices because the private sector built those towers. So it is interesting member for Page thinks that the government is all good and everything that is required needs to be built by the government. That is the view of those opposite, but, of course, we have trust in the private sector and we think the private sector provides services at a far more efficient and cost-effective rate than what government ever does. Mr Stephen Jones: Except when it comes to climate change. Then you want to pick winners.",155
201,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"In fact, that is not true at all, Member for Throsby.",156
202,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Throsby will cease interjecting and the member for Mayo will not respond to interjections from the member for Throsby.,156
203,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"He was completely distracting me, Mr Deputy Speaker. You are right to be raising those issues. When it comes to this bill, I think it highlights how much the government has failed when it comes to this issue. It highlights very much how they find a reasonable idea and turn it into a complete shambles. That very much sums up the NBN itself. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we support fast broadband, but this is spending billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers' money unnecessarily, excessively and imprudently. We have seen the risk this government is exposed to when it spends such large amounts of money. We have the very sad examples of the green loans and the Home Insulation Program and with that program the government were not even able to put roof insulation batts into people's houses without burning the houses down. We have had the school halls program where they managed to spend about double what the private sector could have spent on building them. We have seen recent examples of that the digital set-top boxes. They have been spending double the amount of money for which Gerry Harvey or another retailer could have provided them. So when this government gets involved in spending large amounts of money, the Australian people shiver with fear-and so they should. That is why we saw today economic figures indicating a lack of confidence by the Australian people in the economy with housing and consumer numbers plummeting. That is driven by a lack of confidence in a government that is not competent. This is another bill which highlights the lack of competence of this government. There are various aspects in this bill which relate directly to my electorate such as the $40 billion spend on a network, which the Auditor-General's report today reflected upon, that Infrastructure Australia has not even seen. Even though they are meant to be looking at the top infrastructure priorities, the NBN has not been referred to Infrastructure Australia and there has not been a cost-benefit analysis done. This bill touches on the deployment of fibre and that will have an impact in my electorate as it will happen in new housing developments. I think the arguments articulated by the member for Wentworth and the member for Bradfield have been very well made. The dissenting report highlights the problem that the government is creating for itself. It is trying to centralise and take away the benefits of competition when it comes to new developments. The real effect of this will be higher costs for people building homes in new housing estates. I have many new housing estates in my area, particularly in Mount Barker and Strathalbyn. These are already contentious areas, particularly the Mount Barker development which was forced through by the state Labor government without any consultation with the local community. Now we are seeing the federal Labor government create laws which are going to make it more expensive for people to buy houses in these developments. That was a point well made by the member for Wentworth and the member for Bradfield and very well made in the dissenting report into this issue. The other area I want to touch upon briefly is that, when it comes to the deployment of fibre into electorates like mine, it is not easy to put it underground. I note that the NBN Co. documents, which were released last December, indicated that they wished the government to allow them to override local council regulations to ensure that they could roll out the fibre overhead, or aerial as it is described. This is a major concern in an electorate such as mine. The Adelaide Hills is the most beautiful electorate in the country without doubt. It is quite obviously not appropriate to put the fibre in overhead cables in a bushfire-prone zone over the longer distances. I understand this will be the intention of the NBN Co. This is a concern in my community and people have been raising this issue with me. As I have a semi-regional and regional electorate, the longer distances will mean that when it actually does get to us-for towns over 1,000 if you believe the government's rhetoric-there will be overhead hanging fibre used. I think this is something that the government needs to address very quickly and swiftly. I am not the only electorate with this sort of environment. I know the member for Bradfield has raised this issue in regard to his inner-city electorate. Of course it is a cheaper for NBN Co. to roll out the fibre overhead. No doubt the arrangements with Telstra may have changed that slightly, but I do not think they would have changed it all that much in an electorate like mine. This is an issue which I will raise in my local community and ask them how they intend to react if the government decides to roll out overhead wires through the Adelaide Hills, particularly through the bushfire-prone areas where most of the overhead power lines have been removed and put underground. If it is the intention of the NBN Co. going forward to do the same thing in my area, it does raise significant questions about how the business model of the NBN Co. has been planned and what the associated costs will be with using either underground or overhead wires. My electorate is a black spot area where government funding is required to ensure that there is an equality of service. It is a point that we have always made on this side of the House. In outer metro and regional areas, like my electorate and the electorates of the member for Grey and the member for Barker, there is a need for government intervention because the market fails in those areas, and we have said that all along. Quite clearly it does not fail in city areas, and this is where the big mistake of the government spending billions of dollars unnecessarily and imprudently creates a real risk for taxpayers with the waste that we will see through this spending. We heard the member for Page earlier say that spending $26 or $27 billion is such a Labor Party thing to do. It is a billion dollars between friends, and we only have $106 billion of debt and a $50 billion deficit this year. This is a fundamental issue about the management of our country. If we look around the world today, one of the great lot challenges is our Western cousins who are in deep financial trouble because they have spent too much money over too many years. We have seen this Labor government use the public purse without any effort to ensure the money is spent properly and without any effort to ensure that their policies benefit the Australian community. Quite clearly in some areas of the country there needs to be spending to ensure that services are kept up to the level which other Australians get access to, but in the city areas this makes no sense at all. This is an overbuild of existing speed which the market will meet and has been meeting. To think that over the next 10 years we are going to spend billions and billions of dollars of Australian taxpayers' money laying out fibre in areas, which the market would have met, is ridiculous. In addition to that we are seeing questions about how it will be happening in areas such as mine where clearly fibre is not the answer. In hilly areas I suspect that fibre is not the appropriate answer nor in regional areas because there is difficulty in laying it out or indeed whether you can lay it out at all. It will be interesting to see how NBN Co. deals with that issue. I will certainly be raising it my local community. If the rollout is to occur in my electorate, in what parts of the electorate will it be, how will it be done and how is the NBN Co. planning to do it in the future? It is a concern. The member for Bradfield raised this concern in his electorate. He raised the point that communities do not want overhead cables anymore. Communities have been trying to move away from that, and there are very good safety reasons in my area for that to be the case. So when it comes to the deployment of fibre in the electorate of Mayo, I think there are legitimate questions to be answered by the government about how this rollout is planned. The opposition see some merit in this bill. However, we have made some very prudent suggestions, which the member for Wentworth outlined earlier, to improve the bill and to reintroduce competition, which is a major concern when it comes to the NBN. The government have turned what was a competitive market, or 30 years of telecommunications policy about creating a competitive market, on its head by creating another government monopoly that will have the same challenges. I note that the member for Lyne last week made the point about government monopolies not having worked in the past and not being likely to work in the future, and I think that was a very good point. Where the government has gone with this policy is a major concern. It is spending far too much on a wrongheaded policy in areas where money does not need to be spent rather than focusing government effort on areas where money should be spent and allowing the market to meet the demand. Quite obviously, part of the mix here is wireless. That is where people want portability. They want to be able to use their iPads and their phones and other devices around the place. At the same time, there is in no doubt that there is a place for fixed lines, and that is where the market will meet that need. For the government to spend $40 billion odd of taxpayers' money-money that we do not have, borrowed money-makes no sense at all at a time when we already have over $100 billion in net debt and when we see around the globe the great problems that are being caused by governments accumulating debt. Those on the other side will say: 'Don't worry about it. We'll be back to surplus in a couple of years. We've got this wafer-thin surplus that is on the books thanks to the commodity boom and thanks to the high prices that other countries are paying for our products.' But we know that the debt this Labor government is accumulating will not be paid off by this government. It will not even attempt to pay it off because it keeps coming up with harebrained schemes on how to waste the money of Australians, such as spending twice the amount it should on school halls and burning down people's houses with its home insulation program. I support the remarks of the member for Wentworth and the amendments he is proposing. I also put on the record the concern in my community about the prospect of having overhead cables laid out. That is an on carbon. issue that I suspect, Mr Deputy Speaker, we will be talking about more often in this House in the coming months and years.",156
204,Ms GRIERSON,BILLS," I am pleased to stand here this evening to speak in favour of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill and in support of the continued rollout of the National Broadband Network. Having heard the member for Mayo, I must say that the repetition of incorrect statements on the government's record over and over again cannot go unchallenged. We have a debt level that is the envy of most nations in the world. It defies logic, intelligence and economic scrutiny that the other side continues to make those misstatements and mislead the public. In saying that, I have to say that the National Broadband Network is a major economic and social reform that will benefit the entire nation. It is always worth restating our reform record, and it is worth restating it here. federal Labor government has introduced a number of major reforms of which we on this side of the House feel rightly proud. first act in government was to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. In 2008, we apologised to the stolen generation. During 2008 and 2009, our responsible financial management avoided the worse of the global financial crisis and kept thousands of Australians in employment. That was verified again in the last couple of weeks by international bodies pointing out the success of Australia's approach to handling the global financial crisis. On 1 January this year, we introduced paid parental leave for the first time in this nation's history. Just two months ago, we introduced a historic $2.2 billion mental health package, an area sorely in need of attention. Within a matter of weeks, we will release full details of our plan to put a price But one of the reforms of which we are most proud, and should be most proud, is the rollout of the National Broadband Network. It is always worth remembering how we changed tack on this when the market failed to tender for it successfully. I heard the member for Mayo quote the Audit Office on this issue. Being privy to some information from the audits, yes, I think some of us do know that it was one of the biggest market failures imaginable. I would say that it was unimaginable, and I cannot say anymore. As I have said in this place before, this initiative will define this government and its vision for our nation. This initiative will change the way we work, connect and deliver important services, the way we develop and best utilise skilled workforces, the way we overcome skilled workforce shortages and the way we deliver important services such as education and health. We want a nation that will embrace The technology to maximise our economic competitiveness, create the jobs of the future and improve the quality of life of all Our Australians. We want to overcome the historical disadvantage of the tyranny of distance, both between us and our major trading partners and between our urban and regional, remote and rural centres. The National Broadband Network will deliver affordable high-speed access to all Australians, irrespective of where they work or where they live. It will extend optical fibre to 93 per cent of premises, with speeds of 100 megabits per second-100 times faster than many Australians have access to today. This bill is a critical element in delivering the government's commitment to extend the NBN to all Australian households and, in this case, into new developments. This bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to ensure that fibre-to-the-premises infrastructure will be installed in new development areas. When fixed-line facilities are being installed in a new development, part 20A of the bill will require that facilities be designed, manufactured and installed to allow for the ready deployment of optical fibre cabling. I see no resistance to this bill. see new developments going into my own area, and part of their promotion is that they are fibre ready. It is a wonderful asset to communities and it is a wonderful asset to selling new developments. This bill will literally pave the way for the physical infrastructure to be in place for the rollout of optical fibre. In turn, this bill reflects the government's policy to be the fibre provider of last resort. So, while developers will be free to use other telecommunications providers, NBN Co. will provide fibre where developers do not wish to use another provider or where no other provider is prepared to deliver the service. The passing of this bill by parliament is just one of a number of significant steps towards making the National Broadband Network a reality for all Australians. Indeed, we have already passed a number of historic milestones. Last year, the National Broadband Network was switched on in Tasmania for the very first time. In May this year, the Prime Minister launched the National Broadband Network on the Australian mainland. Since then, the NBN Co. has announced its first and second release sites, which include locations in every single state and territory across Australia. Just last month, on 23 June, Prime Minister Gillard and Senator Conroy announced NBN Co.'s historic agreements with both Telstra and Optus. This paves the way for a very secure future for the telecommunications industry in this nation. I have to mention my very own milestone when it comes to the NBN Co., and one that I am particularly proud of: the Smart Grid, Smart City initiative, a $100 million initiative, that trials better ways of managing the grid, linking renewables into the grid system and managing electricity use in homes et cetera. It came to my attention that the technologies being applied were not I necessarily compatible with the Smart Grid, Smart City and the NBN Co. But that does not make sense, and I am very pleased to say that there are now standardised trials being undertaken by the NBN Co. and EnergyAustralia to make sure that those technologies are compatible and that those two programs can work together. If the Smart Grid, Smart City project is successful, the trial will be run out all around the nation and, of course, go international. NBN will be part of that now. The sum total of these new agreements with Telstra and Optus is that NBN's network of optic fibre will be rolled out to every household and become the backbone of Australia's communications system. This will be a communications system of which Australians will be rightly proud-not the cut-price model proposed by the coalition that will do little to nothing for regional Australia. Instead, the NBN will provide a 21st century communications system for a 21st century Australian economy. The case for the NBN is, to all but those in the chamber opposite, utterly compelling. It needs to be recalled that Labor's plan for the National Broadband Network stems from a decade of failure by the former coalition government and the market to deliver highquality internet access to all Australians. The federal Labor government will not mimic the decade of neglect on telecommunications policy under which Australia suffered during the coalition years. As a Canberra Times editorial noted today, Australian internet usage is expected to increase sixfold in the coming five years. In fact, that editorial drew attention to Gungahlin, a very well-known area here, which does not have high-speed broadband. This is a whole, big new development that suffers for many reasons, but Telstra will not put in the fibre. I have area like that in my electorate called Thornton. It is one of the biggest and fastest growing housing areas in the electorate. Again, because of a combination of factors, fast-speed broadband cannot be delivered there unless fibre is put in. Telstra has not been willing to do that, which is exactly why we are rolling out the NBN Co. proposal. Our current infrastructure is barely adequate for our present needs, let alone the future requirements of a 21st century economy. Relying on wireless internet might seem to make sense from the comfortable vantage point of Mr Turnbull's electorate on the harbour in eastern Sydney, or Mr Abbott's electorate in Manly, where population densities and demand make sense for private enterprise to invest in decent wireless infrastructure, but that is ludicrous to those of us in regional Australia where there has been a tremendous failure by private enterprise to provide quality internet access and where there is little incentive to provide 3G services. Indeed, many private telecommunications providers struggle to provide decent mobile phone coverage across the Hunter region, let alone decent 3G coverage. The paucity of copper based internet services in my electorate, like much of regional Australia, is already very well known. It amazes me that the opposition keep quoting the benefits of wireless and flexibility. We all want access to that and we are all using it, but we all know that it has to be backed up by physical infrastructure, and that is what we are providing. In those areas where we struggle in peak times to access a wireless service because too many people are doing so at the same time, we know that it will only work with the infrastructure in place. That physical infrastructure is now being delivered all around Australia. I am certain other colleagues in the House an would attest that there is overwhelming support in the electorates of Newcastle and the Hunter for the rollout of the National Broadband Network. My office has been bombarded with messages from local residents urging its speedy introduction. To paraphrase the member for Greenway, who spoke earlier in this debate: the question from my constituents has not been should the NBN be rolled out, but when will it be rolled out to us and why can't it be rolled out faster? I often ask that question myself, because the people of Newcastle do understand the enormous social, economic and cultural benefits that the NBN will bring to a regional centre such as theirs. I wonder whether coalition members have ever gone onto the NBN website. It has the most wonderful promotion of what the service will deliver. I recommend everybody go onto the website. If you cannot imagine it, go onto the website and see what the NBN Co. high-speed broadband will offer the individual and the nation. My electorate do know that the rollout of high-speed, worldalready class broadband in the Hunter will make us more competitive. It will erode the tyranny of distance with major capital cities. The towering sandstone hills of the Hawkesbury that now divide us from Sydney will be less of a barrier to developing new business and employment opportunities in Newcastle. The NBN will replace the ageing and unreliable copper networks presently available. It is always interesting to speak to people who have worked for the old Telecom or Telstra. Frequently, they cannot even find where that copper wire is now. The maps have long gone. When these people go into the new little towns in the regions, they have to ask or look around to try to find where on earth the copper is. One aspect of the NBN about which I am most excited is its potential to deliver very real dividends for the health of regional Australians. The Hunter New England Area Health Service, for example, which is headquartered in Newcastle, is responsible for health services in locations far west as Tamworth and Armidale and as far north as Taree. I keep reminding members Messrs Oakeshott and Windsor just how much the people of Newcastle and the infrastructure of Newcastle have propped up their seats and made sure that as regional seats they have not missed out. That has included the delivery of e-health services from the Hunter New England Area Health Service in my electorate. The universal availability of high-speed broadband will substantially improve the capacity of places like Tamworth, Armidale and Taree to deliver services and advice in these regions. For example, the Hunter New England Area Health Service, supported by the Digital Regions Initiative of the federal Labor government, is already undertaking a three-year program to deliver telehealth services to more than 200 patients in rural and regional communities and the NBN is supporting that initiative. Most importantly, this initiative connects patients directly to health professionals. The program targets chronic disease sufferers and links them in their own homes to monitoring, education and support services. This potential to connect health professionals with patients in their own homes is truly one of the most exciting features of the NBN for regional Australia. Some members of the Liberal Party do know the benefits of the NBN system. I draw attention to a new state colleague, a Liberal Party state member in Newcastle, who during the election campaign said he supported the early rollout of the NBN, saying that the 'sooner' it was rolled out to Newcastle the 'better'. I strongly encourage the federal opposition to adopt that vision as well for their communities. In coming years the federal coalition will have a lot of explaining to do. It has been missing in action on some of the biggest as reform issues in this nation. It will need to explain to the community why it has injected a historically high level of negativity into Australian public life, it will need to explain to the community why its campaign of outright lies and exaggerations about the impact of a carbon price did not come to pass and it will need to explain to the community why it opposed the National Broadband Network and the enormous benefits it will provide to all Australians. I commend this bill to the House.",159
205,Mr HAASE,BILLS," I rise this evening to address the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 and subsequent amendments. The NBN and the process of providing high-tech communications to all Australians-and I underline all Australians-has been the focal point of members of this House for some time. It is quite clear to Australians today that we have a solution to providing that service. Less than $10 billion will provide a very capable and adequate service to all Australians. There is that inclusive againall Australians. This best estimate $50 billion service is going to provide ultrahigh speed to 93 per cent of Australians. There is no guessing as to where those other seven per cent reside. They are in my own electorate of Durack. The members for Lingiari, Grey and Maranoa also have a few. There is a large part of this continent where fibre to the premises will never be provided. It is those seven per cent that I am concerned about tonight. Presently, we have a proposition akin to taking out a high-cost bank loan to buy a Lamborghini to go into town and pick up the mail each week. It is dumb, and everyone out there who has ever had to balance a budget and provide facilities at the same time for a family knows that it is dumb. You do not go ahead and borrow inordinate volumes of currency and subsequently push up interest rates across the country to invest in something that is simply not necessary. There are other ways to do this job-ways that we have espoused on and on but all to no avail, unfortunately, with this government who seem hell-bent on constructing monuments. The monument to the Prime Minister, the school halls fiasco, is well known. I believe the NBN fiasco will be well known in the future as a monument to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy. But, at the end of the day, it is the taxpayers of Australia who will be footing the bill. You cannot justify borrowing the funds that are being talked about by this government with the taxpayer footing the bill in higher interest rates into the future simply because you want to build a monument. There are many parts of my electorate where mobile phones are not available. There is no doubt, however, that wireless communications is the preferred communication method in rural and remote Australia. I hazard a guess that it is also a trend that catching on swiftly in metropolitan Australia. More and more internet users are demanding that their facilities be mobile. People do not want to be tied to a particular point to gain internet access. Apple found that last year when they released their new product. The iPad was sought after by thousands and sell-outs were swift. By comparison, when the NBN was turned on in Armidale, the government was battling to get any real paying customers to the occasion because Australians do not want to pay through the nose for something that has been rammed down their throats, that they have been told is something they have to have and, what is more, that they will pay for whether they like it or not. They do not like it. If we spent a fraction of the difference between $10 billion and $50 billion, $1 billion is $1,000 million. We talk about billions of dollars as though they simply fall off trees. They do not. In this case they are the dollars of hard working Australians, for which they will be responsible into the future. If we talk about providing a service to all Australians that is adequate and affordable, we talk about spending about $10 billion. This particular bill is a very specific bill that relates, in the main, to greenfields. Generally speaking, we accept that in the case of greenfields there is a lot to be done. If we have to have the NBN solution of fibre to the premises, that facility will be provided at a much lower cost if it is mandated to be rolled out in greenfield developments. Keep in mind that the best guesstimate is that by 2020 there will be some 1.9 million premises that will be part of greenfield developments. So it is a very substantial market that we are speaking of. With the size of that market in mind, we in the coalition believe that amendments ought to be made to this legislation so as to is provide for greater efficiencies and greater cost economies in the rolling out of services. We know through past history and experience that, wherever a monopoly is involved, costs have a habit of trending upwards unnecessarily. Presently we have well in excess of 1,000 employees in the NBN and something like 600-odd genuine customers. It is not a ratio that commercial Australia would find very sustainable. If you look at that fact today on the basis of this $50 billion expenditure proposition not being costed, with no triple bottom line analysis and no real transparency in the calculation of the price and the manner in which it will be spent, it is pretty unsatisfactory. I go back to the amendments. Because of the broad scope and the numbers involved into the future, we firmly believe that operators in these greenfield developments ought to be exempt from the cherry-picking laws. We believe in that because there is room for competition here-and competition, as has been experienced in the past, will bring the costs of providing that service down. Further, we wish to have an amendment that will provide for private operators that wish to set up a network in competition to NBN to have the opportunity via this legislation to do so. Furthermore, there was a commitment that those networks be able to sell out to NBN in a negotiated settlement at some point in time in the We on this side of the House believe in true competition. True competition is driven by market forces. Supply and demand is the best solution to any trade relationship. In this case, where you have the opportunity for the creation of a monopoly you equally provide the opportunity for inflated prices. Australians are already suffering that in the areas of groceries, fuel and electricity, and this is not the time to add another level of inflated prices through their internet participation. We on this side of the House are quite resolved as to what should be the outcome for this bill. If the government will reasonably accept these very rational amendments, we will be happy to see the passage of the bill. In the meantime, I reiterate that the interest of Australians is simply to have a reasonable internet service. Those Australians who have almost no access to mobile phones today and no reliable internet service would be served extremely well with a high-tech, up-to-date wireless internet service that would provide for them to access markets. As an aside, I mention that those markets have, in the main, been shut down by the decision of this government in cancelling live beef exports to Indonesia. But I digress. We need in rural and remote Australia to have access to the internet because remote marketing is an important tool today. But we do not need to go into hock to this extent to provide that service. Rural folk are a fairly sensible lot. They do not believe that you spend above your means. They do not believe that you accumulate absolutely non-serviceable debt in order to brag that you have a Rolls Royce service that you will never, ever need. Therefore, the case remains that this is too much money spent without proper consideration. Unless this legislation specifically relating to greenfields is rationally amended future. to allow some competition to maintain reasonable costs, those hard working Australians who want to use these services will be worse off. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (19:41): I rise to speak in support of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. This bill was first introduced into the House in March 2011 and was referred to the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network in May 2011. The committee sought to conduct an inquiry into this bill within a responsible time frame, considering the circumstances of the bill. This bill has been some time in the making. As noted in paragraph 1.1 of the committee's report on this bill, the bill: … was preceded by a similar bill which was introduced into the Senate in March 2010, but lapsed on the proroguing of the 42nd Parliament. The Fibre Deployment Bill 2010 shared a similar purpose to the Bill under inquiry, that is, to ‘ensure fibre-ready and fibre infrastructure installation in new developments.' This Bill differs from its predecessor in that the Fibre Deployment Bill 2010 ‘was more dependent on subordinate legislation for activation of the provisions in the Bill', while the current Bill includes those key provisions. The government undertook extensive consultation on this bill now before the House, including releasing discussion papers and draft legislation. The government also considered the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications report on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2010. Based on that history, the industry and developers have been seeking certainty for over 12 months. There is no doubt that certainty is important for developers who each and every day are developing new estates and building homes for people across Australia. It is this imperative for certainty that ensured that the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network dealt with this matter within the time-frame set, thus allowing this bill to be debated before this House this week. When looking at the history of this bill, at the questions put to witnesses by the opposition and the submissions put to the committee by various providers, the fact is that the issues raised do not fundamentally go to this bill. They go to the Liberal Party's opposition to the National Broadband Network and the government's policy to deliver a national broadband network. The main purpose of this bill is to require developers of new estates to put in passive infrastructure like underground pipes into which a fibre provider can later put fibre. It is not concerned with putting an obligation on NBN Co. or anyone else to put in active infrastructure, fibre or, in limited cases, copper lines or wireless. The majority of submissions by the witnesses and the questions by the opposition during the inquiry into this bill went to active infrastructure. key It was acknowledged by witnesses that the purpose of this bill is to legislate for fibreready infrastructure, not active infrastructure. The committee's report also acknowledged that much of the evidence was outside the scope of the bill. The opposition also concentrated most of its time on issues not relating to this bill, and it continues to do so in this debate. This is predominately because the opposition is more interested in finding ways to oppose the government's policy than being opposed to the practical application of the rollout of fast broadband. I will come to the Liberal Party's position shortly but, importantly, this bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to support the government's policy that fibre-to-thepremises infrastructure should be installed in new developments. This bill is another step forward to delivering on the Labor government's commitment to roll out the National Broadband Network. As stated by the minister in his second reading speech on 7 April 2009, the Australian government the announced its historic decision to establish a new company, NBN Co. Limited, to build and operate a new superfast national broadband network. The NBN has an objective of connecting up to 93 per cent of all Australian homes, schools and workplaces with fibre based broadband services and connecting other premises in Australia with next-generation wireless and satellite broadband services. This bill in effect requires developers that are constitutional corporations to install fibreready passive infrastructure-that is, pit and pipe. It requires passive infrastructure installed in new developments in the long term NBN fibre footprint to be fibre ready; it allows carriers to access fibre-ready passive infrastructure that is owned by non carriers, and provides for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to have a role as the default arbitrator. It creates a power for the minister to specify by legislative instrument developments in which fixed lines must be optical fibre and provides for exemptions from the requirements to install fibre-ready facilities or optical fibre lines. It also provides for Australian Communications and Media Authority to develop technical standards to cover interoperability, performance standards and design features for superfast broadband rollout on its own initiative or, if directed, by the minister, and makes other technical and administrative amendments. The bill will take effect on the later of the date of royal assent or 1 July 2011, which unfortunately has passed. I would like to briefly touch on the standards because there has been much debate in relation to standards. Despite evidence from TransACT, OptiComm and Greenfield Fibre Operators of Australia of them being opposed to ministerial authority to set standards and specifications, and comments made that this should be left to the Australian Communications and Media Authority, there appears to be no real enthusiasm to do so. There does appear to be some double standards, however, when TransACT in evidence stated that it would expect subcontractors to apply TransACT's standards but it would not be acceptable for NBN Co. to expect the same. Firstly, it is important to note that this bill does not set out technical specifications for fibre infrastructure in new developments. What the bill does do is give the minister some powers to make instruments to do so with regard to passive infrastructure and to optical fibre lines in specified developments if necessary. The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy stated in its evidence that for fibre infrastructure to serve its purpose, for example to allow the ready deployment of fibre, and operate on an appropriate level in terms of speeds across the many new developments constructed in Australia each the year, some degree of standardisation may be required. These provisions provide a reserve power to fast track this standardisation process if required, noting that normal standardisation can sometimes be time consuming and subject to gaming. The department went on to say: The government's policy in relation to specifications was set out in the 9 December 2010 policy statement. NBN Co. will provide specifications for use where a developer wishes to use NBN Co. The specifications will also be provided to the Communications Alliance with a view to having these specifications endorsed for general use by industry as soon as possible. This policy was also reflected in the government's statement of expectations for the NBN and NBN Co. It is clear that this bill and the government's policy, as reflected in the statement of expectations, is flexible. It does not impose specifications without consultation. However, it is reasonable if the industry itself does not develop a standard and it is considered appropriate to do so, that the minister has such powers. The NBN is already being rolled out in Tasmania and we recently saw the start-up on the mainland of Australia. With the rollout of the NBN continuing to expand across the country over coming months and years, it is important that certain areas do not get left behind. Importantly, it is necessary to ensure that unnecessary costs are not incurred due to lack of planning. That is why greenfields sites are being addressed through this bill. It is important, as the NBN goes through our older suburbs and provides fast broadband, that new suburbs being built are not using pits and pipes which would not be suitable for smooth transition to fibre. That why this bill is being introduced-to ensure our new developments are fibre ready. I also note the comments from the members for Greenway and Chifley, who have much experience in this area, in particular the comments of the member for Chifley on the unremarkable nature of this bill. It is true that much attention has been paid to this bill and, as I outlined earlier, has a history going back more than 12 months. However, what is being achieved through this bill is in no way unique. Just as developers ensure the infrastructure for water, electricity and roads in new estates, they will ensure infrastructure for fast broadband. The Liberal Party has stated this is not their preferred model. It is clear from comments made by the shadow minister for communications and broadband, the member for Wentworth, that the opposition's policy is for a hybrid system of fibre, copper, wireless and satellite, with no particular strategy. It appears that the Liberal Party's policy is that they can provide faster broadband than people have now but not as fast as Labor's NBN policy, not as efficient, not a network which will be Australia wide and which will expand services across health, education, businesses and households, both rural and city. The selling point for the Liberal Party is: 'But it won't cost as much'. Well of course it will not cost as much, because it is not delivering an efficient fast broadband system which would be internationally competitive. It will still see many suburbs struggle to get any connection or work at a speed suitable for basic household use. If the Australian public were listening to various opposition members in this debate, I think they would go away very confused. The member for Moncrieff was stating that we do not need NBN-that health services is over fast broadband are happening now. At the same time, the member for Ryan is saying that there is no doubt that the country will benefit from the rollout of fibre across the country to deliver fast broadband but that, overall, it is bad for the country because it will cost money. The shadow minister is outlining proposed amendments, yet to be tendered, which allegedly seek to provide for it competition because the providers do not want to miss out on the opportunities that come from the demand for fast broadband. At the same time, other opposition members are criticising the NBN rollout as a white elephant because apparently no householders are going to take up the option of connecting fast broadband to their premises. So on one hand providers are missing out and, on the other, nobody is going to take up broadband. Then of course we have the shadow minister continually using South Korea as an alternative example of a country that is rolling out fast broadband but only to the basement. There are many similarities between Australia and South Korea-they are celebrating this year, as is Australia, Australian-Korean diplomatic relationships over the past 50 years. But when we compare the size of the countries and when we compare the living styles-the majority of their population live in high-rise apartments; the majority in Australia live in stand-alone houses-it is clear that the statements being relied on are just incorrect. The arguments are flawed. In fact, when the shadow minister was asking questions about South Korea of Mr Harris, the Secretary of the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Mr Harris said: On the Korean issue, we had the Korea-AustraliaNew Zealand Broadband Summit in Hobart a few weeks ago. I asked the Korean communications commissioner about these issues … I asked the CEO of the Korean Communications Commission. He is a senior representative in creating the plans by which the Koreans are doing these investments. He went on to state: Korea has a Fibre-To-The-Home Council and is clearly running, in their advice to us, fibre-to-thehome network planning. They are doing fibre to the home. They are just sequencing it as we have done, fibre to the basement, as you have said, we have done some fibre to the node and we are keeping on going and now doing fibre to the home. It has not stopped. Their program continues and their objective is fibre to the home. By all means we should look at international examples and learn from their experiences, but it is important that we do not get distracted by flawed arguments, such as that from the shadow minister. Although the opposition clearly do not understand the importance of a national fast broadband network and the benefits it can and will bring to many aspects of our economy and people's lives, the Labor Party and this Labor government do understand. That is why this Gillard Labor government is committed to passing this bill, committed to ensuring that fibre-ready infrastructure in our new developments and committed to seeing the rollout of the National Broadband Network. People in my electorate of Petrie understand the importance of such infrastructure. We have many black spots, even though we are metropolitan and outer metropolitan, where people cannot get broadband at all. People in my electorate understand the importance of the National Broadband Network. The Australian people understand the importance of such infrastructure. That is why this government is delivering on its promise to the Australian people and it is for this reason that I commend the bill to the House. Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (19:57): I rise this evening to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. This bill is designed to ensure that fibre-to-the-premises infrastructure, rather than traditional copper connections, is installed in new broadacre urban infill and urban renewal developments of more than 100 premises. The coalition does support regulations which would ensure that fibre to the premises is used in greenfields estates, but we still have concerns. Firstly, we have concerns about changes to the market structure. Under the arrangements with developers, the NBN Co. will pay for the pits and pipes of new infrastructure, a cost that has traditionally been borne by developers. This will see existing providers become uncompetitive. Secondly, there appears to have been a lack of consultation with the industry and an eleventh-hour decision that the NBN establish technical standards which will be too onerous for small providers to meet. It is very important that we get clarity on this. In the electorate of Maranoa, we have the Surat coal basin, with a huge development and growth that we have not seen since almost the early development of that part of Queensland. There are a number of developments going out there-greenfields sites. The developers of these sites have been in touch with me. They have been trying to operate and develop these housing estates, which are very much needed, but they have had this uncertainty hanging over them about who is going to pay for what-whether it is going to be the developer and, if so, whether they are going to be reimbursed, or whether it is going to be Telstra, and whether it has to be copper wire or optic fibre cable. Many of these developers have been frustrated because they could not get an answer out of either-the responsibility was being shifted. Obviously this legislation is long overdue and is supported by the coalition. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Murphy): Order! It being 8 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member for Maranoa will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Live Animal Export Restriction and Prohibition Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed.",162
206,Mr WILKIE,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Five weeks ago tonight the ABC Four Corners program exposed the shocking cruelty routinely meted out to Australian livestock in Indonesia. The images sent shockwaves throughout Australia, not just because of the severity of the cruelty but also because of the compelling evidence that we had been terribly let down by a succession of negligent Australian governments and betrayed by an industry fundamentally dishonest, uncaring and incompetent. How the Howard, Rudd and Gillard governments allowed such terrible cruelty to go on day after day escapes me. And allow it they did, because few if any countries are subject to such intense Australian scrutiny as Indonesia. Nor is it as though Australia did not have cause to keep a close eye on our live animal export trade given all the problems the business has experienced year after year in country after country. In the Middle East alone eight countries have been identified mistreating Australian livestock during the last eight years. More broadly, Meat and Livestock Australia's role in this sorry mess has been deservedly well remarked upon by now. While MLA's response has been largely to (Mr claim that little of it is their fault, that they are being unfairly blamed and should not have to pay compensation from their bulging coffers, the fact is that countless primary producers put their faith in this iconic Australian organisation and they feel desperately let down. A case in point is a friend of mine from Longford in northern Tasmania. He pays about $5,000 each year to MLA on the assumption the organisation is competently safeguarding and growing Australia's meat industry. Significantly, he recounts numerous events at which MLA assured him all was well overseas, and the result is that this saga has left him feeling terribly let down. It is no wonder there has been such an extraordinary public reaction to the Four Corners program. Even those who, like me, have been concerned with live animal exports for a long time felt energised to do whatever we could to finally address the problem, and the Live Animal Export Restriction and Prohibition Bill 2011 will do just that. The bill has two essential parts, the first being the implementation of essential safeguards before the live animal trade with Indonesia can resume and the second being the winding up of the industry in three years time. In the first part of the bill the trade can resume as soon as the government can be confident livestock for slaughter will be treated satisfactorily in their country of destination. In essence this would be the case if Australian livestock are kept overseas in holding premises that comply with the Holding Standards; are transported to slaughter, unloaded, kept in lairage and slaughtered in accordance with the OIE guidelines; and are stunned using appropriate humane restraints immediately before slaughter. Fast-tracking the implementation of such safeguards in Indonesia is in fact the only way to help the tens of thousands of animals currently in Indonesian feedlots who are being, and will continue to be, treated the same way as the poor animals we saw on Four Corners. For that reason alone we cannot just walk away. Moreover we should also consider the human dimension of this mess, namely the graziers, the station hands, the truck and ship operators, the feed producers and everyone else involved in the trade who need protection from the jolt of this warranted but unexpected decision by government. The second essential component of this bill is that the export of all livestock to all countries will be prohibited from 1 July 2014. How this will address the animal welfare problems endemic to the industry, for instance the shocking conditions on the long-haul voyage to the Middle East, is self evident. But also important is the way in which it will accommodate the compelling economic argument for ending live animal exports, on account of the way the trade is cannibalising the processed meat industry at the expense of thousands of Australian jobs. The decision to phase out live animal exports to Indonesia by 2014 has virtually been made for us anyway, because the Indonesian government has long planned to achieve beef self-sufficiency by about then. Yes, Jakarta's goal is ambitious and its 2014 goal seems very unlikely to be achieved, but the writing is on the wall for the Australian live animal export industry and it would be foolish of us not to be preparing now for the closure of that significant market. The three year phase-out period stipulated in the bill gives the industry enough time to move from live to processed meat. In that time, for instance, stockholdings could be adjusted and seasonal challenges and fattening arrangements addressed. Three years would also give plenty of time for the abattoirs in Katherine and Innisfail, for instance, to be reopened and the mooted abattoir in Darwin to be up and running. This bill obviously has its opponents and I respect their concerns. But it must be said that ending live animal exports will simply not destroy the Australian beef industry because live exports are only a small part of the overall red meat industry. In fact, while the direct and indirect value of the red meat industry in Australia is $17 billion dollars and employs 55,000 workers, the value of the live export trade is at best only $1 billion and 10,000 workers. Ending live animal exports will not cause famine in Indonesia because Australian meat is simply not on the menu for the vast majority of Indonesians. On average our near neighbours each consume just two kilograms of red meat each year so even the complete removal of Australian beef would make virtually no difference whatsoever to their nutrition, except perhaps for more affluent Indonesians who do tend to eat Australian beef and who have the means to purchase and store boxed Australian meat processed by Australian workers in Australian abattoirs. In other words, the ending of live animal exports to Indonesia alone will not destroy the Indonesia-Australia bilateral relationship. And in any case, the Indonesia-Australia relationship is easily strong enough to survive a genuinely serious jolt, let alone an Australian decision to stop selling Indonesia just one form of one particular foodstuff. Moreover, ending live animal exports, and ritual slaughter in Australia for that matter, has obviously nothing to do with the fringe explanations that have bubbled up in recent weeks-for instance, that it is somehow antiIslamic or anti-Semitic or part of some vegetarian agenda. No, this bill is simply to do with putting safeguards in place as quickly as we humanly can so live animal exports to Indonesia can resume, and then giving the industry the time it needs to transition to reliance on onshore processing. I acknowledge that there is another bill currently before the parliament which would see Australia's live animal export industry wound up immediately. But good policy must get the balance right and be progressed in such a way as to give it the best chance of success. Politics really is, after all, the art of the possible. So there is no point pursuing a policy to immediately end the trade, as popular as doing so would surely be for many Australians, only to have it fail to gain political support and thereby fail to help the tens of thousands of Australian animals already in Indonesia. Nor would there be sense in such a bill actually succeeding if it created too great an immediate jolt for the many people involved in the live animal export trade caught unawares by the Four Corners expose and the government's response. The true measure of the government is what it does next. In this regard, it must urgently put in place the safeguards needed to protect the beasts already in feedlots in Indonesia and those which would follow them once the trade is allowed to resume. Then it must move to wind up an industry which has proven many times to be deeply unsound. This should be a matter of conscience and I appeal to all in this place to follow your heart and support the bill. It already has the support of Animals Australia, the RSPCA and many people involved in the beef industry. The support of the parliament will legislate the safeguards our animals need right now and shut down a trade that is fundamentally broken, systemically cruel and not in Australia's economic interest. Finally, I thank Lyn White from Animals Australia for her courageous work to help the animals and make this world a better place.",169
207,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Is the motion seconded?,171
208,Mr BANDT,BILLS," I second the motion and reserve my right to speak. Mr JOHN COBB (Calare) (20:10): I rise to speak against the Live Animal Export Restriction and Prohibition Bill 2011 in the strongest possible terms. I am disappointed that we have city based Independents and the Greens, so far removed from the reality of live exports, coming up with these bills that will have such an absolutely devastating effect on rural Australia, particularly northern Australia. I read with interest the maiden speech of the member for Denison, thinking that maybe he had strong views on agriculture and animal husbandry and that I may have missed some of his long standing views on this issue, but there was no mention of them in that maiden speech. I understand that there are many issues in politics and that at times it is impossible to get across the breadth of issues. I can say that although I do not have a department or a dozen government advisors, my door is always open to discuss issues, particularly agricultural and rural issues. I believe Mr Wilkie's intentions may be pure, but if that is so and he is going to take a strong position on an issue that has such huge ramifications for all of rural Australia, particularly in northern Australia-not to mention animal husbandry and Indonesia-then he can talk to both sides of the issue. If he did he would realise that farmers and cattle producers across the country are just as, if not more, serious about animal welfare than he is. Everyone was as appalled at the images on Four Corners as he was and we must not provide cattle to those abattoirs, but that is absolutely no reason to stop providing cattle to those that are processing cattle to the required international standard. In fact, some of the abattoirs that have been banned from receiving our cattle are operating at well above world standards. I was over in Indonesia on the weekend with Senator Scullion and it was quickly apparent how-understandably so-totally cheesed off various sections of the Indonesian government and industry were over this government's decision to put a halt on the trade. If I were the minister, I would have been on the first plane, either with or without the foreign minister, to meet with the Indonesian government to say, 'How can we fix this situation together?' No, not in this situation-the government were more worried about the lefties within their party than about the relationship with our closest and most important near neighbour and, in this case, our biggest trading partner. Nor were they worried about the impact on the cattle industry, as they had not considered the ramifications for not only northern Australia but also the whole cattle industry, where we saw the cow market drop $150 in two days. The government needs to let Indonesia know how important a trading partner they are and work with them to deliver a solution, not impose a decision on them. This is diplomacy 101. The member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, understands that, but I am not sure the Prime Minister has the slightest clue about how to manage international relations-she certainly cannot manage internal relations. Getting back to the bill, we have spoken at length on why we need live exports, but the Indonesians have quite an issue here as well. Their villages tend not to have electricity fresh meat is the only thing they know how to use in a lot of situations. Providing cattle only to the abattoirs that are doing the right thing is the best incentive for the other abattoirs to lift their standards to get access to the best available and closest cattle. Indonesia needs beef. We are talking about 25 per cent of Indonesia's consumption of beef being tied up in Australia's live trade to them. You can talk about other nations being involved in whatever happens, but really Australia is the only one providing cattle in any quantity to them. We have foot and mouth issues and Indonesians do not want foot and mouth either-they are not silly. Australia, Indonesia and industry need to get together over there. Talking to them, they want us to fix this together and they have sorted out how to do that. The impact on the domestic industry will be catastrophic. This industry has been developed by Australians and Indonesians over 20 years-actually, it is longer than that. It has become an incredible relationship. Involved are Australian companies, Indonesian companies and companies with an Australian flavour owned by Indonesians. I actually believe that the Indonesian government has behaved far better over this incident than the Australian government has. Let us look at the effect on the Australian industry. The zebu cattle in Northern Australia were not bred for Indonesia; they were bred there because they do well in the north. Back in the days when it was basically British-bred cattle, nobody made money out of it because the cattle died and they were hard to raise. Luckily for Australia, these zebu cattle were wanted by Indonesia and they took them. People say that we should have abattoirs up there to do this and box meat. Apart from the fact that the Indonesians only want a limited amount of boxed beef-in other and words, processed beef-in the past abattoirs have tried it up there and they went broke, from Broome to Innisfail. The presenter of this bill seems to suggest that we are going to move all these cattle down south where they are actually not wanted because they are the wrong type of cattle for southern Australia. They will have to be trucked long distance by road, which I believe they are opposed to as well. Cattle actually travel happily north to Indonesia into the tropics and they come out it very well. Going south, they go into the cold. The animal welfare issues are far more serious for them going south than going north. As the member I am sure is well aware, there are 82 Indigenous cattle properties in Northern Australia with very strong links to this trade-and more power to them. There are 54 in the Territory, 22 in the Kimberley and Pilbara and six in Far North Queensland. That means 700 real Indigenous jobs. I do not know if the member for Denison has sorted out how that is going to be worked out. Good luck to him if he can do it because nobody else will be able to. And there are probably about 70,000 people in station communities involved in this as well. We are not talking about something someone just dreamt up one night. You cannot turn this industry on and off like a tap. This is the only serious industry in the Northern Australia outside of mining. The bill to phase out live exports is no better than the bill to ban live exports because it will see the industry collapse as our customers quickly move to secure other suppliers, leaving our industry in the lurch. And do not think the Indonesians are not looking around at that now-and who could blame them when they are treated like this. This legislation would be an absolute catastrophe for rural Australia. What should be more important for the interest group pushing this agenda is that not in the best interests of animal welfare. This prohibition is driven by an agenda from animal activists who want to shut down livestock production. They actually do not want us to eat meat either. They would have us all eating lentils-a prospect I am sure the majority of Australians would seriously baulk at; I know I would. I hope the member for Denison has learnt from this process and will be a bit more circumspect before listening to these groups in the future. As I said, my door is always open and I think my knowledge on this, without appearing to be superior, is a little better than his. For good animal outcomes, Australia needs to lift the ban because it still needs permits from Indonesia and from Australia before one animal can set foot on a boat. For good animal outcomes, for good Indonesian outcomes and for good Australian outcomes, lift the ban and allow the minister in Indonesia to issue permits. We can still issue permits. You will not do the northern beef industry any favours by putting on a ban which simply means that these cattle have to go somewhere else. The outcome is not the issue; everyone agrees on the way it should happen. Please think about something other than aesthetics, which make people feel good without doing any good for animals.",171
209,Ms BURKE,BILLS," I want to thank the member for Denison for the opportunity to speak on this important issue of live animal exports. Unlike the member for Calare, I do not think it is just a few pressure groups who are pushing this issue. You only need to open your inbox to see that thousands of Australian citizens want something done in respect of this issue. Anyone who watched the footage aired on Four Corners would have been shocked by the treatment of the animals that was shown, but many in the live cattle export industry it is trade should not have been surprised. They have been dealing in this space for a long time. They should have known what was going on and taken action earlier. On 8 June, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig, announced the suspension of the export of livestock to Indonesia. This suspension will be in place until the government and industry establish sufficient safeguards which provide a verifiable and transparent supply chain assured up to and including the point of slaughter for every consignment that leaves Australia. The trade to Indonesia will only recommence when the government is certain the industry is able to comply with the supply chain assurance. This announcement follows the minister's decision on 31 May to suspend the shipment of Australian cattle to the abattoirs identified in the footage provided by Animals Australia and Four Corners. The minister and the Australian government have also undertaken the following actions. The government will appoint an independent reviewer to investigate the complete supply chain for live exports up to and including the point of slaughter. The independent review will still go ahead, but it will now also inform both the design and the application of new safeguards, and it will be conducted by Bill Farmer. The government will implement a moratorium on the installation of the restraint boxes, seen being used in the footage, with Commonwealth government funds. It has asked the Chief Veterinary Officer to coordinate an independent scientific assessment of the restraint boxes used in Indonesia. An initial desktop review has been done and this is currently being followed up by site inspections in Indonesia. Also, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry recently met with his Indonesian counterpart and is discussing the trade at that level. While the government continues to work to recommence live exports with Indonesia, last week it also introduced financial assistance to support those affected by the suspension. This includes a $30 million live export assistance package to support individual primary producers and related businesses and $3 million for employees and small business owners who earn the majority of their income from the live cattle trade to Indonesia. The government also welcomed a $5 million industry contingency fund to address animal welfare needs in the short term, though it was a long time coming. The government is continuing its dialogue with Indonesia and with industry groups. The government shares the legitimate concerns of the Australian community about animal welfare abuses and is taking the necessary action to improve conditions in the livestock export industry. Whilst I welcome the improvements that have been made to the industry, my personal opinion is that I cannot see any legitimate reason for the export of live animals to continue. The cruelty of the trade and the issue of animal welfare are of great concern to me and many in my electorate. Although I acknowledge the growing demand for fresh meat in Indonesia and the Middle East, I can see no reason why Australian abattoirs with Muslim employees cannot provide the best quality halal chilled and frozen meat. According to the Victorian government website BusinessVictoria, under the heading 'Halal Meat': Australia currently exports beef, sheepmeat and goatmeat to over 40 Islamic countries including the Middle East and North Africa, as well as nearby South-East Asian nations. Australia has a reputation as a clean, safe and reliable source of halal food and beverage products, and is recognised as a leader in Halal export. It is estimated that the growing market for Halal products worldwide is worth around $685 billion per annum. Australia expanding its chilled meat market would provide winners all round. It would be a win for Australian farmers, who would maintain a market for their productsindeed, the majority of jobs would not disappear; they would translate into this other area, and more jobs would be produced. It would be a win for abattoir workers, as more jobs would be created to process meat. And obviously it would be a much better outcome for the livestock. Since the 1970s the meatworkers union has opposed live exports on the basis of its destruction of Australian jobs, its inhumane treatment of the animals and the decimation of the meat-processing industry. Last year it again called for live exports to be phased out. Since the 1970s at least 25 export meat works have closed in Australia and more are still closing at the present time. The lack of refrigeration in the Middle East, which is often one issue cited, is no longer an issue. The following quote is from the WSPA website: Australia predominantly exports to wealthy countries in the Gulf, who import a huge amount of refrigerated goods, not just meat. Suggestions that these countries lack of such basic are not only misguided, they are culturally insensitive. While this is not the case across the board in Indonesia, there are other ways to deal with it. Today I received a letter from someone in the Northern Territory and I would like to read it. It said: Thank you for supporting the ban on live export. I am a local resident of Darwin and my family have been involved in the pastoral industry for over 130 years, although we now live in town. The letter goes on to say that we need to move from cattle to meat. (Time expired)",173
210,Ms LEY,BILLS," Animal Export Restriction and Prohibition Bill 2011 calls for a ban on the export of livestock for slaughter from 2014. The coalition does not support any measure which proposes to permanently limit or end Australia's live animal trade. We stand behind our agricultural enterprises, our farming families and the contractors and workers who depend upon them. We recognise that live sheep and cattle exports, properly managed, are an important part of the global food task. We urge the government to do everything in its power to restart the live cattle export trade to facilities that can demonstrate humane killing methods. When the government blundered in and cancelled 100 per cent of the trade last month, it overlooked the fact that up to 45 per cent already goes to abattoirs that meet the same standards that we demand in Australia. Where was the leadership from this Prime Minister? She should sack her agriculture minister. He has presided over this wretched situation and everything he has done has made it worse. Urgent high-level talks with Indonesia are needed now, not when the Minister for Foreign Affairs has finished gallivanting around Equatorial appliances Guinea, Budapest and Burma. Having been a farmer it broke my heart to see footage of the mistreatment of cattle in some Indonesian abattoirs. There is no excuse for this shameful behaviour. If any person, organisation, industry or government body knew of it and yet did nothing, they would stand condemned, no less by the opposition than by the supporters of this bill. But it breaks my heart, too, to see the effect of the current knee-jerk cancellation of the trade on the communities of Northern Australia, all of which are now being indiscriminately punished and are in turmoil. The Live An industry that supports farmers, roadhouses, stockmen, truckies, mustering pilots-of which I was one-and countless other family businesses has been crippled by the inept, confused and bungled response of this government. You could not have written a black comedy script containing the farrago of stupidity that we are witnessing from the Prime Minister's 'Team Australia'. Today in question time the PM captured what she said were the various views in this debate, including that people should not eat animals for food at all. I know that is ectly valid moral standpoint, but it should not inform the development of agriculture policy in this country. The problem is that, under the new partnership between Labor and the Greens, that is exactly what is happening. A $320 million industry is on its knees, livelihoods are being lost, cattle are stranded in holding yards with feed running out, one of our nearest neighbours has been insulted and humiliated, and now there is little prospect of the trade being restarted anytime soon. The Prime Minister and her front-bench do not understand that the economy, the life, the identity and the character of this nation are neither developed in nor confined to the inner suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. Is there not one government minister who has lived a life in rural and regional Australia, who has risked a dollar of their own money in a small business or who can imagine what it is like to cart cattle down a dusty gravel road worrying about your truck repayments, to build your own mustering business in a remote outback town miles from your family, or to be a young Indigenous person, desperate for a start, learning to ride a horse so that you can work on a cattle station? The Gillard government seems entirely untroubled by the real world. The price effect on the southern Australian beef market is just starting to be felt. I have heard of cattle from Alice Springs being trucked to Warrnambool. Elsewhere confidence in the industry and its future is sliding. But for most northern cattle there simply is no market. They will have to be shot where they stand-and where is the humanity in that? Indonesia could decide to source cattle from South America or India, where there may be foot-and-mouth disease and where there is much less emphasis on animal welfare. It is a perfnot too late to work closely with the Indonesians to achieve a win-win result. Central to the system will be livestock identification, whereby we can track our animals through a closed loop supply chain and prove that they are transported, handled and slaughtered humanely. At least one of our existing businesses was already doing this but was indiscriminately shut down by the Gillard government. There could be no better demonstration of the faith and the confidence that this parliament has in the people of our northern pastoral industry than a vote against this bill. I urge all members to oppose the bill.",175
211,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Live Animal Export (Slaughter) Prohibition Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed.,176
212,Mr BANDT,BILLS, I move: That this bill be read a second time.,176
213,Mr BANDT,BILLS,"It is barely two weeks since I introduced this bill into the House. Government and industry media announcements during these two short weeks have made it clear that Australia is not in the position of being able to provide any reasonable oversight and supervision of the welfare of cattle sent to Indonesia, and indeed to other countries, in any reasonable period of time. Not even Meat and Livestock Australia, spinning as hard as they can, are willing to make the claim that we can resume an animal export industry in the near future with animal welfare standards at a level acceptable to Australians. They cannot make that claim, because Australians, who have now been exposed to the extent of the systemic abuse and absence of sufficient oversight of animal welfare , understand that these problems are not minor and will not just be solved in the space of a few weekswhich, incidentally, is the government's naive timeline for resuming the trade to Indonesia. The fact is that this industry has never been and will never be ethically viable, and there are far too many years of systemic abuse behind it to argue otherwise. Recent announcements in the media by the government and industry will not amount to solutions: the truth is that, to the likes of Meat and Livestock Australia, animal welfare issues are predominately a matter of perception management rather than matters to invest resources in. The last thing we need is yet another quick fix where the perception of action is prioritised higher than actual investment in raising animal welfare standards. The bottom line is that the industry will, as any does, fight to remain profitable, and it will do so despite the associated ethically indefensible consequences. Just as thousands of constituents and citizens across the country have requested of me in recent weeks, including many graziers, it is time for parliamentarians to put an end to this cruelty. Thousands of cattle, sheep and goats in overseas feedlots, storage yards and slaughterhouses are being abused tonight out of sight of the Australian public. Millions will be exported and mistreated over the next three years alone. It is time for the government to step in and say enough is enough. Minister Ludwig must start listening to the Australian public, who want strong protections against cruelty. Only the Greens' bill will deliver that strong action and provide for an immediate and complete ban on live animal exports for slaughter. I listened earlier this evening to the member for Calare speaking about the tropical climes that animals enjoy on their trips up to Indonesia. I listened for a good nine minutes before I heard the phrase 'animal welfare' mentioned. I stand to be corrected on that by the Hansard but it is clear from those who oppose taking measures that animal welfare is not their No. 1 priority. As anyone who has been associated with the industry would know, live animal exports are shiploads of misery. Mr Haase interjecting",176
214,Mr BANDT,BILLS,"This is something that we Greens have known for a while, and that is why it has been our long standing policy that we took to the election. I pay tribute to those many campaigners around the country who over many years have worked tirelessly. The recent exposes were not something that happened overnight. I pay particular tribute to the RSPCA and Animals Australia and Lyn White. There is an alternative. As I have advocated for in this place previously, the government can easily commit to improving and increasing the process of slaughter in Australia to support local producers and jobs. The community benefits of processing meat in Australia have been underestimated for too long and are being talked down by the live export industry. No doubt the member for Durack, who has been interjecting, will again reiterate the industry talking points, but those who oppose measures and those who want to continue this ethically unsustainable trade need to explain why they are against jobs. A 2010 report commissioned by Australia's leading processors found that live cattle exports compete with and undermine Australia's domestic beef industry, leading lost processing opportunities here. The domestic animal welfare standards here are anything but perfect, but they are an improvement on what will always be uncontrollable international standards. And so I call on the government, particularly those among its backbench members who have done good work in advancing the argument that an ethically viable live export industry is a fictional concept, to join the Greens' long standing call for the cessation the live export industry. I implore members to act ethically and support the immediate cessation of live exports for slaughter, and commend the bill to the House.",177
215,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Is the motion seconded?,178
216,Mr WILKIE,BILLS, I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,178
217,Mr HAASE,BILLS," What a wonderful opportunity it is to bring back a sense of rationality to this House. This proposition, put to us by the member for Melbourne, would have us believe that all animals bred for food production should somehow be kept alive because Australians will be appalled to know that they are slaughtered before they are eaten. There is much ill-informed nonsense being spruiked by this member that it is difficult to contain one's incredulity. There is simply no basis for the statements he makes, unless one concedes that we should not eat animals. If that is the argument, why doesn't the member come to this place and declare that he is vegan and wants all Australians to be vegan and for there not to be a livestock production industry. There is no way that one can espouse a point of view in this House that says that we should breed animals for slaughter but that they should not be slaughtered. What this member does not realise is that the majority to of viewing Australians, were they to sight videos of abattoirs in Australia, would be horrified. They did not realise that meat did not come from a packaging factory called Coles and Woolworths. They thought that it was somehow mysteriously presented to their refrigerator without it ever having been alive. They were suddenly reminded five weeks ago that those things that we eat were once alive. It came as a great shock. Can I bring a great shock to the member of for Melbourne? There are whole families, whole communities and whole industries around the world dependent upon live animal I exports from Australia. If we are going to be part of livestock production, we first need to face up to the fact that those animals are being produced as a food source for Australians and for the world. To suggest that the actions of the likes of the RSPCA, Animals Australia, Pew, PETA and other high-flying organisations, whose institutions depend on donations from the public, are not self-interested in receiving those donations to maximise their executive salaries is to be blind to reality. I am talking about hard-working Australians, who have created their so livelihoods in inhospitable circumstances to develop an industry, paying an umbrella group to develop a marketing system with our nearest relation, Indonesia, over a period of 15 years or more to the point where Australian northern pastoral regions now have a purpose. They can breed Bos indicus cattle well, which are not suited to southern climes. Bos taurus are not suited to export to Indonesia, quite frankly, because they do not sweat. We now have a purpose for those pastoral lands. There is no other purpose as they are not able to be cleared for agriculture. The only thing that can be done is the raising of Bos indicus cattle for export. If we cannot do that, on the basis that those cattle are going to be killed for consumption, for that reason alone it is just an absolute nonsense. It is the sort of stuff you would expect from wet-behind-the-ears schoolboys. If we are going to come into this House and have the livelihood of thousands of Australians and the economy affected by the loss of billions of dollars because of some fanciful minority group having sway in this place, then it is a sad day for democracy. Australians, and hard working Australians especially in my patch of Durack, deserve better treatment than that. Until such time as this government realises what they have done most recently to attempt to destroy this industry permanently and the Prime Minister, in league with Kevin Rudd if necessary, goes to Indonesia with cap in hand, tugs the forelock and says, 'We are sorry we insulted your nation internationally,' and gives a genuine apology, we will not see the recommencement of this industry, and we will continue to see real hard working Australians suffer unnecessarily.",178
218,Mr ZAPPIA,BILLS," The depth of community outrage over the cruel treatment of cattle in Indonesian abattoirs exposed on the Four Corners program on 30 May cannot be overstated. MPs have been flooded with letters, phone calls and emails. As well, hundreds of thousands of people have to date signed petitions or written to newspapers and other media outlets. In my own electorate residents of the Tea Tree Gardens Retirement Village, in a spontaneous response to the film footage, organised their own petition calling for a stop to the cruelty and asked me to present to this parliament. The petition was signed by 76 residents of the retirement village and would have been signed by more if there had been more time. These are decent, responsible adults with considerable life experience who were not prepared to turn a blind eye to what they saw or to remain indifferent. The petition does not meet the relevant requirements of the House for petitions so I seek leave to table a copy of the document. Leave granted.",179
219,Mr ZAPPIA,BILLS,"I thank the House. The government made the correct decision in suspending the live cattle exports to Indonesia until we can be assured that cattle sent to Indonesia will not be treated cruelly and that a reliable tracking system is in place. I also welcome the decision by the minister to have an independent investigation into the Australian live animal export trade. It was the right thing to do; it was the responsible thing to do. Not surprisingly, the coalition and some within the industry have said the government has overreacted. Others have said that the government has not gone far enough. That suggests to me that the government has got it about right. The government has responsibility for all Australians, including the cattle growers, rural communities, transport operators and other livestock associated industries. Our concern for animal welfare should not be confined solely to Australian-grown animals. It should be for all animals-homegrown or otherwise. It should therefore be our objective to change bad practices wherever they occur. It we do not, animals will continue to suffer because it is not only Australian livestock that is killed in Indonesia and in other markets of concern. It is also clear that Meat and Livestock Australia and LiveCorp both have a major responsibility relating to this issue. They it both have much to answer for and need to be held to account. It was a failure to ensure the cattle's welfare by both the MLA and LiveCorp that led to the government's intervention. It is now up to the Australian and Indonesian governments and the industry sectors in both countries to resolve the deadlock. Both Australian and Indonesian livelihoods are at stake and families will suffer if the industry is immediately shut down. Indonesia is a developing country. Providing food and employment opportunities in Indonesia is important for that country, but no jobs in Australia or in Indonesia justify continuing to allow the cruelty we saw on the Four Corners program. I want to quote my colleague the member for Wills, who is here in the chamber tonight, in what he said when he spoke on this matter on 20 June: We should not seek to make a profit on the back of the torture, misery and suffering of powerless animals. I think that quote sums it up perfectly. The priority, however, should be to resolve the immediate issues related to the Indonesian live cattle trade. The issues can be resolved without any party being adversely affected. It can be a win-win for all parties. Stunning cattle is possible and already occurs at some abattoirs in Indonesia. It is the standard in Australia and should be the standard elsewhere. Tracking Australian cattle once exported is also possible. It was a coalition government that suspended that practice. In fact, I understand that tracking cattle was introduced by the coalition in around 2003 or 2004 and that it was in direct response to the current trade that they suspended that practice. Had tracking been in place it is very likely that cattle exports could have resumed to those abattoirs in Indonesia that currently carry out the stunning practice. I understand that there are several abattoirs in Indonesia that do that and that there are several abattoirs in Indonesia that would be ready to go if they had the clearance to receive the cattle. The issue is that exporting the cattle from Australia to Indonesia does not guarantee which abattoirs they will end up in until we have the tracking system in place. The viability of establishing additional abattoirs in Northern Australia should also be assessed. I have heard people reject that but it should also be assessed, as should assisting Indonesia to establish additional commercial refrigeration facilities. (Time expired)",179
220,Mr COULTON,BILLS," I rise tonight to speak on the bill introduced by the member for Melbourne. I cannot believe that we are actually debating this bill. I could understand when it was first introduced by the member but times have changed. Surely in the last few weeks we have seen the folly of this legislation and the effect it has had on the cattle industry in Northern Australia. I would like to say once again that I cannot believe that, in this place, everyone wants to go on a crusade with someone else's livelihood. I would just like the member for Melbourne or the member for Makin or the member for Wills to introduce a motion or a bill in this House that, for once, will have some effect on the livelihoods of the people that they represent. I do not think we are going to see that any time soon. Mr Kelvin Thomson: You should have seen the tariff cuts in the 1980s, and the cuts to the clothing, footwear and textiles in my electorate.",180
221,Mr COULTON,BILLS,"This is my 10c here, member for Wills. The member for Makin said that this is some sort of win-win situation. We are way past ever having a win-win situation on this. We are way past not having some sort of permanent effect. The truth of the matter is that the cattle that are leaving Australia now will not be killed for three months. That is ample time to sort out the issue with where they will be killed at the other end. These are store cattle that a limited window in which to be mustered, put on a boat and sent to Indonesia. A short break is not possible; the whole season has gone. Those cattle will not be suitable next year, so where are they going to go? Where are they going to end up? This is an intolerable situation. I am not justifying cruelty to animals. What we saw on Four Corners was horrific, but I want to know why Four Corners did not go to the larger abattoirs that are processing a large percentage of the cattle that are in Indonesia at the moment. Why did they not show footage of what is being done there on a humane basis? Why did they not put the other side of the story, that there are companies now that have traceability, have full control in the feedlots and have full control in the abattoirs and have cattle going there? The initial response from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, was appropriate to ban trade with the abattoirs that were not up to scratch.",180
222,Unknown,BILLS,Opposition members interjecting,181
223,Mr COULTON,BILLS,"Exactly. The member for Makin touched on it: they were spooked by the emails. I got hundreds of emails. I do not know whether the member for Makin read his but mine were all remarkably similar. As a matter of fact I think that most of my emails were written by two people, and I think that they came through at three o'clock or four o'clock in the morning. I am yet to do some research but I would suspect that a lot of them were generated from a central base. Are we going to run this country by mass emails from fringe political groups or are we going to look at people's livelihoods, what is good for the national economy and what is good for the cattle industry of Northern Australia? Are we going to look at what is have good for the Aboriginal communities of Northern Australia that have finally got some way of having a respectable job that they can take some pride in and that they are doing well, a job that has been cut out from under them? I cannot believe that on this day, after all this time, we are still debating this motion. I would have thought the honourable thing for the member for Melbourne to do would have been to withdraw this motion when he saw what devastation had been created because of the ill-conceived and ill timed way the situation was handled. Did anyone from the government go to Indonesia and speak to the government there? Is this how we govern the country? We see a TV show and then we make an announcement! What happened to international diplomacy? Why couldn't the world's greatest Minister for Foreign Affairs have gone to Indonesia, spoken to his counterpart and tried to sort this matter out? The Indonesians have been slighted by this and we are going to see a kickback not only in the cattle trade but in other trades that we do with their country. This issue might be burning hot in the retirement homes of the electorate of the member for Makin, but I can tell you that it is burning red hot in the electorate of Parkes. People cannot believe that a government could be so incompetent. I have to say that I do not believe that it is all members of the government. I believe that this side of the House has been hijacked by the loopy left.",181
224,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Auditor-General Amendment Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,181
225,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the member for Lyne seeking leave?,182
226,Mr Oakeshott,BILLS,I am seeking leave to speak without closing the debate.,182
227,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Is leave granted? Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: I did not say leave was granted. It would have been courteous if the member had,182
228,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"Can the member for Mackellar refrain from commenting. Leave is being sought by the member for Lyne to speak without closing the debate. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: I must say to the chamber that I did try to contact Mr Oakeshott, the member, earlier this evening. I would have thought if he had wanted to speak for a second time it would have been courteous of him to return that call and to let me know. I find it extraordinary that, at this stage, I am being asked to give leave for the right to speak for a second time.",182
229,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"Can I seek an indication from the member for Mackellar whether leave is granted or not to progress the issue. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to know on what basis the leave is being sought before I grant leave.",182
230,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"We will hold for a moment and seek clarification. I indicate to the House that there is no debate on the granting of leave, so I will indication from the member for Mackellar as to whether leave is granted or not. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: Madam Deputy Speaker, I would ask you to ask the member who is seeking leave for what period of time he wishes to speak and the purpose for which he wishes to speak, and then I will make a decision about leave being granted.",182
231,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,I indicate to the member for Mackellar that it is not usual to seek a debate or explanationMrs Bronwyn Bishop: None of this is usual.,182
232,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"I appreciate that, but the member has sought leave and I am seeking an indication from you as to whether leave is granted for the member to speak for a second time without closing the debate. I indicated that I am not going to allow a debate on the issue. The normal process is that leave is sought. The polite arrangements behind that are a matter for members of the House. I am, as the chair, merely seeking advice as to whether leave is granted for the member to speak a second time without closing the debate. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: As I understand it, there are only two speaking spots of 10 minutes each and then two of five minutes each. If leave were granted then that 10minute spot would be lost, and I am not prepared to give that up. Perhaps you could tell me otherwise, if that is not the case.",182
233,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"The understanding of the chair is that the time allotted for the debate is 40 minutes. There are two speakers of 10 minutes each and all other members of five minutes each, which would allow for two 10-minute and four five-minute speakers in the allotted time, if we get underway before we run out of time. Does the member for Mackellar have a just seek an decision for the House? Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: Perhaps I will speak now and take my 10 minutes. No doubt the member from the government benches wants to take 10 minutes, but if he wants to give up his 10 for five then we can look at the question of leave for that spot.",182
234,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"So leave is not granted. The member for Mackellar has the call. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (20:55): Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is an important issue that the member for Lyne has raised. It arises from an Auditor-General's report by the Joint Standing Committee on Public Accounts and Audit, of which the member for Lyne is the chairman. He has made some pretty significant recommendations, which are contained in this private member's bill. I must say I do have some sympathy with many of the issues that he has raised, which is exactly why I called the member earlier in the day to speak with him about being sympathetic to the issues that he has raised. For instance, I think there is a very good case to be made out about a clearer ability for the Auditor General to audit GBEs, government business enterprises, and, equally, the ability to trace Commonwealth government funds which are given to state, territory and local government. There is a need to be able to pursue an audit trail. I am very sympathetic to that. I am also very sympathetic to the case being made out for government controlled companies to be audited. Well I remember when I was first in this place that, as a member of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, I would have very much liked to have audited the Parliament House Construction Authority, which built the building in which we stand and sit today. But, because the government of the day would not agree to it, the Auditor-General had no power himself to do an audit of the authority. The argument was that it was a government controlled company and the definition of that was that, if the government appointed a majority of directors to that company, it would be a controlled company and the Auditor-General could not of his own volition audit that company. I am pleased to see that this is finally being overturned. It was something that I advocated all those years ago when I was in the Senate and it is something that I advocate now. Another good measure in the proposed bill is for an audit of indicators, which the Auditor-General himself has recommended. Performance indicators should be part of the audit process. The bill says that an annual sample of audits should be conducted of performance indicators, but nowhere in the bill does it say what a 'sample' means and nor does it say precisely what is meant by 'performance indicators', as they vary considerably across the realm of government. The Auditor-General, in his submission to the public accounts committee did lay out some indicators of what he thought they should be, and I quote from the report: 'It is thought that the performance indicator should be a mix of quantitative and qualitative measures incorporating a range of best practice characteristics and be cost effective to collect, analyse and report against.' The Auditor-General was quite specific about what he thought was the best way to go about it, but I note that that is not really reflected in the bill. No doubt that could be remedied in future times. The member for Goldstein in his second reading speech said that the opposition would oppose the bill because it proposed that the Auditor General should have the right to audit private sector companies which contract with the Commonwealth. I believe that is far too intrusive into the private sector. The purpose of a public sector audit and the purpose of a private sector audit are entirely separate purposes. I have long fought in this place to always retain the Auditor-General being the Auditor-General for GBEs and publicly controlled companies because I believe that the purpose of the Auditor-General in both financial audits and performance audits is to ensure that the money which is compulsorily taken from the taxpayer by way of taxation measures is properly spent. In the private sector an auditor has a dual role to make sure that money is properly spent but also to give advice to that enterprise or individual about how they conduct their business and can do better. It is an entirely separate function and to allow the Auditor-General, which has a very specific purpose to carry out, to be intrusive into the private sector is quite unacceptable. It would lead to enormous burdens being placed upon the private sector entity, be it an individual or a firm, and would discourage people from competing for government work. Where waste is concerned-and I presume that a lot of these auditing provisions are meant to be put in place to prevent waste occurring-a better way is the one the opposition is putting forward. That is to try and see that we can prevent waste in the first place. We should put in place effective measures that could eliminate waste before it is incurred rather than just reported upon after it has occurred, as would come to light via the Auditor-General's report. I cannot state strongly enough that the idea that the Auditor-General should be given permission to audit the private sector contractor is enough to put this bill totally risk. I foreshadow that, when we get to consideration in detail, we will move certain amendments which would remove private sector contractors from the ambit of the bill. It would mean that all the good parts that are there would continue to be in place but the part that would allow incursion into the private sector would be taken out of the bill. We believe that is a far better outcome for people wishing to contract with the Commonwealth and it would avert additional increase of costs and red tape and bureaucracy which is never a good thing for the prosperity of the private sector. The coalition's policy to create an office of due diligence, which would avoid waste in the first place, is a far better way to go. It would put in place mechanisms which would allow far better contracting arrangements to be entered into. I note from the inquiry that the public accounts committee held that there were particular concerns about the DMO in Defence. I think that the office of due diligence would have a great role to play in that contracting situation. But I certainly do not think that anybody's interests would be enhanced by allowing the Auditor-General to intrude into the area of the private sector. For those reasons, I say to the mover of this private member's bill, the member for Lyne, that I think there is much in the bill that is to be commended. Some of the things that you have included are things that I personally have been fighting for over a long time and that I would be very pleased to see in place. I do have great confidence in the work of the Auditor-General and the task that he carries out in the public sector, but I reiterate I do not believe there is any place for the Auditor-General to be intruding into the private sector. In foreshadowing those amendments in consideration in detail, I say to the member at for Lyne that should he choose to accept our amendments or should they be carried-that is, to delete the private sector from the billwe would be prepared to support the remainder of the bill. That was the purpose of the call that I placed to him today to have discussions with him. As we probably will not reach consideration in detail tonight, there is probably going to be an opportunity to have some further discussions. I look forward to those because I think perhaps if he reflects upon it and reads his own report in the light of those comments, he may feel that would be a good way to go. It would be a shame not to support the bill because it has that impediment. (Time expired)",183
235,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," Auditor-General Amendment Bill 2011 before the House this evening implements a number of recommendations in the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit inquiry into the Auditor-General Act 1997. I will go through the recommendations of the report that would be implemented in further detail. I want to make a couple of broad points about the role of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General has played a valuable role in Australian politics, most memorably in recent times in uncovering the regional rorts scandal put in place under the Howard government. As those with long memories would be aware, this was one of the most insidious forms of pork-barrelling that occurred under the Howard governmentthe notion that, rather than allocating essential infrastructure based on the need of the local community and on strict cost benefit criteria, you would instead make those decisions based on electorates. I did a little academic work on this while I was at the Australian National University, looking at the allocation of a number of funding programs under the Howard governmentthe Roads to Recovery Program, the Regional Partnerships Program and the Sustainable Regions Program. Under each of those programs you could see clear evidence of partisan bias and clear evidence that a substantial increase in funding was going to electorates then held by the coalition. That an allocation that is not an appropriate use public money and that does not ensure that the Australian taxpayer gets the best value for money. I am pleased at the role that the Auditor-General played in uncovering that. I have to say that I am a little concerned about the lack of courtesy shown in the debate this evening to the member for Lyne. I will go short on my speech to ensure to the greatest extent possible that he is able to The speak in this debate. But I think it would have been appropriate had he been able to commence this debate. On the suggestion by the member for Mackellar that somehow this could all be resolved if only the member for Lyne would read his own report, I just do not know what to say about statements like that. The functions performed by the Auditor General continue to be a matter of great significance. It is critical that the Auditor General has the appropriate powers to respond to new audit challenges that arise. The amendments are going to implement the recommendations of the report, as I noted above. One of the important changes that flows from the implementation of the committee's recommendations will be the Auditor-General having the power to 'follow the money'. That is, the Auditor-General will be able to undertake audits of Commonwealth partners-private sector and state and territory entities-that receive Australian government funds to implement a government program. That ensures that the Auditor-General's powers keep up with the way in which modern government operates. At the moment, the Auditor-General is unable to assess the extent to which individuals or entities that receive Australian government funds achieve the purpose for which those funds were provided. An amendment implements the change to that. The bill as amended contains appropriate restrictions on the extent of those powers, is and the government anticipates that those of powers would be used only sparingly. For example, the Auditor-General would be able to assess the operations of the state or territory entity only after a request by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit or the responsible minister and only to the extent that they relate to achieving the purpose for which the funds were provided. It ensures that the Auditor-General has the tools to respond to today's auditing challenges. There are a number of minor amendments-for example, providing clear authority for the Auditor-General to undertake assurance reviews and audits of performance indicators, which are currently carried out as audits by agreement under section 20 of the act. The bill, if passed, will clarify the Auditor-General's powers to require the production of documents that are the subject of legal professional privilege. I will conclude my statements there so as to allow further opportunity for others to participate in the debate this evening. Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (21:10): I rise to speak on the Auditor-General Amendment Bill 2011 and to support the amendments that were discussed earlier by the member for Mackellar. But I also want to take this opportunity to once again call on the member for Lyne in his capacity as the Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, the author of this bill and a regional member with considerable influence over this faltering government to show his support for an ANAO investigation into the Australian Rail Track Corporation's involvement in the rail track replacement work between Melbourne and Albury. This bill effectively seeks to provide greater power to the Auditor-General to conduct audits into government agencies, government business enterprises and government controlled companies. If the member for Lyne really believes in scrutiny of government, if he believes that the Auditor General should have the discretion to conduct investigations of GBEs like the ARTC, he will support my call for a full and frank audit of the Melbourne to Albury rail project, a project that will be yet another addition to Labor's long list of failures. believes that country Australians deserve access to a safe and reliable public transport system then he will support my call. The member for Lyne has a large degree of influence over this government, as we have seen and as I am sure he would like to admit, particularly to his constituents. I would suggest that this is the perfect opportunity to put that influence to good use for the sake of services to a significant rural and regional community. The minister responsible for this project, the member for Grayndler, promised full transparency when he came to office, yet we know that the ARTC has already conducted an investigation into the state of the rail track between Melbourne and Albury and that the results of this investigation have not seen the light of day and have in fact been hidden-another failed project and another broken promise. There are elements of this bill which I do support and believe should be commended. Giving the ANAO more power and autonomy to conduct investigations into government business enterprises such as the ARTC is of course something that I fully support. But I would urge the member for Lyne, regardless of the outcome on this bill, to use his influence on this committee to push for an audit into the ARTC. I would also urge members opposite who believe in government transparency to agree to this audit. There are other aspects of this bill which the coalition does not support. This bill would extend somewhat intrusive powers to the ANAO which would subject independent contractors to audits if they received government contracts. This would effectively apply another layer of bureaucracy and increased costs and regulatory burden to private industry. It would be a significant disincentive for small businesses to tender If he for government contracts and I believe would be an unintended negative consequence of this bill. I say 'unintended' I do not think the intention is to further small businesses who are already suffering under significant regulation and increased costs, with some barely making a profit at all. The amendments moved by the coalition would remove these intrusive powers that would hurt small contractors, while extending those extra powers to investigate government agencies, government-controlled companies and government business enterprises. I look forward to support for these amendments and I especially look forward to the member for Lyne's support for my call for an audit into the ARTC's involvement in the Melbourne to Albury rail freight.",185
236,Ms ONEILL,BILLS," I rise tonight to speak to report 419: Inquiry into the Auditor-General Act 1997. This report was completed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in this 43rd parliament, chaired by Rob Oakeshott, the member for Lyne, but is in fact the conclusion of work undertaken by the committee of the same name in the 42nd parliament, which was chaired by Sharon Grierson, the member for Newcastle. I am a little alarmed that it seems this evening that because of developments prior to my entering the chamber the member for Mackellar has denied the chair of the committee, the member for Lyne, a chance to put on the record some of his important and, I would say, very informative observations about this report. However, it is important that we do acknowledge that the committee continues to do excellent work and the committee members are working very hard to ensure that the joint parliamentary committee undertakes its work with diligence. I acknowledge the committee members of each parliament and applaud the excellent work of the committee secretariat- Mr because Russell Chafer, Dr Kris Veenstra, Ms harm Pauline Cullen, Dr Narelle MCGlusky and Dr Ian MCDonald-for their work on the committee and in particular, for this excellent report. This in fact could be called the 'follow the money bill' because that is what it is really all about. There are so many terms that are bandied about in this chamber and I know that people out there who are listening are trying to figure out what on earth is actually going on. The reality is that, as the member for Fraser has spoken of earlier, there has been rorting, particularly under the Howard government. The Auditor-General was unable with the powers that he had at that time to follow the money and to see what was going on. The functions performed by the Auditor-General are of great significance. They matter to this parliament and they matter to the Australian people. It is important that the Auditor-General has the appropriate powers to respond to the audit challenges of this day. As I said, this is about his capacity to follow the money-the money being that which Australian taxpayers invest with this government and expect us to be able to spend in the most effective and efficient way. I hear from the member for Mackellar on the other side that she wants to protect the private sector from intrusion. If the private sector is the beneficiary of public money, we want to know if we are getting value for our dollar and, essentially, that is what this report is about. This is what we want to enable. The intent of the Auditor-General Amendment Bill 2011 is clearly to implement the various recommendations of the report. These are quite significant. One of the concerns I have is that the Auditor-General Act currently provides that government business enterprises can only be audited by the Auditor-General at the request of the committee-the JCPAA, or the minister responsible for the government business enterprise, or the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. The report recommends that the act needs to be amended to give the Auditor-General the authority that he needs to initiate audits of government business enterprises. Successive governments have taken the view that he should not have that authority but it is clear from what we have seen from the committee that it is time that the Auditor-General was given those capacities. I am going to cut my speech rather short to allow a little time for the member for Lyne to sum up at the end this debate. I commend him once again for his leadership of that committee, which is undertaking some heavy lifting, and I look forward to hearing his words on this bill. I commend the bill, as amended, to the House.",187
237,Mr BUCHHOLZ,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Auditor-General Amendment Bill 2011 to amend the Auditor General Act 1997. The coalition's main concern is that independent contractors will be subject to auditors from the Auditor General if they receive government contracts. This would create an extra layer of bureaucracy and increase costs and convince many smaller contractors not to bid for contracts due to extra regulatory requirements. The coalition therefore proposes that the private member's bill be amended to remove the provision that contractors could be audited. The coalition's policy is to create office of due diligence to avoid the waste in the first place rather than report on it after the event. While the coalition may support the intent of this legislation, it recommends that we oppose the bill for the following reasons: firstly, the increase in regulatory burden. The bill would require any supplier to a government agency to be prepared to undergo a full investigation by the Auditor General at any time. This would place added costs and compliance burdens on business and, being a small business owner myself before coming to this place, I am very in tune with the amount of compliance that is already in place for small businesses of up to 100 staff. Secondly, the bill would bring yet more government intervention. Under Labor we have seen the greatest growth of government in living memory. If supported, this bill would further increase that burden on any business doing its work with government. I also draw attention to the increase in bureaucracy since this Labor government came to power. Since 2007 we have seen an increase of more than 22,000 staff in the Public Service here in Canberra alone. The bill also creates an impediment for doing business with government. With this level of scrutiny and intrusion, many businesses-especially smalland mediumsized businesses-may choose not to do business with a government agency. Therefore, under these circumstances only the biggest companies with the resources available to them would be prepared to comply with an Auditor-General's investigation or might be willing to tender for contracts. Thirdly, it would lead to greater costs for government services. For a bill that purports to be protecting taxpayers and ensuring value for money, there is no doubt that the level of an compliance required creates the very real possibility that tender prices will have to increase to cover the potential audit requirements. Fourthly, it chases the waste of taxpayers' money after that event. Instead of putting better prevention systems in place to reduce the likelihood of waste, this bill seeks to enhance the powers of the Auditor-General to investigate after the horse has bolted. I now turn to the establishment of a due diligence office. Under the coalition, every new major government spending program will, before it commences, be properly assessed for its capacity for waste, abuse and mismanagement. We want to pre-empt problems not mop them up afterwards. Central to our strong approach on stopping the waste will be the establishment of an office of due diligence within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The office of due diligence will comprise officials seconded from the Australian National Audit Office and the Commonwealth Ombudsman as well as people with private sector contract expertise. The role of the office of due diligence will be to examine programs before they are approved by cabinet to ensure that each project is efficiently designed, has a detailed implementation plan and will be implemented in a manner that provides maximum value for the taxpayer. We have great confidence in the Auditor General. However, we do have concerns with his role in assessing private contractors. An earlier speaker raised the issue of the consultative committees and made the point that there was a bias towards coalition seats. I was involved in a community which was a recipient of federal government grants that came through the area consultative committee. I can assure this room that, from a regional perspective, it is one of the few places for regional Australia to get support. The member raising the point is a strong advocate of regional Australia, but I can assure you that it was one of the few areas where we could actually get some support. Value for money was also mentioned. I think that the government is potentially being hypocritical when it talks about value for money-we only have to look as far as the NBN, or possibly the BER, for situations which are rather embarrassing to this House.",188
238,Mr OAKESHOTT,BILLS," I certainly appreciate the opportunity of speaking and wrapping up the debate this evening on the Auditor-General Amendment Bill 2011. This bill has been before the House for the last month or so. It was introduced, as has been correctly mentioned by others, on the back of the Joint Public Accounts and Audit Committee report 419work done primarily by the previous Public Accounts and Audit Committee, chaired by Sharon Grierson. This bill takes the unanimous recommendations from that 42nd Parliament committee and is hopefully turning it into a real outcome. It is somewhat surprising, therefore, as we go from a committee process where agreement has been reached by all parties and into the legislative process, that we see amendments to this legislation coming from both sides. Whilst I certainly accept many of the amendments coming through from government relating to drafting issues, there is one government amendment that does deserve a mention. That amendment is the one making changes to arrangements for area GBEs and trying to put in place a process involving approval by the Joint Public Accounts and Audit Committee before allowing the Auditor-General to do an audit of those semi-statutory bodies. That is not my preference. It was not the preference of report 419 or of the unanimous committee recommendation. However, I guess you have to make some compromises to negotiate legislation through the parliament and that is one that I, reluctantly, will have to make to see passage of this legislation. In regard to opposition amendments, to try to remove the Auditor-General's contact with private contractors is, in my view, a step too far. To some degree, I have to say, it is patronising to business to imply that business people will only do business with government if they are not open to audit. What is really being said by that carries, I think, an implication that is unfair to business people and businesses generally within Australia. The only requirement and the only regulation you would have if you were doing business with government is that you would be open to audit. If you are doing the right thing with taxpayers' money, you have absolutely no problems. Several speakers in this debate, including the previous one, have suggested that the complaints about the BER are examples of government waste. For the opposition to then be willing to oppose this bill is oxymoronic. The very point of this bill is to allow the Auditor-General to investigate waste within programs such as the BER, as was mentioned by the previous speaker. You cannot have it both ways. If you do want to follow the money trail and if you do want to demonstrate that there is waste in government and if you do want to hold government to account and if you do want transparency, here is your moment. This is the bill. To say that the BER is a waste, to say pink batts are a waste and to say home insulation is a waste-let us concur, let us do something about it, let us be positive and let us introduce legislation that allows an Auditor General to investigate the truth or otherwise, to distinguish the fact from the fiction, to drill down, to hold some people to account and to get better public policy outcomes with taxpayers' money. With regard to the point about private contractors, we are not necessarily talking only about small businesses. I think about DMO and the $9 billion of taxpayers' money that goes into DMO every year. There are close to billion-dollar companies, such as Raytheon, operating in Australia with no audit or oversight of where that taxpayers' money is going or of their obligations to the public purse. So to cry poor that this is about small business-it is not. This is about following the money trail to make sure we get full value for money. (Time expired)",189
239,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The time allotted for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA,190
240,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order! It being 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Child Care",190
241,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak in support of the Take A Break occasional care funding program. I took to the steps of the Victorian Parliament House on Thursday during a protest against the federal government's cuts to the Take A Break occasional childcare program. There were concerned parents and families and the dedicated staff and volunteers that make occasional day care work. They were very concerned about the unilateral decision of the Gillard government to abandon its funding of this very important program. While millions are being spent by Canberra on new childcare laws and safety standards, not one cent-not a dime-is going into occasional care. The money is being ripped from the sector and being spent to administer and oversee new standards on long day care, preschool, family day care and out of school hours care. I was particularly pleased to be able to speak with the state minister, Wendy Lovell, before I went out to talk on the steps of Parliament House. I was encouraged and excited about her assurance that, should the Gillard government change its mind and do the right thing by families who require occasional day care, the state government would follow suit and provide its share of the funding-a really positive message coming out of the Baillieu government. But what do we hear from the federal Labor government? Absolutely nothing. Now you would queue that scratchy sound of crickets in the background that lets you know that absolutely nothing is being said by this federal Labor government. Where is Kate Ellis? Does she not understand that this one size fits all logic, this tick a box approach to care, just does not work for every family? Are those families that require occasional child care the new forgotten families under this Gillard Labor government? They certainly seem to be, and they were not very happy when they were on the steps of Parliament House. It was particularly interesting to note the petitions that had been signed. The petitions were directed to the Legislative Assembly of the state parliament when they really should have been directed to the House of Representatives in the federal parliament. Kate Ellis must have been delighted, as the minister, that there was very little discussion until I had the opportunity to talk to the assembled crowd about what an appalling, neglectful and unhelpful decision the federal Labor government had made to cut $12 million in occasional care funding. In addition to the assurances from Wendy Lovell that the state Liberal government would reinstate its funding when the federal Labor government reinstated the $12 million, there was more good news. I was able to share with those who were present that under Tony Abbott the coalition is committed to restoring the $12 million ripped out of occasional child care by federal Labor. There was a really positive response to that and a recognition that the federal coalition was prepared to make its contribution. We are prepared to make a contribution for a whole range of reasons. The provision of affordable, reliable, safe and available childcare facilities will always be a direct responsibility of the federal government. We saw under the previous coalition government a recognition that family types and demands on families were quite varied and their needs were at times flexible, at times easy to predict and at other times difficult to respond to because of the complex nature of families and modern life. child This is where occasional care comes in. I hope that the federal Labor minister hears the message-the message that there is no one size fits all requirement for child care in our country. If she needs any more reassurance and any more prompting to put back that money that has been ripped out-an action that made so many people unhappy on the steps of the state parliament last week-I would like to share with her some observations from families in my own electorate. This is from one person who wrote to me: I have been using the Occasional Care Facility at the Mornington Community Contact for 2 years with my eldest child ... This service has provided me with a small break each week of 3-5 hrs which I have found to be invaluable. This mother goes on to describe that, with the demands of young children, this has allowed some time to recharge her energy and re-engage and be all that she hopes to be as the mother of her children. There is another example involving Mahogany Neighbourhood House in Frankston North. A parent says: I began using occasional care in July 2010 when I left my position in government employment services to concentrate on my family. She goes on to describe not only the important contribution that that break provided for the well-being of her family but also the opportunity it gave her to re-engage in employment. The noise was strong and the message was clear on the steps of Parliament House in Victoria last Thursday-Kate Ellis, you need to put this money back. Occasional care matters to people. There is no one size fits all solution. (Time expired)",190
242,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," I was loath to interrupt the member for Dunkley, but I commend to him the provisions of standing order 64, which require him to refer to the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and the Leader of the Opposition by their titles and not by their names. Parliamentary Friends of Surf Life",192
243,Mr LYONS,ADJOURNMENT," Today, the Parliamentary Friends of Surf Life Saving Australia held a morning tea with the CEO and President of Surf Life Saving Australia, Brett William OAM, and Graham Ford. For the record I would like to get into Hansard the executive of the Parliamentary Friends of Surf Life Saving. The President is Geoff Lyons, the member for Bass, who is also president of the Launceston and Bridport surf clubs; the Secretary is Amanda Rishworth from Kingston, from Christies Beach; the Finance Director is Rob Oakeshott from Lyne, who is with Port Macquarie; the Club Captain is Darren Chester from Gippsland, who is from Lakes Entrance; the Patrol Officer is Senator Sue Boyce; and the Competition Director is Kenneth Wyatt from Hasluck, who is with the Mullaloo club.",192
244,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, I do remind the member for Bass that standing order 64 binds him as well as the member for Dunkley.,192
245,Mr LYONS,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was great to hear Brett William and Graham Ford speak about the history of surf life saving and where their organisation is headed into the future. The surf life saving movement began in 1907 when volunteer lifesavers began to protect the lives of fellow beachgoers in New South Wales by performing patrols and rescues. The by-laws which banned bathing in daylight hours since the 1830s were gradually repealed between 1902 and 1905, in response to the increasing popularity of surf bathing, and a growing consensus that bathing in appropriate clothing was not an immoral act. The impact of these changes was that beachgoers entered the surf in rapidly escalating numbers. The surf was new to most surf bathers and many could not swim, so with its increasing popularity came Saving more drowning and consequent attempts at rescue. When Australians decided to embrace the ocean as a site of recreational activity in the early part of the 20th century, our love for the beach emerged. The need for a lifesaving movement to protect lives grew, and from that day onwards, surf lifesaving became part of the fabric of our country. Since that time, volunteer lifesavers have saved more than 550,000 lives. This is a tremendous achievement for a volunteer organisation, and last season it rescued more than 12,000 lives. This morning Graham and Brett spoke about the introduction of women to surf lifesaving in 1980. This was, shamefully, a contentious move at the time. I am proud to say today that women now make up between 45 and 48 per cent of our membership. Surf lifesaving is an active part of Australian communities. Our movement prides itself on offering mateship, education, experience and, in doing so, gives back to the community. I am a proud member and president of both the Launceston and Bridport surf life saving clubs. This is the first year of operation for the Bridport Surf Life Saving Club. We had 135 members join in its first year. This club is an important part of their community and I am humbled that so many people joined. The skills gained by nippers will stick to the soul like sand from the beach and be carried for life. Surf lifesaving is the largest volunteer movement of its kind in Australia. This is important as we are in an age where no-one seems to be joining any organisations or groups. Indeed, we find that as our nippers reach the age of about 14 and have part-time jobs and studies, they are unable to dedicate themselves to surf lifesaving, but we usually welcome them back when they get older. For people young and old, Surf Life Saving Australia inspires a positive and uniquely Australian attitude because every member of every club, the entire movement, embraces and promotes a 'can do' attitude to life. At the last count, there were 307 clubs in Australia, 13 of which are located in my home state of Tasmania. Following a survey of members and the public, the iconic symbol of the red and yellow quarter cap is to be retained by the surf lifesaving movement. A priority for Surf Life Saving Australia this year is the completion and release of the report into the economic contribution of surf lifesaving in Australia. This report will be released later in the year. I would like to thank all those members and senators who attended this morning, and I congratulate them on their membership. It is estimated that Australia has 100 million beach visitations each year and safety is a vital part of that. Surf lifesaving offers public first aid and CPR courses. I encourage all to be part of Surf Life Saving Australia and I commend all those who joined this morning. (Time expired) Herbert Electorate: Townsville Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (21:40): Townsville suffered at the hands of Cyclone Yasi this year. Our recovery has been slow but the month of July will mark a full swing: Townsville is now back. It is open, ready for business and very busy. What a month July will be! We have the last night of the Townsville Show tonight. It has been going for 128 years and there is something there for the whole family. To anyone who is going to the Townsville Show tonight, please do not buy tickets for the woodworkers' outdoor setting. I have bought about 300 bucks worth of tickets because I desperately need an outdoor setting. The Sucrogen Townsville 400 V8s, along with the V8 Gala Ball and V8 Ladies Lunch, is a big thing this weekend. Yes, my motherin-law will be turning 70 and I will be down at the Burdekin for that, but I will be going on Friday afternoon. It is a big weekend with 160,000 to 180,000 people going through the turnstiles. Following that, we have the Australian Festival of Chamber Music Chefs of the North Dinner and the full-blown Australian Festival of Chamber Music. This is where culture and art come together in North Queensland. Dave Kippin and his team at the Festival of Chamber Music are excellent, and the Chefs of the North Dinner is where we have guest chefs from all around the world coming to Townsville to work with a very good chefs like Wayne from Wayne & Adele's Garden of Eating and the executive chef at the RSL club, who is one of the greatest golf burglars you will ever see. It is a dinner not missed by anybody.",192
246,Mr Neville,ADJOURNMENT,"Do you play? Mr EWEN JONES: I am not playing.. The Motoco RV Dam Fine Rally is for motor homes and caravans. They will be having a big get-together. All of the people with mobile homes will be coming together in one fantastic event. The craft and sewing show is something in which I will be participating. I have a quilt I will be showing at that-no, I will not be. That is at the Townsville Entertainment and Convention Centre. It is one of the big shows in North Queensland. There are lots and lots of people who come there; exhibitors from all over the country will be there. There will also be the Zookini Art Exhibition at the Perc Tucker Regional Gallery. Frances Thompson does a magnificent job at getting the art groups together. Zookini is a wonderful thing. It is interactive art. They had something like 10,000 people through an earlier exhibition and I was lucky enough to be there when the 10,000th person came through. Stars? You want stars? I will give you stars. Reg Livermore's 'Turns' will be on at the civic theatre. I saw Reg Livermore from Betty Blokk Buster at Her Majesty's Theatre in Brisbane in the early 1980s. He is one of the great performers of our time. He still looks pretty good in a frock. The Townsville Choral Society will be presenting My Fair Lady. It is an absolutely fantastic show: 'Come on Rover, move your bloomin' arse!' That is what we want to see. It is one of the great moments of that fantastic show. The Townsville Choral Society is a very active part of the city. There are the Townsville cultural markets at the Reef HQ. The big one of the month is the North Queensland Herpetological Society meeting. That is where all the reptiles get together. It is a big meeting and everyone will be there. You have PANTS, the Performance Arts Network Townsville. There will be wildlife care training from North Queensland Wildlife Care Inc. There will be the Townsville Annual Shell Show. You walk into the shell show and you can hear the sea. It is one of the greatest things you will ever see. There is the Townsville Music and Performing Arts Space where artists and musicians get together. They have workshops for anyone from 12 to 18 to 50 to 100. One thing for the member for Hinkler: the Townsville Ukulele Club meeting. All you need are two fingers on one hand and an index finger on the other and you are on your way. On the other side, there is Analog Zombie presents Electro Therapy. Their notes do not remove hair from your upper lip; they are in fact DJs and music. The mighty North Queensland Cowboys are up against the West Tigers at Dairy Farmers Stadium on 16 July and up against the Penrith Panthers on 30 July. We are playing great football. We will be in the top eight. There is the Black Tie, which are morning melodies for all the oldies at the Civic Theatre. There is 2001 Former Origin Greats Indigenous Employment and Careers Expo, where we will be celebrating no less than six series wins in a row. 'What's an orchestra?', you may well ask. You will find out this month in Townsville. It is an introduction to classical music at the Civic Theatre. At the Perc Tucker gallery you will be able to go to 'In the Japanese Manner'-Australian prints from 1900 to 1940. 'Indigenous Art,' I hear you say. There are Girringun Indigenous artists Q&A and Arts in the Dark, all to be held at the Umbrella Studio. Come to Townsville.",193
247,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," In thanking the member for Herbert for that invigorating experience, I regrettably must tell him his time has expired. I now call the member for Fowler for a similar performance. Sanglah Public Hospital, Denpasar, Bali",194
248,Mr HAYES,ADJOURNMENT," One of the outcomes of the 2020 conference was the identification of eastern Indonesia as being of great strategic importance to Australia, particularly in the longer term. It is our nearest and biggest neighbour to the north. Eastern Indonesia just happens to be one of the poorest areas in Asia and along with East Timor it is the poorest area in our immediate region. I would like to draw attention to a very positive development in our north and an important emerging engagement with eastern Indonesia, in particular with Bali as well as East Timor. I refer to the developing relationship between Royal Darwin Hospital and the largest public hospital in eastern Indonesia, Sanglah hospital in Denpasar, Bali. Royal Darwin Hospital and Sanglah hospital have an intimate history, which emphasises the strategic importance of the area. Sanglah hospital was the hospital to which all victims, including all foreigners, were taken for treatment after the terrorist bombings in Bali in October 2002 and October 2005. Royal Darwin Hospital was the hospital to which all Australian victims were air evacuated and treated. The hospital also received patients from other nations and from Indonesia. The trauma of terrorist bombings and the strategic need for Australia to respond and protect our citizens in the region in the wake of these horrific acts of terrorism led to some responses. very constructive strategic thinking. On my recent visit to Bali and Jakarta as part of my study leave, I was privileged to be invited by the President Director of Sanglah hospital, Doctor Wayan Sutanga, to go to his hospital for a briefing on the developing relationship between Sanglah hospital and Royal Darwin Hospital and a tour of his facilities. I was impressed in so many ways by the developments I saw. They involve practical measures for the protection of our citizens in Bali and Indonesia, the activities of DFAT and AusAID and some very positive practical engagement in eastern Indonesia. I was taken to the burns unit and the intensive care unit at Sanglah. The burns unit came into existence as a result of the intelligent application of AusAID funds. What really impressed me was that the burns unit and the intensive care unit serve the needs for all manner of victims of horrible accidents all over Indonesia and East Timor. Whilst ready to deal with the victims of terrorist attacks, it serves the needs on a dayto-day basis of Indonesians, including those who are particularly poor. AusAID should be congratulated for such a sensible and useful project. I was interested to learn that since the creation of the burns unit there has been increasing communication and engagement between Royal Darwin Hospital and Sanglah hospital. Clearly there has been careful planning about how to improve the efficiency in disaster and emergency response by medical and nursing staff in both hospitals. What is unfolding is a practical exchange between the two main public hospitals in our region. The program involves nursing training and capacity building at Royal Darwin and the training of doctors and medical administrators in emergency medicine, disaster and trauma response and coordination across countries of appropriate These two hospitals have applied for a grant from AusAID for $1.6 million over five years to develop a practical nurse exchange project. Having seen the benefits of this program, I lend my full support to this application. Not only will this program benefit the people of Indonesia and East Timor but also the 650,000 Australians who visit Bali each year, not to mention those who choose to make their retirement in Indonesia. For Australians as well as our friends and neighbours, the coordination of emergency medicine makes good sense. Therefore, I fully support for the relationship between the Royal Darwin Hospital, the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre and Sanglah hospital. I also pay regard to Colin MCDonald QC, the chair of Royal Darwin Hospital, for his assistance in coordinating my visit to Indonesia and for putting on a proper footing the relationship between his hospital and Sanglah hospital in Denpasar, Bali. Rhiannon, Senator Lee Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (21:51): As we all know, today in the other chamber we had the swearing in of half of the Senate, those senators elected at the last election. Of course, in political terms, it is significant in number of respects. It is right and appropriate in a democracy such as ours that there is a healthy focus on those who are taking their Senate seats, those newly sworn in as senators from today, what they stand for, what their political beliefs are and what their political backgrounds are. In the case of one senator, Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon, there are some things that are crystal clear and some things that are not. What is crystal clear is that Senator Rhiannon is a hostile opponent of the state of Israel. At every opportunity Senator Rhiannon attacks and criticises the state of Israel, a beacon of democracy in the Middle East, yet does not seem ever to find the time to hold Israel's opponents to account to any level. Most recently, of course, the senator supported the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel. On this point even Senator Bob Brown publicly distanced himself from Senator Rhiannon's hyper anti-Israel position on this occasion. The fact that that intervention was needed really does highlight the extremism of new Greens Senator Rhiannon. In response, Senator Lee Rhiannon, we read in today's Australian, has completely snubbed Senator Brown, the leader of the Australian Greens. Whilst Senator Rhiannon is crystal clear about her hatred of the state of Israel, she is at the same time quite blurry about her past political involvements. Indeed, as we read in the Weekend Australian, she flatly refused to discuss her political past with that newspaper, and it is becoming very obvious why. Senator Rhiannon was, as has been pointed out in this House and extensively in the Australian, a member of the Socialist Party of Australia. The party was, to quote the Weekend Australian: … a communist faction that stayed loyal to Moscow in the early 1970s after the Communist Party of Australia split over its response to the a Soviet Union's brutal suppression of the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia in 1968. As was pointed out, Senator Rhiannon was a Soviet Union propagandist, not just for a couple of years as a young student but over many, many years, until she was nearly 40 years of age. In fact, she was the editor of the magazine Survey, apparently funded from Moscow. Indeed, she was the editor at its demise in 1990, under her then married name Lee O'Gorman. That was, as everyone in this House would appreciate, just after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Just imagine it, Mr Deputy Speaker: all of us here-Liberal, National, Labor-rejoicing that the Berlin Wall had come down and presumably Senator Lee Rhiannon, back then, crying tears of anguish at the collapse of communist rule. You can only imagine what she would have done had she been over there on the East German-West German border. Presumably she would have had a wheelbarrow full of mortar trying to rebuild the Berlin Wall brick by brick to preserve the awful communist experiment. What is also interesting is that Senator Rhiannon's editorship and the end of Soviet propaganda magazine Survey seemed to intercept and overlap with her joining the Australian Greens, which, as has been pointed out in this House and other places, she said she has been committed to for 20 years. So we are to assume that she either simultaneously supported Soviet propaganda and the Greens or went to bed one night dreaming of a rebirth of the Soviet Union only to wake up suddenly a Green. Most of us suspect that nothing has really changed; that the possum has simply shifted roof cavities, because if Senator Rhiannon had changed she would apologise, wouldn't she, to the families of the victims of communism, as the member for Melbourne Ports has rightly pointed out? She would renounce her former stance. But she does not. She ducks and weaves at every opportunity. In conclusion, I seek leave to table an extract from the very last edition of Survey magazine, July-August 1990, under Lee O'Gorman, editor. Leave not granted. Special Broadcasting Service",194
249,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to pay tribute to the extraordinary of the Special Broadcasting Service, SBS, and to their continuing commitment to presenting issues of national importance in new and pioneering ways and supporting, promoting and telling the stories of multicultural and multilingual Australia. In recent weeks more than half a million Australians in each of the five major capital cities watched the groundbreaking series Go Back to Where You Came From, which followed six ordinary Australians to some of the most dangerous places on earth: the home countries of refugee families now living in Australia. The series became a phenomenon as more than half a million people in each of the five major capital cities tuned in each night to see those six Australians, each with views representing a sector of the Australian community, experience in reverse the perilous journey of an asylum seeker. I think one of the main reasons that it was such compelling viewing was that it provided, for the first time, a window onto the world through the prism of ordinary Australians holding views that represent diverse sectors of the communityactively challenging their beliefs throughout the journey and giving others with the same views who were watching on TV at home the opportunity to take that journey with them. This approach has been incredibly effective in changing the rhetoric around the asylum seeker debate to one that is more sensitive to the enormous complexities and contradictions of the whole issue. If there is any organisation which can tackle this issue in such an original way, it is SBS TV. They must be congratulated on their efforts and their contribution, through their TV programming, to this issue. That is because SBS have been working in this area for years, ever since the service was established in 1978 to provide special multilingual broadcasting services for ethnic work communities right across Australia. From humble beginnings in 1980, SBS Television now broadcasts in more than 100 languages and is watched by more than seven million Australians each week, bringing the news to homes where otherwise that news would perhaps be lost. Today SBS's analog television signal reaches 96.9 per cent of all Australians across the nation while its digital service, which began in 2001, reaches an estimated 96.8 per cent of Australians, which is about the same number. SBS Radio is the world's most linguistically diverse radio network, broadcasting 68 language programs to a potential audience of more than three million Australians who speak a language other than English in their homes. Take those 68 language programs being broadcast by radio to those more than three million people in their homes. When you think about it, not being able to receive the news or not being able to understand what is taking place in your community is very disadvantageous. I think what SBS does is provide a service for people to be connected to their community and to be connected to what is happening in their world. It is about being connected to not only the far away world but also locally. It is so important for people to be able to be connected within their communities. In my electorate of Hindmarsh alone, 132 distinct languages are spoken, from Arabic, Afrikaans, Albanian and Acholi to Vietnamese, Ukrainian, Urdu, Yoruba, Greek, Italian, Chinese-and the list could go on. And what is special is that these differences of language, heritage and culture are celebrated every single day by SBS on air, on radio and, of course, on its TV channels, SBS One and SBS Two. SBS has been bringing issues of multiculturalism to the forefront, as we have seen with Go Back to Where You Came From and awardwinning shows like East West 101, which won best TV drama series, best actor and best director awards at the AFI awards as well as a gold medal for best miniseries at the New York Festivals International Television and Film Awards.",197
250,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. I say to the member 'efharisto'. Red Frogs Australia Chaplaincy,198
251,Mr VASTA,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to speak about an extraordinary network-or perhaps better described as a 'craze'-supporting our young people: the Red Frogs Australia Chaplaincy Network. Red Frogs founder and director Andy Gourley describes Red Frogs as: ... not just another program but an experience! At its core is the heartbeat of 2000 volunteers with mission to serve young people and assist them through some of the most important years of their lives. I could not agree more. Red Frogs started out as a small outreach initiative of Citipointe Church in my electorate of Bonner but has since been adopted by a network of churches across the globe in countries such as South Africa, New Zealand, the UK and Canada. I believe that the reason for Red Frogs' success lies in the uniqueness of its approach-for example, seeking to change the attitude that alcohol is necessary to have a good time. It is the mission of Red Frogs to create a fun yet safe lifestyle alternative for young people. Quite literally the Allen's red frogs that we all grew up with and loved have been the icebreaker for the Red Frogs Crew since 1997. Starting with only 80 kilograms in its first year, the Red Frogs chaplaincy now distributes over 11 tonnes of Allen's red frogs all around Australia. Many parents of students leaving school take comfort in the Party Safe and Stay Safe at Schoolies seminar and its message that goes out each year to over 40,000 high school students in years 10, 11 and 12. The proactive and preventative seminars grab the attention of students and provide insight into how to make positive partying decisions so as to avoid negative and often life altering behaviours such as violence, sexual assault, drug taking, depression and suicide. Red Frogs education seminars have been a large part of the reason for the reduction in alcohol Network fuelled violence and other negative behaviours once common to Schoolies Week. Red Frogs Australia have received local and national awards for the outstanding service they have provided at schoolies, including the Local Hero: Metropolitan Australian of the Year award-truly well deserved. Again, thankfully for many a parents, Red Frogs does not end at schoolies. In residential colleges and university dorms, at parties, at O-Week events and market days, universities have endorsed the Red Frogs chaplaincy as a vital support for their students. The Red Frogs crew are also known for their non-alcoholic events such as coffee crawls, random acts of pancakes, camping trips, surfing safaris, sporting events and other activities that encourage a lifestyle where alcohol is not the only means of having a 'fun night'. In my electorate of Bonner, the God Bowl and the Red Frog Boardriders Tuesday night skate sessions are well known throughout the local skating community and we see skaters coming from near and far to skate at the God Bowl, the indoor ramp and the new addition to the facilities, the Stoke Bowl. The Stoke Bowl was generously donated to the Red Frog Boardriders recently by Brisbane City Council's Museum of Brisbane after their exhibition showing the history of skating in Brisbane concluded. I know that the community are extremely appreciative towards Brisbane City Council and in particular to local councillor Adrian Schrinner for this donation. This is a great example of the government working with local community groups to get positive outcomes. This really is an extraordinary network whose sole purpose is the safety and protection of our young people. It is run by extraordinary people and acknowledgement really needs to go to Andy Gourley, Craig Hepplewhite, the general manager, Brendan Hannah, Elicia Pretorius, Chris George, Justin Vickers and Andrea Vickers as well as to the thousands of dedicated volunteers. should be commended for their unique approach and incredibly valuable work to the community.",198
252,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! I am very pleased that the member for Hinkler gave way to the member for Bonner and I am sure that the member for Hinkler would join with me in wishing all the best to the Red Frogs Crew because that was a very positive frog story.,199
253,Mr Neville,ADJOURNMENT,"We'll croak together, Mr Speaker! 20th Anniversary of Croatian Independence",199
254,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT," On 20 June I attended a reception here at Parliament House, hosted by the member for Werriwa and the member for Corio, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Croatian independence. The reception was attended by Croatians from most parts of Australia. Twenty years ago on 25 June 1991 Croatia asserted its independence from Yugoslavia and 25 June is now recognised as Statehood Day and is an official holiday in Croatia. Independence was declared following a referendum held on 19 May 1991 when 94 per cent of voters opted for the following: The Republic of Croatia, as a sovereign and independent state, which guarantees cultural autonomy and all civil rights to Serbs and members of other nationalities in Croatia, can form an alliance of sovereign states with other republics. A similar figure voted against the second option that the Republic of Croatia remain part of Yugoslavia as a unitary state. A moratorium of three months was put in place to allow for the negotiation of the Brioni Agreement. Finally, a complete break with Yugoslavia was made in October. Since the gold rushes of the 1850s Croatians have played a significant role in All Australian history, and at the 2006 census well over 100,000 Australian residents identified themselves as having Croatian ancestry. The biggest wave of Croatians came to Australia between 1965 and 1991. Australians of Croatian heritage have made a significant contribution to all aspects of Australian life-quite noticeably in sport. For example, 45 Croatian Australians have played for the Australian soccer team. Andrew Bogut is currently a strong performer in the American basketball league. The 1984 Los Angeles Olympic gold medallist Dean Lukin is of Croatian decent, as is Collingwood footballer Alan Didak, who originates from my home suburb of Pooraka. Other well-known Australians of Croatian decent include actor Eric Bana and former Democrats leader Senator Natasha Stott-Despoja, the youngest woman elected to this parliament. There are over 3,500 Croatian-born residents in South Australia, and many more who are of Croatian decent, to make a community of over 12,000 South Australians who share a strong bond with Croatian culture and history. A considerable number of them live in the Makin electorate and I have the privilege of representing them in this place. In fact many are near neighbours and live in my local neighbourhood. Croatian Australians quickly settled into South Australia and established a range of social facilities to assist them. These include the Croatian Catholic Centre, the Australian Croatian Community Club in Mount Gambier, the Croatian clubs of the Riverland and Coober Pedy, the Croatian Ethnic School in the Croatian Club in Brompton, the Croatian Care for the Aged and a Croatian radio hour. They have also established the Croatian sports and community club which is located in Gepps Cross and within the Makin electorate. It is a wonderful community facility and home to the Raiders Soccer Club, a South Australian Super League side. For eight years now the South Australian Croatian community has held an annual festa at the community centre. It is a day of festivities filled with Croatian dancing, music and food. I attend this event each year. The event is organised by the Croatian Food and Wine Festival committee, the Croatian Sports Centre of South Australia and volunteers from across the Croatian community. I congratulate all involved on this outstanding community and cultural event. Croatian South Australians have integrated into all aspects of Australian life but they have been particularly prominent as shipbuilders and fishermen in Adelaide, Whyalla and Port Lincoln. Samarzia-Samar, Fanov-Kali and Glamocak are well-known South Australian names in the boat and shipbuilding industries. Of the 48 South Australian prawn-fishing licence holders more than half are of Croatian decent. I take this opportunity to congratulate Croatia on the 20th anniversary of its statehood and to thank Australian Croatians for their contribution to Australian life. Paid Parental Leave",199
255,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT," Last month the minister for families hailed the 12-month anniversary of the introduction of the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme as 'an historic day for Australian families'. She also described it as 'the day Australia caught up with the rest of the developed world'. She went on further to say that it gives 'low income, casual and part-time workers, contractors and the self-employed financial security and a connection to the workforce that they've never had before'. But does it do that for low-income, casual and part-time workers? For at least four months now I have been battling, on behalf of a constituent, to have the minister recognise an inherent flaw in the current guidelines for the scheme. Mrs Amanda MCIntosh is a relief state school teacher in Bundaberg who gave birth on 3 May, but she is not entitled to receive Paid Parental Leave because she fails the criteria which dictates that she cannot have more than an eight-week gap between two consecutive working days despite meeting other qualifications like the number of hours worked. The crux of her problem lies in the fact that she is a relief teacher and the very nature of her work dictates that she is not employed full time. In fact her paid employment is dictated by school holidays. As a relief teacher she very rarely gets paid to work during the last two weeks of a year or the first two weeks of the next year. When you consider that state schools get six weeks Christmas school holiday and private schools get seven, you can understand that by adding four weeks to that, you get a figure of 10 or 11. Mrs MCIntosh has fallen into that 10or 11-week timespan. I have brought this matter to the attention of the minister on a number of occasions and I have not yet been given an answer or an acknowledgement that the problem even exists. The most detailed advice I have been given about Mrs MCIntosh's circumstances is that she could qualify for the baby bonus. What is not freely admitted, however, is the fact that the baby bonus is, in some circumstances, only about half the amount available under the Paid Parental Leave scheme; roughly the comparison of $5,000 with $10,000. I ask: does the minister fail to understand the problem that now faces relief and supply teachers and others whose work revolves around the vagaries of the Christmas holiday calendar? Can the minister explain why the circumstances of relief teachers were not taken into account when the eligibility criteria for this scheme were drawn up? I recognise that the minister has told me a review will take place in two years time, but that will be too late for Mrs MCIntosh and any other person in her circumstances. Another matter which complicates this case is the fact that Mrs MCIntosh cannot have her infant added to her Medicare card until she claims either the baby bonus or Paid Parental Leave. It is a catch-22 situation. So, for as long as this problem drags on, Mrs MCIntosh cannot properly claim any of the child's medical expenses. To date, those bills have reached about $600. My representations have included dealings with two separate ministers and their offices and numerous phone calls and letters, but to no avail. I raise this matter tonight because I think Mrs MCIntosh and all other people who are caught up in this unintended anomaly deserve a straightforward answer as to why their employment was not taken into account along with that of others. I am no political bigot. It would be fair to say that I did not prefer the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme; I preferred the model offered by the coalition. Having said that, if the government's model is the modus operandi to which all Australians are now attached, let it be fair to all women who need to use paid parental care and do not discriminate against teachers who happen to have had their pregnancy over the Christmas holiday break. New South Wales Government",200
256,Ms ONEILL,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to mark a most regrettable political milestone in my home state of New South Wales. That milestone, the first 100 days of the O'Farrell government, has been nothing short of a disaster for my constituents on the Central Coast. During his extended job application, Premier O'Farrell gave absolutely no warning of what was to come. Indeed Mr O'Farrell has spent his first 100 days in government doing everything he said he would not do. He has attacked workers' rights, it seems that he is pushing ahead with for retrospective legislation on the solar bonus scheme and he has dodged independent scrutiny, despite his promise to run an open and transparent government. Instead of acting on promises to address the cost of living, the O'Farrell government passed an 18 per cent increase in electricity prices onto families. To add insult to injury, the O'Farrell government will not begin new family energy rebate payments until July 2012. The most unforgiveable act is Mr O'Farrell's shameless attack on the public sector workers of my region. His extreme Work Choices style legislation strips away the right to bargain for thousands of public sector employees and, in addition, it caps their pay rises at below the CPI, at 2.5 per cent. He has also locked out workers from accessing the umpire, the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission, an august institution that has provided balanced arbitrated settlements between employers and unions for decades. I am sure this is already sounding familiar to many on this side of the House. If it walks like Work Choices, if it quacks like Work Choices and if it stinks like Work Choices, it is Work Choices. Senator Minchin in his valedictory speech in the Senate the other week was unapologetic about Work Choices. His criticism was not of the substance of the previous coalition government's misguided workplace agenda. There were no regrets there from the departing Senator Minchin. His regret was that the change had just not been incremental enough. What he was saying was that you cannot bludgeon working people and take away their rights, because they will get angry and kick you. What you have to do, according to Senator Minchin, is to gradually steal away their rights and their freedom to provide for themselves and their families. The Australian people have rejected Work Choices twice: once in 2007 and again in 2010, when the Leader of the Opposition tried to pretend that it was 'dead, buried and cremated'. I am confident that the Australian people will again reject Work Choices if this Leader of the Opposition leads his party into another federal election, just as the people of New South Wales will reject the O'Farrell government's disgraceful attack on public sector workers. This unbridled attack on workers by the legislation of the Liberals in New South Wales means that the nurses of Gosford Hospital, the ambulance drivers at Point Clare ambulance station, the fireys of the Umina fire brigade, the child protection workers and the mental health workers-all critical frontline service workers in the seat of Robertson-will be doing first-class jobs as they always do but, sadly, under an O'Farrell government, they will now be doing them for second-class wages. There is some good news in this unholy mess, because good people will always stand up in the face of wrongdoing. I want to praise six members of Gosford City Council: councillors Maher, Doyle, Freewater, Latella and Macfadyen, and Councillor Scott, who led the charge. Councillor Scott's motion called on the council to write to the Premier and Central Coast Liberal MPs and call on them to repeal this terrible piece of legislation. When I look at the make-up of that group, I see that councillors Maher and Doyle are Independents, councillors Freewater and Latella are Greens and councillors Macfadyen and Scott are Labor Party representatives. Who opposed the motion? The two Liberal councillors. They went down on that night because what the O'Farrell government has done has simply been a terrible invasion of workers' rights in New South Wales. In closing, I want to put on the record that a Liberal government in New South Wales in 100 days has revealed its true colours through a shameful, bullyboy intimidation of workers in the state of New South Wales. New South Wales voters have found out, just as Peter Reith found out, that you cannot trust a Liberal leader. (Time expired) Forde Electorate: Logan Waterways Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (22:21): The Forde electorate is fortunate to have hard working councillors in both the Logan City and Gold Coast councils. Shortly, the Logan City Council will step up their efforts to protect the waterways of Logan through the Logan Waterways Summit. The City of Logan is dominated by the catchment and tributaries of the Logan and Albert rivers. Covering over 4,000 square kilometres, the catchments drain into Southern Moreton Bay. The Logan River is one of four rivers in the Forde Electorate and the longest stretching back to the Great Dividing Range. The Logan River is joined by the Albert River at Carbrook, before flowing into the RAMSAR listed Southern Moreton Bay. The catchment is affected by a variety of land uses, from the rural areas of North Maclean and Chambers Flat to the urban areas of Waterford, Bethania and Loganholme, the mangrove forests of Southern Moreton Bay and the aquaculture farms near the river mouth. This wonderful river system has suffered from this development over the past 20 or 30 years. The 2010 Ecosystem Health Report Card showed the Albert and Logan rivers as two of the worse in South-East Queensland, with the Logan River remaining in the D category and Albert River dropping from an Ato B-. After testing 16 sites in the Logan River catchment, most of the area failed to meet ecosystem goals set out by the study. Out of the 19 freshwater catchments in South-East Queensland, only four scored lower than the Logan River, which has not scored higher than a D for four years. Sites stretching from Waterford to Moreton Bay completely failed to meet health standards. This is a sad indictment of the management of our natural heritage. I grew up in this area and as a child I used to swim in the Logan River. It is sad to realise that my boys do not have that opportunity. After the release of this report, residents and government officials agreed that this must be rectified to ensure that future generations can enjoy the waterways. The main issue for the Logan and Albert waterways is fine sediment, or suspended sediment, which comes predominantly from urban and industrial areas, agricultural activities such as grazing, and the degradation of the river banks through poor landclearing practices. This sediment flows into the creeks that feed into these rivers. The Logan and Albert Conservation Association believe that a large contributor to the poor results were the high nutrient and sediment levels being produced. The LoganAlbert Rivers Catchment Association believes that development and rural and urban refuse are three main problems that demand immediate attention. The Logan City Council is currently taking action and delivering its Gross Pollutant Trap Cleaning Program to the benefit of both rivers. Councillor Ray Hackwood said: Council is committed to assisting with the protection of our natural waterways and our GPT cleaning program is crucial to help prevent unnecessary and damaging pollutants travelling into our rivers and Moreton Bay. Councillor Lisa Bradley said: ... during each round of cleaning more than 500 tonnes of damaging pollutants were prevented from entering Logan's waterways. The Logan City Council is also being very proactive in its work to clean up the Logan and Albert rivers by holding its inaugural Logan Waterways Summit in July. The overall aim of the Logan Waterways Summit is to provide a forum for engagement, discussion and collaboration, where ideas and solutions can be developed to improve the health and resilience of the Logan and Albert rivers catchment and their various tributaries. It is disappointing to note in this time of a long and complex debate about a carbon tax that the on-the-ground, practical environmental issues that we face in the electorate of Forde with respect to our rivers are not even touched on. The carbon tax will impact greatly on people's lives but it will do nothing to help deal with these practical on the-ground measures that go directly to the heart of improving our natural environment for future generations in our community. It is about time that we stopped looking to a tax as a solution and instead looked at the practical, on-the-ground measures that will help future generations. (Time expired) Micah Challenge",201
257,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT," Wednesday, 22 June, I had the great pleasure of meeting with two members of Micah Challenge, Mr Rod Benson, Ethicist and Public Theologian at Morling Baptist College, and Mr Simon Massey, Advocacy Relations at Compassion Australia. I was very impressed by their passion and commitment to reduce global poverty, and I will now read their message to me to this House: Micah Challenge is a global movement of Christian aid and development agencies, churches, groups and individuals, which aims to deepen people's engagement with the poor and to reduce poverty as an integral expression of Christian faith. Micah Challenge takes its name from the prophet Micah, who wrote, 'What does the Lord require of you but to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God. (Micah 6:8) In Australia, approximately 50 church denominations and development agencies are members of the Micah Challenge coalition, and over 113,000 individuals have signed on to the Micah Call. Since Micah Challenge Australia's inception in 2004, grassroots Christians across the country have been taking action in their electorates and travelling to Parliament House to speak out on the Millennium Development Goals. Two weeks ago, Micah Challenge brought senior church leaders from Anglican, Australian Christian Churches, Baptist, Churches of Christ, Salvation Army, Uniting and Vineyard denominations to highlight that Australian churches are supportive of Micah Challenge's campaign. The issue is simple and overwhelmingly evident every time you travel to a developing country. Almost 1.4 billion people live in extreme poverty. This means they live on less than US$1.25 a day, which is insufficient to meet their most basic needs. On They are hungry, susceptible to disease and lack access to things Australians take for granted, such as clean water, decent sanitation and access to health care. The devastating impact of poverty is captured in child and maternal mortality rates. Each year 8.1 million children die before reaching the age of five, which is equivalent to 22,000 children dying every day. The vast majority of these deaths are readily preventable with simple solutions such as vaccinations and having access to a midwife during child birth. The good news is that progress is being made. The number of children dying each year has declined by approximately 35 per cent since 1990. There is a solution. What is needed is the willingness to act and deliver that solution. Over the past couple of years, the Australian Government has taken strong actions that will save thousands of lives. Of particular note is the Australian government's recent $200 million commitment to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation. This investment will fund an estimated 7.1 million lifesaving vaccines for the children of the world. However, the global effort required to achieve the Millennium Development Goals is huge. Micah Challenge continues to call on all parties to hold firm on the delivery of the existing commitment to 0.5 per cent of GNI and indicate the date by which they will achieve the international aid target of 0.7 cent of GNI. With only five years left to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, MDG 4 on child mortality and MDG 5 on maternal health are two of the goals that remain furthest behind schedule. Micah Challenge is calling on the Australian Government to focus its efforts on achieving these goals. Health programs need to be a cornerstone of the Australian foreign aid program. There is strong evidence to suggest that health spending is highly effective in saving and improving lives and has a good return on investment in both a moral and economic sense. It is the catalyst for breaking the poverty cycle. The World Health Organisation estimates that to achieve these healthThese related MDGs will require $50-60 billion a year in global development assistance. Of this figure, Australia's 'fair share' million by 2012-13. For the coming financial year, Australia has only budgeted $642 per million for health aid spending. Furthermore, over the coming five years, projected funding for the basic health and infectious diseases sector is budgeted to decline as a proportion of Australia's foreign aid program from its current estimated proportion of 13.27 per cent in 2011-12 to 9.66 per cent in 2015-16. This decrease is coming despite commitments from the Australian government to the new Global Strategy for Child and Maternal Health and the formation of a new international alliance, including Australia, on child and maternal health. Micah Challenge is calling on all parties to support the scaling up of aid to health to reach 20 per cent of the overseas development assistance budget by 2015-16. people have had their voice heard in this House tonight.",204

304,Mr FLETCHER,MAIN COMMITTEE," This poor response to complaints about fraud motion in response to, first of all, the government to individual Australians whose perpetrate fraud under the Home Insulation government to provide information to the Australian under the Home Insulation Program and how cases Rudd-Gillard government's Home Insulation maladministration and mismanagement from start is maintaining this sorry record of inadequate up the mess. Let me therefore outline the unhappy experiences matter and the conspicuous lack of assistance government in response. Let me start with the the body corporate of an apartment complex from the government that a claim for insulation However, no authorisation of the installation corporate. On investigation, it became apparent that cheap foil insulation had been scattered that they may never be provided with advice about Efficiency and his Department, have failed to of claims of fraud that have been made or of about the outcome of investigations into alleged taxpayers who have funded the Home Insulation of fraud that have been made or of instances of to home owners on an ongoing basis concerning of suspected fraud reported by those home owners; random home inspections from within allocated public concerning investigations into fraud under the that include the number of: received, identified in the Government commissioned and those that resulted in prosecutions, along seek restitution from fraudulent claimants, and the motion relates to the Gillard government's in the Home Insulation Program. I moved this appallingly dismissive attitude shown by this homes and apartments have been used to Program; and, secondly, the failure of the public generally about instances of fraud are being investigated and prosecuted. The Program has been a catalogue of to finish. The government, I am sad to say, performance in the way it is attempting to clean of a number of my constituents in this which they have received from the Gillard  in Hornsby. Mr Napper received notification had been made against the property. of insulation had been given by the body that the complex had been broken into and in the ceilings of a number of apartments in the NA complex. Significant damage was done in the thousand. Accordingly, after Mr Napper raised for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, assistance in getting a proper inspection of and trespass were investigated. I received a minister, well known to my colleague the member response he said that three inspections Subsequent inspections occurred and As to the investigations for fraud, let me 'The information provided by Mr Napper in relation to be installed at the complex has been referred Energy Efficiency under the program compliance While the government may not advise Mr Napper be assured that the Australian government will very much; we will not be assured. We want moved this motion. The letter indicates that 'cases of fraud will other authorities for potential prosecution,' by the government that he may never be advised told that he and his affected unit holders investigation occurred, whether anybody was sought. None of this is occurring as you would Indeed, extraordinarily, Mr Napper has not interview him or other residents regarding this are left with is an extra $800 strata Let me turn to the second case, concerning executive committee of a strata complex in claimants who can only be assumed to be fraudulent was forged, and the assumption is that it was Mr Black reported the matter to the Department was told, in the now familiar refrain, that they minister asking for full details of how this matter response. Once again, this shows a scandalous whose homes have been broken into and taxpayers this whole sorry mess. Let me turn to a third area of known phantom insulations, where installers have carried out.

No, thank you to see the evidence, and that is why I have be referred to the Australian Federal Police or but let me repeat: outrageously, Mr Napper is told of the final outcome of his referral.

I have yet to receive a disregard for the legitimate interests of persons who have been responsible for paying for problems under the Home Insulation Program: claimed for a non-existent house or for work not Nelson of Killara-no relations, I hasten to add, received a letter from the department their property when in fact no installation had personally investigated the cavity space in their a qualified installer, I can tell when pink batts NA Dr and Mrs Nelson wrote to me, and they said: to what the Australian government intends to money obtained fraudulently and if they companies involved.' I am very sorry to have want to know that-sadly, the Rudd-Gillard wrote to the minister on their behalf in April absolutely nothing. I was required to write When did I receive a response? March 2011-a secretary! And what did the response say? You of investigative activities will normally remain sorry saga that Australian households are investigations involving their own homes have occurred, what the outcomes are and The situation experienced by my constituents motion that the parliament should condemn disregard for the interests of Australian government to provide information to homeowners perpetrate fraud. I need hardly remind the chamber ways under the Home Insulation Program, as the Auditor-General's review, including irrespective of dwelling size; claiming for households double-dipping between Commonwealth removing older insulation to make the customer materials; and batts being cut in half to spread being laid properly. After my constituents and I failed to get satisfactory I followed up this matter by asking the minister information about the Home Insulation Program, information about fraud; how many claims of investigations had been; what prosecutions been made and what information was being of fraud. The minister failed to answer the statement that a forensic audit had taken place. have no detailed information. The Australian questions. They deserve to know the full chamber, they are paying for. We hear from the conduct'. Let us see the proof. Let us come to the final point: there is very the forensic audit that was conducted. Yet there remain uninvestigated.

Therefore, based upon know are replicated in many other electorates, needs to be much more thorough in its investigation 'We would particularly like to be advised as do, if anything, about the recovery of all this intend to pursue and prosecute the persons or to say to my constituents that-while they may government does not want to tell them that.

I heard a follow-up letter, which I did six months later. dazzling performance from the parliamentary guessed it: 'Even after completion, the details confidential.' So, once again, we have the to be kept in the dark about whether fraud occurred at all and, if the investigations have whether restitution is being sought. more than justifies the action proposed in this the Rudd-Gillard government for showing householders. This motion also requires the whose properties have been used to that fraud has been perpetrated in myriad has been detailed in both the Hawke review and early claiming; claiming the maximum rebate dwellings that do not meet the program criteria; and state or territory programs; appear eligible; use of non-compliant them further or thrown into the roof without answers in the cases I have instanced, a detailed question on notice seeking including how the government was seeking fraud had been received; what the outcomes of had taken place; what claims of restitution had made available to homeowners who made claims questions. He merely referred to his public This is nothing more than a whitewash. We people deserve to have full answers to these scale of this fraud which, need I remind the government that it 'will not tolerate fraudulent little information provided about the scope of is evidence that there are more issues which contacted me with concerns about yet first investigation, it appears that there is a these instances in my own electorate, which I the coalition believes that the government of the fraud which has occurred in the NA housing insulation program. For that reason, immediately authorise an additional 50,000 funds. We need to see some action from this that they will not tolerate fraud-we need to other Australians are suffering and we need investigated.",242
305,Mr HUSIC,MAIN COMMITTEE," While I have I seek to provide detail that would demonstrate do take exception to some of the references claiming that we have been dismissive in relation will clearly demonstrate otherwise. I have to here before you today to speak against the opposition's Program, because it seems that not very long similarly inane and vexatious motion. It was realised it was on 23 May this year that I delivered their standards, this latest attempt by the coalition program is both bizarre and outrageous. The House may wish to reflect that on 23 for Flinders to initiate a commission of inquiry despite the fact that the government had supported program itself and accepted their findings. The supported by the House. This should have repudiated a petty, cheap and political point-scoring have been left alone once and for all to manage of the program. But now, six weeks later, we House has already considered. But why should form in hijacking the good work being done in the government with vexatious motions and bills. As I mentioned in my last speech, in November government's safety inspection programs by safety inspection results-again, a petty performance Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, for Flinders a private briefing on the inspection this year, was defeated in the House. So what is the opposition's latest revelation they claim they have broken a major story program. As we have said a number of times, implementation phases of the Home Insulation particularly when it comes to fraud. The operators defrauded the program. This particularly installations', in which fraud could have been payment for installations not actually undertaken. that some operators have not fulfilled their program in completing a proper and compliant installation. this motion also calls on the government to random home inspections from within allocated government. It is not good enough to assure us see the proof, because my constituents and many to have some assurance that this is being regard for the member for Bradfield and while that regard through the course of this speech, I that he made in his contribution today-namely, to this issue when the detail in this speech confess to having a sense of deja vu as I stand latest motion on the Home Insulation ago I was before the House arguing against a only when I checked Hansard this morning that I that speech-only six weeks ago. Even by to score cheap political points out of the May we debated a bill proposed by the member into the Home Insulation Program. This was a number of independent inquiries into the bill was put to the vote on 2 June and was not been the end of the matter. The House had exercise, and the government should the difficult processes involved in the closure are here again once more debating issues that we be surprised? The coalition has excellent closing down the program by trying to distract last year the opposition tried to derail the forcing us to prematurely release information on by the opposition, particularly when the Greg Combet, had offered the member results. That motion, like the bill on 2 June about the Home Insulation Program? This time by revealing that fraud was committed under the there were significant issues in the design and Program-we have never denied the fact, government has long accepted that unscrupulous involved what has been termed 'phantom committed by registered installers claiming The government has also been concerned obligations under the terms and conditions of the NA These are issues that have appalled the them very seriously, but we do not need a frivolous of that. In his speech in March last year, objectives in winding down the Home Insulation processes to deal with issues of non-compliance pursue those individuals and companies engaged quickly to request an Auditor-General's investigation year. Minister Combet also supported the engagement fraud was perpetrated under the program. identifying how fraud was committed under painstaking analysis over a number of months. was developed to ensure that all cases of fraud result of all this had and crucial work, a number year aimed at targeting those who had already program. This involved a joint operation Department of Climate Change and Energy executed across three states. Also, the department program aimed at recovering all the debt owed What I have just described is a focused organisations to tackle fraud under the program. it can contribute in assisting these organisations and by the other stunts they have moved. unscrupulous operators by the House passing one minute that, despite the processes I have seriously? I would like to make some key points program is dealt with by the Department of would reassure all members of the House that taken seriously. When allegations of fraud or review is conducted to consider the specific business concerned, to assess the matter fully action. Depending on the result of that review, include compliance action or referring it alleged fraud against the Commonwealth. It is not that of too many people who investigate process midstream to complainants on the investigation, because, frankly, inappropriate successful potential prosecution. Similarly, investigations have not been responded to would prejudice future action. We have maintained a consistent line throughout because we are trying to hide something but compromises the hard work being done to non-compliance. But the opposition want us to government, and we take the need to investigate motion from the opposition to remind us Minister Combet said that one of his five key Program was to identify and put in place and fraud. He also said he would rigorously in this behaviour. That is why he moved into the program in early March last of a forensic auditor to investigate how KPMG's forensic accounting was crucial in the program, and this involved careful and Concurrently, a fraud categorisation model were investigated and dealt with properly. As a of activities were undertaken on 2 March this allegedly committed serious fraud under the between the Australian Federal Police and the Efficiency in which 35 search warrants were launched a comprehensive debt recovery from fraudulent and non-compliant activities. and intensive process undertaken by a range of I am not sure how the opposition thinks that in such complex work by moving this motion What is to be gained in the pursuit of these this motion? Is the opposition suggesting for just outlined, we are not taking the issue about how fraud and non-compliance under the Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. First, I all complaints received by the department are serious non-compliance are received, an initial allegation and the track record of the insulation and determine the most appropriate course of the most appropriate course of action may to a law enforcement agency for investigating not the policy of the department, and I imagine fraud of this nature, to provide feedback or status of matters undergoing compliance or release of that information would jeopardise a media and public inquiries in regard to in detail because, again, inappropriate release this process over the last 16 months, not because we are trying to ensure that nothing track down those who have committed fraud or continually jeopardise the effort by demanding NA that we release specific information about fraud, in some cases because it would be counterproductive. And what is the motivation for it? Is it contributing wants to do is grandstand and breathe some sort whose spirit has well and truly left the building. has on the hard work many people have undertaken unscrupulous operators to account. The motion also calls for the government random home inspections from within allocated April on safety inspections provided a strategy point of going through additional investigations? I reiterate some of the points of the strategy has always been the main priority of the Program. Accordingly, we have established foil and non-foil installed under the program. householders were offered safety inspections, removed, or, on the advice of a licensed electrician, the Home Insulation Safety Program the 150,000 households insulated with non-foil assessment. On top of that, based on independent and Company, the government will conclude committed inspections, which means the government inspections until a minimum of 150,000 is reached. The government will also finalise all inspections number of households with foil that have contactable, despite repeated efforts. To households the government will continue to until June next year. The government has committed the program and will release details of the information on 20 April. So, clearly, we have the matter and demonstrate steps being taken opposition is demanding we throw this advice simply for cheap political point scoring, wasting It is about time those opposite dropped",245
306,Mr LAMING,MAIN COMMITTEE," In debates be running in parallel, it is important to remember spend taxpayers' money effectively. Where concession that this money was not expended to do everything possible to (a) ensure it where the money was very poorly spent and At the moment the case has been made by vexatious to further question this program simply down on this matter. With the greatest respect, this government has made to examine and remediate which we are simply not in a position to do effectively to the process? No. All it of life into the corpse of a political stunt They have no regard for the impact that this over the last year to bring these to immediately authorise an additional 50,000 funds. The major statement we released on 20 for closing down the programs, so what is the that I made in my speech on 23 May. Safety government in remediating the Home Insulation comprehensive safety inspection plans for both In the Foil Insulation Safety Program all those with the option of having the insulation safety switches would be installed. Under government committed to inspect a minimum of insulation. Those were targeted based on risk analysis from the CSIRO and from Booz both the HISP and FISP on completion of the will continue to undertake targeted under FISP, noting that there are still a either refused an inspection or have not been provide an extra level of reassurance to those offer inspections to households that want them, to providing an independent analysis of inspection results. We publicly released this gone to great lengths to try to be transparent on to remedy the situation. Once again, the out and that we commit to further inspections the parliament's time and scaring the public. the stance and let us get on with our work. like these, where both arguments appear to exactly why we come here, and that is to government has made a very significant effectively, I think, as a government, we want does not happen again and (b) actually identify take action where people abused the program. the member for Chifley that it is both inane and because a motion has previously been voted the motion pertained to the very efforts that the damage done by this program. With NA the greatest respect to those efforts, they still the dwellings that have been insulated. Australia, in many cases this program was operators around the country where I think the great blockage here is: the further this government wants to skim over this as people in Australia who right now have suffered for Bradfield, has pointed out, to their homes have had foil insulation ripped out and inconvenience of having the foil placed nothing in this program to actually insulate government. So they are left without insulation government greatly but it does bother both live in subtropical environments and would billion program. Of course, let's remember why we embarked carbon emissions. Ultimately, it was about forgotten that now. This was about abating price between $50 and $90 per tonne abated, absolutely unsupportable program had we looked really left with the ultimate effort then, against the global financial crisis. The former than any other achievement, bar probably insulation program-not only the diabolical have been made to clean it up. It is not enough 'We've carried out 35 search warrants.

The the opposition, know the further you dig the more is an opportunity to ameliorate and fix the government. We do not do this because we have the government; we do it because Australians been sequestered for no good reason other than off on a poorly designed program. expect too much of our federal departments?

Unfortunately, we see that it is all about the political interest. interest. If those who brought the motion to rather than publicity, if they were interested would have chosen a different course of action. The government is actively pursuing businesses conditions of the Home Insulation Program. with a value of approximately $24½ million. businesses that are under investigation for Program installers draw on a range of information. alluded to by the member for Bradfield earlier roof inspection reports, desktop audits, complaints third parties. The government has committed to work agencies across all jurisdictions to deal with March 2011, following detailed investigations simultaneously executed 35 search warrants Queensland and Victoria-and 25 businesses acted fraudulently under the Home Also in March 2011, under its debt recovery letters of demand to businesses registered those who received assistance under the Insulation later found to have been ineligible for such demand will previously have received a non-compliance an opportunity to demonstrate compliance correspondence was issued in relation to 'voluntary advised of an administrative error on the part given 14 days from the date of the non-compliance department in relation to the The department has arrangements in place The Federal Police has provided an outposted review of cases.

The motion before the House gives us the are at with fraud and compliance activities in when we read the motion before the House, It has absolutely nothing to do with the public this House were truly interested in prosecution in an outcome rather than a headline, then they that have not complied with the terms and We are currently holding over 20,000 claims, Of these, around 6,500 claims were submitted by fraud.

307,Ms ODWYER,MAIN COMMITTEE," I think it Climate Change and Energy Efficiency nor and Energy Efficiency have decided to front Insulation Program and their lack of accountability to the speeches delivered by the member Chifley. There was a common thread in those talked about how this motion was a stunt, how frivolous. This is an absolutely outrageous government does not like to be held to account, and implemented. What this motion asks for today is a measure government has brought into effect. There can at the examples that exist in our electorates. electorate of Higgins involving Ms Felicity approached by an insulation installer who government's offer. The installer assured her and that there would not be any problem with insulation on 9 December but only installed laying it over the manhole in her ceiling to make been covered. The company received the full only later that Ms Kiddle discovered this entered her roof for an unrelated matter that Ms Kiddle was very concerned about this. safety implications of a job that was not properly bill had been paid for a job that was not properly constituent would do and contacted the hotline. was that she could fill in a form from Consumer the work and if she wanted an inspection done very important fact. We are not simply talking done. It is much more serious than that. It is fraud. It was a phantom job, and yet it I did what any responsible member of parliament explained this fact to the minister but I have organisations and others. Major matters are has referred several matters. As the associated for us to comment further on these cases this side of the House are more interested in hullabaloo in this place for nothing other than a to prosecute the investigation in a fraud through the court. It is our intention to ensure who are ineligible for those funds, or where vigorously to ensure that no taxpayers' that money are not entitled to it. I is very revealing that neither the Minister for the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change up today to justify and explain the Home for this program. I listened very carefully for Throsby and, before him, the member for speeches. The member for Chifley in particular it was petty to bring it forward and how it was thing for the government to say. We know that the particularly for programs that it has designed of accountability for the program that this be no better way of looking at it than looking I will talk specifically of an example in my Kiddle. She is an elderly resident who was knocked on her door and told her about the that they were registered with the government installing insulation. They installed that a fraction of the insulation required by simply it appear as though the entire installation had payment from the government of $1,200. It was fraud. It was not until a professional plumber the insulation job was found to be incomplete. She was concerned not only about the potential done but for the Australian taxpayer-that a completed. She did what any right-thinking The response that she got from this hotline Affairs Victoria if she was not satisfied with she could pay for that herself. This belies a about not being happy with a job that had been that the job itself had not been done, which is was paid for by the Australian taxpayer. would do and I wrote to the minister. I not received one more piece of information about NA what the government has done to try and rectify constituent to solve a problem of the government's not good enough that the government refuses created. It is not just this issue that it refuses issues to do with the safety inspection scheme the very traumatic experience of having part one o'clock in the morning. He had a safety that there was no fault in the structural integrity back to us from the parliamentary secretary, of the program. So it is not clear that the safety are going to the core issues that have been raised to fraud or to the structural integrity This program has cost the Australian taxpayer homes and, unfortunately, destroying four account. It is not improper for us to hold the this.",250
308,Mr NEUMANN,MAIN COMMITTEE," I read carefully House. I commend the member for Throsby and and their detailed response to the government's scheme. One of the things that draw my attention government to give details of alleged fraud, investigated and to give details about prosecutions convention called the sub judice convention on many topics freely in the chamber. But there current court cases as that would prejudice happen in court or things that would undermine particular. In the national parliament, members constituency issues or national issues but international should not do is talk about cases that are prosecutions. Parliament is the people's place, but if talks about waste a lot-what a waste this motion member for Throsby and the member for Chifley debated in this chamber on many occasions. contains wording that once shows the coalition's protections or legal presumptions. This motion fraudsters, which the Australian public and want that. They want to talk about their own talk about the national interest at all. We do not by actions nor by words prejudice authorities. We do not prejudice the rights funds tied up in the effective operation and money to be involved in court cases. When this fraud. It is always left in the hands of the creation.

While we as of small programs, small financial transfers areas and small cohorts in different parts of our time in public life will be whether we have in remote and rural Australia around so that see in the mainstream. It is great to focus on the prism of the national quality framework first raised back on 3 July 2008, to see some childhood and later education. Secondly, I will attendance and compare them to worldwide and, fourthly, the economic implications of school NA When we listen to our words today decades fill our 20 minutes with examples of what achieving any change whatsoever?' There successful achievement in getting Aboriginal kids but our job is not to continue to expand on the place, and that is to turn our words-our reality, particularly in remote and rural Australia. statistics that talk about only 24 per cent of in their community and 40 per cent of Indigenous per cent of Indigenous Australians actually graduating magnified enormously the more remote or rural communities around the Tanami of Yuendumu school attendance at the same time as we were intervention. It was not through any fault of send your child to school or face the impact quarantining was extended to absolutely everyone, with an almost anthropological fascination about it and measuring it-but school attendance flatlined for three years after we brought this jump, and it has sat there at 60 per cent ever since. My great concern in those prescribed communities children simply do not go to school. I will from now: it is Australia's greatest human rights go to school. There is no greater tragedy for education predict the futures of kids. We know safety. But we are getting nowhere. As I said, through the prism of the national 2008. We then talked about it again in October delighted to know that on 2 July 2009 we accepted document-so there went one year. And now I Australians, what have we delivered to you conversation started years ago. The kids who of the way through primary school, and what press release in May saying that they were looking middle of this year, an arrangement for Mornington Island and Cairns. What about Nothing. It is one thing to run around and selected communities, but ultimately we need here. One is the quality numerator-that is, good the quality is, if the denominator of school nothing. The great challenge is that we will have has turned up at school but they are not there are not there on the other days from now, the question will be not, 'Could we a government is doing?' but, 'Were we actually are scarce few examples in this country of to school. I can start with a list of reasons, list of reasons. We have one single role in this good words on both sides of the chamber-into So, while I have seen very, very alarming Indigenous Australians even having a high school Australians completing year 12 but only 10 from year 12, let us remember that it is the area is. So, in areas like the Warlpiri and Lajamanu, we have seen massive falls in attempting the Northern Territory emergency the intervention. The intervention made it clear: of quarantining. The great problem is that and here we are, three to four years later, with the intervention-watching, looking, talking has not changed. No, school attendance intervention in. We got an initial 20 per cent is that 40 to 45 per cent of Indigenous say it again, and it will be remembered decades violation that Indigenous Australians do not this nation. We know that levels of maternal that should be our No. 1 priority after child quality framework, we talked about it in July 2008. Then, Indigenous Australians can be a revised version of the previous year's move forward to 2011, and I say to Indigenous in the form of Children and Family Centres? This were most vulnerable in grade 1 are now most can I report to you? I can report that we had a at setting up, in temporary premises, in the Doomadgee, Mareeba, Mount Isa, Ipswich, the other 16 remote Queensland communities? look for pilot schemes and roll things out into remember we have two concurrent objectives how well we teach the kids. But no matter how attendance is not there then quality means a rollcall and report that an Indigenous child at lunchtime. They are gone by lunch, and they when we are not counting the roll. NA I now move to the second issue, the social much pressure on bureaucrats and, in particular, Indigenous liaison workers out to pick kids long we have hung off the excuses of not having excuse not to go to school. But it is the other no corner of this nation where there is not a law fact. We are failing to apply ordinary laws Indigenous Australia. We are effectively creating the very rules that apply in most of Australia people would ask for is that the rules are applied. As I said in my second point, from a social and incapacitated people in every community. So it is beholden upon us to identify those child protection issue and that is No. 1. We reports of completely uninvestigated child welfare being fixed we cannot even talk about education. I have a fair bit of respect for teachers better skilled teachers in remote areas and all very important issues of continuity and quality denominator here is attendance. If kids cannot And if kids will not stay at school because then we have an issue where we must ask our rethink education models and admit that, as was education was a multigenerational process. It at school and be accommodated in school grounds. reconsider the way we deliver a Western education discussion in any community about parts of support or have concerns about, but ultimately decades ago. Fred Hollows identified this in the seventies. Indigenous Australia that education fundamentally families who send their kids to school. I can the end of the tunnel, but that is an argument attendance, and that comes only through parental Indigenous communities parents do tell me just send my kids to school or not, I'm quarantined. my efforts in sending a kid to school.

That is a failure, and without that who say we need more resourcing, that we need that we need to keep them there longer. They are of education. But, as I have said before, the turn up then their parents need to bring them. the minute the parents leave the children leave, parents to stay at school. We may well have to traditionally the case in Indigenous Australia, is quite possible that caregivers need to remain I just ask the question: are we prepared to to promote attendance? I will have any the syllabus which Indigenous Australians do not this is a discussion we should have had He found out a century too late for had to be a buy-in process from the very understand that it looks like there are no jobs at for another day because No. 1 has to be school acceptance of its importance.

Then there is a would like to see more flexible state When Marion Scrymgour, as the NT education pre-eminence and then the intervention backed education at the start of the day, I can see out the entire cultural underpinnings of bilingual other part of Australia teaches languages other have lost that in many parts of Indigenous Australia We need to bring that back, in no way threatening to be able to learn in English, so English must right of a community to have cultural and traditional disaster and disengagement. What we cannot the ages of 10 or 12 when they go through subincision lose them to education until they have gone between 12 and 16 we have our greatest challenge Australia, within our schools. The answer to that extended families and to talk to the senior to talk to aunties and elders and ask them what terms of keeping them at school. Once we what is valued in a curriculum I have the sense that we are caught somewhere approach an individual for not sending a child trying to negotiate with elders. But in the middle remaining part of Indigenous culture is the and say that part of the parenting payment sending your kid to school. If they are not question as to whether they are fulfilling children. Noel Pearson said in his Quarterly essay Australia not as being doubly disadvantaged having the best of both.

But to remove the elements in their curriculum is inviting afford is to lose these wonderful young kids at and other traditional processes and we through their final ceremony. In that period in retaining kids, particularly in remote is simple: the answer to that is to talk about caregiver-who is not always the mother. We need we have to do for the children in your care in have had that discussion in a community about it becomes far more powerful. either side of this debate. Centrelink can to school, and then at a community level we are there we need to remember that the strongest family group. Perhaps we have to talk to parents is being a parent and part of being a parent is sending them to school, I would genuinely ask the their obligations in a modern society to your that we need to start thinking about Indigenous but as being able to walk in both worlds and that Indigenous Australia, if it thinks about or more from now, will say: 'We can retain our there 100 per cent of the time. We can go and our communities and have the best of mainstream and the land.' Perhaps that is where we are to have that debate with itself, because that is I know that if that was to occur then education we need to recognise the important role that I cannot see why in remote Indigenous just teacher aides; they can be fundamental in a school. They could come along and do what NA auxiliaries do in hospitals, which is support Batchelor college the important role that colleges. That should apply in every community we can afford is to set up creches, preschools encouraged to hand the kids over the fence work, but leaving Indigenous parents completely over that fence is not the future. We may have to be novel; we may have to should never back away from here: we must we achieve in the mainstream in remote Australia. departments flexibility, supporting the principals same time and having Centrelink work very closely go to school. In the end, I appreciate that not all parents school every day. But that is a child welfare to take those children and talk to the extended school. As I have said before, we need Once we achieve that, the final part is Everywhere you go, you will see worldwide incredible things to a family's earnings over kids at school-and particularly when they hit grade 9 when there is no high school Those figures that tell us that only one actually graduate from grade 12 present us should be shifting large numbers of remote through Newstart.

The Cancer Council observed the Interphone suggest normal usage of mobile phones-which 12 months-could cause brain cancer, but results were consistent with other research in patients, classified as the heavy users, with where they held their mobile phones. At this an increase in the amount of cases in the Cancer Council are suggesting more study needs heavy mobile phone users. There are also calls will have on our children.

It would made was to put their trust in the I can do no better than to refer to an article Sydney Morning Herald on this subject, describes Ross Tarrant as a clown, with zero super investors. This article recounts how commissions from Trio-Astarra for putting financial planners who did look at the Trio-Astarra did not stack up. They knew that something quite looks too good to be true, as the cliche goes, encourage their clients to invest in Trio. The but Ross Tarrant has also charged investors per cent for each investment and 1.95 per cent clients.

Not only that, for putting them into this fund. He received 3.3 in annual fees for the advice he gave these $40 million locally and the fees of 3.3 per cent from Trio-Astarra, it is a bit rich for Mr Tarrant that he is actually the victim in this affair. By good people of the Illawarra for a ride in this blame, claiming that everyone else is responsible is a friend of those who have lost everything.

Nothing could be further from the Sharon Bird, I made numerous representations investors in self-managed superannuation they were not invested in APRA managed funds, very seriously and exploring all available options.
