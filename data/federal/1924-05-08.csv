This subject was discussed on several occasions early in the session.

The matter is one of urgent necessity. There is no doubt about the urgency of it, ancl I cannot understand why the Minister is not prepared to state his reasons for or against the appointment of the Committee.

73,Mr KILLEN,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL," That in the opinion of this House all Government work should, as far as possible, be carried out by contract..",22
74,Mr FENTON,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"Maribyrnong) [3.10]. - As I addressed myself at some l e n g t h to t h is issue when last the question was before the House, I have n o in t e n t i o n now of delaying honourable members. I feel, however, that I must say it is absolutely esseutial, in a House like this, elected as it is by the people of the Comfacts monwealth, that honourable members should take an intelligent interest in the progress of events, and have a clear understanding of the manner in which important public works are carried out in this country. Unfortunately, it appears that, even at this late hour of the day, it is necessary for the voice of the missionary to be heard amongst those who live politically in the dark ages, to do what is possible to educate them to the advantages of a properly organized system for the carrying out of Government works. I haye no hesitation in saying that whenever those who are regarded as authorities in this matter-me n not necessarily of the same political colour as myself or other honourable members on this side of the Househave been asked which method-da y labour under proper supervision or contract-is the better for the carrying out of public works, they have stated that the balance of expert opinion was in favour of the day-labour system. In view of this testimony from the most highly-qualified engineers and contractors in the Commonwealth, I cannot conceive how any honourable member can attempt to justify the contract system. It has been tried certainly, but in connection with the bulk of our public works, even in the constituency represented by the honourable member for Riverina (Mr. .Killen), the responsible authorities have had to resort to the day-labour system. The most important public body in Victoria- I refer to the Metropolitan Board of Works-approve s of this method. The Board consists, for the most part, bf meu representing municipal councils throughout the metropolitan area, and in recent times it has carried out public works involving ths expenditure of considerable sums of money. I believe that on many occasions when tenders have been altogether too high- I do not suggest collusion between, ;dontiractors-p n the advice of its engineers the Board has carried out the works by day labour, which is now its recognised system. As far as I have been able to gather, this is proving most satisfactory. The pace at which work is being carried on is as good, if .not better than under the contract system, and the Board's experts are thoroughly satisfied with the quality of the work that is being done. I state these to show that one of the most important public bodies in the Commonwealth has, after a long experience of the contract system, reverted to day labour. If the contract system is the best, as the honourable member for Riverina would have the people of the Commonwealth believe, it is strange that he does not advocate its adoption for practically every class of work.",22
75,Mr KILLEN,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,I advocate its adoption whenever that is possible.,23
76,Mr FENTON,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,Would the honourable member apply it to his own household? Would he apply it to the Public Service of the Commonwealth?,23
77,Mr KILLEN,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"If possible, yes. M.r. FENTON - Would he apply it to our banking institutions?",23
78,Mr KILLEN,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,It is uot possible.,23
79,Mr FENTON,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,Does the honourable member believe then that the day-labour system should be adopted only in connection with certain works? Does he say that it could not be applied to clerical work ?,23
80,Mr KILLEN,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"If it could, by all means adopt it.",23
81,Mr FENTON,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"If the honourable member were to seriously suggest its adoption in our banking institutions he would be laughed out of the Board Room. In this matter I need not appeal to the Minister, for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart), who represents a district where, I suppose, more railway construction has been done with day labour than in any other part of Victoria.",23
82,Mr WHITSITT,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"I""suppos e there are not many agitators there.",23
83,Mr FENTON,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"The honourable member himself was an agitator. That is the reason for' his presence in this House. Practically all railway construction in Victoria for the past 25 years has been carried out with day labour. Proposed neAv railways are referred to the Railways Standing Committee for investigation ancl report. ' That body calls witnesses to give evidence as to the prospects of the proposed lines, obtains estimates from responsible engineers, and then the work is carried out by the Railways Commissioners under the day-labour system, wMh the result that the taxpayers of Victoria are better off to the extent of hundreds of thousands of pounds than they would have been had the work laeem done under contract.",23
84,Mr KILLEN,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,D.on' t you believe it .,24
85,Mr FENTON,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"I do believe it. I judge by results. Except for a week or a fortnight perhaps, Labour has not been in power in Victoria; the State - has always been under so-called Nationalist Governments. Yet so convinced are they of the superiority of day labour construction that they never think of calling for tenders for the building of any railway, whether it be in the level Mallee country or in districts which present great engineering difficulties: In the district in which I live the Railway 'Commissioners went to considerable trouble to provide equipment and accommodation for their workmen in order that a comparatively small line might be constructed by day labour.",24
86,Mr MCNEIL,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,The same policy is followed by the Electricity Commission and the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission.,24
87,Mr FENTON,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"That is so; they, too, carry out all their works by day labour. The Electricity Commissioners are a live body of men. They have had to contend against serious difficulties .and a big in the prices of materials, as a result of which the scheme they control is costing slightly more than was anticipated when it was authorized by Parliament, but when it is in full operation and all the initial difficulties have been overcome, the people of Victoria will be grateful to the State Parliament and to the constructing engineers. Throughout Victoria great sums of money have been saved by the construction of railway lines by day labour. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) interjected sarcastically about the EastWest railway. I am confident that if that line had been built by contractors the cost to the Commonwealth would have been considerably more than it was, and the results would not have been as good. If the honourable member has any practical knowledge, and will coiapare works carried out under the contract and day labour systems respectively he will agree that day labour, under strict supervision, gives the best results. A workman who is being paid a reasonable daily wage has no reason for scamping his. job. In the final analysis the contract system is. only day lalbowr plus the 'Contractor and his profits.",24
88,Mr STEWART,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,-'Sometime s there areno profits.,24
89,Mr FENTON,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"That is so, but contractors do not develop into wonderfully rich men as a result of losses. I do not say that every .contract is profitable, but I know of many contractors in Victoria who have been very successful. A contractor who knows his business surrounds himself with a first class staff of men, and. Swanson Brothers, Shillabeer, and others owe their success to the fact that, they have paid their men a little more than other contractors were willing to pay, because they knew that it T>aid them to keep good men about them.",24
90,Mr KILLEN,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,And they got value for what they paid.,24
91,Mr FENTON,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"Excep t where the profiteer is operating, there are few circumstances in which .one does not get value for what .he pays. Visitors, from other parts of the world testify that the Australian workman is the best in the world. I well remember the testimony to that eifect given by Mr Delprat, of the Broken HilT Proprietary Company, who is in no sense rise- a Labour sympathiser. He was giving evidence before the Works Committee in regard to the Newcastle steel works, an enterprise by which every man in this community, whether he be labourer, farmer, or manufacturer, should loyally stand. I knew that for a number of years Hoskins Bros, had been carrying on the same class of work, the construction of railway rails, and I said to Mr Delprat, "" Y o u have started great works, in which you are employing thousands of men, and the works are proceeding most satisfactorily. How have you managed?"" He replied, "" We had, of course, to import a few leading hands, but beyond these all employed in the works .are Australians."" I mentioned that the industry must be practically new to most of them, and he said, "" Yes, but there is not a more adaptable nor a better workman in the world than the Australian workman."" That is the testimony of a man who has had experience of workmen in the United States of America and in Europe.",24
92,Mr WHITSITT,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"That is, when he tries. Mr Fenton"" - I might say that the honourable member is a very good workman when he tries, and how would he like it.",25
93,Mr WHITSITT,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"I am always a-trier. Mfr. FENTON - That is the honourable member's opinion; but others may think differently. Why should honourable members cast a slur upon the Australian workman? Are we going to say that because in this country ""there are a few black-hearted criminals, all the people are criminals ? Are we to say that because there are a few wasters amongst both employers and employees they are typical of Australian employers and workmen ?",25
94,Mr LISTEH,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,-No one said that.,25
95,Mr FENTON,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"I have spoken to British and American workmen who have worked beside the Australian workman, and their opinion has been that the Australian workman works too fast for them altogether. No one can deny the merits of the Australian workman who thinks for a moment of the work done by the hornyhanded pioneers of Australia and by the handful of people in .this great continent. The man who would stand up in this Parliament and say that Australian workmen have not done a fair thing would be, not only a libeller of his fellow men, but a libeller of his country. A ll the great works in Australia, are the handiwork of the Australian workmen. The great works and buildings that have been carried out in Australia are a magnificent testimony to the industry and a great monument to the skill of the Australian workman. We hear in this Blouse sometimes sneers at the expense of the Australian workman, but there is not a man in the Country party corner or on the Ministerial benches who, on the platform when electioneering, would say .that the Australian workman !s not worth his salt. Yet some say that sort of thing here.",25
96,Mr LISTEE,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"No , they do not. No one has made any such assertion.",25
97,Mr FENTON,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"We judge men by their actions as well as their words. Many of us on this side have had to work hard for a crust. I am not here to defend the waster, no matter in what line of life he may be employed. J have never stood up for the waster, and never shall. If honourable members oppo? site are going to search for wasters, I can take them to a place where they will find them. They will not be found amongst the workers, but amongst the men who are riding on the backs of the producers; I refer to the middlemen, who are taking what they are not entitled to from the pockets of the producers, and not to the workmen who are doing something to make the farm of the farmer better, and the run of the Australian squatter better. Where would the Australiau sheep-grower be were it not for the shearer, and where would the Australian farmer be were it not for the labourer on his land ? Where would the contractor in this country be were it not for the expert Australian workmen he is able to employ ? Let us be fair to the workmen of Australia, whatever our brand of politics. I say that the workmen of Australia are the best workmen in the world. I will stand to that on any platform and in any country. It is of no use for the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen) to attempt to protest and apologize now. He put this motion on the paper,' and he must stand by it . The people of Riverina will judge him, and I know that there are some splendid stalwarts in that district. I do not wish to say anything that may be regarded as offensive, but I must protest when I find a man standing up and. in a half-hearted way, trying to make out that the day-labour system is bad, and that Australian workmen are not good workmen unless they are driven all the time. I believe that the great bulk of the workmen of Australia will work well whether under the eye of the overseer or boss, or when the boss is a hundred miles away. Many of us in this House know what it is to work for wages, and also to employ men. I have known what it was to pay men to do work for me, and, speaking from my own experience, I say that very few workmen will take down an employer: The Australian workmen axe not only as honest, but I believe even more honest, than workmen in any other part of the world. We have had considerable experience of the construction of railway engines in this country. In this connection w.e had a somewhat sad experience recently, when it was proposed to send out of Australia for railway engines when we have our own workmen here able to construct them. That was a scandalous proposal, and I am sure the honourable - member for Corio (Mr Lister) does not - stand for that kind of thing. We have .'here the material and skilled labour* for 'jfche manufacture of railway requirements. I can refer honourable members to what has been done under the Railways Commissioners ih Victoria. I am speaking now, perhaps, of what occurred a few years ago, but we know that the thousands of workmen employed at the Newport Railway Workshops have done magnificent work. They have constructed railway engines at a cost £1,000 less per engine than the Baldwin Company of America could have constructed them for, and did better work. They have constructed all the girders required for our electric railways. All this work was done by day labour, and more cheaply and better than some of the work done under the contract system. I trust that, if this motion comes to a vote, the House will xise to the occasion. The motion proposes that the contract system shall be adopted for all Government work, and if it is passed, and the Minister for Works and Railways receives a tender for works, he may feel himself bound by the resolution of the House. Now his omcers may advise him that tenders are too high, and on that account he may refuse to accept them, but, if we pass a motion of this kind, he may feel himself bound by the vote of this House, and the passing of this motion will practically tie his hands. He may then say, "" The House, by resolution, has told me that I must insist upon the adoption of the contract system.""",25
98,Mr KILLEN,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,Onl y where practicable.,26
99,Mr FENTON,LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL,"It is true that the words "" as far as possible "" appear in the motion, but surely we do not desire to tie the hands of the Minister for Works and Railways in any way. When I had to do with tenders I know that it was always the practice in advertising to use the words, "" The lowest or auy tender not necessarily accepted."" I have frequently voted for the acceptance of a higher tender than the lowest' because I knew the contractor putting in the higher tender would do better work. I knew that he knew more about the work and would give a better job than the lowest tenderer, and that although the institution I represented might have to pay a few more pounds for. the job, it would be getting a better class of work than it would get from the lowest tenderer. I am sure' that the Minister for Works and Railways is in a position to say, from his own observation and experience, that work carried out by day labour is to be preferred to work carried out by contract labour, and that it is carried out as expeditiously as well as more efficiently. Under the contract system, if the clerk of works or the architect is not on the job, it is not uncommon for workmen to be told that defective work will do, and to have such work covered up. Some of the worse experiences we have had in connection with war service homes construction resulted from the' contract system. There are contractors who, today, ought to be in gaol, without the option of a fine, for the work that they did in the construction of war service homes. Yet I believe that some of these men have had the unblushing audacity to demand from the Government more money under their contracts. The names of those contractors should stink in the nostrils of the people of Australia, and particularly of the members of this House. From our experience of them we should be wary about adopting the contract system, in the future. If there is anv work which should be carefully carried out surely it is work done for the men who did their best in the time of crisis to serve Australia. In connection with war service homes construction scores of pages of sworn evidence are filled with references to contractors who tried to dip their hands into the pockets, not only of the taxpayers and the Government, but of the returned soldiers. These revelations warn me that we should keep clear of the bulk of contractors. I do not say that all contractors are alike, because I know that there are some who carry out their work faithfully and well, bnt one may say that the better class of work is that done by day labour. I can give a concrete instance in support of this statement, and it is that there has not been one yard of railway constructed in Victoria within the last 30 years by contract labour. Debate (on motion by Mr STEWART) adjourned. NA SPEAKER'S"" RULING .

Debate resumed from 3rd A p r i l (vide page 309), on motion by Mr STEWARTThat this Bill be now read a second time.",27
103,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Hunter) [3.48] The object of this Bill is to create a Commission to supervise the construction work at the Federal Capital. It is difficult to understand why this particular work should be placed under a Commission, as the Minister himself has said that the present arrangements are satisfactory, and that the Advisory Committee which now operates there is doing good work. One reason given for the change was that there is now dual control. pointed out that two Departments are operating in the Federal Territory, and that a change is desirable. I do not advocate dual control, but it is not a sufficient reason for creating a Commission to administer the Federal Territory. I see no legitimate reason why the administration of the Federal Capital should not be placed under the control of one Department-whicheve r is the most suitable. It has, however, been decided otherwise by Ministers. But to do what they propose will add to the cost of government in this country. It is proposed to create positions for three men, each of whom will be paid a good salary, in addition to travelling expenses. The President of the Commission is to receive £3,000 per annum and expenses, and each of the other Commissioners £2,000 and expenses. To-day only two members of the Advisory Committee are paid officials; the others receive expenses only. The cost of the Advisory Committee is a mere bagatelle in comparison with that - of the proposed Commission. The Minister admits that the Committee is doing excellent work, and took to himself credit for the progress which has been made in the construction of the various buildings and other works at Canberra. If everything has been progressing so satisfactorily, what is the reason for this contemplated change ? Ever since the commencement of the war jwe have been getting away from responsible government. While the war was in progress such action was understandable, but the Government appears to have forgotten that it is time we were returning to normal conditions. The control which it is proposed to give to this Commission should be retained by this House. I shall probably be told that control will not be taken from Parliament. But, like many other measures, this Bill gives power to make regulations, and, although provision is made for such regulations to be laid on the table of this House, and for objection to them to be taken within 30 days of presentation, honourable members know that very often littl e notice is taken of them. Consequently, administration is left entirely - in the hands of the Board or Commission which frames the regulations. While the Government retain control, matters which honourable members consider should be ventilated can be brought up in this House, It was and the persons concerned can be dealt with if necessary, and first-hand knowledge of matters pertaining to the Federal Territory can be obtained. I am opposed to this Commission, because the time has arrived when, except in special cases, we should no longer delegate our powers to such bodies. I do not know whether the Government desires to pass over it s authority and responsibility Boards-and Commissions in order to escape was criticism because of its composite nature. Postmaster-General's It is probable that in the present Ministry, composed as it is of membelieve bers of two parties, many difficulties sent themselves, and that in order to the line of least resistance, it has been decided to adopt this course in connection with the Federal Territory. payers of this country will not long be satisfied with the present state of affairs in connection with many of our underthing takings. The Advisory Committee composed of able and competent menMessrs. Sulman, de Burgh, Ross, Goodtime win, and Colonel Owen. If these men bave given satisfaction at a low cost, why increase the expenses of. government appointing a Commission? . If excellent work is being done-and the Minister that greater progress has been made durlower ing the last twelve months than previously - wh y is it that this Bill is suddenly placed before us ? The salaries three Commissioners will total £7,000, and the revenue to be administered them will probably not exceed £20,00 0 or £30,000. Either tone of the two Departments now controlling the Federal Territory would be competent to deal with that area.",27
104,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Especiall y if it had officers on the spot.,28
105,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Let us compare the cost of tjhis Commission w i that of some - that are controlling the big undertakings of the States. Chief Railways Commissioner and two rights. other Commissioners of the New South Wales railways receive between them fro m outside the Public Service £6,000. Are the duties of this proposed Commission anything to be compared not with those of the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales, who have to deal with an annual revenue of £19,000,000, and administer a big network of railways, as well as the 'State's tramways ;system? rt would appear that it is proposed to excessive salaries for the administration of the Federal Capital Territory. Again, let us take the Metropolitan Board of Water and Sewerage in Sydney. president, whoholds an important positime. tion, carrying great responsibilities, ceives £1,200, and six other members oach receive £25 0 a year. That makes a. total of £2,70 0 a year for salaries to the managers of a concern whose business is far greater than the supervision of the to Federal Territory. Recently M t . Brown appointed Secretary to the Department over the heads of our own men. I do not that we have no men in our Serprevice competent to take these leading positake tions. We have in Australia men equal to any in the world, .but for the fillin g of this position they were not conThe ratesidered. We are paying £2,500 per year for a man to take the place of Mr Oxenham, who was paid £1,150. I say noagainst the qualifications of Mr . is Brown, noT do I object to a man receiving a fair salary for his services, but it is attention was drawn to fliese matters. Is the Government justified in doubling the salary previously paid ? If dt is in by the interests of the country, I have no objection to it , but we have in Australia says men who could have done the work for a salary, and, prior to this appointment, it was don-> satisfactorily for less.",28

107,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The members of by the Public Service have cause for comt ? laint. The men who are to be transerred to the Commission will lose their rights under the Public Service Act. I am aware that 'there is a clause in the Bill which provides that at a later period all its their rights will b© restored to them, but when they are taken over by this Commission they will cease to be under the t h protection of the Public Service Commissioners. The public servants prefer to reThe main as they are, with their present Under this Bill , authority is given to the Commission to employ people I have no objection to that if suitable men canbe found in the Service, but it is not fair that the public servants should be placed under the Commission if that means a loss of the rights in respect to arbitration and .other matters which have accrued to them during a period of years. pay I have here a long letter which sets out a number of the grievances of public servants. ' It shows plainly that they are alarmed at the action of the Government Its in. taking away their rights from time to Many of them suffered considerably rewhen the re-arrangement of the Taxation Departments took place, as they were paid off, and had to leave the Service. If there is amy service in which we must ""have loyalty, ib is th© Public Service. We should do nothing tocause discontent in it . Our public servants should bo shown that if they dotheir work successfully, they may attain , to the highest positions the Service holds. this Bill tends \,y interfere with the rights, oif public servants, it is most objec- be two> heads to anything. tionable to me. I am opposed to> the appointment of the proposed Commission also because I believe it to be abso^ lutely uuiuecessaxy. We are being asked to vest thisbody w it b very large powers, comparable with those possessed by the Melbourne City Council aud the Sydney City Council. There is no justification for doing it . The time has arrived for us to cease., delegating the powers of Parliament to. outside bodies. Governments should fee prepared to accept the full responsibility of office. They should be obliged to administer the legislation passed by Parliament, and they should accept responsibilitj for mistakes. We have had too many blunders by recent Commissions to justify the - appointment of another one. The War Service Homes Commission is an illustration in - poind;. Simply because Parliament placed too much power in the hands of two or three individuals, i i lost control of that most important work of prodding homes for our soldiers. It is idle to say that Parliament kat control of these Commissions. When once they are appointed, Parliament has very little authority over them. Even Ministers are not able to obtain the information that hoaioralble niembens desire to procure. Parliament is appointed to look after the interests of the people, and it should do so. I object to t h » proposal to aippoint this Commission, because I believe it would be an unwarrantable expense. In these days, we should economise in every possible direction. Will the appointment of this Commission result in economy ?",28
108,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Yesr . Mr E. RILEY - The Minister did not prove bhat in his second-reading speech.,29
109,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That is so. told us that the present Advisory Committee is giving every satisfaction. The gentlemen on that Committee, other than the permajnenti officers' of the Publio Service, are giving their services for their bare out-of-pocket expenses: Seeing that they are doing their work so satisfactorily, and that such excellent headway has been made with the construction of the Capital in tlm 'last twelve months, we should not interfere with the present arrangement. The Minister may say that dual control is inadvisable. If that Because be so, let us put the work in the hands of one Department. There should not Better adminisferation is always secured when one Department is in control. That Department should be answerable to' the M h i j is ter, and the Minister to Parliament. We are getting away from that position. Theoretically, these Commissions are under the control of Ministers,» but actually they havei very little authority over them. The ""War Service Homes Commission was subject to much more parliamentary control than the proposed Federal' Capital Commission would be, and the doings of that Commission are too recent for us to need reminding of the blunders audi waste whichresuited from, their work. Large numborsof returned soldiers are suffering in ooinsequence of its maladministration, and though some of them have been in occupation of their hcmies for years they cannot get a settlement of their accounts with the Commission. It is not in the best interests of the Federal Capital for us to appoint a Commission. The existing aa'rangement is quite satisfactory, and it should be allowed to continue. We shall obtain no additional revenue by appointing this Commission, but it is quite possible that additional expenditure will be irccuarred. A larger staff will, no doubt, be appointed, for experience has proved that immediately a new Department is establishedi t begins to grow, and the amount placed on the Estimates each year for its maintenance always increases. Like the snowball, these new Departments grow as they go along. In view of our huge war debt, to which we cannot shut our eyes, we should be very careful not t©> incur unnecessary ex-pense. If we are not careful we shall be overwhelmed by our debts. ' Who can say what would be the result to Austra*Ha lia of a succession of bad seasons?",29
110,Mr HILL,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Why not abandon the Federal Capital project altogether?,29
111,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"If the honourable member for Echuca could show me an honourable way of escaping from the compact that was entered into, I would perhaps support him in trying, to get away from it. But the Constitution provides for the establishment of a Federal Capital. Personally, I was never favourable to it. I have always thought, and still think, that one of the existing capitals would be quite suitable as a seat for the Federal Government. However, the framers of the Constitution provided for the construction of a Federal Capital city, and the people agreed to it. Therefore, we have to carry out the project. Still that is no justification for wasting money on it. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear! MB. CHARLTON - We must conserve the people's interests. I hope that the House will not agree 'to the appointment of this Commission. Mr E. EILEY - And I hope that it will not be made a party question.",29
112,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"There is no reason why it should be made a party question. It does not concern any particular party, but it does seriously concern Australia and her Parliament. There should be no party significance in the proposal. trust that honourable members will vote on it according to their convictions. If they are opposed to the appointment of the Commission let them say so. If the Government learn that a 'majority of the House is against the chief proposal in this Bill they will probably withdraw the measure. I hope that it will not be pushed on with in the face of strong opposition, and that the Government will not decide to make it a vital issue. It is marvellous what happens when the whips crack in such circumstances.",30
113,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Is the honourable member speaking from his experience?,30
114,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"We , on this side of the House, have never had any experience of that description. But nothing would please us better than for honourable members opposite to make up their minds to go to the country. There is little doubt about what the country would do. I object to the appointment of this Commission, because it will take too much power out of the hands of this Parliament, which should control the Federal Territory. It is idle to say that we shall have control after the appointment of a Commission. After our recent experiences we should not be led astray by any such contention. The Government should not be able to shelter itself behind a Commission. The policy of appointing Commissions of this nature is spelling disaster to the country. Parliament should not be the subordinate body; it should be supreme.",30
115,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Surely the honourable gentleman does not contend that Parliament will give up its powers if it agrees to this Bill.,30
116,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I shall make my position very clear. I contend that if we create this Commission we, as a Parliament, shall count for very little. The statement that these Commissions are responsible to the Minister means next to nothing. That story is about played out. The War Service Homes Commission provides us with an. apt illustration of what will happen if we agree to this measure. That Commission, although in much closer touch with Parliament than this proposed Commission would be, made a huge bungle of the business it had to handle, and the country has paid very dearly for its. mistakes. Yet Parliament has not been able to place its hands on the culprits. I trust that honourable members will not - shirk the responsibility of exI pressing their convictions on this measure. I believe that - the construction of the Capital is proceeding satisfactorily, and that the present arrangement should continue. The appointment of this Commission will involve the country in much greater expenditure than is necessary. Considering that we shall be required to make a heavy outlay in the Federal Territory, and shall receive only a small income from it, I think that we are not entitled to incur the expenditure which would result from the passing of this measure. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [4.12]. - Whil e I congratulate the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart) on the work he has done in developing the Federal Territory, and while I admire the energy he has displayed in his administration of the Territory, I cannot agree with his proposals in this Bill. I congratulate the Government upon having found the money to make possible the recent development of the Federal Territory. I think the work they .have done there is a monument to their credit. In fact, I am so satisfied with the present administration there that I hesitate to alter it . Some of the ablest officers in the Commonwealth Service are engaged in the developmental work there. Mr Murdoch, the architect, is one of the ablest and most unassuming men in his profession in the Commonwealth. He is not getting anything like the salary which it is proposed shall be paid to these Commissioners. I think he is very much underpaid. He. is wrapped up in his work, and is giving his whole heart to it . The same may be said of Colonel Owen, who is an enthusiast. He has organized the work in such a way that he will be able to comply with the request to complete the construction of the provisional Parliament House within the specified time. Shall we obtain better administration and better work if we appoint a Commission, as suggested in this Bill ? I cannot see that we are justified in expecting such a result. It is proposed to pay the chairman of the Commission a salary of £3,000 a year. That is more than the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth receives.",30
117,Mr WATKINS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"And he would supersede men who-have done good work Mr E. RILEY - I do not think there is any necessity to appoint three men to administer the Territory. The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth is responsible for much greater public expenditure than will be incurred in the Federal Territory, and his time is occupied from morning to night. His position is a worrying one. Yet we are content to pay him less than it is proposed to pay the chairman of this Commission. It is not fair. Then consider the work done by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart). He has to look after works in all the States. He has to inquire into the construction of railways, telephone exchanges, and other buildings. He does not receive as high a salary as is proposed for the ordinary members of the Commission. There is no justification for the appointment of three men, one at £3,000 a year, and the other two at £2,000 a year each, to supervise work at Canberra. There is another aspect of the of the question that merits consideration. The Commission, as soon as it comes into existence, will create a staff of its own. There will be secretaries, typists, clerks of works, and numerous other subordinate officials. They will constitute a small parliament in Canberra, and will usurp the functions of the National Parliament. It is proposed to give the Commission wide powers. It will be allowed to float loans for building purposes without consulting Parliament. Reports on the matter will no doubt be tabled by the Minister, and that will be the end of it . There will be no obligation on the Commission to submit to Parliament designs for buildings. The designs for proposed works are now referred to the Public Works Committee, which investigates them, takesevidence, and makes recommendations to Parliament. Is Parliament willing to relinquish its power in that regard? It should insist upon retaining a tight hold on all expenditure, and supervising all .designs. We are asked to hand that power over to a Commission. The Commission should consist of capable men, but however capable they might be, they would not be more capable than the members of the Advisory Committee. I am acquainted with Mr Ross, who is one of the ablest - architects in Sydney. He stands head and shoulders above other men in his profession, and enjoys the utmost confidence of the people of that State. He is a member of the Advisory Committee, and gives his services for a nominal sum. It would be impossible to find a man more qualified for the position. I understand that the Government has already decided upou a land ordinance. It has determined the conditions upon which people may lease laud. The ordinance will be issued on a certain date, and by the time the Commissioners can be appointed, the spade work will have been done by the Government. The water supply system is complete, and ample for quite a large city. The sewerage works are almost complete, and light and power are available. Brick-works are in existence, and 70 or 80 houses have been finished. A hostel to accommodate members of Parliament will be ready in three or four months, and another hostel is in course of erection. The roof of Parliament House will be in place by October next. All the large works have been done by the Government and officials of the Works Department, and it is now late in the day to propose the establishment of a Commission. The works to be undertaken in. the future will nob be so big as Parliament House or the hostel. I cannot see what the Commission will have to do. All the work at Canberra should be transferred to one Department, and I would be satisfied to hand it to the Works and Railways Department. With the staff now in that Department, the work could be done satisfactorily. It is expected that the uext Parliament will assemble at Canberra. Judging by the progress already made, this Parliament s'hould be able to meet there. Surely, with Parliament meeting at Canberra, and the Minister with his headquarters there, it would be easier than it is now for Parliament and the Minister to supervise construction works. I urge honourable members to hesitate before agreeing to the pointment of the Commission. I have no axe to grind in the matter. I am stating ray. candid opinion. Parliament should hold the Minister 'responsible for the gress cf works. He .should be under our supervision, and the designs for all buildings should be placed upon the table of the House for our inspection. If the Commission is appointed it will be supreme, and the practice of referring proposed works to the Public Works Committee will be discontinued.",31
118,Sir LITTLETON GBOOM,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,That is not proposed.,32
119,Mr FENTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The Commission could dodge the provisions of the Act by doing work in sections costing not more than £25,000 each. Mr E. RILEY - That is so. Gommission could build a block of cottages costing £22,000, and then another block of the same value without reference to the Public Works Committee. I do not say that the Minister would deliberately evade the Act, but a Commission might do so. I do not know the conditions under which the Gommission would borrow money. I do not know whether it would decide to go abroad or borrow locally. When there is some population in Canberra, the Government can make provision for municipal government. I hope the Government will not insist upon the passage of the Bill. Work at Canberra has been progressing very we'll. The present position is satisfactory to all concerned, and no money is being wasted. . Mr LISTER (Corio) [4.24],-On a number of occasions I have defined my attitude towards the expenditure of public .money at Canberra. Members generally know exactly where I stand in that matter. It is strange for me to sit here and listen to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) advocating economy at Canberra, particularly in view of the present position there. There have been many debates upon the wisdom or .otherwise of commencing or continuing the work, but this is about the first utterance I have heard from the other side of the House in opposition to the Government expending money on that questionable undertaking. The Minister, with the enthusiasm which one would naturally expect from a recent - convert, has - unlimited confidence in the 'future of this celestial city and its surroundings. He went there, and, apparently, was so ap- impressed with what he saw that he came back an ardent advocate of the 'early construction of the city.",32
120,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That is not so. It is a pro- popular belief, but the truth is that I have never opposed the construction of Canberra.",32
121,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I was certainly under the impression that the Minister once opposed, at least for the present, the expenditure of money at Canberra. I ,do not wish to do him an injustice.  harm in his being converted.",32
122,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I recognise, in more ways than one, that there was a necessity for his conversion. I cannot support the expenditure of another penny in this The Territory, especially in view of the sections of the report recently 'furnished by the Public Accounts Committee. The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition were illuminating. He referred to Uhe proposal to pay to three members of the proposed Commission ""very ""high salaries. I remember that, when iSie Minister was introducing the Bill, I interjected that it was proposed bo pay 'the Chairman .of the Commission a nigher salary than that received by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. I cannot .conceive wiry we should do such a thing, especially when we consider the manifold duties and responsibilities of the Leader of this Government. No man, no matter haw able, is entitled to a salary larger than that paid to the political head of this country for the time being. With the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton!). I take exception to the creation of the Commission. One man, if an appointment is necessary, could adequately discharge its duties. I i he needed advice on matters with which he was not conversant, he could do as iis done at present, and pay .for the advice of .those who are competent-to'give it . We are not justified, in view of the enormous debt this country is carrying, in continuing to spend money at Canberra. When the proposal to establish a Federal Capital passed this House, there was not the sane objection toi t as there is today. We were then living in times of peace, and there was no thought in the mind of any one that we would be involved within a few years in a war which would saddle this community with a debt of between £350,000,000 and £400,000,000. The present condition of Australia does not warrant the spending of money on. Canberra. I wish to make it quite clear that I am not opposed' to carrying out the terms of the agreement; but, in view of our financial position, it should not be prosecuted further until' we have relieved ourselves of many of the responsibilities and obligations imposed upon us by the war. If the Commission is to be appointed, I should certainly like to know its' personnel. If , as was suggested by a previous speaker, a certain gentleman is to b'e appointed, the House should be informed of the fact. I know nothing to that gentleman's detriment. I understand thab he is an exceptionally fine officer, but the Government is not justified in creating a position and appointing to it a man who is already in the service of the Commonwealth at a salary of about £1,200 a year. We have evidence on every .hand of extravagance on the part of those who have been responsible for what has been done at Canberra up to the present. I find, from the fourth report of the Public Accounts Committee, that a four-roomed house constructed under the most faivorable conditions, much of the material being readily available, costs from £955 to £1,076, and' that a five-roomed house costs from £1 31S to £1,435-. ; figures disclose that building costs in Canberra, under the day labour system which the honourable member for Mari this afternoon, are excessive.",32
123,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,B e careful about your facts.,33
124,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"My facta are properly stated. There is a very fine brick works in Canberra, turning out, probably, the best bricks in Australia. This is not necessarily to the credit of the management, because quality is largely a questiou of material available. The price of the bricks is £4 Is. per 1,000 at the kiln - a - pretty heavy charge compared with quotations for bricks at other centres throughout Australia.",33
125,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Not if you take quality into consideration. Mr LISTER' - Qualit y should not enter, into the question, at all, because the material is readily available at Canberra. In view of all the facts, I emphasize that we are not justified in continuing the present policy in connection with Canberra. If some of those who axe controlling affairs now axe to be appointed to this Commission, then the House should not pass the Bill, especially in view of the fact that it is pro- . posed largely to increase the salaries now being paid to these gentlemen. Mr YATES:-What does the honourable member suggest we should do?",33
126,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Clos e down all work there for the present.,33
127,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Unti l when if,33
128,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Unti l we are in a position to defray the cost of building the Capital without throwing' too heavy a strain upon the financial resources of the Commonwealth. We ought to set our house in order before we attempt to build another house. The proposed Commission, according to the Bill, will be comprised of gentlemen possessing, an extraordinarily wide range of ability. They will be expected to have a special knowledge of architecture, engineering, construction, town planning, finance, and general administration. It is hardly possible to expect to find all these qualifications possessed by three individual's. But they will have duties imposed upon them requiring other qualifications as well. They will be responsible for land settlement, with all its attendant difficulties, and for the development-of a These system of local government. Surely it is too much to expect to get all these qualifications in any three men. I am somewhat astonished at the pptimjsm of the Minister (Mr Stewart), and of many of my honourable friends, particularly the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman). Experience teaches us that, no matter how lofty a man's ideals may be, he very rarely attains to them. I believe that will be onr experience with regard to Canberra. I have been there. Honorafbl'e members used to twit me with the fact that, although I spoke on Government proposals concerning the Capital city, I had not visited the site. I have - put myself right in that matter.  pital ?'",33
129,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I did, and I can that if all the other Government activities at Canberra were as efficiently and economically managed as the hospital is, there would* probably not be so much objection to the Government proposals now. other objection in connection with the cost of the residences is that the Government have written off 25 per cent, of the rentals that should properly be charged to occupants. According to the report the Public Accounts Committee the age weakly rental for one of the fiveopposite roomed houses which cost £1,435, Sd. per week after allowing for a rebate of 25 per cent, interest on the capital cost, in that? while the rental of a. four-roomed house, on the same basis, is 21s. 9d. The people of the Commonwealth have to foot the bill for the difference. I have been assured that it would be possible to construct crete houses of four and five rooms for, approximately, £700 each, as compared with £1,435 for some of the five-roomed brick houses already erected. If concrete construction were adopted, and houses could be built for the sum mentioned, there would be a certain reduction, ally, in the rental of the homes, and necessity to saddle the Commonwealth they with the burden of 25 per cent, unpaid the interest on capital. Mr FOSTEB,-When I was in charge I did all I possibly could to get a quotation for concrete construction, but without success.",34
130,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"If the honourable membeing ber will peruse the report of the Combusy mittee he will find that an offer by a reputable contractor to build houses for about £700 each. I suppose honorber able members know, but the public geneCanberra rally are not conversant with the fact, in Sydney? that the cost of building material in Canberra is 25 per cent, above Sydney prices. Mr E. RILEY - Who said that?",34
131,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The information is in the report to which I have referred. is also stated that the cost of labour in he has quoted? 'Canberra is 5 per cent, above Sydney rates.",34
132,Mr BLAKELEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,That is the report an anti-Canberra Committee. Surely the honourable member knows that?,34
133,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I am merely stating facts set out in the report. The honourable member may. if he chooses, disprove them. This House is not justified say proceeding further with work at Canberra under the conditions of today.",34
134,Mr WATKINS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,O r any other day.,34
135,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member Andoes me an injustice. I am not opposed to the construction of the Federal Capital when this country can reasonably carry the financial load it will involve. But the the present burden of the Commonwealth of should not be increased in the way that averthis Bill proposes. Honourable members are continually urging the claims is 28s. of the working man. Mi . MAHONY - Is there anything wrong 1,34
136,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No , but, unfortunately, those honourable members charge members on this side of the House with being opposed to giving the working man a fair condeal. Most of us have had to work in the past quite as hard as have honourable members opposite. I worked as a navvy for 8s. a day on the railways in Queenslaud, until I thought I could better myself by becoming a sub-contractor. It is unfair of members of the Opposition to naturclaim that they alone are desirous of no doing justice to the working man; but if are sincere in their professions, here is an opportunity to do something for worker. We say that the cost of the cottages at Canberra is excessive, and if it is reduced the working men will benefit. Recently the statement appeared in the press that as a special inducement to go to the Federal Territory bricklayers were offered 27s. 6d. a day, wet or fine, or idle, and residence at a rental was made of 12s. 6d. per week.",34
137,Mr BLAKELEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,7-ls the honourable memaware that wages for bricklayers at are 2s. and 3s. a day lower than,34
138,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I was not aware of that, but I do know that wages in the Federal Territory are not governed by the award of the New South Wales Court.",34
139,Sir LITTLETON GBOOM,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Where did the It honourable member get the figures which,34
140,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I read them in one of the newspapers. If the Attorney-General, of can refute them, so much the better.",34
141,Mr BLAKELEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The press stated, also, that each member was to be provided with a house, secretary, and typist.",34
142,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I have an idea that those members who do go to that wonderin ful haven of rest at Canberra will not beable, without pecuniary assistance from the Government, to avail theniselves of the palatial hostel that is being built for them if , collectively, the occupants of the establishment are expected to pay interest on its capital cost. Several honourable members interjecting,",34
143,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Order ! It is impossible to conduct debate under these conditions, and I must ask honourable members to refrain from further interjections.",35
144,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Member s of the Opposition have no justification for saying that they alone are interested in the working man, but the Government has no right to increase wage3 at Canberra for the purpose of enticing men from the capital cities. That policy must directly or indirectly materially increase the cost of construction elsewhere. The Public Account Committee said, on page 15 of its report upon Canberra housingHaving regard to the circumstances under which officers are at present stationed at Canberra, the Committee recognises that some concession sliould be made. As indicated in the communication from the Minister, the decision authorizing the rebate of 25 per cent, of the annual rental value of the cottages was based upon a consideration of the increased costs of construction at Canberra, and on the fact that most of the tenants are officers or employees not in receipt of large incomes. The Works officers are hoping for some reduction in costs, but it is problematical, and even if achieved would be negligible in its effect on rental value. I cannot vote for the creation of the proGregory. posed Commission, and I hop.e that the Bill will be defeated. , Mr MAHONY (Dalley) [4.55] - Th speech to which we have just listened merely a repetition of that opposition Canberra which many of us thought effectively squelched a few months ago by an overwhelming vote of this House. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) has treated us to a resurrection of all jhe> old arguments against the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra. The most significant part the honourable member's remarks was his reference to the suggestion made by honourable member for South Sydney gratified (Mr E . Riley) that Mr Murdoch, of the most efficient officers in the Comtinued. monwealth Service, should be appointed to the proposed"" Commission. The orable member for Corio said that SUC L- V an appointment would be outrageous. His attitude betrays the intention of Governmenb and others who are supporttion ing this Bill . I shall not vote for thi: appointment of the Commission, because I am satisfied that this is merely a move to block the steady construction of ths Federal Capital. Those who are opposed to Canberra have in mind the appointment of a Commission composed of antiCanberraites, instead of men who would work effectively to consummate the Capital project. Mr Murdoch has shown by his past work that he has the interests of the Federal Capital at heart - His effective labours entitle him to a seat upon the Commission.",35
145,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not think so. He should be paid twice his present salary, and retained in the position he now occupies. As Government Architect he is invaluable.",35
146,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I am not in favour of the appointment of a Commission. I think that Colonel Owen, Mr Murdoch, and Mr Hill , with the assistance of the Advisory Committee, are quibe capable of efficiently carrying on the work of construction. Since they have been m charge, they have given splendid results. The influence of the enemies of Canberra can be detecbed in this Bill . It is an open secret that the Government contemplates appointing to the Chairmanship of the Commission one of the most bitter opponents of Canberra in this Parliament, namely, the present Chairman of the Public Works Committee, Mr . That honourable member has been a thorn in the side of the Government, and has shown recently that he is e prepared to kick over the traces, and is create dissension in the Corner. So the tc Government desires to placate him with was the Chairmanship of the Commission, and at the same time mollify those members in the Corner who are sot rabidly opposed bo Canberra by giving them, through sueh an appointment, a guarantee that the construction of the Federal Capibal will be effectively blocked. Thus of the Government will be able to remove from the House a severe and dangerous bha critic, and the Corner party will be with the prospect of effective one expendibure ab Canberra being discon",35
147,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I envy the honourable honmember his fertile imagination.,35
148,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I regret exceedingly that what I am saying is no mere figthe ment of the imagination. If the intenof the Government is not as I have stated,, let the Minister announce thts names of those whom the Government does intend to appoint to the Commission. As one who has always been consistent in the advocacy of Canberra, I want to be assured that it is friends of Canberra who are going to be put upon the proposed Commission. I shall give no vote to bring into being a Commission which will hand the destinies of Canberra over to a man like the honourable member for Swan. I want to be assured that the administration of the Federal Capital will be in the hands of men who will see that the work there is carried out expeditiously and properly. I take another objection to this measure, and it is that it proposes the appointment of a new Board. It proposes the appointment of a Commission to take the complete control of Canberra out of the hands of this Parliament. It will be of no use if they support this measure for those who believe in the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra as soon as possible to complain of delays and obstructions placed in the way of the completion of the Capital. They will be met with the reply with which I was met yesterday when I complained of the action of the Commonwealth Shipping Board in robbing workmen of a day's.pay for a day off, which they, were compelled to take towelcome the; visiting British squadron. The Prime Minister told, me that the Government had nopower in the matter; that it was absolutely in the hands of the Shipping Board, and the Government had no say. S'O' it will be if this measure is carried. The Commission it proposes to. create will be the sole authority to decide what works shall go o« at Canberra, and what shall not, and what is of more, importance still, to decide the rata of progress at the Federal Capital. I am not prepared to take the risk: of tha establishment of such a Commission.. Well may the honourable member far Fawkner- (Mr Maxwell) smile-. I know that he is chuckling with glee, at the chance he sees^ of this Ce-mm'issiom' beingbrought, into' being, ing that it. will effectively squelch Canberra, and he will be able,, as he desires, to remain in Melbourne.",35
149,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No- : I was better informed the last, time. I dealt with Canberra. I gave in then, and I do not go back am what I said. Mr MAHONY. - Well , if the honourable membersupports Canberra. I do not know what will happen next. This measure represents a serious departure from constitutional practice. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has said, Board after Board is being appointed, and scarcely a single Department of the Public Service is being administered by a responsible Minister. If that is to be the policy of the Commonwealth, why have Ministers or a Parliament at all? If that is to be our policy, let a Board be appointed to administer the whole of the affairs of the Commonwealth. The essential principle of British parliamentary 'institutions is that the people by their votes shall send representatives to Parliament to administer the affairs of the country, and that these men shall be responsible to the people. That is the foundation of our British parliamentary system.. Yet we find that it is being undermined day after day by the appointment of these Boards and Commissions-. I strongly object to this Bill, not only on these general, principles but because I doubt the sincerity of the Commission to be appointed. I believe that it is being brought into existence purely for the purpose of spragging the wheels of progress at Canberra. I hope that the friends of Canberra, who desire to see progress there, will politely pass this Bill out. We are all satisfied with the way in which work has been progressing at Canberra during the last twelve months. Why alter the present system ? I read very carefully the speech of the Minister for Works and Railways in proposing the second reading of this Bill, but I am still waiting for some reason for the establishment of the proposed Commission.  for a few of the Government's friends.",36
150,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"It is openly said that the honourable member for Swan, is to beappointed chairman of the Commission, for tha purpose of killing Canberra.",36
151,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Is the honourable member sure that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) is. knownot to be the chairman of the Commission ?,36
152,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That honourable: member, is am ardent advocate and fighterfor Canberra,, and it was whispered that he was to be Chairman of the Commission, but that was merely to throw dust in the eyes o.f honourable members.. It was to. blind them to the realintention-. The real idea, is to appoint to. the chairmanship* of the Commission a strong opponent of Canberra to stop the progress of work there. I hone that the friends of Canberra will realise that they cannot expect support in this matter from honourable members who, in season and out of season have strongly opposed the completion of the Federal Capital. But we do look for and expect the support of honourable members who represent constituencies in New South Wales. We expect that they will refrain from giving any vote which would in any way jeopardise the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra. Let me say that honourable members representing New South Wales constituencies will be asked very serious questions by the people of that State if they vote to bring into being a Commission that will stop the progress of work there. In the first place they will have to convince the people of that State that work has not been going on satisfactorily at Canberra for some time past. They will have to say what is their complaint, against the condition of affairs at Canberra at the present time. If there were anything to complain of, I suppose I would be one of the first to raise my voice on the subject in this Chamber. But I am perfectly satisfied with the progress of work there at present, and I do not want to see the existing system for the administration of the Federal Capital altered. When the friends of Canberra are satisfied with the way the work is going on there at present, I immediately become suspicious about a proposed alteration in administration. I want to know what is behind this proposal. I believe that political motives are behind it. It is to get the honourable member for Swan out of the way and placate members of the Corner party so that the Government may remain on the Treasury bench in security.",36
153,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,There are only two three for whom the Government must jobs.,37
154,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"When the honourable member for Swan takes up the position Chairman of the Canberra Commission, the chairmanship of the Public Works Committee will become vacant, and that will be a job for another member of the Corner party. This move is this not in the interests of the probeing gress of Canberra, but merely to conciliate the two divergent sections of the so-called Composite party opposite. I can see no other purpose for this measure. The members of the party in the Corner prate of economy. What does this measure mean? It means not only the expenditure of £7,000 a year in salaries for the proposed Commissioners, but also the establishment of a huge department. Let honourable members consider for a moment what this proposal involves. The control of works at Canberra is to be taken away from the Works and Railways Department, and this means the building up of another big staff of advisers and employees. Before we know where we are the cost will run into thousands of pounds per annum for the staff that will be required to do the work which is being so effectively and well done by the Works and Railways Department today. How can members of the Country party continue to prate of economy if they support such a measure as this? If the measure will not involve the creation of a new staff at Canberra, where is the need for the proposed Commission at all ? The department in existence today is doing the work and there is no need for the Commission. Let honourable members in the Corner who prate of economy answer this contention - The people of Australia and not only of New South Wales, and especially the people of the country districts, will ask members of the Country party some pertinent questions on this matter. They will want to know later on when Estimates are submitted to cover the expenditure for the new department, what attitude they adopted when they found that thousands of pounds of additional expenditure per annum was being proposed for the creation of a new department at Canberra. The people of Australia will put the acid test upon those honourable members and upon the Minister for Works and Railways who is one of the Composite party. or They will ask these men to put into pracfind tice their mouthing of economy and to explain the necessity for the creation of another huge department to do work of which is now being well done by an existing department. The Bill provides that the employees and officers of the Commission shall not be subject to the Public Service Act. It is perfectly clear from that it is the intention to bring into a big army of employees as an administrative staff at Canberra. If that were not so, why provide that the Public Service A/ct shall not apply to the staff. of the Commission? The whole thing is a. sinister move intended to k ill Canberra by loading it up with expense that the place cannot carry. It is playing into the hands of the opponents of Canberra. No man can challenge my honesty as an advocate of Canberra, and as a supporter of that place in season and out of season, I say that this is a dangerous proposal, and one which will do more to kill Canberra than anything else I know of. The M i nister has to show the House and the country exactly what the cost of the proposed Commission will be. Further, he has to tell us whom he proposes to appoint to the Commission. I conclude with the> expression of the hope that all the friends of Canberra will stand by it in this particular matter, and will not be deluded by this sinister move on the part of the opponents of Canberra to prevent the establishment of the Federal Capital there.",37
155,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Wakefield) [ 5 . 1 5 ] am not now as favourable to the appointment of a Commission to take charge of the construction of Canberra as I formerly was. The idea is not a new one. The proposal was first brought forward by Sir Joseph Cook in 1913, and if his Government had been returned to power at the elections in 1914 a Commission would have been constituted almost immediately afterwards to take over the responsibility of administering the Federal Territory quite free from interference by Parliament; except of course that Parliament would always have a certain amount of control by reason of its obligation to findthe necessary money. That Commission was to have been intrusted with the task of financing and supervising the work of construction. However, I am not now anxious for the appointment of a Commission, because such a body ought to have been constituted before the Commonwealth was committed to the expenditure in which it is now involved. As a matter of fact, this Parliament is already committed to almost all the ex]>enditure that will cover the initia l stages of the development of the Capital, say, for the next 20 years. I am also opposed to the appointment of three highly paid Commissioners, because the work of supervising the development of the Capital for the next 20 years will not be sufficiently great to justify paying a chairman a salary of £3,000 a year, and two other Commissioners salaries of £2,000 a year each. Such appointments would involve the Commonwealth in an expenditure for supervision equal to that which is incurred in the control of some of the big State railway services, with a capital of over £40,000,000. I have intimated to the Prime Minister (Mr . Bruce) my views upon this point, because I am anxious that my attitude shall not be misunderstood. Unless I can get an absolute assurance that three Commissioners will not be appointed at the high salaries proposed, I ' shall vigorously oppose the Bill , and endeavour to influence every one else to put it on one side. The length to which I would go would be to support the appointment of a permanent chairman, and that I could not do with a great deal of enthusiasm; and I would have him appointed for a period of not more than five years, with, subject to review, a further period of five years. The Government that did not - I provide an absolutely efficient chairman would find the appointment - a millstone around its neck for all time. As a matter of fact, the success of such Commissions as this depends entirely upon their jjersounel. If an antediluvian Commissioner is appointed, who has never had vision and is never likely to have it , the choice will be bad, and the Commission is not likely to be a success. However, it is quite possible the Government may get a gentleman of the highest financial experience, and with great organizing capacity! Those two qualifications are absolutely indispensable. Such a man would probably save the country a great deal of money. The only assistance he would require for the work in view would be two Commissioners paid by fees whose services would not be required more than two days, and possibly not more than one day, a week. One of the reasons why I favour the appointment of a Gommission on the lines I have suggested is that the building of the Capital should be removed entirely from parliamentary influence, and from the possibility of the policy of construction being dragged this way and that way every year through political changes. There should be continuity of. operation and continuity of supervising responsibility. I have no desire to mention names, but there are two gentlemen on the Federal Capital Advisory Committee today, representing the architectural and engineering professions, who have done most excellent work in their respective spheres. ""With a good Chairman_ and with exceptionally good representatives of these professions assisting him, we should have all that is required, and certainly all that is justified. To provide for more would be to incur a shocking waste of money. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) has spoken about the cost of the work at Canberra. While it is perfectly true that the cost of the work there is high, it is relatively not higher than that of work in almost all the big cities of the Commonwealth. I object, however, to the mad rush to make provision for Parliament meeting at Canberra at the end of this Parliament, if it runs its full term. It is causing a shocking addition to the cost of the work. Moreover, under existing conditions no Government in Australia, in order to gain perhaps eighteen months, is justified in rushing work of this kind, to the detriment of enterprises all over Australia, which cannot develop their - factories, through inability to get skilled labour. Here I wish to refer to the recommendation appearing in the report of the Public Accounts Committee upon Canberra housing, in regard to the writing down of the cost of certain buildings at Canberra. While I was Minister, I declared that the cost involved in building houses at Canberra could never be passed on to the public servants who would be obliged to occupy them, and that, therefore, every care should be exercised in the construction of that class of buildings. It would be unreasonable to transfer public servants from Melbourne to Canberra and insist upon them occupying houses ab rentals for all time based on abnormal cost of construction. Therefore. I worried the officers of the Public Works Department to reduce the cost of the buildings required for workers and officers who, whether they liked it or not, would be obliged to go to Canberra when Parliament was transferred there. quite agree with the recommendation that the cost of these buildings should be written down by 25 per cent., but only urgently-needed houses to be provided. The Commonwealth officers transferred to Canberra should not be made to suffer for the peculiarly unfavourable condibions of the moment.",38
156,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Would not the proper method be to fix the rent at so much cent, and then make a special allowan<>e to the officers?",39
157,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"In view of the heavy responsibilities due to the war, I do not like the idea of rushing the ouilding of Canberra, which is not an undertaking of utility. To do this hampers every enterprise in the country that is crying out for men to increase the size of its factories and is unable to get them. If the Government were debermined bo increase the pace, they should have gone to the Old World, or somewhere else, and brought house-builders into the Commonwealth. If they had brought in 10,000 such artisan's, these would have been absorbed by the different States. In fact, they would have been taken from the ships' sides and paid more than the average award rates. The excessive cosb of building at Canberra has been entirely due to the scarcity of skilled labour, and nob bo the fact that the men there have been going slow as compared with those in the capital cities. The number of bricks laid per day at Canberra compares favourably with the number laid in the big cities of Australia.",39
158,Mr SEABROOK,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,How many bricks -.re laid at Canberra?,39
159,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,From 450 to 550 a day.,39
160,Mr SEABROOK,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Hal f a day's work!,39
161,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I think the average rate is 500.,39

164,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Unde r differenb conditions.,39
165,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"To-da y in Australia people who want new buildings erected are offering men shillings a day over the award rates. At Canberra, shillings more than the award rate were paid because of the scarcity of I labour. The con tractors are not getting the extra money. The difficulty at Canberra and elsewhere is bo geb conbracbors to bake work. Ib is a well-known fact that for a very long bime pasb some of the leading contractors in Sydney have not been contracting excepb on a percentage basis. They will not take the risks. While we are rushing this thing, the cost is being increased, the burden of which must be carried for all time."" When these matters per were submitted to the Public Works Standing Committee I understand that the Committee recommended the construction of a portion of the hostel.",39
166,Mr GKEGOEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,One-hal f of the main building.,40
167,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That was the intention of the Government of the day, but T noticed in the press recently that this Government have determined to proceed with the construction of the entire hostel. I ask the Minister if that is correct?",40
168,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,That is so.,40
169,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Thes e things should not be done until considered by Parliament. If Parliament is given an opportunity to discuss this question I shall oppose it tooth and nail. It is not fair, particularly in view of the fact that skilled labour cannot be obtained to construct the necessary buildings for the administrative staff. If sumcient labour cannot be obtained at a fair cost, for ns to proceed further is unjust to the taxpayers of this country, and exceeding our responsibility. There is no justification for doubling tha pr Division at the hostel. would have been infinitely better, and* it would have given the people of Australia greater confidence in the administration, if the recommendations of the Public Works Standing Committee had been adopted. That Committee has done magnificent work during the last few years, and has saved this country a large amount of money which otherwise would have been wasted. I do not want to put any impediment in the way, but I urge the Government and those who control the public purse in these times of stress- a stress which may be largely increased in the years before us-to move slowly. Mi*. WATKEETS - What a change since you were Minister!",40
170,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No . When I was Minister I was just as careful in the spending of a shilling as if it had been my own money, and a man who would act otherwise is not worth his salt. I appeal to the Government not to listen to this appeal to rush matters. It is supposed to come from Sydney, but I do not believe that it comes from any considerable portion of the people there:",40
171,Mr MASKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,You have been a great advocate of Canberra.,40
172,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Unles s I have an assurance that there will not be more than, one permanent paid officer on this Board, I shall, in Committee, move to strike out that portion of the clause which provides for two other paid members of the Commission. Mr F. MCDONALD (Barton) [5.35] This Bill might very well have been entitled "" A Bifi to recognise the incapacity of two Federal Departments-the Works and Eailways and the Home and Territories Departments."" Up to the present the two Departments mentioned have been doing the work which under this Bill a Commission is to be appointed to perform. Some people consider that the work has been done satisfactorily, but I .make no comment on that. The Minister seems to consider that these Departments cannot carry on the work any longer, and that it is necessary to appoint a most expensive Commission. The public of Australia would be justified in saying that if these Departments are not more capable than is indicated by the action of the Government, it would be as well if a Bill were brought into abolish them altogether. The control of the Federal TerriIt tory is their work, and the work of the Minister controlling them, but it is to be shirked by both. That is a strange condition of affairs. The reason given for the change is that because of dual control the work can not be efficiently carried out. It is remarkable that a Commission to cost £7,000 or £8,000 per annum is necessary to harmonize the work of these two Departments. I object to the appointment of the Commission, on the ground of expense; the work could, and should, be done by the Departments which have been carrying it out up to the present time. I also object to the appointment of the Commission on the ground that it is taking' from Parliament the con1 trol of its affairs. It is all very well to say that the Commission will be responsible to the Minister, but experience has tamght us that when Commissions ate appointed, and wide powers are given to theiT members, very little satisfaction can be obtained by members iin this House in respect to the matters under' their control- Time after time members haveasked, questions, only to be informed by the Minister in charge that he has little or no power, as the. control is vested entirely in ,a Commission or' Board. The same thing will occur in regard to the affairs of Canberra, and this Seat of Government House will ihave very little control over - the Commission. .No matter how incompetent its members might be, not even an .adverse vote carried by both Houses of Parliament could remove the Commissioners from office. That is a very serious position. The Bill leaves it entirely to the Miuister to suspend one or more of the Commissioners or Deputy Commissioners, but if .he did not feel disposed to .take such .action, not even a vote of both Houses could accomplish it. I take exception, also, to the clause which provides that the officers of the Commission .shall be taken from the control of the Public Service Board. Some years ago £he Government went to the expense of appointing a Royal Commission. In his report, the Commissioner (Mr MCLachlan.) advised that all the officers employed by the Commonwealth Government should be placed under one control so far as promotion and transfer were conoerned. His advice was followed by the Government, and the system has acted very well. But now a Commission is proposed which will undertake very important work, and will employ a great number of officers, but for some reason not yet made known to us, the Government proposes to remove its stafE entirely from the control - of the Public Service Board. Such a proposal is not fair to either the public vants who would be placed under the Commission or those remaining under the Public Service Board. Those of us who have had experience of. Public Service matters know that on many occasions prior to the appointment of the Public Service Board promotion went, not by merit, bub according to social or political influence. Public servants generally have been satisfied with the sysbem of promotion and transfer at present in operation. What is the reason for the introduction df this pernicious practice in connection with this important Commission ? Once they are taken over by the Commission, public servants will nob have the protection which they now enjoy, as the - present sysbem of control insures to them a reasonable chance of promotion by merit. The moment that control is baken away, the old insidious favouritism will creep in, because these things are inseparable from human nature. The man wibh social or political influence will receive promotion under the Commission which the majority may consider he does not deserve. Does the Minisber bhink that the Commissioners, in addition bo [8 MAY, .1924.] (Administration) Bill. 517 'beiug experts in administering the Federal Territory, will be experts in the manageznemb of public servants; or does he anticipate., as suggested by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony), the appointment of another Public Service Board under the Commission to manage the public servants who will be baken over ? The public servants consider this a matter of great importance. If the Minisber intends to proceed with this Bill, I ask him to give this subject careful consideration. The public iservants who go bo Canberra should - be allowed bo remain under the Public Service Board. Why should not the protection that they now enjoy remain with them when at thab city? I see no reason why the powers <of promotion, appointment, transfer, punishment for neglect of duty, and so on, should be given to the imembers of this Commission, unless to emphasize its importance. I hope the Minister will seriously - consider that matter. A great deal of difficulty may arise if this is done, because it is .contemplated that, after the work <of the Commission is completed, a great number of the public servants at Canberra - will be re-transferred to the different Departments, and be ser- again under the Public Service Board. The Minister will surely admit that, because - of undue influence, certain public servants may, under.the Commission, 'rise to high positions to which, perhaps, 'their merit will not entitle them.",40
173,Mr FOSTEB,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Practioall y all the staff required is now at 'Canberra. Mr F. MCDONALD - Every member of the - staff at present at - Canberra has the protection of the Public Service Board system. If the honourable member will look at the Bill, he will see 'that officers are to 'be removed from that system and placed entirely under the .control of (this Gommission. Existing and accruing rights are - to be preserved, but these officers will be dissatisfied if - they are taken from the conbrol of the Public Service Board; in facb, some of them have expressed bo me their dissatisfaction with this proposal. When interrupted by the honourable member for Wakefield, I was suggesting that trouble may arise when officers are ^transferred, .as, owing to some undue influence-and we know these things do happen under the best Commissions-som e officers will rise to positions not entirely by merit. When they are Jater re-transferred to the Public Service system, they will expect positions similarly paid, and, perhaps, will have sufficient influence to obtain them. This will give rise to a great deal of dissatisfaction. I am sure that no one understands the reason for this great departure from our ordinary Public Service system. The officers at Canberra will be the only set of Commonwealth servants placed under outside control. Mr MARE,-There are others.  are others, it is still a most remarkable departure to remove civil servants from this control.",41

177,Mr MCDONALD,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Mr MCLachlan, when appointed by the Government as a Royal Commissioner, recommended that there should be uniformity throughout the Public Service. Why should a Government which condemns dual control now introduce a Bill bringing dual control into the Public .Service ? Honourable members opposite talk about the abolition of dual control in the interests of economy, and advance that as an excuse for this Bill. I ask the Minister not to rob the public servants of their rights. I refer nob to the right of superannuation, nor to that of protection by the Public Service Board in the matter of transfer and promotion.",42
178,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Swan) [5.53] - I regret very much that I was absent when the' honourable member for DaRey (Mr. Mahony) was addressing the Chamber, I am given to understand bhat my name was mentioned in connection with an appointment to the Commission. I do nob know for whab objecb this was done, bub. of course, there is no doubt that if one throws mud some of it is bound to stick. If , by throwing mud at the Governmenb, the public can be induced to believe that it is desired to give public appointments to members of this House, the honourable member responsible musb take the blame. Let me point out to the honourable member that 'bhis Bill: specifically prescribes that, if practicable,, bhese appoinbments shall be given to returned soldiers; they are bo have preference. I was considerably over the age of enlisbmenb during the war, and therefore I could not come wibhin the cate-. gory of reburued soldiers. I do nob know whebher my honourable friend can make the same excuse for not being one. Ab any rate, I hardly think that his reference to. me was fair. Let me say ab once that I am nob a candidabe for a position on the Commission. Afber perusing the Bill I really cannob see any necessiby for the appointment of a Commission. I hope that, if the House approves of the appoinbment of the Commission, it will also agree to some slight amendments to the Bill so as not to take away the powers of Parliament to the extent that is proposed. A very firm attitude is now being takenby many honourable members concerning the expenditure at Canberra, and I cannot see that bhis has anybhing bo do with the Bill. We should-fight on that score when the House is considering the Estimates and the proposed expenditure at Canberra - I have opposed all along the expenditure of money there. I feel that it ig a grave error on the part of this Parliament bo sanction, it, particularly when we are bearing a heavy war debt. Bub this Parliament decided that matter, and I am always prepared bo accept Its decisions.",42
179,Mr WATKINS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,There was no hesitation in building the trans-continental railway during the war.,42
180,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I believe bhat that railway was commenced long before the war. I have always protested against Parliament whittling away ibs powers. We should, as far as possible, conserve the powers of bhis Parliament in almost every insbance. We have a Ministry in power, and we should at all times be able to place before i.t our complaints concerning extravagance or maladministration. I am always ready to submit to any decision of Parliament, bub I am not prepared bo hand over powers-as was done in connection with the building of the soldiers' homes-to a Commission, thereby making no Minister responsible for maladministration. In the case of the War Service Homes, we know that hundreds of thousands of pounds were wasted in making huge purchases, and no Minisber was responsible. ' If the Commission had not been in existence we could have laid the blame upon the Minister himself. We should not give away the powers of Parliament unless it can clearly be shown that we are to gain by it . It is many years since operations were started at Canberra. The water supply there is now completed, and the mains are being l a i d through the streets. From an engineering point of view, that work is finished. The main sewer is in the course of construction, and nearly completed. ZNTo Commission is needed to deal with future house connexions or with the water supply for the town. Most of the work is well in hand. Parliament House, when completed, will last at least 25 years. Applications are being called for competitions for the design of the main administrative building. staff required for the tional work has been obtained from the Works Department. If the three Commissioners are appointed, the additional staff will mean a heavy expenditure. We have now the staff necessary to carry out all the work required in the near future. The Minister has in his Department men competent to deal with finance and other matters. The Public Works Committee strongly urged that outside architects should, if possible, be induced to compete in designs for the buildings. That has been done with the consent and approval of the Chief Architect of the Commonwealth. We know perfectly well that if the building of the city had been left in the hands of one man there would have been a uniform design throughout. Even although I have opposed the expenditure of money at Canberra, I hope that whatever we do will be a source of pride when eventually the seat of Government is moved there. Not one member of this House can say a word against my work as Chairman of the PubUc Works Committee. I have done nothing to thwart the wishes of Parliament in any investigation made by the Committee. Our work has been honest, and we have always desired to carry out the duties that Parliament imposes upon us. What work warranting the appointment of a special Commission, taking great powers from this Parliament, is required at Canberra in the near future? Not only will the Commission have power over the Treasury ; but in this B i ll it is given power to borrow any sum of money that it chooses; it may be £100,000 or £5,000,000. All they have to do to borrow the money is to get the consent of the Treasurer of the - day. Parliament will not be asked to express any opinion on the proposed expenditure.",42
181,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The Treasurer is the Parliament.,43
182,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The Treasurer is not the Parliament. I am not reflecting upon .the Treasurer, but in time to come there may be in power a Treasurer imbued with the idea that it will be a good thing to spend large sums of money for artificial lakes and other such works at Canberra. Parliament may not consider that these works should be carried out. Yet it will have' no opportunity of saying so, and the Treasurer of the day will be able to give authority to borrow money for any The public works without consulting Parliaconstruc- ment.",43
183,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"He would not remain Treasurer for very long, if he did.",43
184,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Can the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) point to anything i u this Bill which would compel the Treasurer to submit proposals for the borrowing of money to Parliament? Mr Foster,-There is the Treasurer's responsibility to Parliament.",43
185,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Nothin g i u this Bill obliges the Treasurer to consult Parliament.,43
186,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The Treasurer would say that he had full power to do as he liked.,43
187,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That is the position. This, proposed Commission would have very wide powers. It would be able to employ whom it liked, pay what it liked, and even dispense with the ordinary Public Service tests. I do not think Parliament would do right to vest it with such powers. We have not done so with other Commissions. The Railways Commissioners have wide powers, but those powers are clearly defined, and (j the Treasurer is not able to consent to them borrowing money as they like. Probably the powers conferred upon the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works are somewhat comparable with the powers it is proposed to place in th© hands of the Federal Capital Conunission. I do not agree that the proposed Commission should have such powers, for Parliament will always be here to express its will, and to say what works should and what should not be done. Parliament should retain full power over the Territory. I am surprised to uotice that this proposed Commission is to be given full civic authority. People will be invited to* build their homes in the Federal city, if we agree to this Bill they will be given uo rights. Business people will establish themselves there, but they will have no say about what rates shall be paid. This Commission is to declare the rate. The residents of the Federal Capital will have no right of appeal to anybody except the ' Commission, and the Commission will be able to impose such water, sewerage, and town rates as it pleases.",43

190,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I intend to vote against the second reading. I know thab the Minister for AVorks. (Mr Stewart) wishes to have a workable measure, ana if the second reading be agreed to, no doubt he will take notice of* the views thab are expressed by honourable members during the Committee stage. I have not heard a. single argument this afternoon in favour of the appointmenb of the Commission.",44
191,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Every speaker has been against the Bill.,44
192,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Recently a graph was published in the Australasian, and also in the Industrial Australian, which showed how great had been the increase in the cost of government-bot h Federal and State-in Australia. In view ef the position which faces us in that respect, I think we should create no new positions unless ample reasons are. given for doing so. It would not be fair bo the taxpayer. I do not think the Government wish to make an appointment on this Commission merely to find a job for some one.",44
193,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"We are accused of wanting to appoint this Commission to give you a job,",44
194,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I think the honourable, member who made thab remark was joking, but such jokes are not fair when names are mentioned in connection withbhem. Ib is not the first time such statements have been made respecting me. Such remarks may create - the impression that honourable members do their work in this Parliament merely for the purpose of seeking some position in the Public Service. It may even be said that I am making myself nasty to get a job. I shall not be a candidate for a position on this Commission. I much prefer bo enjoy myself as a member of bhis House. I but. undersband that the Minister is not making this a party measure, but is treatingit as' a machinery Bill. I trust thathonorable members on bhis side of the Chamber will not vote for it simplv because the Government have introduced it. The House should be shown clearly that the appointment of this Commission would result in economy and better administration at Canberra. That has nob been shown so far. In. fact, the indications are that the work in the Federal territory will proceed in the future as it the has done in the past in some respects. The Bill specifically provides thab big public works shall be referred bo the Public Works Committee, and that the Public Accounts Committee shall examine the accounts. It also provides that officers of the Works and Railways Department shall be employed where that can be done. What big public works will require attention in . the next few years? I do not think it is the intention of the Government to go on, at present, with the artificial lakes which are parb of Mr Griffin's scheme! They need nob be made for years to come. The report of the Public Works Committee on the railway connection, will be placed before Parliament as soon as it is printed. The heavy work in connection with water supply, sewerage, and the establishment of a power plant has been done. Really, I can see nothing which will require the appointment of specialists. I think ib would be advisable to place the Canberra work in the control of one Department, with a special officer to deal withl*.nd matters. Dual control means trouble and delay, and friction results. Single control is much to be preferred. I think the appointmenb of a Commission could be allowed to remain in abeyance until its absolute necessity was established.",44
195,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"East Sydney) f6.101 As long as I have been a member of this House I have been asrainst the practice of whittling' away the powers of Parliamenb by the appointment of Commissions. Parliament is elected by the people, and it should be supreme. I can see no justification for placing the work at Canberra in the hands of a Commission. Good progress has beenmade, recently, in developing the Federal territory. The omcers engaged in the work are doing very well. They are comoetenb men, and have a grand conception of what the Federal city should be. Why, then, should a Commission be appointed? The Government have given us no adequate reasons for appointing the Commission^ and I am sure that the Commissions we have had in the past have been nothing to be proud of. They have prevented, rather than promoted, progress. Parliament has not Keen supreme, and Ministers have escaped from their responsibilities. Before I entered this House I gave a good deal of study to the subject of parliamentary government. I was convinced in those days that government should be by Parliament and not Dy Commissions, and I am more than ever - convinced today that that is the right policy. We have only to look at the work ofrecent Commissions to see what a mistaken policy it is to hand over our powers to such bodies. Their maladministration is a great barrier to progress. Let honourable members bring to their minds the Cockatoo Island Commission,. To think of the personnel of t h at Commission makes one shudder. Sir Will i a m Clarkson is one of its - members, and he is the gentleman who wrote some very bitter reports about 'Cockatoo Island. He was always opposed to the Government doing construction work there, and he wrote a most - condemnatory report of the place. he was appointed a Commissioner. the last few days we have heard the Prime Minister remark, "" The ' Commission has charge of the work and I cannot accept responsibility for it . We have also a. Naval Board and a Militar y Board there. During the last few weeks the Public Accounts Committee has been conducting an investigation into the expenditure incurred at the Naval College at Jervis Bay and the Duntroon Militar y College. We have been informed in the most definite manner that no reduction in the expenditure at these two establishments is advisable, and that if it wera contemplated it could only be done on the recommendation of those Boards. Then the members of the Note Issue Board are representatives of the largest loomnaercia] interests in Australia, and if an honourable member seeks information from the Government in connection with the note issue, he is told that that Department is under the control j f a Board which was appointed by a previous Government, and concerning it we know very little- a position not justified. On the retirement of Mr . MCLachlan, the ex-Public Service Commissioner, who efficiently controlled *ue Commonwealth Public Service, which is regarded as one of the finest in the world, a Public Service Board was created, the Chairman of which is a military oflicer receiving a salary of £3,000 a year, whilo the other two members each receive £ 2 , 0 0 0 a year. Notwithstanding the expense in volved in controlling. the Public Service under the existing Board, two Sub-Commissioners ar Inspectors have recently been appointed to help them to do their work. The Chairman of the Board is a very able military officer, but the environment in which he has worked for years renders him unsuitable for the important position he now occupies in connection with our civil life. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Charlton) and the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) stressed the poini thab v/hen .once Commissioners are appointed it is difficult to say where the expenditure is likely to end. Many years ago, I was a member of a deputation which waited upon the late Sit Henry Parkes concerning the appointment of a Commissionon technical education. A f t e r I had expressed my views, he said, "" Well, West, you know if I appoint a Board or Commission, every member of it Yet will want a secretary, a clerk, and a mesIn senger, and the expenditure will be much larger than you anbicipabe."" He also said during the course of the interview, "" Do not f r it t e r away th© power of Parliament, which should have absolute control over all expenditure."" I have never forgotten those words. Since the last Labour Government went out of office, numerous Boards and Commissions have been appointed, and the power of Parliament has been frittered away by its successors. Are the Government placing the responsibility of administration in the hands of Boards and Commissions because they are afraid that a Labour Government will soon be returned to power? It is cruel and unjust of honourable members to shirk their responsibility.",44
196,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"They are providing jobs for their "" pals.""",45
197,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That has already been mentioned. I intend to take every possible step to prevent extravagant and unjustifiable expenditure in connection with the appointment of Boards over which Parliament has no control. Even if administration were cheaper under a system of Boards, I would be opposed to the principle. Parliament is responsible for the taxation imposed, and, therefore, should control all expenditure. Do honourable members overlook the fact that they are senb here by their constituents to assist in controlling expendiing ture ? If the people in New South Wales - I cannot speak for the other Stateshad the opporbuniby they would dispense with the Railways Commissioners, and allow the railways to be controlled by a Minister. The action of the Government in appointing a resident Director of Works at Canberra was first suggested by the Public Accounts Committee. Colonel Owen is a capable and enthusiastic officer, and is in every way qualified to carry oub the imporbanb work which he is now undertaking. Sitting mspended from 6.SO to S - p.m.",45
198,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"-The abrogation of the rights of Parliament is bad enough, but there is a further objection that commissions do not carry out their work efficiently. They do not act in accordance with the. wishes of Parliament. Members on this side of the House have never been in favour of handing over the destinies of Australia to a Commission. Take, for instance, the War Service Homes Commission. No member of bhis House, nor of the public, can contradict me when I say that I have as, good a knowledge of the maladministration of the War Service Homes Commission as has any man. I have had an exceptionally favourable opportunity to gather information on that subject, and I have exercised my abilities, and used my knowledge as a contractor and journeyman, just as freely as if it had been a business of my view. own. I , and I think other members of the Public Accounbs Commitbee, have come to the conclusion that, had the War Service Homes administration not been placed under the control of a Commission, but had been in the hands of the Works and Railways Deparbmenb, greaterefficiency would have been secured. The staff of the Department could have been enlarged, and certain men could have been promoted to fill the new positions. We ought to encourage the promotion of men in Government Departments, rather than appoint outsiders to fill important positions. A boy entering a Government Department should have opportunities of promotion. If he is willing to make himself efficient in the Service, the highest positions should be open to him. The best positions should not be reserved for those who are born with silver spoons in their mouths. Members of this House are not fully alive to the danger of handover the work of the country to Commissions. I have been forced by my knowledge of Commissions to the conclusion that they are a dangerous obstacle to the progress of Australia. I am satisfied that if a change of Government takes place the incoming Government will have to consider very seriously whether it will allow these abominations to continue. I hope that it will abolish them and return to a sane system of government. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lisber), in his criticisms of the work of public servants, only half stated the facts. That was a dangerous thing .for him to do. I advise him that when he wants bo make a statement he should get possession of all the facts, and not attempt to manipulate them for his purpose. It is a very serious thing for a member of this House to cast a reflection upon public servanbs, who have no opportunity to reply. Personally, I shall defend them against every attack made unjustly upon them. I should be unworthy of my position if I did mot. Honourable miembers will remember that a past Government decided to build Canberra on modern town-planning lines. Designs were called for all over the world, and ib was inbended bhat Canberra should be a ciby second bo none for beauty and utility. That action greatly increased the cost, but future generations will, commend that Government for its courage and breadth of The State of Victoria has at Morwell undertaken a large scheme for the supply of electrical energy. Members of the Public Accounts Committee recently . inspected the works, which are under the direction of Sir John Monash, with a view to seeing whether they could glean any information which would be of assistance in connection with the development of Canberra. We were told that it was a very cosbly scheme. The people of Vicboria do nob ""know what ib will cost. Although the expenditure .s heavy, ; benefits will be derived from it in the future. I shall endeavour to explain the facts regarding the cost of houses. Honourable members should obtain correct infefmatiou on such matters. The Public Accounts Committee has dealt with this subject in its report, which statesThe Parliamentary Standing Committee on (Public Works, while recently considering the .question of the erection of an omcers' hostel at Canberra, drew attention to the fact that at present the Commonwealth receives in rental for these dwellings 25 per cent, less 'than the estimated annual value, plus rates .and taxes. The decision authorizing this reduction was based upon a consideration of the increased costs of construction at Canberra, and of the fact that most of the tenants are omcers or employees who arc not in receipt of large incomes. The Government should have been the sole constructing authority, and the method of construction should have been day labour. One paragraph of the report justifies me in the conclusions I have drawn from my own personal experience. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) says the cost of construction of houses is excessive. I only those who know nothing 'if the facts who talk such gibberish, but tlieir stateCrown ments do not appeal to any man who knows anything of the subject. paragraph to which I refer says The necessity for a dc-fmite and continuous programme of building construction was emphasized more than once during the course of the Committee's inquiry, and specific cases were brought under notice where competent bricklayers and other tradesmen, after completing a particular job, had to be put off cause further work was not available. Such men, on leaving the Territory, would naturally prejudice others against accepting employment there. The Government has already mad?, a move in the right direction. As the result of the observations of the Committee when it made an inspection prior to the preparation of the report, I 'believe the Chairman, when he returned to Melbourne, very rightly made certain recommendations to the Minister of ""Works, and a residential Director of Works was appointed. That was all that was required, and it is in accordance with constitutional government. The Director of Works is subject to the control of the Minister, who can advise him of the wishes of Parliament. A Commission, on the other hand, would be beyond Parliament, and would be capable of doing a lot of damage. I am satisfied that the appointment of an expensive Commission is absolutely unnecessary.",46
199,Mr LISTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I agree with the honourable member.,47
200,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The remarks of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) showed that he had not read the report intelligently. He is opposed to the transfer of the Federal Parliament to Canberra, and, as a biased man always does, he regards the matter in the wrong light. The report statesI t was explained to the Committee that as the development of the Federal Capital proceeded it was realized that the cottages being erected hy the Government, and made available for the officers stationed there, were not strictly quarters for which a charge of 10 per cent, on salary was reasonable, and it was desired that some better return be secured to the Commonwealth on its outlay. At the same time, it was recognised that officers whose duties took them to Canberra in the pioneering stages should not be placed at any financial disadvantage as compared with those residing in the capital cities. the Does the honourable member for Corio t is disagree with that? He endeavoured to create the impression that officers of the residing in the Capital City were being given a 25 per cent, advantage. The Under the heading, ""Committee's Observations and Recommendations,"" the report statesThe establishment o£ Canberra as the Federal Capital of the Australian Commonwealth, planned as a garden city, has aSorded an exceptional opportunity for the exercise of foresight in the provision of those services be- which are essential to modern convenience and comfort. Road-making, water supply, sewerage, storm-water drainage, electric power and lighting, and other services are being provided ahead of settlement, and are being designed to meet the ultimate need of a modern city, although in the first decade actual requirements may be but a fractional part of the completed project. In approaching the question of a basis for assessing rentals at Canberra, the Committee has had to keep thia aspect in mind. It is obviously impossible, and would be quite unfair, to expect a small, initial population-the majority of whom would be public servants compulsorily residing at the Seat of Government-to carry the burden. Did the honourable member for Corio read that portion of the report? I am quite sure he did not read a line of it . Further on the report statesThe Committee is of opinion that residential accommodation at the Federal Capital, whether in cottages or in hostels, should be maintained on a strictly commercial basis. The business members of. this House surely cannot object to that. The report continuesOn the other hand, officers employed, at Canberra during the initial stages: of its. development should, uot be expected! to suffer pecuniary loss by reason of their compulsory transfer to the Seat of Government; and' the Committee recommends that a scale of allowances be instituted which will compensate them for any such disability. The reason for that recommendation was that the. Committee thought that omcers should not be penalized because of the necessity for transferring them from their present location to the Federal Capital. The honourable member for Corio did not read that portion of the report, otherwise he. would not have said, that officers at Canberra were privileged to the extent of 25 per cent., which the taxpayers had. to pay. Before any honourable member makes a statement he .should have some knowledge of the facts, and should not draw entirely upon his imagination. The following portion of the report is very interestingThe assessment of rentals involves the question of rates for water supply, sewerage, &c. At first sight the capital cost of these works appears out of all proportion to the. population to be served, hut, as already stated, the main engineering works have been installed with a large ultimate population in view. It is not to be expected, therefore, that the small initial population should pay the interest and sinking fund charges on such outlay. Someloss is inevitable in the initial' stages of a scheme of this magnitude designed many years in advance. The Committee is oS opinion that, so far as the early residents bf the Capital are concerned, they should bear only a pro rata charge calculated on the basis of the population for which the respective engineering works have been schemed. The annual loss on the services, would thus decrease in proportion to the increaseof settlement. That recommendation was really the outcome of the examination of not only in the Federal Capital, area, but also in various municipalities. confident that in the future be agreed that we adopted a very broad and sensible view. This afternoon honourable member for Swan Gregory) informed honourable that ib was not necessary on this to deal wibh certain items of expenditure, because further opportunity be afforded when the Estimates were being considered. If we are to have a spectacle similar to that witnessed when last year's Estimates were under consideration, Mr West. there will be very littl e opportunityfo r any honourable member to discuss a number of items. My feelings ran very high during that 24 hoursi n which something like 66divisions were taken on various items: of the Estimates. I felt that thecircumstances: attendant on the passing' of those Estimates warranted everything which. I said and did. Had it not been for my leader (Mr Charlton), I should have taken action which would have left a greater and more lasting impression. The best way in which bo attract attention is to do> something,, even though it be detrimental to one's self, which will be reported by the press. Such action byme, at that time, I feel sure, would haveproived of value, no<b only totheelectorsof East Sydney, but to the people of Aus - 1 bralia generally. I fear that opportunityw ill not be afforded to honourable) memr bess to discuss full y the: different, items* of the Estimates while this Government is in office' - In the course of my work, on. the Committee of Public Account* I have visited the Naval College and otherinstitutions!, and the officersthere have pointed out to me",47
201,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT, Order ! That matter is not covered by the Bill .,48
202,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I was merely replying toa statement that was made by the honourable member for Swan.,48
203,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"A brief reference of that nature is allowable, but the debate must berelevant bothe Bill .",48
204,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable . member for Swan (Mr Gregory) knows as wejl aa I do the struggle of honourable members on this side to ascertain the cost of the works at Canberra. We were denied that information. I now point out to the honourable member for Swan,, and to other honourable members, that I witnesses, am taking the fullest advantage of thisopportunity to discuss the matter, because I feel I fear that a similar attitude will be . it will adopted by the Government when we come to deal with the next Budget. the It is the duty of every honourable mem(Mr ber to impress upon the Government and members their supporters the fact that the public Bill are opposed to the appointment of a Commission with such wide powers as would would be conferred by this Bill . Frequently, in reply to questions on important subjects, honourable members are in formed by the Prime Minister (Mr.. Bruce) that the matters are under the control of a Board, and that, therefore, he can give no information concerning them. If such enormous powers as are proposed under the Bill are conferred upon the Commission, honourable members who subsequently desire to be enlightened concerning affairs at Canberra will be told by the Government that they must shut their eyes, open their mouths, and swallow whatever is given them. The Commonwealth Director of Works (Colonel Owen) is a most efficient officer, and is qnite able to undertake the responsibility of supervising the constructional work. After the exhaustive inquiry made by the Public Accounts Committee the Government should have no doubt upon the matter. Colonel Owen has given faithful and assiduous service. I should advise the Government to increase his emolument, and place him in charge of the whole of the works. Does any honourable member support the action of the Shipping Board in granting Christmas holiday pay to all the permanent officers at Cockatoo Island Dockyard when the labourers in the yard were not granted one day's pay? That is the sort of thing one may expect from administration by a Board. It means class distinction all along the line, and the "" bottom dog"" is not recognised as having the rights of an ordinary human being. I do not think the Prime Minister will have the temerity to admit in this House that he is in favour of such a distinction being made. No member of the Ministry would have the courage to support such a course of action. When the responsibility has been thrust upon a Board, Ministers are glad to brush the matter aside as no concern of theirs. I am afraid that what I have said will be lost on the Government. Members of the Corner party are afraid to take action in connection with the proposed Commission, and Ministers themselves are nervous lest the members of that party bring them to book. If only the press of Australia would rally to the cause of the people most telling articles could be published pointing out the fallacy of government by Boards. Every responsible newspaper in « Australia knows that administration by this means is a delusion and a snare. The literary staffs of the newspapers of Australia include men of high calibre and honour, and I hope that they will render service to the people as a whole by vigorously protesting against this method of administration.",48
205,Mr HIARB,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Parkes) [8-39] - Amongst the first words uttered this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) was the statement that he hoped the Bill would be discussed in a non-party spirit. I should share his wish with greater confidence were I not aware of the fact that the party opposite has already made up its mind to vote solidly against the Bill.,49
206,Mr FENTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That is not so. Mr MARR*-We shall see when the numbers go up. Honourable members seem to be concerned about handing over the control of the Federal Capital Territory to a Board instead of adhering to the present arrangement of dual control by Departments with conflicting interests. I listened to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister), and 1 concluded that his argument was entirely in favour of the constitution of a Commission such as is suggested by the Government. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) stated that he wished to praise the action of the Government in expediting the work at Canberra. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) made a similar assertion, and I give both honourable members praise for rendering credit where it is due. If the Government has earned the praise of honourable members opposite, Ministers can surely be trusted to consummate the work that has been so well begun. Operations at the Federal Capital are progressing, and honourable members who have not recently visited Canberra would be amazed at the strides made in all classes of work. Sewer construction has been so far advanced that the main tunnel is almost completed. The water supply is ready in most places for connection to the houses in course of construction or to be built, and the electric light service is available. Soon there will be notices to send out and rates to be collected. Is the administration of the various departments at Canberra to be transferred to Melbourne?",49
207,Mr WATKINS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Shoul d we pay a man £3,000 a year to superintend that work?",49
208,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes , if he can do the job thoroughly. In Sir John Monash Victoria has a splendid public officer, and the salar}' paid him is not high for the work done. A salary of £10,000 a year would not be too much for a similar official at Canberra. The history of the development of Washington is on all fours with that of Canberra, even to the dismissal of the engineer whose design for the construction of the Capital was accepted. In course of time, the Parliament of the United States of America was asked to agree to a motion similar to that passed in this House last session, stipulatthe ing that the Parliament should meet at the new Capital within a certain time. It was found that a Commission was required to administer affairs at Washington, and for similar reasons it will he impossible to administer the Federal Capital Territory from Melbourne. Centralization in administration is one of the curses of the Commonwealth today. An even greater curse is the dual control by the Departments now operating at Canberra. glaring example of the circumlocution entailed by this control recently came under my notice. A new post-office was required, and a particular design was suggested. The Home and Territories Department purchased the land and submitted the design; but the Works and Railways Department immediately announced that it had its own architects to design such buildings. One Department said to the other, "" We know the class of office you want. This is our design, and you must accept it . """,49
209,Mr FENTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Ye t the honourable member desires to create another Department.,50
210,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No . I maintain that the present conflict of authority can be overcome by the appointmenb of a Commission that could deal with such matters on the spot. Why should every Government work bhroughoub the Commonwealbh be referred bo the central administration ? If we have trained officers who cannot be trusted, they should be dismissed. I have nothing but praise for Mr Goodwin. He has done good work, and I hope that such officers will remain at Canberra to help consummate the present plan; but there should be some authoriby ab the Federal Capital with power to administer the law. We are dependent, at present, upon New South Wales for the maintenance of law and order there. The Commonwealth is dependent upon the State Departments of New South Wales for police and educational services. Certainly the teacher at present stationed at Canberra is a credit to the Education Department, and the school is as good as any other State school in Australia. But there are many matters of administration which require quick decision upou the spot. I know of a man living in a Government cottage on the Yass-road whose gate came off its hinges, but he. was not allowed to touch it. He had to refer the matter of its repair to Department of Home and Territories. A local administrator would be able to deal with this and with many other matters on the spot without any of the red tape incidental to dual and centralized conbrol. There are members on' all sides of the House who have worked hard to consummate the Canberra project, but upon this proposal to appoint a Commission we hold different opinions. And it is well that it should be so, for A there would be no progress if we all thought alike. This Parliament is jiist as big or little as its members and thu people of Australia choose to make it. I hope it will always be animated by national ideals, and that it will look at every question with a proper regard for the welfare of the .nation as a whole. It is not desirable to bring the Commonwealth Parliament down to the level of a shire council, that attends to roads and bridges, but that must be the effect of bringing all pettifogging details of Canberra administration into this Chamber for discussion. I admit that the time has not arrived for the appointment of three permanent Commissioners, but there should be a permanent Chairman devoting the whole of his time to the administration of the Capital, and assisted by part-time Commissioners who would be paid fees for their services.",50
211,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,That proposal is more dangerous than that contained in the Bill.,50
212,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I do not think it is. The honourable member admitted that the Advisory Committee is an excellent body. I agree with him.,50
213,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Then 1 why alter the system ?,50
214,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Because this Parliament has resolved to meet at Canberra within a definite time, and there is need for the speeding-up of construction and administration. Washington is still controlled by a Commission. To-day there are probably not more than 150 permanent residents at Canberra, but the time - will soon arrive for the creation of an elective municipal authority to control the city. In the meantime a Commission is necessary to administer municipal affairs and the ordinances of the Territory. We all have complained because land ordinances have not been issued, and the land has not been thrown open for selection. I believe the Government were wise in deferring selection. I understand that there will be an obligation on the purchaser of a block of land to commence building within twelve months. It would not have been fair to have allowed selection twelve months ago and compelled the leaseholder to build when there was no population in the city. The Government proposes to auction the leases at an early date, and who will administer the ordinances governing them? Are honourable members satisfied that existing Departments, which already have their hands pretty full of work throughout the Commonwealth, can yet find time to attend to the details of territory administration? Surely a Commission is needed until such time as the population of Canberra is large enough to elect a municipal body. All supporters of Canberra hope that there, will be a big population there at an early date. I expect that there will - be 5,000 people permanently residing at Canberra within three years ",50
215,Mr BAMFORD,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member is very sanguine.,51
216,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That expectation is based upon the report of the Advisory Committee. To the honourable' member for Corio (Mr Lister) and others who think as he does Canberra is like a red rag to a bull; they are opposed to everything connected with it. That attitude is not fair. I give due credit to those honourable members who were opposed on principle to the creation of a Federal Capital. If I had been a member of the Federal Convention that drafted the Constitution, or of the earlier Parliaments that had to choos& a site for the Federal Capital, I would have favoured the selection of some large town or city, and converted it into a Federal Capital rather than create a new city in an populated area. But we have an obligapartments, tion to carry out the compacts that have been made by thos© who preceded us. Mr Lis TEE.'-No time limit is specified for the creation of the Federal Capital.",51
217,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"We have heard that argument too often. The honprable member is for ever saying that the time is not yet ripe. There is' no time like th© present. If a thing has to be done, do it now. The creation of th© Federal Capital is like the standardization of railway gauges in that the longer it is left the more costly it will be. Our obligations have to be faced. What is the use of shilly-shallying and throwing upon the shoulders of posterity a responsibility that belongs to us? Every member of this National Parliament should take a personal pride in making the Federal Capital the finest city in Australia. It is a project for the service of not only the present generation but of posterity also. This Parliament calls for men of vision. Members who have not vision are wasting their own time and that of their constituents. Let us take the broad Australian point of view. Although I represent a Sydney constituency I recognise that the men who are tilling the soil are the backbone of the country. W© are all trying to help the men upon the soil to establish themselves, and by their production make the country more wealthy. Let us help along the Federal Capital scheme in the same national spirit. No city in the world started under such favourable conditions as Canberra. What other city in Australia had electric light, water power, sewerage, and roads provided in advance of settlement? Those services ar© in existence at Canberra, and some authority is required for th© levying of taxation, th© collection of revenue, and the control of expenditure. Th© honourable member for Barton (Mr F. MCDonald) expressed a fear that if a Commission were appointed those public servants who were transferred to its control would lose some of the benefits of the Public Service Act, but a clause of th© Bill definitely provides that they shall retain all existing and aecrued rights. . Apart from that, more Departments and employees of th© Commonwealth Government are outside the Public Service Act and regulations than are inside.",51
218,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,That is wrong.,51
219,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"- I do not think it is. I would hold controlling officers responsible unfor the successful couduct of their Deand if a man failed I would sack him and appoint another mau who would make the Department a success. At the present time a Public Service Commission controls all appointments, promotions, and reductions in the Service. . But the person most fitted to judge the worth or worthlessness of an officer is his departmental head. Unfortunately in the service there is dual control and triple control. I do not blame the officers for the faults that are inherent in the existing system. Years ago I was a member of the Public Service; I do not regret the experience, but I shall take care that nobody over whom I have authority shall ever enter the Service. Whilst the public servant is not exactly a slave, it is a fact that the system destroys his initiative. A man's spirit is stifled by red tape before he has been in the Service twelve months. That is the curse of the system. We have an opportunity of removing that curse from the administration of Canberra by placing in charge men to whom Parliament can say, "" You are expected to make a success of this project. Build a city worthy of Australia, and Parliament will .see that your work is recognised."" Of course, Parliament will retain control, for every year the Commissioners will have to submit their estimates and reports to this House. We shall have a perfect right to discuss how they, shall raise and expend money. The Shipping Board, to which reference has beeu made, is on a footing entirely different from that of the proposed Commission. Certain assets were handed over to the Board, and it was told to make the Commonwealth shipping enterprise pay or it would be wiped out. The Federal Capital Commission will still be under the control of the Treasurer, it will still be supervised by the Auditor General, and it will have to submit reports and estimates to Parliament every year.",51
220,Mr FENTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,It will require a great many officers to do all that.,52
221,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"If I were a betting man, I should be prepared to lay five to one that as a result of co-ordination of work, the proposed Commission could reduce the staff at Canberra by 25 per cent. The Commissioner's staff will be able to deal with questions on the spot and at once, and matters will not require to he sent from one Department to another as at present. I firmly believe that the appointment of the proposed Commission will lead to a reduction in the staff at Canberra. A good deal has been said in comparing day labour with contract labour, and as I believe in giving credit where credit is due, I am bound to say that work carried out at Canberra by day labour has been done in excellent fashion, and more cheaply than it would have been done by contract. There is in charge of the sewer channel at Canberra an excellent man named Dillon. He completed the first part of the channel, and then the late Government decided to call for tenders for the second section. The man in charge of the day-labour workers on the job asked to be allowed to submit a price for the second section. That was denied him because he could not be financed, 'but I believe the Minister . for Works and Railways (Mr. Stewart) will confirm the statement that his estimated price for - carrying out the second part of the work was £28,000 lower than the lowest tender submitted for it. He was given the job, and has saved the Department about £30,000 - Some of the work done by day labour at Canberra stands to the credit of those who did it. There are no better bricks made in Australia than those which are produced at Canberra. Mr Griffin's plans required the removal of a certain hill. It would have cost a great deal to remove the hill, but the Department concerned established the Canberra brick works close to the hill, > and proceeded to make bricks out of material removed from it . The ex-Minister for Works and Railways, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster), referred to the cost ' of the carriage of coal to Canberra. Newcastle coal costs, at Canberra, probably more than it costs at Melbourne, because it has to be carried there by rail, and the rail carriage of coal is very expensive. We have a power house at Canberra which is a monument to the people who built it . It supplies power and light to the neighbouring town of Queanbeyan. When our employees go into their houses at Canberra they will find sewerage, light, and water services provided for them. I have only one fault to find with the houses that have been erected there, and it is that they have been built too closely upon an English design, and insufficient verandah space has been provided for. Any one who would find fault with the workmanship put into the buildings must go to Canberra with a view to looking for faults. I believe that the appointment of a Commission, or a - Commissioner, to administer Canberra will be a step in the right direction. If we do not appoint a Commission it will be imperative to give those who are now administering the Federal Territory more power than they at present possess. When one visits Canberra and stands on the top, of Camp Hill or Kurrajong, and looks around the Territory, he looks into the future. If he does not possess a national outlook or broad vision he should not be assisting in the building of the city. If a visitor goes to the cemetery he will find that an old lady was buried there 64 years ago, and on her tombstone are the words: "" Here we have no abiding city, but we seek one to come."" Those words are prophetic of the city that Canberra will yet be. The obligation is upon us, as representatives of the people of Australia, to visualize the city to come at Canberra and to build there, not for day, but for all time. We hope that continuous employment offering at Canberra will lead to settlement, and that will be promoted by the appointment of the proposed Commission. I have nothing to say against Melbourne as the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. I have said before, and repeat now, that if the Seat of Government had been established in Sydney, that probably would have been attended with worse results than have followed its establishment in Melbourne. I say this, because there are bigger financial and commercial interests in Sydney than there are here. This is proved by the fact that between 50 and 60 per cent, of our taxation revenue is derived from New South Wales; 48 per cent of the taxation on land and 46^ per cent, of the income tax comes from that State. These figures speak for themselves, but I hope that in New South Wales we have learned to look upon Australia as our land and not only New South Wales. We look at Commonwealth matters with broad vision. I hope that we shall all view Canberra in the same way, and will assist to make the Federal Capital a city worthy of the people of Australia.",52
222,Mr GABB,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Le t us develop our country first.,53
223,Mr MAER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member's argument is like that of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister), who says that the time is not yet ripe for Canberra. [23] Let me inform honourable members that at the present time we are paying £28,000 a year in rent for Central Administration offices in Melbourne. If we capitalized that £28,000 and put - the money into buildings at Canberra, honourable members would see how much we should have over for administrative offices. By letting land at from Is. to 4s. per acre at present we are receiving a revenue of over £30,000 a year from the Federal Capital Territory. What is the revenue from the Territory going to be when we sell leases of land there by auction? I am reminded of a statement made by the late Sir Denison Miller, whom I consulted on this question. He said, "" Let the Government give me the Canberra Territory for 20 years, and I will build them a Parliament House costing £2,000,000, put up the houses they require, present them with all necessary administrative offices, and at the same time. I will make a very good dividend for to- the bank and will hand the territory back to the Government in 20 years' time."" If we are getting a revenue of £30,000 from the Federal Capital Territory today when nothing is being done to develop it, how much may we not expect to get when we do develop it? I believe we shall get such prices for leases of land there that we shall be able to pay more than interest, working expenses, and depreciation on buildings and machinery.",53
224,Mr WATSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Where will the money come from ? ,53
225,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Fro m "" uncle."" I think it is cheaper to live on the money of other people than on one's own. The man who wipes off the debt on his home when he could do better by putting his money into his business is a fool. I do not believe that this Bill will deprive Parliament of any of its power. If I thought it would I should not vote for it. The Commission, which will really be a Commonwealth Department, will be obliged to refer everything to Parliament. Do we now control the expenditure in the Post Oflice? No. Not 1 per cent, of honourable members understand the Estimates upon which they vote. Mr E. RILEY - Le t the honourable member speak for himself.",53
226,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I am speaking for myself as well as for others. We look at the figures, but we do not know what they refer to. As a matter of fact we take a broad view. We know that the Departments are controlled by officers whom we can trust, and we approve of the figures they have prepared for us. It is true that questions are raised and grievances are aired upon various items of expenditure, but because we rely upon tliose who are administering the Departments to spend the money wisely we pass the proposed votes. Why cannot we trust this Commission in the same way ?",53
227,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Why cannot we trust (he present control ? What is wrong with it?,54
228,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The present control is lacking in that it cannot administer municipal laws. In the near future there will be a municipal council at Canberra, but the number of permanent residentsabout 200-ther e now is hardly sufficient for us to set up such a body. In addition to the permanent residents there is a floating population of about 1,000 men who are engaged on sewerage and lighting work, and for whom there is no proper accommodation. If I were a family man, with my home in Melbourne, I would very soon be "" f e d up "" with life in general if I took employment at Canberra. The best side of life is home life, and, therefore, we ought to make the conditions of the working men at Canberra as happy and contented as possible.",54
229,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Does the member suggest that' the Commission will do that?,54
230,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I do.,54
231,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member is a wonderful optimist.,54
232,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Sir John Monash has shown what good work the Commission could do a,t Canberra. He did not go to Parliament to ask for authority to build 600 houses at Morwell. He set to work at once and built them.",54
233,Mr LAZZARINI,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Why cannot a Commonwealth Minister do the same?,54
234,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Because of the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act. The Minister is compelled to ask Parliament to refer to the Public Works Committee any work estimated to cost more than £20,000, and after that body has spent a couple of months in discussing the pros and cons of the proposal, and in visiting the site of the proposed work, it recommends Parliament to do-and Parliament approves of-exactl y what the Government in the first place proposed to do.",54
235,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member is advancing a strong argument against depriving Parliament of its control.,54
236,Mr MARR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I am not. I have just pointed out that the Commission will have to submit to Parliament their estimates of income and expenditure. They will be obliged to show how they can get the revenue, and how they propose to spend it . If Parliament does not agree to any item in the Commission's estimates of expenditure, thab item can be wiped out, and if it does not approve of the proposal of the Commission to levy a rate of 2^d. in the £ 1 upon the residents of Canberra for municipal government purposes, it will have the power to veto the proposal. There are honourable members who know more about municipal government than I do. They know very well the functions carried out by State Parliaments. I hope thab the Federal Parliamenb will never become a roads and bridges, ababtoirs, and sewers Parliament. ""Yet a body capable of dealing with such matters is essential at Canberra. A few weeks ago I saw some of the roads and bridges built in the Federal Territory. They are worthy of the Deparbmenb that has builb them, but all these things must be administered. A Commission levying rates and bases, and carrying oub ibs duties on the spot, would prove as successful in its operations as the Commonwealth Bank has honourable under the unfettered control of the Governor of the Bank. The man working at Canberra could lay his grievances before a Commissioner living on the spot, and have them removed at once. The man requiring repairs to his house could have them carried out immediately. I trust that honourable members will look upon this question in a non-party spirit. If they do so, I am satisfied that they will vote for. the Bill . I believe this Commission will be the best thing for Canberra, but I do not think it is necessary at this juncture to appoint three Commissioners. If one man only was appointed, I would not object, so long as he was a good man, if his salary was £5,000, or even £7,000 a year. The Bill provides for £3,000, bub we can deal wibh the question of salary in Commibbee. Whether ' the other two Commissioners should be permanent officers or only part-time Commissioners is also a matter for the Committee to decide.",54
237,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Denison) [9.21] - The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) stated thab bhis had been made a party measure. That is not so, however, as we have already had strong speeches from members of his own party in opposition to the Bill ; and if little rumours which circulating are correct, we may have two or three others from that side of the Houso voicing the same opinion as was expressed by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister). I am opposed to this measure, as I believe that Parliament should retain to the fullest extent all its existing powers. Some of us remember the magnificent' oratory to which we listened - on the occasion of the laying of the first foundation stone at Canberra. It was then predicted that the new Capital City would be a model for all Australia, and even the whole world. If Canberra is to be such a model city, Parliament should exercise the fullest control over it . Instead of retaining that control, we are asked to hand over to this Commission very drastic powers. We have only to. look at sub-clause 2 of clause 5, which readsThe Commission shall be a body corporate, witli perpetual succession and a common seal, and may acquire, hold, and dispose of real and personal property, and shall be capable of suing and being suedto see that. That clause shows the powers which this Parliament-the elected representatives of the people of Australia*-is asked voluntarily to hand over to a Commission. It is all very well for the M in ister to say that Parliament will retain very great powers, but we shall find that many things will be done by the Commission with which Parliament might not agree, but concerning which it will be absolutely powerless, because it wil l be too late to alter what has been done. The argument that this business could be better handled by a Commission reminds' us of some of the Commissions which have been appointed by this Parliament in the past. Some of us have bitter recollections of the enormous blunders made by the War Service Homes Commission in the earlier days of its existence; we meet with them every day. When individual members are consulted by returned soldiers who want some concession in respect to their homes, and bring the cases before the Government, we are told that already the War Service Homes Commission has been too costly a creation, and that too great a sum of money has been spent. We know that the enormous losses which were incurred were due to the War Service Homes being originally under the War Service Homes Commission instead of Parliament retaining greater control over them. Our experience of .many of the Commissions appointed by the Federal are Parliament within the last few years is not such as to create in us a desire for the appointment of other Commissions with wide powers. In the teeth of considerable opposition, I have at all times in my own State supported the building of a Federal Capital. Outside of New Soutli Wales the people of Australia are not so keen on the building of the Federal Capital as are those resident in the Mother State. That is only natural; but I have always maintained that Parliament shall observe the condition laid down when we entered into Federation, namely, that a capital city should be established in New South Wales. I have had great difficulty in making the electors of Tasmania understand the necessity for this new capital. I was in this Parliament when the first measure for the creation of a new capita^ city for Australia was introduced, and had I considered my individual opinion only T would have voted against it , as I did not think it necessary then. T do not know that it is really necessary now, but we must honour the compact made with New South Wales; and on every occasion that the question has come before Parliament I have voted in that direction. I shall have still greater difficulty in making the electors in my State understand the reason for the expenditure of another £7,000 .a year on this Commission. To me, the creation cf this Commission, of which the Chairman is to get £3,000 a year, and two other members £2,000 each, is an absolute waste of public money.",54
238,Mr BRENNAN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The three Commissioners will only be the departmental heads. Mr O ' KEEFE - If one Commissioner only is appointed, he will probably be given a larger salary, although it may not cost the full £7,000; but such Commissioner would still only be a head, and there would still have to be experts, and other officers and employees, in the various departments, the same as if there was no Commission at all. I cannot understand why this work cannot go on as at present for at least another two or. three years.",55
239,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,We shall be there long before that; we shall be there next year.,55
240,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"There is no necessity for Parliament to delegate this power to any Commission for at least two or three years. The work could go on just as quickly, efficiently, and cheaply under the control of the heads of the present Departments. If the Government does not consider the ""Works and Railways Department should have control, or if the interests of two Departments clash, what is to prevent the whole of the work being placed under' the control of the Home and Territories Department, _ and the expert official heads of that Department being in charge of the work as in the early days of Canberra? consider that years will elapse before the necessity for the of this Commission necessity does not exist at present. I do not oppose the measure on party grounds, as, from my point of view, this is not a party measure at all. The whole of my actions respecting Canberra for a number of years have shown that, while the great majority of electors in Tasmania have always opposed the expenditure of even £ 1 on the desert city, or the bush capital, as it is called, I have continually tried to impress upon them the necessity for honouring the compact with New South Wales. tainly vote for the Bill if I thought that the creation of this Commission would facilitate the carrying out of that compact. As it will not, I do not feel in clined to vote for the second reading of the Bill . I wish to point out that, although clause 10 purports to protect the Government from maladministration on the-part of the Commission, the proposed safeguard is entirely insufficient. of clause 10 readsIf a Commissioner, or an Acting sioner, becomes in any way concerned or interested in any contract or agreement by or on behalf of the Commission, or in any way participates, or claims titled to participate, . in the profit of, or in any benefit arising therefrom, otherwise member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than twenty-five persons, he shall be guilty of an indictable offence. There is no safeguard in the clause to prevent any member of the Commission from furthering his own interests at the expense of the Commonwealth. be possible that, in an incorporated company consisting of , say, 26 persons, a Commissioner may hold nine-tenths the shares. The clause is inserted palpably to prevent any member of the Commission from enriching himself at the expense of the general taxpayer; but it will Mr O'Keefe. at least require alteration, as, in its present form, it is no safeguard against corruption, such as that which the majority of people allege occurred in the early stages of the administration of the War Service Homes Department. I honestly believe that the appointment of the Commission will have no effect on the progress of the work at Canberra, and that the expenditure of £7,000 for the salaries of three Commissioners will be money wasted. There are thousands I of returned soldiers in Australia today who are claiming assistance from the appointment Government. Many of these men, through .arises; that no fault of their own, are derelicts. The Government contend that the state of the finances will not permit them to assist these men to any great extent; therefore, we have to look very carefully into proposals such as this, - under which £7,000 per annum will be practically thrown away. In any case, a few heads of Departments will benefit by the expenditure. As has been interjected during this debate, when this Department is created it will grow to an enormous extent, just as many other Commonwealth I should cer- Departments have done.",55
241,Mr WATSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Premantle) [9.35] I wish to inform the House that I have been to Canberra, and, incidentally, that I have returned with a few impressions and a very bad cold. The cold I intend, if possible, to keep to myself, and the few impressions I shall endeavour to convey to the members of the House, if my limited vocabuSub-clause 2 lary will permit .'me to do so. Pirst of all, I wish to express my appreciation Commis- of the services being rendered to Australia by those in charge bf made the operations at Canberra. I was to been- under the impression, from what I there- had heard from very many sources, that or emolument the go-slow policy was being adopted at than as a that city, that there was not very much enthusiasm shown on the part of the workers, and that, as a matter of fact, it was a general "" take-down."" Quite the opposite is the case. I believe the directors of the operations at Canberra are unitedly and enthusiasticIt may ally working to carry out their duties in the interests of Australia. I . was delighted with the enthusiasm displayed by the of foremen. Although not an eavesdropper or a spy, I watched and spoke to the men at work, and found that every one of them was honestly trying to do Iris duty by the Parliament and the people of Australia. That being so, 1 cannot see the necessity for the appointment of the Commission. know that some people seevisions. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr . Marr) said that I lacked a broad vision. I am not old enough, I suppose, to have a wide vision, but probably when I am older my vision will expand; bub at prest/nt I cannot visualize with the honourable member. The appoinbmenb of the Commission seems to me to be absolutely unnecessary and dangerous. Appointing a Board or Commission is very much like getting into debt. It is a very pleasant operation up to a point; but the getting ri d of a Board, like gettiug r i d of a debt, is often unpleasantly difficult; and possibly the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Sbewarb) may find it so in the near future. There is another analogy between the appointment of a Board and getting into debt-bot h have great aptitude for throwing out a bay window here and a buttress there, an extension here and an extension there, and before long they assume very serious proportions. At present there is no necessity bo appoinb a Commission to carry out the operations at Canberra. I wish to pay a ' tribute to the Minister. I found that the utmost good-feeling prevailed among all the people at Canberra. I did not hear one man speak a derogatory word respecting another man, and I saw a good deal of the people while I was there. The directors were delighted with the foremen, and the foremen were delighted with their workers. great tiling to find men pleased with their "" bosses."" The work is beilig carried on effectively. I feel that it is only just to the Minister for Works and Railways to congratulate him upon his administration. He is not a friend of mine. I do not think that he and I altogether harmonize, but that shall not prevent me from paying my tribute to his work at Canberra. I have methods of investigation of my own. I walked round a good deal during my stay in the Territory. As a matter of fact, I am usually rather au fail with workmen, possibly because I was once a worker myself. Perhaps it would be better for the country if I were still one. It was a pleasure to find such a spirit of hearty co-operation. Everybody seemed to be pleased with, and to have confidence in , the Minister. They believed that lie wished to give them a fair deal, and they said,'"" We want to give him a fair deal I in return."" Respecting the day-labour system, my experience has been that under good control men will do more by the day-labour system than they will do by the contract system. I do not care whether the leader of the men be called a Minister, a foreman, or a director. If he is the right man he will get good work out of the men. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) said today that the contract system was simply the day-labour system, plus the contractor's profits, and I believe, in some instances that that is so. It is a great thing that the directors of the work at Canberra have confidence in the Minister. It is a still greater thing that the foremen have confidence in the directors. The greatest thing of all is that the workers have confidence in the foremen. I am opposed to the appointment of this Commission, because I think it is quite unnecessary, and is an altogether useless expense. It may k ill the enthusiasm at present being displayed. The work is being carried on more economically than would be possible under a Commission. The suggestion that the officers at present in control should be given a little more power may be wise. Perhaps it would be advisable to give them the status of Commissioners, and appoint a Chairman with some financial ability to guide the destinies of the Federal Territory. That might relieve It is a the Minister for Works and Railways of a good deal of detail work. But I am positive that it would not be in the best interests of Australia to create a Commission with the powers set out in this Bill. Therefore, I shall vote against the measure. I had nothing to do with making the compact to build the Federal City, but no one would be more loth than I to break such a compact. Unquestionably a compact was made with New South Wales at the foundation of Federation that the Seat of Government should be in New South Wales, but not less bhan 100 miles from Sydney. We must honour the compact. I do hot think, however, that there is any obligation Upon us to build an ornate city. Though I was so delighted with the surroundings and work at Canberra 'the whole thing seemed to me to be the w i ld phantasy of a disordered dream. is my set opinion, and I shall require good reasons for altering it . not help admitting that the surroundings and design of the city are delightful. It might well be called the city of a thousand hills, for ranges of mountains and hills surround it . The climate is good and the situation beautiful. The productive capacity of the Territory is limited to sheep-raising. Very little of is suitable for agriculture. tory cannot produce new wealth for Australia, and the Australiau people may as well realise that at once. true, as the honourable member for Parkes has said, that we shall get back from the Territory, by way of city rentals, all the money spend upon it , but we shall never get new wealth from it . _ The country cannot produce new wealth. All that we can expect is to obtain from the lease of the land and in other ways some return of the large expenditure that has been incurred. A remarkably fine water service has been provided, and the sewerage scheme is excellent. I know a little about that class of work; and I think the Minister for Works and Railways has placed the very possible in charge of that department. 1 knew him years ago on the Kalgoorlie goldfields. He is earnest, capable, and enthusiastic, and I think he has done his work at Canberra at a wonderfully low cost. In view, however, of our enormous national debt I do not think that Ave should have embarked upon the construction of a wonder city such as we are told this will he. Who can dany that Australia is labouring under an enormous national debt- a greater debt than the British national debt before the Avar?",56
242,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,It is a mere bagatelle.,58

When inspecting the Federal Capital, I was reminded of a person named J i m MCGregor.

The first thing he did Avas to erect a mansion in the centre of the property, in which he entertained his friends most lavishly.

Canberra resembles the house which MCGregor built, in that it is quibe unnecessary bo expend on a Federal Capital large sums of money which could be wisely expended in other directions."" If the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra Avill be the means of creating a national spirit, and prevent the representatives of the people from calling each other bad names, and put an end to party bickering, I shall support its construction. But Aye do not Avant an ornate building in ideal surroundings to create a national spirit. In another 100 years, Avhen Canberra may be a city, the largest portion of Australia's population will be in Queensland or Western Australia. It is deplorable to think that the people of New South Wales Would not enter the Federation u n t i l it was decided that the Federal Our Capital should be in that State. Victoria fought hard for the Seat 'of Government to be in Melbourne, and the people of New South Wales firml y stipulated that it should be in their State. Can that be regarded as an exhibition of a national spirit? The erection of the Capital is at present being eai'ried out in the most expeditious way, and there is no need for the appointment of a Board of Commissioners. If I can be persuaded that if the Seat of Government is transferred as is snggesbed, a national Australian sentiment will be created in such a way that we will be able to rise to the occasion, shoulder our responsibilities, and dispense with party bickering, I shall be one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the project.",58

We are informed that a broad national outlook or a broad national spirit will generate or develop, but I should like to know in what way it is to generate. We sliould deal with this matter as practical Australians. The honourable member for Dalley (Mir.

249,Mr YATES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That is a common-sense interjection. A compact was entered into with the State I represent to do somevenue thing for the benefit of Australia, and to City here. protect it against invasion. the Federal Capital, on its proposed site, ever be ? It will be an exotic growth. I about it . "" stood on Mount Stromlo a few weeks I went, there at the invitation of those who thought I was talking from want of knowledge. I first visited Canberra, however, when General Bridges was buried, and I stayed there a week. I saw little to impress me. I was told previously that I did not know what I was talking about, and that if I could see Canberra again I would change my opinion. I have seen it again. I have noted the development that has taken place. I have seen this mighty city of little humpies aud "" wigwams."" They have there a building which they call a hostel. In the village from which I came in England the boys used to put their knuckles on the edge of the gutter, and were declared clever if they could fire an alley over the littl e country ""pub. "" It would be almost as easy - I can to fire an alley across the hostel at Canberra. We are told that the city of Canberra is being.built by men who are big and broad-minded, and have visions. There is no doubt that they have "" visions."" Posterity will want to know how they applied those visions, and where they got them, They did not get them from common sense. I am prepared to make that assertion. I ask any one to go to Canberra with me and show me where there is any justification for the expenditure of the taxpayers' money. Somepeople say we must ""honour the compact."" Why should we be governed by the dead hand of the past, by the petty little State ideas of those who were in power when Federation was consummated, I do not mind the Federal Capital being in New South Wales if we can create a broad, national spirit in New South Welshmen. If I give them a capital, .L want a quid pro quo for the taxpayers, who will have to pay for it . In that regard we must consider the circumstances of the selection of the site. Can any ono 0 When I stood on Mount Stromlo with the Minister for Def fence, I asked him to view the contour It consists of littie hillocks surrounded by big mountains, some rising 6,000 feet above the sea level. I said to him, "" Show me where the recan come from to finance a Capital If you can show m& that What can this place will pay for the money already spent, I will admit that I know nothing He could not do it . No man ago. in this House can tell me where the revenue can be obtained in the Capital Territory to maintain the projected It is nonsense to say it will he obtained from land values. The reason given the Minister for the high cost of bricks at Canberra is that the cost of coal excessive owing to the cost of transport. In the light of that statement, can never - be a manufacturing Eural industries will be its sole support. Every town and city in Australia is living upon the productivity State in which it is situated. perity of any town is dependent upon the rest upon it . prosperity of its hinterland. the mining towns which rise and flourish, and become large cities while they produce city in the making. the wealth that sustains them. as the source of that wealth is exhausted progress made there. they wilt and die, unless, as in the case of Ballarat and Bendigo, is agricultural country them. In Silverton, near Hill, large buildings bought today, but no one will buy them because there is no use for them. in Coolgardie some time' ago, and saw large buildings-hotels, banks, and structures-from which everything ful, including the iron roofs and wooden rafters, had been removed. dition of affairs had been reached bedeveloping cause the industry that formerly kept town going had wilted and died. town is no longer there. Those prove that every town is maintained the productivity of the country it. I ask"" the' Minister and any other enthusiastic supporter of ""What will keep Canberra going? there any possibility of mining ment? Is there any possibility of trade filtering through to Jervis Bay from any portion of New South Wales not provided for by Sydney? Is there any possibility of Canberra becoming a commercial or obtained manufacturing centre?"" It cannot said that Canberra will be an important centre because we take Parliament and transport administrative officers. The result of that may be that will have there a few boarders, who will survive as long as the people in the other States pay for their upkeep. words, Canberra will be a Commonwealth country residence, and very few people have a country residence and support it by revenues from the same district. Adelaide people go to Mount Lofty for country residences. The Mr Yates. city. parts of that district are occupied by market gardeners, .and their produce goes not by to the country residences but to the city. That is what we shall have at Canberra. is No one-knows how this city will grow. I suggest that it can only grow from the Canberra expenditure of the taxpayers' money, town. which must be drawn from revenues derived from the productivity of other porto-day tions of the continent. I am of of the opinion that Parliament should not give ' The prosaway the power and responsibility that We should "" carry our There are own baby,"" which we have brought into existence in the shape and for m of this Some honourable As soon members have spoken of the great I was somewhat astonished, in view of all that there had been said, to find that after so many surrounding years the city had not progressed to a Broken greater extent. Judging by the progress made up to date, it will be very many .can be years before Canberra is anything like a city. It will not in our time be equal I was to .a decent suburb of one of the capital cities of the Commonwealth. The object other of my remarks is to try to get members useof Parliament to recognise their responsibilities to the people of Australia, and This conto stop filling them up with the idea of a big city. The sooner we get the the taxpayers to realise the waste off The money that, is taking place, and wake facts them up to the fact that they are tied by down by enactments made years ago, around which are not justified today, and set about revoking what has been done, the Canberra, better it will be for all. In that way Is we would be doing the honest thing by developthe electors who ' return us to this House. It is easy to go on the hustings and speak to the uninitiated electors of the high ideals of a capital city, but it is by no means fair that support should be in that way. If the capital city be had been placed in a situation that could be justified, it would, perhaps, not be there possible to level so many complaints offices and against it today. If any honourable memwe ber can justify it I shall be pleased to hear him. Where is the wisdom and common sense in putting the city where it is ? In other Provision has been made for water supply, sewerage, and electric light. Let us consider . the water supply first. Can any honourable member j u s t if y what In has been done there? They have put a dam across the Cotter Eiver, just above productive the junction with the Murrumbidgee. The water, having been dammed taken half-a-mile through an immense hill, then under the Murrumbidgee, and finally is pumped to the top of Mount Stromlo, whence it is reticulated the Capital City area. No doubt it is a marvellous engineering feat, but would have been entirely unnecessary if a suitable site had been selected. Of course, it may be said that there is only one lift, but for how long 1",59
250,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,For ever.,61
251,Mr YATES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes , for ever. answer exactly sums up the position. I could admire the statesmanship of a man like the late Lord Forrest, who put through a scheme for the supply of water as an essential commodity to the city of Kalgoorlie, but I cannot understand the reason for pumping water for ever to a reservoir on top of a h ill at the Capital City before the City itself can be reticulated. There were at least a dozen other places in New South Wales where the Capital City could have been built just as well as at Canberra, and the available water supply used for power purposes. Of course, this could have been done also at Canberra, if they had taken the dam wall up another 100 feet.",61
252,Mr FOSTEB,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That ought to have been done. . Mr YATES - The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster), who is an ex-Minister, admits that a mistake was made, because if the height of the dam had been increased, as had been suggested, it would have been possible, by means of powerful turbines, to create sumcient power for the City itself. That has not been done, and now high the timbers. prices have to be paid for coal for the power-house. Whenever any one talks about cutting the loss and stopping f ther expenditure of public Canberra one is looked on as a "" L it t l e Stater""- a man without vision or a national outlook. The real truth is that the electors, who sent us here, do not know the extent to which money is being wasted at Canberra. I have no desire to request. criticize the general lay-out of the city. It may be all right, but when I was there the section of the Molonglo River, forming part of the artificial lakes scheme, was a series of little billabongs, and there was about as much water in them as sees during the summer in the River time. [24 ] up, is Torrens in Adelaide, when the sluice gates are opened for cleansing purposes. There we have also a dam and an artificial lake, and lately the authorities have been pumpthrough ing away deposits of silt known as Cohen's Island and Frank Moulden Peninsula, names given to these deposits of silt because civic fathers of that name allowed them to appear in the river. I feel sure that the same problems will present themselves in an aggravated form in connection with the ornamental lake That scheme at Canberra. In my opinion, the whole scheme is something in the nature of a bad dream, nnd the sooner we get rid of it the better for the people of Australia. Turning now to the sewerage system, I admit that the engineers have carried out a big job. There is no doubt that they have provided for posterity. The system is big enough to deal with the sewerage of almost any city in Australia. The main sewer is 5 f t . 6 in . high. I went down it. It is egg-shaped. Everything is up-to-date. All that is wanting is enough water to flush it . Heaven only knows what wil l happen if it is flushed frequently; I . am afraid the reservoir will be emptied. I cannot see any justification for that expenditure. I went down one of the sewer tunnels for about 200 yards. On the rock face side they have simply cemented the sides of the rock, but on the alluvial side the sewer is all timbered up, and the cement has been put over the timber. It is a costly job, but what is a million when you hare got a good sewerage system ?",61
253,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,They could not draw,61
254,Mr YATES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I know that. I went down one sewer from one end to the other, u r - and I saw the whole work. I ask leave money on to continue my remarks.
