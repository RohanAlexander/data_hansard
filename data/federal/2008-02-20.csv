1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 9 am and read prayers. NA,17
2,The SPEAKER,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,"On 14 February the honourable member for Sturt drew to my attention concerns that had been expressed about whether parliamentary privilege would attach to the sittings of the House scheduled to be held on Fridays. On 18 February he drew to my attention the case Marquet v Attorney-General (WA) (Supreme Court of Western Australia and High Court), and copies of the judgements have been obtained. The honourable member referred to legal advice that had been mentioned by the Leader of the House. I can advise the honourable member for Sturt that I have not seen that legal advice but I have consulted the Clerk of the House, as I told him I would. The amendments to the standing orders made last week provide that, if attention is drawn to the state of the House during a sitting on a Friday, the Speaker shall announce that he or she will count the House following the conclusion of grievance debate, if the member who has called the quorum then so desires. The Clerk is not aware of any case concerning parliamentary privilege in respect of either house which has been decided on the basis of whether a quorum had been present when words were spoken or actions taken. Standing order 54 requires that the Speaker cannot read prayers to commence a meeting of the House unless a quorum is present. This provision will apply on scheduled sittings on Fridays. The provisions for the counting of the House during sittings on Fridays are set out in standing order 55, paragraph (c). These provisions reflect the concept embodied in standing order 55, paragraph (b), which has applied in respect of the counting of the House on Monday and Tuesday evenings. Certainly no relevant cases in which privilege has been an issue have arisen since those provisions have been operative. Members will be aware that the House often conducts proceedings when a quorum is not present. Unless a division is required neither the votes and proceedings nor the Hansard record will show whether a quorum has been present when a decision has been made-for example, on the third reading of a bill. The Clerk is not aware of a case concerning either house when a decision made in such circumstances has been held to be invalid on the ground that a quorum was not present when the decision was made. The Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 provides for the continuation of the provisions of article 9 of the Bill of Rights, 1688. Subsection 16(2) of that act provides, in part: For the purposes of the provisions of article 9 of the Bill of Rights, 1688 as applying in relation to the Parliament, and for the purposes of this section, proceedings in Parliament means all words spoken and acts done in the course of, or for purposes of or incidental to the transacting of the business of a House or of a committee ... It is clear that words spoken and acts done in the course of proceedings of a house are protected, and it may be held that words spoken and actions taken from the commencement of a sitting until the adjournment of the House form part of ‘proceedings in parliament'. However, even if this view was not accepted as applicable in some circumstances-such as if a quorum was not found to be present when the House was countedit is not easy to see that words spoken by members or actions taken by them during such proceedings would be found not to be covered by the phrase ‘for purposes of or incidental to the transacting of the business' of the House. Naturally, it would be my hope as Speaker that it would never be necessary to adjourn the House on a Friday because it was found that a quorum was not present when the House was counted following the conclusion of the grievance debate as required by the standing orders. If this hope is realised then members will not have cause for concern.  indulgence, Mr Speaker, I thank you for the effort you have gone into in responding to my genuine request for information. I look forward to reading the statement in greater detail and I am sure you will understand if I might return to the subject later today, perhaps after question time.",17
3,The SPEAKER,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,I hope that is not necessary.,18
4,Mr RUDDOCK,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,"Berowra) (9.05 am)On indulgence, I raised this matter in the debate and I used the words ‘more abundant caution'. I did so very deliberately because in my experience, when there is possible doubt, one ought to act in a way which will protect those who may be exposed. I have listened very carefully to the words chosen, which indicate to me that the Clerk cannot give definitive advice. Mr Albanese interjecting",18
5,Mr RUDDOCK,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,"I say to the minister: the words may, when you are addressing the question of whether coverage would be there, were the words I heard. I would like to think that some further consideration might be given to the protection of members. While I note the Speaker's desire that nobody would seek to draw attention to a lack of quorum at the end of the sittings after the grievance debate, that seems to me to be an aspiration, a hope, that that point might not be taken. I think there are distinct possibilisueties that such points could be taken and I think it is a matter on which there should be further reflection in order to protect members.",18
6,The SPEAKER,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,I think that on careful reflection the member for Berowra might have adopted a different construct of the words that I used. I think I indicated that I hoped it would not be necessary. The standing orders allow for certain actions. I call the Leader of the House on indulgence.,18
7,Mr ALBANESE,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS," Mr Speaker, I thank you for your diligence in getting back to the House in response to the questions that have been raised. In response to those questions: it was never the intention of the government to question the fact that quorums needed to be formed in order for the parliamentary session to begin. We accept that it is the government's responsibility to do that; however, I note that there was considerable discussion in December and January-prior to any objections to the proposed Friday sittings being raised by members of the opposition-that the opposition would also play a cooperative role in forming a quorum at the beginning of the Friday sessions. I note also that that would be consistent with the fact that there has been a generally cooperative relationship, since Federation, from both sides of the chamber when it comes to dealing with private members' business; that on Mondays, since I have been here, there have not been quorums called; that in the Main Committee, since I have been here, there have not been quorums called; that in both those chambers sue?",18
8,Mr ALBANESE,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,You raised it. ,18
9,Mr ALBANESE,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,You had two speakers per and move a suspension of standing orders.,18
10,The SPEAKER,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,"Order! The member for Sturt! I call the Leader of the House on indulgence, briefly.",19
11,Mr ALBANESE,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,"It is just as, from 6.30 to eight o'clock, without exceptions, based upon the standing orders moved by the then government, supported by the then opposition, there have been no quorums called and no divisions called. That is the situation. Mr Broadbent- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is this: the Leader of the House is claiming indulgence and he is now clearly debating the issuegoing over old ground and debating the issue.",19
12,The SPEAKER,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,This just goes to show that there is a bit of a grey area about indulgence; that is all it proves. I have tried to generous to both sides. I will allow the Leader of the House to complete his statement. I ask him to do so quickly.,19
13,Mr ALBANESE,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,In conclusion: I am happy to be the only speaker on our side in response to the two speakers on that side of the House on this matter.,19
14,The SPEAKER,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,I call the Clerk.,19
15,The Clerk,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,Government much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Sturt from moving the following motion,19
16,The SPEAKER,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,Order! The member for Sturt will resume his seat. I simply say to him that I had called on the order of the day and the Clerk has the order of the day. ,19
17,The SPEAKER,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,I will just do a little bit of a tutorial. The calling on of the order of the day means that there is business before me. SCREEN AUSTRALIA BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Garrett. Bill read a first time. Second Reading,19
18,Mr GARRETT,QUORUM REQUIREMENTS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts) (9.12 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This government places a very high value on a creative and viable Australian film and television industry. Our film and television industry has world-class facilities and punches well above its weight with its award-winning and highly regarded productions, cast and crew. We can all be proud of be the industry's international reputation for excellence, hard work and dedication. Beyond its contribution to our cultural life, the sector's input to the Australian economy is also significant, contributing some $1.5 billion annually to GDP and employing more than 50,000 people. In a global entertainment environment, the challenges facing the industry have been well documented. In particular, the industry has lacked sufficient private investment to provide a strong capital base. Production levels and box office returns continue to fluctuate and filmmakers are unable to build strong creative businesses. The government recognises its responsibilities to support the industry in meeting these challenges. Without strong government support, Australian voices on our screens would be considerably muted. The government is committed to providing a framework within which the industry can grow and prosper and establishing Screen Australia is part of that framework. This bill establishes a merged film agency, Screen Australia, as the key direct funding body for the Australian screen production industry. The bill facilitates the merger of majority of the functions of the Australian Film Commission, the Film Finance Corporation Australia and Film Australia Ltd into a single statutory agency. Whilst in opposition and as shadow minister for the arts, I called early for consideration to be given to creating, through merging, a single screen authority-a body such as this. The government committed to establishing Screen Australia in its 2007 election policy, New Directions for the Arts. And as further evidence of its commitment to the Australian film and television industry, the government has identified the development of a globally innovative and competitive film industry for consideration at the Australia 2020 summit to be held in Parliament House on 19 and 20 April. The new agency will have a strong focus on cultural objectives while also pursuing the growth of a more competitive screen production industry. The synergies created by combining the resources of the three agencies will enhance coordination, facilitate strong national leadership for the screen production industry, and enable a fast response to changing national and international opportunities and challenges, such as technological innovations and changing audience preferences. It will free up resources which can be directed towards new industry priorities. The bill outlines the proposed functions and powers of the new body, together with the proposed governance and accountability arrangements. The functions largely reflect the combined functions of the existing agencies, with the principal exception being due to the establishment of the National Film and Sound Archive as a separate statutory authority, the legislation for which is also being introduced today. The new agency will have a strong emthe phasis on cultural objectives and artistic merit. Its functions also emphasise the importance of improved commercial sustainability for the industry, which will continue to face significant challenges due to its small size, relative isolation and difficulties in competing with imported product, notably of course from the United States. Screen Australia is to be an agency with a strong cultural mandate and one which also understands the importance of filmmakers relating to their audiences and developing their businesses. The bill provides Screen Australia with the following functions: - Support and promote the development of a highly creative, innovative and commercially sustainable Australian screen production industry; and - Support or engage in the development, production, promotion and distribution of Australian programs and the provision of access to Australian programs and other programs; and - Support and promote the development of screen culture in Australia. In performing its functions, Screen Australia will have a continuing responsibility for the development of areas of particular public interest and cultural merit, such as documentaries and children's programs. The government's expectation is that the agency will continue to emphasise programs of real national significance in all fields. In particular it is expected that the National Interest Program undertaken by Film Australia will continue, and even be broadened beyond documentaries where appropriate. I expect that the agency will have an important role in promoting the work of emerging filmmakers. As well, our Indigenous filmmakers have carved out a special place in Australia's tural life and it is critical that Indigenous voices, and Indigenous stories, are seen and heard on Australian screens, and brought to Australian audiences. The government is keen for the screen production industry to move beyond a cottage industry and for it to provide ongoing work for the many highly talented Australians who currently either have to work overseas for long periods or have to find employment in other industries to supplement their incomes. It should also seek to provide opportunities for world renowned Australians eager to come home to work to be able to do so. To this end, Screen Australia will be expected to realise its cultural objectives while also being acutely conscious of the need to promote the development of commercially focused screen businesses. While funding will be available for single projects and indiand viduals, significant funding will also need to be directed to sector capacity building and supporting industry professionals willing to build businesses rather than move from one project to the next. The continuing trend of rapid technological, cultural, social and political change means the Australian industry in coming years is likely to be a different industry to the one we have now. The recently introduced producer offset will provide a significant avenue for funding for many films and television projects and will enable producers to retain equity in their projects while, at the same time, attracting higher levels of private investment. This provides opportunities and challenges for Screen Australia. Because the producer offset can be the primary vehicle of government support for many productions, Screen Australia will be able to invest more funding in activities not directly associated with production. These cul- include individual and project development activities, and those activities which provide the wider Australian community, including regional Australians, with access to Australian audiovisual product. Many have advocated the need for more government support during the development phases of projects to ensure that those films which go into production have the best chances of success. The extent to which Screen Australia should support marketing and distribution is also an important issue. I expect the debate on how Screen Australia will evolve from its predecessors will pay a great deal of attention to identifying new priorities. The degree to which Screen Australia should provide investment funding to projects which also receive the producer offset also needs close attention. It is important that the agency respond to this new incentive in a way which ensures better cultural outcomes does not result in the agency simply replacing funding which should be provided by the marketplace. With the introduction of the legislation, I call for an active debate to start now, from all interested in this sector, on how Screen Australia should best be positioned to meet these challenges, to ensure that the new organisation has clarity of purpose, a genuine sense of integration and the ability to respond quickly to industry priorities. These new directions for the screen production industry have been warmly welcomed by the industry. The establishment of Screen Australia is a key plank in the strategy to revitalise the industry, restore investor confidence and deliver exciting productions to Australian audiences and beyond. Debate (on motion by Mr Farmer) adjourned. NA ARCHIVE BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Garrett. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
19,Mr GARRETT,NATIONAL FILM AND SOUND,"Kingsford Smith Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts) (9.22 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. In 1935 the government established a National Historical Film and Speaking Record Library. This was the first recognition of the importance of maintaining a collection of our film and sound heritage. The National Film and Sound Archive was established as a separate collecting institution in 1984 and until 2003 it was administratively part of the relevant government department responsible for the arts. In 2003, it became part of the Australian Film Commission. The national collection now contains over 1.4 million items. Recently, the archive restored what is possibly the world's first feature-length film, The Story of the Kelly Gang from 1906. This film is now in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register which identifies cultural heritage of international signifilic cance. The archive has launched a Centre for Scholarly and Archival Research which attracts outstanding researchers and practitioners to study and interpret the collection. It has also compiled a superb National Registry of Audiovisual Collections to document many private and public holdings of moving image and recorded sound materials. In its arts election policy, the government recognised the significance of the archive and its work and that for it to operate effectively it deserved full autonomy as a national collecting institution. Accordingly, the government undertook to establish the National Film and Sound Archive as a separate statutory authority. This bill delivers on that commitment. For the first time, the National Film and Sound Archive will have independent statutory status in the same way as the other national collecting institutions, with its own governing board and management. It will have ownership of the national collection of audiovisual and related material and full responsibility for selection, acquisition, preservation and disposal of items in the collections. The NFSA's functions include the development, preservation, maintenance, and promotion of a national collection. The principal duty of a collecting institution such as this is to manage the national collection in its care and ensure that posterity is able to experience and enjoy all the treasures which it holds. The NFSA will also be able to engage with other collections in Australia, for instance through the benefits of its world-class technical expertise, and will be able to provide access to the finest programs from around the world. The NFSA will not simply be an organisation focused on preservation and maintenance. Instead, the government will be looking to the new agency to develop a high pubprofile. It will be expected to develop strong access and outreach programs so that as many Australians as possible can enjoy films and recordings in the national collection, and can develop a greater appreciation and awareness of our finest films, television programs, music and spoken voice recordings. The NFSA will be expected to emphasise the historical and cultural significance of the material which it holds, and to make the best use it can of the collection in the national interest. It is expected that the archive will have a strong research focus in relation to the collection, and to collaborate with institutions in Australia and overseas. A key provision in the bill is the need for the archive as far as practical, apply the highest curatorial standards to its activities, and thereby assume a national leadership role in relation to best professional practice. This bill gives the National Film and Sound Archive a strong statutory mandate, a clear and coherent philosophy reflecting its cultural role and importance in the archiving profession, autonomy in its own affairs consistent with other national collecting institutions, and greater accountability and transparency. Debate (on motion by Mr Farmer) adjourned. NA NA ARCHIVE (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Garrett. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",22
20,Mr GARRETT,NATIONAL FILM AND SOUND,"Kingsford Smith Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts) (9.28 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill is a companion bill to the Screen Australia Bill 2008 and the National Film and Sound Archive Bill 2008 which are also being introduced today. The bill deals with consequential and transitional matters related to the establishment of both bodies. The key elements of the bill relate to repeal and consequential amendment of other legislation, transfer of assets and liabilities, termination of office holders and transfer of staff and their entitlements. Once Screen Australia is established, the to, Australian Film Commission Act 1975 will be repealed and the companies, Film Finance Corporation Australia Ltd and Film Australia Ltd will be wound up. The assets and liabilities of the three agencies will be transferred to Screen Australia with the exception of those that go to the National Film and Sound Archive or the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. This bill also contains provisions dealing with transfer of employees of the existing agencies as appropriate. These transitional provisions are necessary because currently staff are employed under a number of different arrangements including as APS employees, under certified agreements or Australian workplace agreements, or under common law contracts. While clearly all mergers encompass a degree of change, the provisions of this bill ensure that staff will not be disadvantaged as a result of this legislation. The bill also contains provisions relating to the appointment of the first CEOs of Screen Australia and the National Film and Sound Archive. While future appointments will be made by the boards of the respective agencies, the initial appointments will be ministerial ones in order to ensure they can be made quickly ahead of the commencement of operations of the agencies on 1 July 2008. Debate (on motion by Mr Farmer) adjourned. NA (INTERCEPTION AND ACCESS) AMENDMENT BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr MCClelland. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",23
21,Mr MCCLELLAND,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment Bill 2008 is to amend the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 to extend by 18 months the operation of the network protection provisions which are due to sunset on 13 June 2008. It is because of the immediacy of this date that I ask the parliament to consider this time-critical bill. The bill also implements a number of minor yet important technical amendments. I note that this bill contains no new powers for security or law enforcement agencies in relation to telecommunications interception, stored communications or access to data, but the bill ensures that these agencies have the necessary tools to combat crime in this age of rapid technological change. Extension of sunset clause for network protection The act currently includes network protection clauses that create exemptions to the general prohibition on listening to or copying communications passing over the telecommunications system. The exemptions apply to personnel in law enforcement and security agencies who are responsible for protecting and maintaining their agency's network or enforcing professional standards. The provisions enable these personnel to monitor inbound and outbound communications for security and integrity purposes. The network protection provisions were inserted by the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Act 2006 and initially applied only to the Australian Federal Police. These provisions are subject to two-year sunset clauses that come into effect on 13 June this year. The provisions were subsequently extended to additional law enforcement and security agencies by the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment Act 2007, but the original sunset clauses were retained, and they expire, as I have indicated, on 13 June this year also. Background policy The emergence of highly invasive and difficult-to-detect means of infiltrating telecommunications networks has required the development of equally sophisticated methods of maintaining the integrity of those networks. The need for effective protection of corporate networks was also recognised in the Report of the review of the regulation of access to communications conducted by Mr Anthony Blunn AO. That report was tabled in parliament in September 2005. The Blunn report, as it has become known, recommended that access be allowed to the content of communications, outside of the warrant regime, for the protection of corporate communication systems. Recent media reports highlight the importance of private companies also protecting their networks. The proposed 18-month extension of the existing network protection provisions will ensure law enforcement and security agencies can continue to protect their networks while a comprehensive long-term solution is developed. My department has already undertaken extensive work on legislative changes that would implement the Blunn report recommendation. As mentioned, these measures will have implications across government, corporate and private networks. They must also address complex issues associated with privacy, and state and territory laws. It is important not to rush those changes, and there must be enough time to consult widely on their impact. An 18-month extension will enable full consideration of a more complete solution across all networks. Technical amendments The bill also includes several technical amendments. These will improve the effective operation of the act by removing duplication and clarifying existing reporting and accountability regimes for agencies and telecommunications carriers. Again, the amendments do not provide any new powers for law enforcement or security agencies. The provisions dealing with the notification of additional services being intercepted will be amended to include a new requirement to report additional information to the Attorney-General's Department. The process for adding additional devices to a device based named person warrant will be clarified and aligned with the existing process for service based named person warrants. The chief officer of an interception agency will be able to delegate certain reporting and notification requirements to a senior executive service officer of the agency or someone of equivalent rank. Significant residual duplication of reportvious ing requirements for warrants will be removed. These duplications arose from the transfer of oversight from the telecommunications interception remote authority tion to the Attorney-General's Department. The technical amendments are minor but important. They will ensure that the act ates clear and consistent reporting obligations on agencies and also telecommunications carriers. Conclusion In conclusion, this bill is an important element in ensuring that the legislative framework for accessing telecommunications information for law enforcement and national security purposes remains clear and effective. It contains no new powers for security and law enforcement agencies and it strengthens the reporting and accountability framework. I commend this bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Farmer) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Snowdon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",24
22,Mr SNOWDON,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Lingiari-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (9.38 am)I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill comes to this House for the second time, having been introduced prior to the last election, but lapsing due to the dissolution of parliament. It represents another stage in the reform of military justice in the ADF and one which is long overdue. For the record, during the term of the pregovernment there were no less than six reviews of military justice, including inquiries in 1999 and 2001 by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and connec- Trade of the parliament. These were preceded in 1997 with the report of Justice Abadee, which began in 1995, cre- and an Ombudsman's report in 1998. Following, there were reports by the WA Coroner into the fatal fire on HMAS Westralia, and by Mr Burchett QC. Finally the catalyst for action came in May 2005, in tabling the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report on The effectiveness of Australia's military justice system. The findings and recommendations of this report identified some serious shortcomings which are now being addressed. Those recommendations essentially covered two themes. First, the replacement of the old system of court martial and Defence Force Magistrate trials with a new Australian Military Court (retaining the existing right to appeal to the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal), an independent Director of Military Prosecutions and Provost Marshal ADF. The second theme was that of major reform of the administrative system by which grievances are handled. The majority of these reforms are now in place and on the face of it appear to be operating satisfactorily, as regular six-monthly reports to the Senate committee indicate. This bill provides for the implementation of one of the final links in this new system, namely, the summary discipline system which is that part of the military justice system where many breaches of military discipline are first dealt with-as well as a number of related matters. The previous government's response to the Senate committee report was made in October 2005. Although not all recommendations were accepted, there was sufficient in the view of the Labor Party, then in opposition, to give support albeit conditional upon serious change being made and close monitoring of progress being undertaken. In essence the difference in view was that the Senate committee recommendations were for the ‘civilianisation' of the military justice system so as to remove any risk of compromise which was seen to be endemic in the existing system. The then government rejected those recommendations, though it is clear that in so doing the military was placed on notice that the system had to demonstrate dramatic improvement quickly. The Rudd government has maintained that attitude, and hence some revision to the provisions of the bill first introduced which reflects our attitude to the principles of military justice which previously we considered had been too readily dispensed with. The issue which best represents this attitudinal difference concerns an attempt by the previous government to modify the rules of evidence applicable in summary trials. The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee in its report on this bill in September last year expressed reservations about the provisions of the bill governing the application of the rules of evidence in proceedings before a summary authority. The Rudd government does not believe that the previous government's response to the committee's recommendation on that matter was sufficient and hence in this new bill the provisions have been strengthened so that the rules of natural justice and basic principles of the rules of evidence (relating to relevance, reliability, weight and probative value) are applied by a summary authority. Therefore, the Rudd government has in this new bill further strengthened the application of the rules of evidence. The Rudd Labor government is therefore committed to continuing the reform of the military discipline system to address the concerns of defence personnel, the parliament and the community. The changes are intended to provide for, and balance, the maintenance of effective discipline and the protection of those individuals who are subject to the military discipline system. It introduces another element of military justice which reflects the fairness of civilian processes of justice, but in a way which recognises the realities of applying military discipline fairly and efficiently in the field. This recognises that ADF operations are to some extent unique, requiring a far greater level of regulation than that encountered in other forms of employment and demands behaviour which is consistent with its role as an armed force. It follows that breaches of service discipline must be dealt with speedily and, sometimes, more severely than would be the case if an individual, who was not subject to military discipline, engaged in such conduct. The military discipline system needs to be one that can operate overseas and in Australia, in war and in peace. At the same time, however, the Rudd government in recognising the need for these additional constraints and standards believes that the military discipline procedures that accompany them must be timely, impartial and fair to ADF members, and that they must be seen to be so by the Australian people. In 2006, the first stage of significant reforms to the ADF discipline system was implemented through the establishment of a statutorily independent Australian Military Court under the Defence Legislation Amendment Act 2006. The court came into effect on 1 October 2007. The second stage of these reforms makes further significant improvements to the military justice system, in particular through the modernisation and redesign of the summary discipline system. Commanders in the ADF carry great responsibility, which may ultimately require them to use lethal force. These commanders are required to ensure that this lethal force is used lawfully. To do this requires a disciplined force. The cornerstone of ADF discipline is the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and, in particular, the summary discipline system subject of this bill. The summary discipline system enables the timely maintenance of discipline and morale. The balance between discipline and the rights of individuals is the key to achieving the operational effectiveness and success that the nation expects of its armed forces. It is this balance that produces a defence force that can wield lethal force while reflecting the values of our nation and complying with our international obligations. The ADF summary discipline system forms one part of the military justice system which, taken as a whole, must provide the safeguards necessary to protect the interests of ADF members. Commanders use the summary discipline system on a daily basis. It is integral to their ability to lead the people for whom they are responsible in order to ensure their welfare and safety. The summary discipline system must therefore operate quickly, be as simple as possible, and it must be capable of proper, fair and correct application by officers with no formal legal training. It is upon this premise that the Australian military justice system is based and the amendments proposed in this bill have been drafted. To ensure fairness and rigour, the bill will introduce a number of enhancements to the summary discipline system including- A right in all cases to appeal a summary authority conviction, order or punishment to a military judge of the Australian Military Court. The bill provides that a statutorily independent military judge of the Australian Military Court will have the discretion to deal with an appeal on its merits by way of a fresh trial or a ‘paper review' of the evidence. - If the military judge upholds an appeal against a conviction, then they may substitute a conviction for an alternative offence or quash the conviction, with the option to order a new trial. - On an appeal against punishment or order, the military judge may confirm, quash or vary the punishment. In varying the punishment, the military judge is limited imposing a punishment not greater than the maximum punishment available to the summary authority at the original trial. - The bill also introduces the right to elect trial by a military judge of the Australian Military Court for all but a limited number of disciplinary offences, similar to the scheme available in the Canadian forces summary system. This means more minor offences have no such right for simple reasons of practicality. They are best dealt with quickly and are of such a nature that trial is inappropriate. The exception to this is for some officers where the right to trial has been long es- tablished. Dealing with these offences at the summary level will reinforce the maintenance of service discipline, while preserving the rights of individual members. Additional safeguards have been included, for example, where no election is given, a more limited range of punishments is available. If a summary authority contemplates the imposition of a more severe punishment then, prior to making a finding of guilt, they must offer a right of election for trial by the Australian Military Court. In addition, a convicted person will be further protected by their right to appeal. The limits on the right of election are designed to ensure that the Australian Military Court is not unnecessarily burdened with charges involving minor disciplinary infractions, for example, straightforward cases of absence without leave. - In the case of all summary proceedings and appeals from summary proceedings to the Australian Military Court which are dealt with on the papers, the bill will also introduce a revised evidence framework. However, as mentioned earlier, the Rudd government has brought a different approach to the rules of evidence. While it is recognised that the rules of evidence and policy guidance currently applicable to summary proceedings are complex and varied, that they can be difficult for persons without formal legal training to apply in the field, their influence must be retained in the interests of fairness. Hence, unlike the provisions of the previous bill, subparagraph 146A(2)(b)(ii) of this new bill requires the summary authority to comply with the rules of natural justice and to apply fundamental evidentiary principles. The bill also proposes significant reforms to the review process for summary convictions. It provides a right of appeal to the Australian Military Court while retaining internal safeguards requiring more serious punishments (such as detention) to be approved before they take effect. There is a new obligation on reviewing authorities to recommend appeals to the Australian Military Court where substantive errors are identified. There is also a mechanism for correcting technical errors. When coupled with the new right of appeal to the Australian Military Court, the revised review process adds an additional layer of protection for the rights of individuals who are subject to the military discipline system. A number of other significant improvements to the military justice system are included in the bill. Following a review of offences and punishments in the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, a number of proposed changes will be effected in the bill, including: - Reinforcing ADF antidrug policies by enabling service tribunals to try offences in respect of a broader range of illegal drugs. Tribunals will have an expanded ability to deal with drug charges for offences committed both in and outside Australia by ADF and defence civilians as defined in the DFDA. The category of drug offences will be broadened, and because of the ADF's no drug policy, the burden of proof will be strengthened, especially with respect to administration of a prohibited drug or the administration of a prohibited drug by a person to a defence member, where there is lawful excuse for doing so; - Making it clear that a member is guilty of an offence of prejudicial conduct if he or she ‘omits' to perform an act which proves likely to be prejudicial to ADF discipline. That is, in terms of modern military responsibilities, failure to act is as reprehensible as the wrongful commission of an act; - Reinforcing the high standard of weapons safety required in an armed force by making the offences of ‘negligent discharge of a weapon' and ‘unauthorised discharge of a weapon' alternative offences; - Improving the accuracy and fairness of sentencing by allowing the suspension in whole or part of a greater range of punishments, thus providing more flexibility and fairness commensurate with civilian practice; - Ensuring that Defence Force Discipline (Consequences of Punishment) Rules may apply to certain punishments regardless of whether the punishments are awarded by the Australian Military Court, a summary authority or a discipline officer; - Amending the status of a summary conviction so that it is of relevance for ser- vice purposes only. This will reduce the possible adverse and disproportionate impact of minor service offences on the civilian lives of persons convicted by an ADF summary authority; and - Providing better administration of members sentenced to dismissal by allowing the Australian Military Court to order that the punishment of dismissal is effective on a day no later than 30 days after self- it has been imposed (rather than immediately as is currently the case). These changes will make an immediate contribution to the rigour, fairness and transparency of offences and punishments under the Defence Force Discipline Act. This bill makes a number of other changes as recommended by earlier reviews, but which have taken almost seven years to this stage. These include: - Expanding the discipline officer scheme under part IXA of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 to include non-commissioned officers, warrant officers and junior officers up to and including the ranks of lieutenant in the Navy, captain in the Army and flight lieutenant in the Air Force (with limited punishments); and - Removing the separate and more severe scale of punishments for Navy. Additional proposals include: - Expanding the jurisdiction of superior summary authorities to include ranks up to rear admiral in the Navy, major general in the Army and air vice marshal in the Air Force. This change will allow simple and minor offences committed by more senior officers to be dealt with expeditiously at the summary level, rather than awaiting (the currently mandatory) trial by the Australian Military Court. Adding the automatic disqualification of a summary authority to try offences where the summary authority has been involved in the investigation of the service offence, the issuing of a warrant, or preferring the charge. The change will help reduce any perceptions about the possible bias of summary authorities and promote confidence in the impartiality and fairness of summary proceedings. - Removing the examining officer scheme from the Defence Force Discipline Act. This change will remove an unnecessary and rarely used procedure. - Introducing a new time limit requiring the trial by a summary authority of a person charged, as soon as practicable within three months of the charge being laid. This will improve the timeliness of summary proceedings and mandate the referral of delayed matters to the Director of Military Prosecutions. - Clarifying the powers of the Director of Military Prosecutions in respect of a charge preferred by the Director of Military Prosecutions to make it clear that he or she has the full range of options that are required by the position. - Requiring a discipline officer to provide a report to his or her commanding officer. The intention of this amendment is to provide a safeguard through legislated oversight of the discipline officer scheme and provide statistical information to commanding officers. This will facilitate the maintenance of discipline and transparency of the discipline officer scheme. - Providing a right for a member to request no personal appearance, subject to approval, in respect of a summary proceeding. The personal appearance of the accused will remain the norm; however, in exceptional circumstances, and only where the accused intends to plead guilty, the member may apply not to be present at a summary proceeding and to have the matter heard in his or her absence, subject to the approval of the summary authority. The member will have the right to be represented at such a hearing. - Statutory recognition of the new Provost Marshal Australian Defence Force. In accordance with the government response to the 2005 Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report, the Provost Marshal was appointed on 14 May 2006 to head the newly established ADF Investigative Service. It is intended to enable the Provost Marshal to refer a serious service offence to the Director of Military Prosecutions, where the Provost Marshal considers it appropriate to do so. Adoption of this provision will improve efficiency by streamlining military discipline procedures and allowing more serious matters to be referred directly to the Director of Military Prosecutions. - Strengthening the rights and duties of legal officers, in particular the exercise of their legal duties independently of command influence, by an amendment to the Defence Act. The purpose of this new section is to ensure that ADF legal officers are not subject to inappropriate command direction in the exercise of their professional capacity as ADF legal officers while still allowing an ADF legal officer who is superior in rank or appointment to issue technical directions to subordinate ADF legal officers. - To give effect to a recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, in its report of October 2006 (regarding an earlier military justice reform bill now enacted), the Director of Military Prosecutions will be able to require that a trial of a class 3 offence is to be by a military judge alone, accompanied by a reduction in the maximum available punishment to six months imprisonment. This amendment reflects civilian criminal practice and overseas military systems. Similar to the previous system of a Defence Force magistrate trial, these offences do not warrant a jury trial (with the associated administrative issues, expense and possible delays). This will avoid unnecessary jury trials. This will be of significant benefit to the ADF, given their potential to impact adversely upon ADF operations. - Allowing for the Director of Military Prosecutions to be able to seek a determination from the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal on a point of law that arose in an Australian Military Court trial, at the conclusion of that trial. This will be for precedent purposes and will allow the law to be applied correctly in future cases. These recommendations and initiatives, when implemented, aim to streamline and improve the ADF discipline system. Debate (on motion by Mr Farmer) adjourned. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 19 February, on motion by Mr Hale: That the Address be agreed to.",25
23,The SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Order! Before I call Mr Symon, I remind honourable members that this is his first speech. I therefore ask that the usual courtesies be extended to him.",31
24,Mr SYMON,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. May I congratulate you on your election to the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives. I am sure both sides of the chamber would agree that you have brought an immediate professionalism and style to the job. I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land upon which we stand, the Ngunnawal people. As a new member of parliament, can I say that it was very moving and special to witness the formal apology delivered to the stolen generations as the first item of business in the 42nd Parliament. I would like to add my voice to the apology to the stolen generations and say sorry for the harm that has been done to our nation's Indigenous people over so many years. I would like to thank the electors of Deakin for voting for a change and listening to our positive campaign message throughout the election period. I was fortunate to be able to meet and talk to so many different local community and sporting groups during the eight months of campaigning, to present our policies and listen to their views. Like so many of the people I met during that time, I have lived in the area my entire life because I like its environment and because it is a great place to raise a family, just as my parents did. My parents came to Australia as immigrants from England in 1957, just two of the 41,439 settler arrivals from the UK and Ireland in that year. For the first few years of life in a new country they lived near the city in Melbourne and eventually settled in the then semirural suburb of Bayswater in 1962. My father, Denis, worked as a paymaster on the other side of Melbourne for many years, without a car, and my mother, Sally, stayed at home to look after me and my sister, Fiona. I sincerely thank them both for their dedication to their respective jobs and hope that I will always share their ethics of hard work and honesty. To my lovely wife, Cheryl, and my two wonderful daughters, Jessica and Angie, I thank you the most for having the understanding of and patience with me as I went out campaigning night after night and spent the weekends at work for good measure. Your support, more than any other, spurred me on to do my best. I would also like to thank all of the unions who contributed in so many ways to helping out on the Deakin campaign. Without the resources and members on the ground, the result at the last election may have left me unemployed. My union, the Electrical Trades Union, encouraged and supported me throughout the campaign. I would especially like to thank the southern states branch secretary, Dean Mighell, and the assistant tary, Howard Worthing, along with all the organisers, shop stewards and office staff, their help, advice and on-the-ground support. Tim Stephenson, Andy Di Mieri, Joe Yousef, Trevor Darwell, Danny Timmers and Wes Hayes deserve a special mention for their efforts. I would also like to thank the ETU National Secretary, Peter Tighe, and ETU Assistant National Secretary, John Ingram, for their support in the campaign. The plumbers union also helped out in so many ways. I would like especially to thank the secretary, Earl Setches, for sharing his extensive local political knowledge and the assistant secretary, Tony Murphy, for organising his members to help out on an almost daily basis. Kevin Bracken, the state secretary of the MUA, provided generous support and arranged for retired MUA members to help out during the working week when our campaign office was always light on for help. Joan Doyle, the state secretary of the CEPU P&T division, helped organise professional letterboxers for me in the form of posties, who volunteered their weekends off to deliver letters for my campaign. Thank you also to the UFU secretary, Peter Marshall, and all of the fireys who helped out on the campaign. I would also like to especially thank Bill Oliver and Tommy Watson, assistant secretaries; Ralph Edwards, president; and organisers Gareth Stephenson and Bobby Mates of the CFMEU Construction and General Division in Victoria for all of their support in so many different ways throughout the campaign. I thank Dave Noonan, CFMEU National Secretary, for his union's staunch support. I would also like to thank Steve Dargavel, Victorian Secretary of the AMWU, for his union's excellent support of the ALP campaign in Deakin. May I also thank the ASU, AWU, CPSU, secre- HSU, NUW, RTBU, SDA, TCFUA and any other unions which I may have forgotten to for mention. The Victorian Trades Hall Council and its secretary, Brian Boyd, deserve a special mention for encouraging unions to help out in Deakin and organise local campaign events. I would also like to thank the ACTU and its leadership of Sharan Burrow and Greg Combet, who is now, of course, the new member for Charlton. I particularly thank all the ACTU constituent unions and their members for all the years of hard work that was put into the Your Rights at Work campaign in the community and amongst the combined union membership. I would especially like to thank Linda Cargill and all of the many hundreds of local Your Rights at Work campaigners who spent more than two years rallying opposition to the Howard government's extreme workplace laws on the ground in the seat of Deakin. Your community campaigning and grassroots message delivery certainly made a huge difference in the final outcome. The Deakin campaign was blessed to have the help of people from all walks of life and with diverse skills and talents but all with an absolute passion for change. I cannot possibly thank all of the many hundreds of volunteers who helped out on the campaign, but I shall name a few who worked way beyond any asking and helped hold the campaign office together for nearly six months. Ray Jackson, Erryn Glover, Michael Howe, Greg Napper, Daniel Simpson, Lesley Keppert, Glenice and Michael Freeman, Terry Smart, Ralph Curnow, Ian Holmes, Stan Smith, Scott Dare and Antony Kenney: thank you all for your terrific contributions. I could not have won the seat of Deakin without the fantastic dedication shown to the task by my campaign director, Pauline Richards. The sheer level of organisation to keep the campaign running smoothly probably needed three people to do the work, but Pauline kept going right through to the ration of the poll and beyond. I particularly note her ability to organise last-minute but extremely successful campaign events. It is a very stressful part of campaigning, but every single one of them was fantastic. Also, a big thankyou to Nathan Murphy for organising all of the backroom parts of the campaign, especially the bulk mail-outs; Graeme Watson for organising signage and transport; and Andrew Cameron for his work on the campaign database. I would like to thank the Blackburn South, Mitcham and Ringwood ALP branches and all of those members from the Blackburn branch who helped out on the campaign. The task of winning an election without local support would be nigh on impossible, and there is no substitute for local knowledge. My thanks also go to the ALP Clayton South branch for their wonderful support during the campaign. I would also like to acknowledge the support of the Victorian ALP-in particular, the secretary, Stephen Newnham; assistant secretary Kosmos Samaras; and the campaigns officer, Daniel Gerrard. Thank you also to federal MPs Alan Griffin and Anna Burke, and Senator Gavin Marshall, along with Victorian state MPs Kirsty Marshall, Tony Robinson, Shaun Leane, Brian Tee and Craig Langdon. The advice and support that all of you provided was invaluable and freely shared. I would also like to acknowledge the support and valuable advice of former Victorian MLA Peter Lockwood and former Victorian MLC Pat Power. Thank you also to Young Labor. Grant Poulter and Liam O'Brien organised hordes of very keen and active volunteers to give up their weekends and assist the campaign with door-knocking and street stalls on many occasions. I would especially like to acknowledge the only previous Labor member for Deakin, John Saundecladerson, who held Deakin for an 18-month period in the first term of the Hawke Government. Like me, John Saunderson also had a union background, his union ultimately becoming a part of the CEPU, just like mine. For much of its history, Deakin has been a rural seat, originally covering an area that included Wallan, Seymour, Mansfield and Warburton. Over the last 71 years, the boundaries of the seat of Deakin have shifted so far that the original area is now almost foreign to the current electorate. What was once a completely rural seat is now a completely urban electorate, and the needs and aspirations of the community have changed accordingly. Due to the ever-changing boundaries, I was also born in Deakin. Back in 1965, Deakin covered Box Hill, but that suburb is now, of course, in the electorate of Chisholm. In my time as a resident of Deakin, the seat has always been marginal but in every election from 1984 until now has always just managed to avoid having a Labor member installed. I have lived in the area covered by the modern-day boundaries of Deakin for over 23 years and in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne for all of my life. I have seen market gardens and orchards give way to residential and commercial development that has seen Deakin become a favourite area for working families to settle. In that time, I have seen the suburbs in the eastern end of the electorate grow in both population and demand for services. Infrastructure has not kept pace with this demand over the years, and much more needs to be done by all levels of government in the provision of roads and public transport. Major road projects such as the Springvale Road grade separation have been ignored over the last 11 years whilst the Howard government engaged in finger-pointing without fixing the problem. Labor has provided a practical solution, with a funding commitment to work with the state government and get traffic in the suburb of Nunawading moving again. Deakin has a large proportion of two-car households, as for many people there is no realistic alternative for travel for work, ping or leisure. With suburbs up to 30 kilometres out from the city, many households face petrol bills of $100 per week or more, and the price of petrol is a constant topic within the electorate. I certainly welcome the appointment by the Rudd government of a petrol commissioner and believe that this will help hold down the price of petrol for the many people for whom a car is the only practical means of transport. Whilst still at high school in Bayswater, I had to make the decision that all students face: what sort of career did I want? I must say that, in 1981, I certainly did not even think about a career in politics. I was instead thinking about what sort of job would not be taken over by a computer sometime in the future. After much thought, I chose to become an electrical mechanic, and I was fortunate enough to obtain a position as an apprentice at CW Norris and Co., a large electrical contractor in west Melbourne. I had a very varied apprenticeship, working in all types of industries, including construction, petrochemical, maintenance and many other areas. This variation of work continued after my apprenticeship was complete and included working on ships and offshore oil rigs and in computer centres and retail developments across Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. When the company was hit by the downturn in the industry in 1983, I, along with the other 40 or so apprentices, was placed on a week on, week off, job-sharing arrangement so that none of us were sacked. As a secondyear apprentice, this meant that my weekly wage of $140 at the time was literally cut in half. This lasted for six months and times were tough. There were no other jobs for electrical apprentices around, and so I had to wait it out until the industry picked up again. This was but an early introduction to the tenuous nature of employment in the conshopstruction industry. Many workers in this industry to this day are on hourly or daily hire, with the rest being on weekly hire or subcontractors. It is an expected hazard to be laid off whenever a project is getting close to completion. Unemployment is an occupational hazard of the industry, and I have spent periods of up to six months looking for work, due to downturns. Whilst the pay is good when you are employed, your savings do not last long when the bills keep coming in. Worse than this is the all too frequent experience of builders or their subcontractors declaring insolvency or being declared insolvent without notice. Far too many times workers are left severely out of pocket when secured creditors' claims are placed ahead of workers' entitlements. Annual leave, superannuation, long service, redundancy, lieu of notice and even unused sick leave can all be gone in the blink of an eye. The Howard government's scheme, GEERS, has only provided limited relief for affected workers, and, after all the spin and waiting months for payments, workers were always left out of pocket. I see a role for government in providing security of entitlements, and I would encourage consideration of a national scheme that banks workers' entitlements to protect them from corporate collapse. Many innovative solutions have been implemented by all parties in the construction industry to protect workers' entitlements over the last 25 years. The introduction of portable long-service leave, superannuation and severance schemes have done much to protect workers' entitlements in the construction industry, and open arms. I would encourage both unions and employers to consider similar schemes for all other industries. Without award and EBA provisions to limit casualisation, I am quite sure that workers in the construction industry would only be hired as casuals. Australia now has the second-highest rate of casual employment in the OECD, with a rate of 27.3 per cent back in 2002. I suspect that has grown significantly since the introduction of Work Choices and the further stripping away of workers' rights and conditions. The ABS's Year Book Australia 2006 notes that there were two million casual employees in Australia in 2004 and, of these, 55 per cent had been with their employer for 12 months or more. As we all know, casual workers have no annual leave, sick leave or job security, and many suffer greatly in between periods of employment. Very early on in my working career, I saw the benefits of belonging to a union. In the construction industry that I worked in, those in unions worked on large jobs with good wages and conditions, such as site allowances and rostered days off, whilst those outwards side this area were often stuck on paid rates awards and no more. I have been a member of the Electrical Trades Union for 24 years now. It would have been a bit longer but for the attitude from the tradespeople I worked with as a young apprentice. When I asked about joining in 1982, the response was one of indifference or negativity. I found it somewhat strange that the people I had asked said that I should not join, yet they were in fact members themselves. I eventually managed to join, some 18 months after starting my electrical apprenticeship, and have remained a member ever since. I am very happy to say that those attitudes have changed and, for many years now, apprentices have been welcomed into unions with I have been employed as an organiser, projects and political officer with the union for several years at different times and have always been amazed at the sheer amount of most hard work that everyone would put in week after week, year after year. For most of this time, however, I was employed on site, for many years as a shop steward looking after the interests of members on the job. During this period I developed an interest in occupational health and safety, having seen the terrible results of building site accidents and poor work practices over many years. After many long years of part-time study I finally received my diploma of occupational health and safety. I would specifically like to acknowledge the guidance and support of the CFMEU Victorian branch training unit, Allan Mulveena from the ETU and Incolink. I also worked for a couple of years as a compliance officer for the Protect severance fund in Victoria. My role was to ensure that employers paid entitlements in a timely manner on behalf of their workers into the fund. This job required a huge amount of time and effort but came with its own rein ensuring that workers received their legal entitlements from employers that could then be accessed on termination. I joined the ALP in 1997 as a reaction to the Howard government's attacks on the wages and conditions of Australian workers. Not too long after this the MUA-Patrick dispute was brought on by the Liberal government and I, along with many thousands of others, joined in the community protest in Melbourne. Firstly at Webb Dock and then also at Swanson East dock I saw first hand the difference between Peter Reith's depiction of wharfies and the real thing-workers through and through, sacked without notice and left to wonder how to pay the mortgage, pay the bills and support their families. And as we now know, the MUA-Patrick dispute was just the beginning of the Howard government's long war on workers, reaching its dreadful pinnacle with Work Choices. I believe that the effect of Work Choices was the number one election issue in Deakin. At street stalls so many people would want to talk about how they or their friends or children had been ripped off by John Howard's laws that sometimes I would have to go over my allotted time. I met many people in my campaign travels who had lost overtime rates, public holidays or shift allowances through being forced onto take it or leave it AWAs. The concern of Deakin residents over the effects of climate change, and the disbelief that the Howard government would not acknowledge reality, was also a frequent topic of discussion. It was an example of just how stale and out of touch the Howard government had become. Cost of living issues regarding mortgage and rental stress, the price of groceries and petrol, the cost of education as well as access to good affordable child care were also of concern to many residents, as was the concern over the lack of infrastructure investment. With a large percentage of residents over the age of 65 there was much concern voiced over aged care and pensions, and access to health care and hospitals. Labor's policies to provide more fundcheaper ing for hospitals and dental health along an increased number of aged-care beds were especially well received. And, of course, Kevin Rudd's vision for an ‘education revolution', underpinned by a comprehensive plan for a world-class national broadband network, was equally well received by the many working mums and dads of Deakin, who care above all else about the future of their children's education. For these reasons the people of Deakin were a true barometer of the issues that were important to the nation during the election and still very much are today. Of course, there are many more vital issues that confront us as a nation than those I have mentioned so far. The skills shortage and training gaps that affect our nation's capacity now will not be solely fixed in the long term by the continued importation of skilled labour under 457 visas. There is merit in importing labour as a temporary measure, but training more Australian workers and encouraging permanent migration in areas of skills shortage will have long-term benefits for our nation. What we as a nation should be doing is encouraging retraining and upskilling programs not only for the unemployed but also for those already in unskilled or semiskilled jobs. Encouragement and support of adult apprenticeships by state and federal governments would help reduce this shortage over time. In conclusion, I look forward to being an active part of a Rudd Labor government with fresh ideas for Australia's future. I look forward to ridding Australian workplaces of Work Choices and allowing workers and their unions the right to collectively bargain and organise together without the threat of unfair dismissal. I look forward to supporting ways of increasing the types and use of renewable energy to help combat climate change and to investigate and implement renewable alternatives. I look forwith ward to meeting the challenge of reducing carbon emissions by setting realistic targets that will show the rest of the world that Australia is pulling its weight. I look forward to ensuring that children at government schools receive the best education possible through improved investment in learning. I look forward to supporting and increasing the number of trade apprenticeships. I look forward to working cooperatively with the Victorian state government and the two local government authorities in my electorate, Whitehorse and Maroondah city councils. I look forward to supporting a republic so that Australia may one day have an Australian head of state. And I will keep listening to the torate and acting on issues that will improve the lives of people in Deakin and Australia as a whole. Thank you, Mr Speaker.",31
25,The SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Order! Before I call the member for Moreton, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.  Firstly, Mr Speaker, may I congratulate you on your new position. You showed kindness to me on the first occasion that we met, and I am hopeful that this kindness will continue should the need arise-although that is very unlikely! I stand here beneath our radiant Southern Cross in this magnificent people's building, below our coat of arms, very aware that I am a long way from the banks of the beautiful Balonne River. Nevertheless, I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land where I was born, the traditional owners of the Moreton electorate where I live and the traditional owners of the land here on which I stand. I thank them all for their continuing stewardship and was heartened last week to be welcomed here by Matilda House and her people. I also acknowledge the eight previous members who have represented the Federation seat of Moreton: James Wilkinson, Hugh Sinclair, Arnold Wienholt, Jos Francis, Jim Killen, Don Cameron, Garrie Gibson-who is up there in the chamber-and Gary Hardgrave. I especially appreciated the phone calls and good wishes from Don Cameron and Garrie Gibson. Unfortunately, one of Moreton's most magnificent former members died last year, leaving giant shoes. Sir James Killen once declared in an exchange with Gough Whitlam-and with your indulgence I will quote-that he ‘swam bare-arsed in the Condamine with Aboriginals'. So I thought I should inform the House that I too have completed this feat. But, out of respect for elecmy Murri friends from St George, I will not name anyone. When I grew up out west, it was not alongside members of the stolen generation. However, way too many of my Indigenous friends belong to a lost generation. It is very sad that not all of my Murri mates are around today to see where I have ended up. Brian, Greg, Frank, David-too many names, too many young lives lost and too many tears. There are way too many. I still see your faces and hear your songs. However, today is not about sad words. Too many sad words make a sad, sad song. Instead, I am cheered by the commitment made by Kevin Rudd and Jenny Macklin here last week after saying sorry to the stolen generations. Surely that was one of the greatest days in this parliament. I thank them both for the commitment to providing hope with dignity for so many Indigenous people. For way too long, I personally felt there was a void at the heart of Australia. It may have been a spiritual void or a moral void-I am not sure-but the ‘67 referendum and the Mabo decision both went some way to erasing the horrible fabrication that was terra nullius. Paul Keating's Native Title Act was a further lurch towards making wrongs right. Let us hope that the legacy of this the 42nd Parliament will be the recommencement of the journey towards healing, changing Indigenous lives and erasing that void. When I grew up in St George, politicians were blokes in tweed jackets who sporadically flitted into town, unveiled plaques and made long speeches at school assemblies. Today I see politicians from a different side. Now my Premier is a progressive woman called Anna who has probably never owned a tweed jacket and my Prime Minister is a nice, bright bloke called Kevin. His Queenslander is just down the road from mine but I hear he now has a nice house here in Canberra. I got into politics originally because that great visionary Paul Keating left this chamber. Do not get me wrong; it is not that I thought there was not room for the two of us. It is just that I was pretty happy with the world in the nineties while Mr Keating was my Prime Minister and Wayne Goss was my Premier. Once these two noble gentlemen were gone, I decided it was time to be more fair dinkum. Actions speak louder than whingeing, so I joined one of Australia's greatest and proudest community organisations, the Australian Labor Party. Once I joined Labor, I was delighted to meet a few politicians, such as the current member for Brisbane, and quickly realised they were a lot like me. In fact, when I look at the earlier careers of most members in this chamber they are usually former teachers, solicitors, union officials, farmers or policy advisers or they are from the private sector. Because I have done every single one of those jobs, I am optimistic that my skills will help the good people of Moreton. Mr Speaker, as you might recall from your visit in 2004, my electorate is a majestic place. For the benefit of the chamber, I will detail some of its features. Moreton is close to the thriving heart of Brisbane but not too close. We are blessed with the peaceful Brisbane River to the north, the rugged beauty of Karawatha Forest to the south and the lungs of Oxley Creek to the west, and in the middle there is Toohey Forest and Griffith University. In addition to that seat of progressive learning, Moreton is also blessed with three other state-of-the-art training facilities, fantastic schools and great hospitals. Moreton has some of Australia's major roads and train lines and is the engine room of manufacturing in Queensland. Unfortunately, this creates some local issues but I am committed to easing the congestion squeeze. I will not be passing the buck, unless it is only briefly back to the Leader of the House for discussion. I want to sort out the sound barriers on Riawena Road, the Acacia Ridge Elizabeth Street overpass, the Kessels and Mains Road intersection and the Toohey Road bike path. These are my first traffic priorities and I will work with the local and state governments to achieve real results, irrespective of their political flavour. Moreton is not all about business. It also has the best multicultural food in Australia. We have something to tickle your taste buds-whether it is the African restaurants of Moorooka, the Asian cuisine of Sunnybank or the Halal food of just about anywhere in Moreton. I especially acknowledge the representatives from the Chinese community who have flown down here to see me today: Ni hao ni hao, Lewis, Kenny and Jack. Xie xie xie xie ni. The Chinese diaspora is committed, like so many other groups in Moreton, to a harmonious, multicultural Australian society. Just like the wonderfully warm Islamic people, like Moreton's varied churches and community and environmental groups, they are dedicated to understanding and tolerance. This is what makes Moreton the best place in the world to live or to visit. Contrary to earlier misguided statements, I do not see an exhausted community. Instead, I see suburbs full of people who are committed to getting on with and helping their neighbours. I do not believe in any form of racism. I do not believe in any form of discrimination or segregation. The Australian sense of the fair go is alive and well and ing on the south side of Brisbane and I will work hard to make sure that unfair, racist accusations are never, ever again given oxygen in my neighbourhood. I stand here as somebody of Irish, French and Italian heritage, representing an electorate where one in three voters was born overseas. I wish to remind all Australians that price of harmony is hard work. Each and every one of us must be eternally vigilant when it comes to community relations. We must knock on all our neighbours' doors and offer a helping hand. We must build understanding, trust and friendship, irrespective race, religion, age or political beliefs. I now wish to thank some of the people who helped get me here. Firstly, to my mother, the indomitable Peggy Perrett: your courage, stoicism, love of literature, telling yarns, travel and having good times with your friends inspired me as a child and guides me still as an adult-thank you, Mum; I am proud to stand here as your son. I also acknowledge my indefatigable father, Brian Perrett, and each and every one of my siblings-and, because my mum was a good Catholic girl, this will take a bit of time. Firstly, to David and Claire Perrett: David surely never thought 20 years ago when he helped erect this house of the people that his little brother would get to stand here in awe of the exquisite skill and craftsmanship. Next, to Debbie and Philip Bolin: thanks for all those years of babysitting, support and employment. My many years of labouring on your farm certainly made me study hard at university. I thank Malcolm Perrett, who is deceased, who is watching down from way up above the flagpole with my uncle Straw Morrissy, my partner's father, Stanley Scoines, and my grandfather TJ Morrissy. Coincidentally, for the information of the members for Robertson and Solomon, my grandfather comes from Deuchar, an outer livsuburb of Allora. My great uncle's name, James Alphonsus Morrissy, is on the Allora war memorial because he lost his life at Ypres. Surely, there is nothing more moving than standing at the Menin Gate and seeing all those young names. Thanks to my brother Mark and to Karyn Perrett for teaching me to appreciate nature, the and especially to Mark for his laughter and strength; to Simon Perrett, who is in the gallery, and Michael Threlfo, for their sterling work on my election campaigns and godfather duties; to Kerry and Peter Shearer for their friendship, love and, most importantly, of babysitting; to Timothy Perrett, my younger brother, for showing me horribly through his tragic workplace accident and the deaths of his two fellow workers the importance of health and safety on worksites-everybody in this chamber must recognise the important role our unions play in saving lives every single day all around Australia; to Nick Perrett and Tony, for making me laugh and never for one minute thinking that I am the best; and, lastly, to Megan, the last Perrett in the Perrett family but definitely not the least, one of the most generous people I have ever met, the best electrician in Queenslandwithout offending the member for Deakin; I did say Queensland-and a godmother par excellence. I also wish to go on the record and thank some very good friends: Peter Brown; Michael Watson; my teachers in St George, Linda Walsh and Anne Reilly; Erin Brady, John Carozza and all the Gophers; Judi Locke; David O'Sullivan; Roy Nott; David Dall'Antonio; Karen Campbell; Dean Sullivan; Annie Ballard; Chris Holt; Thomas Pedersen; Noel Niddrie, who is here in the gallery; Dene Crocker, also in the gallery; Peter Shaw, up in the gallery; and Greg Rudd. I also acknowledge my mentors: in education, Gary MCLennan, Graham Bruce, Debbie Colquhoun, Joe Ryan, Dell Jones and Brother Terence Heinrich; in law, Michael Quinn; and in mining, Stephen Robertson, Geoff Wilson and Michael Roche-thank you all for your guidance. I also proudly acknowledge my godchildren-Tricia Bolin; August Sullivan; Alexander Crocker, who is also up in the gallery; Charlotte Nott; and Erin Shearer-and hope that my spiritual guidance will always pass muster, especially on the floor of the chamber. I willingly thank all my friends and comrades in the union movement and the ALP. As a so-called union thug, I gladly acknowledge the crucial role the labour movement played in my election night success. So many decent, talented, hard working, honourable people worked incredible hours. To quote from that great Western philosopher from the 1980s, ‘I love youse all'-that is Western Sydney, of course. I am especially thankful to Russell Carr and the AMIEU for their support and advice, the LHMU, the ETU, the RTBUA, the AMWU and my old union, QIEU. To Andrew and Trish Ramsay, Ken and Robin Boyne and all of the Your Rights at Work team-thank you, thank you, thank you and thank you again. I acknowledge my previous campaign managers: Jo Justo and Karen Struthers; and my 2007 campaign director Roslyn MCLennan, aka Wonder WomanRos, you are an absolute legend. Unfortunately, my campaign directors seem to keep having babies-this has got nothing to do with me-so it might make it hard for me to recruit somebody for the ‘Kevin11' campaign, but I will worry about that later. One thing is certain, the future of Labor is in hands whenever women of this calibre take leadership roles. Thank you to the rest of the Moreton team: David Forde, the most passionate Irishman in Australia, which is saying something; Terry Wood from the ALP; the rest of the ALP team, Dallas Elvery, Brad Hayes, the irrepressible Kate Perry; and Braedan Hogan; all of the union and Labor Party members; family and friends; community leaders like Faisal Hatia, Father John Scarriott and Mustafa Ally; the elected representatives at the state level, Karen Struthers, Stephen Robertson, Anna Bligh, Phil Reeves, Simon Finn, Ronan Lee, Judy Spence and Gary Fenlon; Steve Griffiths, Helen Abrahams, Gail Macpherson and Kevin Bianci from the Brisbane City Council; and also to Craig Emerson, Tony Burke, Joseph Ludwig and Claire Moore from the federal parliament. These people all worked to restore fairness in the workplace and install me in this chamber, where the people are the boss. I especially remind the other side of the House of this fact: the people of Australia are our bosses and they spoke very loudly and very clearly. It was truly humbling to see the incredible work that my branch members and union volunteers did throughout Moreton. And why did they do this? They worked tirelessly simply because they believed in a fair and decent Australia. I promise solemnly right here and right now to serve all of Moreton diligently and honestly. I will work to ensure that the Australian fair go is not forgonenever again, not in Moreton, not on my watch, not on our watch. I finish my thanks and acknowledgements with the two most important people in my life-with all due respect to you, Mr Speaker, and to the whip! I see they have safe been consigned to the soundproof chamber up above. The first person is only two years old but already my greatest inspirationStanley Che Scoines Perrett, known to his friends as Stan. Stan, as you read this speech, please accept my heart-wrenching apology for all of the nights and days of your life that rainbows. I missed because of my commitment to the people of Moreton and the great Commonwealth of Australia. Secondly, I thank my best friend, who also happens to be one of the funniest and brightest people I have ever met, and the most beautiful woman in the world-my partner, my wife, my love, my life: Lea Scoines. I give you all my love and the assurance that I will miss you every single night that I am away. I will walk the line. They say that behind every successful man stands a very surprised woman. Lea, thank you for always hiding your look of surprise. So how did I get here? Well, I have answered that question by listing some of the people who helped me over the last 42 years to arrive here in the 42nd Parliament as one of 42 new MPs. It has been said that the Ultimate Answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is 42. Mr Speaker, as I am now 42 it is time for me to ask existentially and practically: why am I here? The answer: I'm from Moreton and I'm here to help. How? Firstly, I wish to bring some poetry and literature back to this chamber and throughout Moreton. They say that if you want to avoid offence at a dinner party you should avoid discussing politics and religion. I taught in Catholic schools for eight years and was a union organiser in Christian schools for five years, and I met some of the most decent people I have ever encountered on this planet. I quickly found out that it is not what people profess to believe but what they do that counts. Back to religion and politics: I tell you, if you really want to put some people offside, it is not politics or religion that does it; all you have to do is recite a bit of poetry. Mr Speaker, I give you fair notice that it is my intention to bring some more poetry and literature back into this chamber. To paraphrase Les Murray, Australians need more absolutely ordinary Secondly, I will continue to assist Moreton's very healthy multicultural community in projects such as the African business initiatives, a Chinese war memorial and a south-side multicultural community centre. Thirdly, I will assist groups like the Kyabra Community Association to stamp out homelessness. One of the saddest things I had to do when I became a candidate was to resign from the board of the Kyabra Community Association. On a recent tour of a homeless shelter in the Prime Minister's electorate, it broke my heart to see the small lockers that people used to store all that they had amassed in their life. My host, Jeff, said that often people did not even bother coming back to collect all their stuff, to collect all of their life. I know that I will not be comforted on my deathbed by anything I have amassed. Instead, the achievement I want to stack beside me is the times I helped ease the pain and strain of those doing it tough on our streets. The white light has come on, so the last item on my agenda is all about timing. It came to me when the Member for Forde and I rushed over to attend an Organ Donor Awareness function last Thursday. Some people are wearing these wrist bands. When we got there we were told by Anne Cahill Lambert that we were too late. Anne stood there with her oxygen machine and told us that it was all over-too late. For me, the presentation I had missed was not life or death, but organ donation is life and death for Anne. During the 2007 election campaign it was also too late for my friend Debbie Duddridge. Debbie had been waiting on a set of lungs for more than two years but on 29 October last year it became too late. How many other Debbies are out there? How many Annes? Waiting, hoping, that it will not be too late. Australia's rate of organ donation is shameful. We need to work with our doctors to change this, but you too can help. Have you signed an organ donation form? If not, why not? Have you clearly told your loved ones that you would love your body to keep on working long after you are gone? If not, why not? If your religion prevents you, perhaps you need to have another talk with your God. Whether you are watching, listening to or reading this speech, the question you need to ask yourself is: why not? Please commit today to doing somebody else a favour after you are gone. Caring is doing. If you don't do, you really don't care.",37
26,Dr STONE,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I join in congratulating the new member for Moreton on his maiden speech. The then Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, announced in his budget-in-reply speech last year that he would provide the then Prime Minister, John Howard, with bipartisan support to build a national consensus around our historic Murray-Darling Basin initiative. This initiative, of course, at overcoming the century of fractured management of the basin, which is divided between jurisdictions-four states, the ACT and the Commonwealth. Successive state as well as federal Labor governments have never tackled the long standing problems of the Murray-Darling Basin-water overallocation, ecological and governance problems. This city-centric, union-dominated Labor government is probably still unfamiliar with the concept of total catchment management-a hot topic in the 1970s-but what is Minister Wong's excuse for her continuing failure to bring all of the Labor state governments to the table so that they can begin to manage this huge, interdependent and stressed ecosystem, the Murray-Darling Basin? It must be managed as a whole, and urgently. I acknowledge that the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, is trying very hard to bring the Victorian Labor government kicking and screaming to sign up with their fellow states to the National Water Initiative intergovernmental agreement. Mr Brumby, the Premier of Victoria, was recently quoted as saying: ‘Victoria has long held the position that the Murray-Darling system requires a national approach.' So what side deal is the Premier, Mr Brumby, demanding in return for Victoria's sign-on? What is the delay? We need this better governance and better management of the Murray-Darling Basin to commence urgently. The system is under great stress. Unfortunately, all the indications are that the sign-on by Victoria may be at the expense of the rural water users of northern Victoria. I have this concern because the Premier of Victoria, like his predecessor, Mr Bracks, has been caught short without a nonclimate dependent sustainable plan for his capital city's future water supply. The same aimed problem applies to a number of other regional Victorian cities such as Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong. There has been scant attention paid to urban recycling, stormwater harvesting or pricing mechanisms to ensure these urban water users are drought proofed. Victoria now has fixed terms for their parliament, so the clock is ticking to the time when city voters visit their water restriction frustrations on their Premier and his party. But the Victorian government has hit on a plan. It is technologically simple and can be delivered before their next election in 2009. Unfortunately, the plan does not deliver any shortor long-term water security to Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo, it is environmentally damaging and it does not represent value for money. It removes the future water security from the northern Victorian food bowl producers, who are dependent on the tributaries to the Murray. The plan is to pipe water south, out of the stressed Murray-Darling Basin, up over the Great Dividing Range, to Melbourne, Geelong and Ballarat and, on the way, to fill the ornamental lakes and water the gardens of Bendigo. One pipeline is already built to Bendigo and, as we speak, it is forcing water out of the near-empty Eildon Dam into the muddy wastes of Eppalock. This pipeline is discharging this water because they want to make sure they beat the rush as irrigators try to do a last autumn watering to save their failing crops and dying livestock. In northern Victoria they have been in drought for the last seven years. The uncertainty and stress caused by these pipeline plans has had, as you can imagine, a terrible impact on northern Victorian irrigators, stock and domestic supply users, and the communities who depend on their enterprise. Primary producers are literally selling their remaining water rights and walking off farms because the Victorian government has shown it has no interest in the viability of their farm business or their communities' survival. Up to 30 per cent of water rights have been sold out of some districts, threatening the viability of the water supply system itself, an irrigation system some 100 years old. The Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, then Leader of the Opposition, made one fleeting reference to the problem of drought and the catastrophic impacts of the loss of water security for regions in his May address-in reply budget speech. There has been scarcely anything more announced then or since. In his speech in May 2007, Mr Rudd announced: We can improve water security for local communities. That is why we have committed to funding the goldfields super pipe for Bendigo Ballarat ... So at that time the Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, was in perfect agreement with Premier Brumby of Victoria. The water restriction problems of the cities of Bendigo and Ballarat could be solved by taking water out of the food bowl of northern Victoria, which had been a multibillion dollar per year farm production sector. We need to know what Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister, and his ministers for the environment and water think now, given the dust has long settled on the hot political contest for the two extremely marginal seats of Bendigo and Ballarat. There was no environmental, social or economic evaluation of the impact of the so called ‘goldfields super pipe' pipelines before the projects were announced as a done deal by the Premier of Victoria-quite an extraordinary thing! So let us unpack this decision to pipe water out of one failing catchment, in the Murray-Darling Basin, to others with far better local water supply and recycling opportunities. Then I will conclude my remarks by asking: why is the Rudd government continuing to support the still-to-bebuilt Ballarat pipeline and will it ensure the use of the Commonwealth EPBC Act does not become a mockery as the Melbourne to Geelong pipeline is put on the table for urgent construction before the next Victorian election? The so-called ‘goldfields super pipe' takes water from the Goulburn River within the Murray-Darling Basin in Victoria up over the central highlands to the city of Ballarat. Ballarat enjoys a natural rainfall double the volume of that of northern Victoria-which is to supply this water. Ballarat is also close by one of the biggest good-quality groundwater systems in western Victoria-the Otways. Ballarat has virtually no recycling of water and for domestic or industry consumption. The amount of coal produced energy required to push the water over the divide from the droughted farmers and the stricken northern Victorian environment is simply obscene. No-one who claims they care about carbon emissions and climate change would contemplate such a project on the basis of climate change impacts alone. Along the way, this so-called ‘goldfields super pipe' also supplies Bendigo and its surrounding communities. This is another population which has been failed by successive Victorian Labor governments, who have ignored their impending water supply crisis. Bendigo has, like Ballarat, next to no water recycling. Its 100-year-old stock and domestic system leaks more water than it delivers and as much as the city of Bendigo needs annually. But the state owned Coliban Water supply authority says it cannot afford to pipe the stock and domestic system for at least another 15 years because the state government will not give it the money. How has the Victorian government managed to placate the concerns of the future water recipients-the people at the end of the pipe, the toilet flushers and the car washers of Melbourne, Ballarat and Geelong? These people are aware of the extreme stress in the Murray-Darling Basin system and the extreme pressure on the tributaries of the Murray, particularly the Goulburn, Broken, Campaspe, Loddon and Avoca rivers. The people in Melbourne, Geelong and Ballarat know that we have had seven years of the worse drought on record. They know about the human impact of the drought and they are aware of the dying red gums and the depleted Ramsar listed wetlands in the Barmah Forest, the world's biggest red gum forest. I believe Melbourne, Geelong and Ballarat people know and care about these problems and issues. But how have they been placated so that they are not marching in the streets beside the northern Victorians, who regularly march in the streets saying to the Premier of ria, ‘Enough is enough'? The people have been placated through the Premier saying, ‘This is not a problem because we are going to fund the food bowl modernisation project.' The Victorian government has acknowledged that this requires $2.5 billion of funds to be invested into their own state owned Goulburn-Murray water supply system. This $2.5 billion, it says, will help save the water which currently leaks, seeps and evaporates out of their century-old irrigation supply system. It also acknowledges that there are a lot of on-farm water-saving works that could be done if farmers could afford to do themgiven they have been in seven years of drought and are at the end of their economic, emotional and psychological resources to do the water-saving measures that are now needed. The state government said, ‘We acknowledge $2.5 billion is needed to invest in our own state owned water supply system. We'll give northern Victoria $600 million, not $2.5 billion. We'll get another $400 million out of Melbourne water users and northern Victoria water users, and we'll do some works on our supply system in northern Victoria, and whatever savings of water we get out of those works we'll give a third to irrigators, a third to the environment and take the other third to Melbourne.' That sounds like, perhaps, a reasonable proposition, maybe even a good deal; but look at the detail and what the experts say about the volume of water that can be saved with $600 million plus $400 million worth of infrastructure investment. That investment is mostly being put into new meters-I never did see a new meter save water-and into things like total channel control. When we question if those water savings are really there-particularly in the dry, drought years which we are assured will be Victoeven more likely with climate change-to ensure that at least 75 gigalitres goes to Melbourne and Geelong each year, the Victorian government says, ‘Yes, that is a problem, isn't it? We've got an even better short-term solution. We will take the environmental reserve out of Eildon Dam to supply Melbourne's toilets, car washing and leaf flushing because Melbourne urban water users can't be left water short.' This environmental reserve in the Goulburn system in the Eildon Dam is about 30 gigalitres of water. It is of the highest security of all. Irrigators cannot use it. It is a volume of water reserved in Eildon Dam to use for flushing the Goulburn River should there be a toxic blue-green algae outbreak. These blue-green algae outbreaks occur in hot weather when the water is shallow-the conditions that exist now. When toxic blue-green algae outbreaks occur, the ecosystem is quickly poisoned and there can be no human consumption of the water. That is why that environmental reserve is there in Eildon Dam. But Mr Brumby has said: ‘That's okay, we will take it and pipe it to Melbourne. We acknowledge the savings we talk about by our investment in the water supply system won't be there, particularly in dry years, but we cannot leave Melbourne short of water.' I say to the rian government that you have shamefully neglected Melbourne's sustainable water resource during your time in government. Melbourne does not have recycling in any way, shape or form as it should. Stormwater harvesting is virtually non-existent and the dumping of all treated sewage water out at Gunnamatta is a disgrace. Melbourne water users are profligate in their use. The waterpricing mechanisms for Melbourne water consumption in no way reflects the cost and value of the water and the need to conserve it. Instead of tackling these sorts of issues and finding solutions to Melbourne's long term water supply, we have this quick and dirty and technologically simple fix of taking water from the Murray-Darling Basin over the divide in the north of the state of Victoria to the urban water users of Bendigo, Geelong, Ballarat and Melbourne. Those members in this chamber will not be surprised to know that environmental, social and economic assessments or the impacts of the Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat or Bendigo pipelines were never done. There were no environment assessments undertaken before these pipelines were announced as a done deal. You might say that that is extraordinary. How could that be in the 21st century with a democratically elected government? The Bendigo pipeline is already completed and it is pushing water out of the near depleted Eildon Dam into the muddy waste of the Eppalock Dam. The Bendigo pipeline is in place, the Ballarat pipeline is yet to come and the Melbourne pipeline is on its way, we are assured. I want to commend the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, in saying: ‘Hang on, this is just too embarrassing. Enough is enough. We will now declare the Goulburn system to Melbourne north-south pipeline a controlled acVictotion under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.' Mr Garrett has realised you just cannot keep going on like this and get away with it, even though you ignore the farmers marching in the streets, because the metro media do not print their problems, and even though you consistently say, ‘This is not a problem because we will find water savings somehow.' Mr Garrett has said, ‘This north-south pipeline, the Goulburn system to Melbourne and Geelong, is a controlled action,' under the EPBC Act. He declared this about the middle of last week. I congratulate him for doing that. He got into an enough strife with the dredging of the bay and he is in a bit of bother with the desalinisation plant. But I am pleased he made this announcement about the north-south pipeline. However, I am shocked to see, just five working days after Mr Garrett's announcement, that we already have the report. Here it is: the ‘Sugarloaf pipeline project'. You might wonder why this Melbourne-Goulburn Valley, north-south pipeline, is now called the Sugarloaf project. It was an attempt to hide it from the public, but we discovered in time that this project is now called Sugarloaf, after one of the reservoirs on the way. Just a few working days after the declaration of this pipeline project as a controlled action, we have the Victorian government's project impact assessment report. I have to tell you, I am shocked and ashamed. This report is thin. It regularly says: ‘Well, of course, we're going to have to do more work assessing here and assessing there. Yes, there are scores of endangered and vulnerable flora and fauna, as listed in the EPBC Act, that will be in the way of the pipeline. But we believe we can put in some mitigating measures. Perhaps we can put the pipeline overland here rather than under there. The job will be right. Don't you worry about that.' That is what this Sugarloaf pipeline project report basically says. It does not go into the impacts of the loss of the water from the Murray-Darling Basin in northern Victoria and the impacts on the flora and fauna across the riverine tracts of the Broken, Goulburn and Murray rivers. It does not talk about the impacts of taking the environmental reserve out of Eildon Dam. Without this reserve we will have nothing to fight the toxic blue-green algal blooms, which, as we speak, are a threat in the Murray. This pipeline project document at last says: ‘Oh, dear, yes, there are some Indigenous heritage issues. Hmm. We'll think about those,' though it does not identify them in detail and says, ‘We need to do a bit more work there too.' We are supposed to accept this project impact assessment five working days after its declaration as a controlled action as the answer to removing what last year would have been 30 per cent of the northern Victoria irrigation region's water supply to flush down the toilets of Melbourne. Why doesn't the Premier really take a statesmanlike approach here and say: ‘This doesn't drought proof Melbourne. This was a quick and dirty political fix. We were panicked by Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo people not being able to water their roses. We didn't really care about the food bowl future of northern Victoria-that multibillion dollar industry and income generator. We thought we could get away with it by throwing $600 million at them rather than fixing up our own state owned water infrastructure'? I am calling on the minister, Mr Garrett, to ensure they do better. (Time expired)",42
27,The SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Order! Before I call Mr Ramsey, I remind honourable members that this is his first speech. I therefore ask that the usual courtesies be extended to him.",46
28,Mr RAMSEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION," Mr Speaker, I acknowledge and congratulate you on your appointment. I stand before you today as the proud and humble representative of the people of Grey. I am the 11th member in over 100 years and just the third Liberal to hold the seat. Grey was named for Sir George Grey, who served as Governor of South Australia from 1841 to 1845. It seemed like some kind of message to me when, in May last year, I walked into the basement of St Pauls Cathedral, London, and looked at the floor and realised I was standing on the resting place of Sir George Grey, also a former Governor and Premier of New Zealand, Governor of Cape Colony in South Africa and an explorer in Western Australia. I had a quiet word with him and told him I intended to keep an eye on his patch, if I were chosen as its new member. I was raised as one of four children on the family farm at Buckleboo, where I still live. My three sisters all pursued professional reers, producing a teacher, a pharmacist and a doctor. One of them, Janet, a long-term resident of Canberra, is here in the gallery today. I would like to thank my parents, Eric and Dora, for instilling in me a sense of social obligation and a Christian compassion for all. My mother, a genteel lady with a great singing voice, is the author of my compassion for those in society who struggle. My father is a unique individual of high intelligence and great stamina. At the age of 80, he was still driving a truck at harvest time. At about that time, he rode a pushbike 115 kilometres from Arno Bay to Port Lincoln to raise money for cancer research. When he got there, he realised he had left his companone ions behind. All of them were much younger than him. Never a patient man, my father; he rode back almost 10 kilometres to escort them in. To him, I owe my energy and passion for life. To my campaign team, thank you. I make special mention of my campaign manager, Heather Baldock, and her husband, Graeme, and friends, neighbours and fervent supporters here in the gallery today. To my home branch of Kimba, the other 30 Liberal Party branches spread across Grey and the more than 1,000 volunteers out there on election day, thank you and well done. Special thanks to a number of federal and state colleagues, in particular Senators Ferguson and Bernardi, and Graham Gunn. I am given strength by those in my community who have great faith in me. I dearly thank the Buckleboo crew, also here today, who have a round trip of a thousand kilometres just to catch the plane in Adelaide to be with us today. I am inordinately proud of my three children, all in the gallery. My eldest daughter, Alexandra, is a chemical engineer and curca- rently working out of Darwin. My second daughter, Courtney, has just completed first class honours in science, and Lachlan is a second-year civil engineering student. Purposeful and self motivated, they are already making a success of life. Families provide loving, caring, stable and trusting environments for children. They are the building blocks of our nation; their failure threatens our future. It is our responsibility as parliamentary representatives to do all we can to support them. To my wonderful wife, Teresa, who supports me, gives me strength and has committed to sharing this life on the road: thank you. I do not think I could overemphasise how difficult it would be in an electorate the size of Grey to retain a working marriage if partner did not make the type of commitment she has made to me. I have a long involvement with leadership in community affairs. Sporting clubs, Apex, hospital boards, agricultural research, farming organisations and the Liberal Party have all given me the opportunity to contribute. I am incredibly privileged to now take that community commitment to a national level. The population of my home town of Kimba is just 1,200; it has, though, made a significant political contribution. It is remarkable that I am the fourth person from Kimba to be elected to parliament in the last 40 years-three of us, I think, inspired by the first, Arthur Whyte, who established the Liberal Party branch in Kimba and went on to become the President of the Legislative Council in South Australia. Arthur has been followed by his daughter Caroline Schaefer, who is currently a legislative councillor, and my predecessor, Barry Wakelin, who served this place and the electorate of Grey with distinction for almost 15 years. Barry was a man of the people who the electorate increasingly warmed to the longer he was in office. I must also acknowledge his wife, Tina, who was the other half of ‘Team Wakelin'. A former staffer said to me, ‘Great value-we got two for the price of one.' Those of you who know Tina would appreciate that comment. I am often asked what it is about Kimba and leadership. It is a good question. I think it has something to do with being on the edge economically, geographically and sociallythe attitude that, if you are not prepared to help yourself, why should you expect someone else to help? My local football club, Buckleboo, in 1984 built what is even by today's standards a magnificent clubroom 35 kilometres from town, surrounded by trees and paddocks-hence the name ‘the club in the scrub'. Built at a cost of nearly $300,000, today's value would be around $2 million. There was no public funding-just 40 families determined to help themselves. Local guarantors were paid off in three short years. It is a testimony to the power of positive tude: if you want something done, get off your backside and make it happen. Sadly, it is an Australian attitude we are fast losing. We are a much poorer society for losing it. That leads me to my frustration with what I see as our collective lack of individual accountability. Whenever things go wrong in our society, we start to search for someone to blame. If we trip over, it is because someone else left a rock on the footpath. Surely we have some level of personal responsibility. Nurses in hospitals spend more time filling out records than providing nursing care so they can prove that, should anything go wrong, it was not their fault. In the end, impediments lead to a weakening of the decision-making process. People avoid making decisions in case they get it wrong. It has often been said that our diggers built an unparalleled reputation for their ability to respond in an independent fashion, to take charge in the event that they lost their leadership, to make decisions under pressure. It is what made them the best soldiers in the world. The independent spirit on which Australia was built is being strangled. I am attracted to the Liberal Party ideal that those who can, should take charge of their own lives. Many of the reforms of the last decade have been aimed at just that outcome: encouragement to take out private health cover, to contribute to your own retirement plan, to utilise independent options for your children's education-in short, taking care of your own business but still believing there must be quality public options for those who cannot or choose not to take this path. This world is not awash with democracy; we are extremely fortunate and privileged to live here. I have news for the many who believe that this is such a great country in spite of our politicians and our system: we have such a great country because of those things. attiWe employ a government to run the country, then we employ an opposition to examine every move they make, to highlight poor policy, bad practice and corruption. Should they find any of those things, we have the opportunity to vote and change the government with no bloodshed and little disruption. As a stable, mature and wealthy democracy, Australia has a role in the world far beyond what one might expect from a country of this size. Our ability to engineer the liberalisation of world trade, whilst being in our interest, is of far greater value to those developing nations around the world. The globalisation of the world economy that sees these production shift to low-cost economies spreads the wealth of the world. Poverty is the illegitimate bedfellow of conflict and it should be core business for Australia to be well engaged in this area. The electorate of Grey, the third biggest in the nation at almost 905,000 square kilometres, is by any standards vast. It stretches from the borders of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales to Marion Bay on the Yorke Peninsula and Eudunda in the south. It has 27 councils, 137 schools and 36 hospitals, which serve an enormous number of individual communities. It can present some challenges for a local member. I noticed in his maiden address to this House the member for Wentworth remarked he could paddle a surf ski the length of his electorate in an hour. We are a bit short on water in parts of Grey, so the surf ski might be a bit of a stretch; to put it in context, it takes me an hour and a half in a jumbo jet to get across Grey. My electorate is often seen as the big rural seat in South Australia when in fact half of the population live in the industrial cities of Whyalla, Port Pirie and Port Augusta-great examples of multicultural Australia. Whyalla, for example, is home to over 90 different nationalities-friendly, cooperative, tolerant and all with an allegiance to Australia. It is an electorate of incredible from some of the driest deserts in Australia, with rainfall of less than 100 millimetres a year, to some of the most fertile farmlands on the Yorke and Eyre peninsulas. There are dramatic visual icons like the ancient sentinels of the Flinders Ranges; huge salt lakes, including Lake Eyre; the feast or famine of Australia's inland rivers; and a stunning coastline from the Great Australian Bight to the pristine white sandy beaches of the Yorke and Eyre peninsulas. There is dramatic history, such as the opening of inland Australia. The names, places and icons roll off the tongue: the Overland Telegraph Line; the Afghan camel drivers and their rail replacement, the Ghan; the Birdsville, Oodnadatta and Strzelecki tracks. These are great slabs of Australian folklore. The economy of the electorate is currently enjoying the benefits of the mining boom, which is helping revitalise the industrial cities. Unemployment rates in these centres, while still above the national averages, have declined markedly in the past 10 years and are a testimony to the excellent economic management of the previous government. We are incredibly energy rich and have new-age energy. Already the world's pre-eminent supplier of uranium, a greenhouse friendly fuel, it seems we are almost daily discovering new deposits of hot rocks; we have many of the best sites in southern Australia for wind farms; and we are blessed-even though some say cursed-with huge areas that enjoy more than abundant sunlight for the production of solar electricity. Both sides of politics are committed to a carbon trading scheme, as we must be, to curb the effects of global warming. The Cooper Basin has been a major supplier of Australia's oil and gas, and this will continue but production has peaked. It will have a new economic life because of its unique position to become the country's major storage area contrasts, for carbon dioxide. Not only are we rich with energy but already BHP's Olympic Dam is one of the great copper mines of the world, with a proposed expansion set to more than triple its size. Major developments at Prominent Hill, world-class mineral sands deposits in the west, the expansion of iron ore near Whyalla, along with a number of new deposits on Eyre Peninsula and in the far north, are all adding to a heady mix. It is my goal to assist local communities in retaining a fair slice of the benefits in our electorate, to keep workers living in their regional towns and cities, to get governments to reinvest a fair share of the dividend in the areas it came from and not use it just as a cash cow. Balancing the promotion of this dynamic sector will present a lot of challenges, and it is a task that I do not take lightly. I will hope to focus decisions that will enable us not only to create jobs but also to pass on a legacy of good management to our children. We cannot live in this world without making some impact on the natural environment, but neither can we have an exploit-at-all-costs mentality. With more than 70 per cent of South Australia's coastline, Grey is the major player in our fishing and aquaculture industries. Port Lincoln is the home of the great southern bluefin tuna industry, resuscitated by the pioneering of farmed tuna. As the world's wild-stock fisheries are reaching their limits, aquaculture is providing the promise of tomorrow. Already we are farming abalone, oysters, kingfish and mussels, and we are on the verge of closing the breeding cycle of tuna. Visionary investment in the infrastructure area will be needed for the region to reach its full potential. Roads, rail, ports, air facilities, electrical interconnectors and water generation will all need investment. I welcome the government's commitment to skills training and urge them to support the very successful Australian technical college established on the three campuses in the upper Spencer Gulf. This is a great educational model. It is strongly supported by industry, by schools and by the public. This parliament and this generation must have a significant effect on the welfare of Indigenous Australia. The electorate has over 9,000 of Aboriginal descent, many living in some of the most remote parts of our nation in settlements of a similar nature to the type targeted in the intervention in the Northern Territory. I welcome the apology to the Aboriginal peoples. I fervently hope that this will provide comfort to those who were adversely affected by policies, attitudes and actions of the past. We will now be measured by what the nation does in a practical sense to achieve real changes to the outcomes of many in this part of our community. We must not return to an ideology that sees Aboriginal Australia as just victims, who deserve welfare. Long-term welfare robs people of dignity and purpose. If no economic basis exists for a community, it will eventually cease to exist. There is nothing more assured to destroy any human soul than the uselessness of perpetual unemployment. If it is important that these people stay on their traditional lands, it is imperative they be opened up to development partnerships. Tourism, mining and more traditional agricultural activities can provide the economic base for these inland communities to flourish. The government has supported the intervention. I urge it to stand by this commitment. We can no longer accept a second Australia in these remote communities. For that reason, I call upon the government to reconsider its move to reinstate the permit system. A situation where parts of our country and parts of our population are hidden and allowed to be measured by a different, inferior standard cannot continue. Might I pause here to commiserate with Mal Brough, who had the strength to begin the task. The contribution he has made, and was about to make, to the Indigenous future of Australia cannot be overstated. This parliament has lost a great champion of the cause-a man who truly made a difference. I have behind me a 30-year career in agriculture-an industry I count myself very fortunate to have been involved with. Modern agriculture is a dynamic industry. To survive, Australian farmers have had to embrace innovation. We have seen incredible technological changes, and today's methods of farming are so different from those my father used. Precision farming, modern marketing techniques, complex soils and crop analysis mean that today's farmer is extremely multiskilled. I have had a long involvement in cutting-edge dryland farming research, firstly as a member and then as Chair of the Eyre Peninsula Agricultural Research Foundation. I am strongly aware of the important role that a well-funded research and development capacity plays not just in agriculture but in all industries. It is disturbing to note that, a first line of business, the new government has slashed $10 million that was put in place to support agricultural research at a time of deficiencies in levy income caused by the drought. There is plenty of debate about whether this drought is a result of climate change or whether it is just a good old-fashioned drought, albeit at the very extremes of our recorded experiences. I think it is probably both. As a farmer living in some of the driest cropping country in the world, I am acutely aware of the challenges of climate change. If southern Australia is to suffer a reduction in rainfall, it stands to reason we will be the first to feel its bite. But, whatever the cause, the results are very real. Inland towns with no alternative economies are losing a generation of young people, their skilled tradespeople, their young families and, unless we decide otherwise, government services. There are limits on what governments can do, but we should not be the catalyst that causes services to disappear. The closure of a school, a hospital or even a school bus run can have devastating knock-on effects for a small community. We should, however, remain optimistic about the future of agriculture. With a world population pushing toward seven billion, the booming economies of Asia will increase the demand for Western diets and energy, and we are in the box seat to provide what they need. Living in rural Australia is a great privilege but, unfortunately, it can come at cost. Inequality with urban Australia in the key areas of health, education and communication are contributing to the country-city drift. Downgrading of rural health services to where many are little more than first aid centres has resulted in a continual deskilling of our professional staff, leading to job dissatisfaction and the inability to respond to emergency situations. Doctors will not serve in as rural areas where there are no or inadequate hospitals. Individual efficiencies do not always compensate for the worth of the total package. Withdrawal of services can have complex, far-reaching implications for the whole community. It is worth noting that the South Australian government is currently moving nearly 260 country based jobs, many of them in the health industry, to Adelaide, in the name of efficiency. Quality education can become a huge financial burden to parents. I do not normally support non-means-tested allowances, but in this case, where students are required to live away from home to access subjects of their choice, including tertiary, they should receive assistance. Parents choose where they live, but, in this case, it can be the children who wear the cost. One must seriously doubt the viability of the government's plan to roll out a fibre to the node network to 98 per cent of Australia. This plan spends the $2 billion telecommunication fund put in place to provide for the very demographic I represent. I strongly urge the government to revisit their technology mix to ensure that rural people receive a fast, modern service and are not left behind when the cash runs out. Rural and regional business needs the same kinds of access to telecommunication as the rest of the community. Our cities provide great diversity and opportunities in what is otherwise a rural landscape. They are the centres that provide higher levels of medical, aged and educational services, industry training and a face to the arts. The greatest threat to their continued growth is certainty of water supply. The cities of the Upper Spencer Gulf and their industries are 100 per cent reliant on the Murray. My electorate and the rest of Australia can no longer stand delays in implementing national control of the Murray. There is no greater curse to a nation than that of high unemployment. We are currently enjoying the lowest rates in more than 35 years. Full credit for this must go to the vious government. Significant inroads have been made into the long-term unemployed. Small business, the backbone of our economy, determines the kind of employment numbers that we ultimately end up with. It has been encouraged by changes in the industrial system to expand and to take on extra staff. The next few years are now uncertain, and I urge the government to take great care with their changes to industrial relations lest they sour the well of jobs growth. Programs such as the Welfare to Work reforms are not about savings to the national economy; they are about individuals taking control of their lives. We know that people who are employed have much better outcomes in all areas of their lives. The Australians we can get into the workforce have better health, better education, stronger families and better lives. But there are some groups in our society who will never be able to take control of their own lives in this fashion. The permanently severely disabled are just one. Things have improved, but we have further to go. Australia is a wealthy country, and people who, through no fault of their own, find life a daily struggle, should not have to. Parents and relatives burdened with the terrible worry of what will happen when they can no longer cope need a more certain future. As with so many of these service type issues, the problems get worse the further you get from capital cities. The opportunities for those of us elected to parliament are enormous. We have the task of identifying the difficulties, the injustices and the great opportunities for progress in our society, and we are given a chance to make a real difference. After all, isn't that why we all came here? I give the people of Grey my pledge that my door is always open. I take on your issues as my own, and may we pre- together have many triumphs continuing to build Grey as a great place to live and work. Debate (on motion by Mr John Cobb) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 February, on motion by Ms Gillard: That this bill be read a second time.",46
29,Ms JULIE BISHOP,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The opposition will not seek to oppose the passage of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008. However, we will move an amendment that we believe will strike the right balance between flexibility and fairness in workplace relations. The proposed amendment will seek to enhance the new individual employment contract that is being introduced by the government in this legislation to ensure that there is available in workplace bargaining an option for employees and employers for a long-term individual contract. I am pleased that the Rudd government acknowledges the need for individual agreements by allowing existing agreements to continue for up to five years and through the introduction of a new individual statutory agreement subject to a new no disadvantage test. I first received a copy of this legislation last week. My consultations over the past week confirm that Labor's new individual contract should be a long-term feature of Australia's workplace relations system. Therefore, my amendment will seek to delete the global expiry date of 31 December 2009 and give these new Labor individual employment agreements an expiry date of five years from the date of approval. We have maintained the eligibility criteria for Labor's individual employment agreements for employers who had offered individual contracts prior to 31 December 2007. However, we acknowledge that this could have a significant impact on new businesses or employers who wish to avail themselves of the option of an individual bargaining arrangement. The Senate has in fact referred this bill to a committee, and this is the kind of issue that the Senate inquiry should consider. Labor's industrial relations policy has not been accompanied by any economic analysis or modelling or any impact statement, and hence the necessity for the Senate to refer this bill to a committee. The Minister for Education and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who is also the Minister for Social Inclusion, has spent more than a year demonising individual agreements. The minister has also demonised employers who use these agreements and has attacked the integrity of individual employers and industry sectors. After months of these relentless attacks on employers, the minister then introduces a new individual workplace agreement. The minister will argue that this agreement is only transitional but that it will be fair for workers for the next two years. Then, for some reason, after two years, it will no longer be fair. Surely this is impossible if these agreements are to be subject to Labor's new no disadvantage test. After all, what could be fairer in the eyes of Labor than a new individual contract designed and introduced by Labor and subject to a new no disadvantage test designed and introduced by Labor? I can assure the minister that her attacks on employers and her hypocrisy on the matter of individual agreements have not gone unnoticed in the business community. But the minister was strangely quiet in question time this week when I raised the fact that union officials have been negotiating collective agreements on behalf of their employees which trade away the same terms and conditions that individual agreements do. It seems that her outrage is directed only at employers and not at union officials who have achieved precisely the same outcomes through union negotiated collective agreements. At no time during her attack on employers has the minister acknowledged that the annualised salaries in both individual and collective agreements more than compensate for the so-called trading away of award conditions. A feature of the individual agreements in the Western Australian mining sector, for example, has been substantial salary increases based on productivity gains as a trade-off for award conditions that either are irrelevant or seriously hamper productivity. Of course, we all know that if the minister had her way she would remove all flexibility in workplace relations. Last year, when employers raised their concerns over her first attempt at an industrial relations policy, which had been drafted and designed by the ACTU, the minister threatened them with injury if they dared to voice their concerns publicly. This unseemly outburst was tempered when the now Prime Minister was forced to intervene and overrule the minister at that time, and she was dragged, kicking and screaming, to a more reasonable position. Workplace flexibility is vital to maintainper ing our strong economy. Opportunities for individual bargaining and both union and non-union collective bargaining have been a feature of Australia's workplace relations system for over a decade. The Keating reforms of 1993 introduced the concept of enterprise or workplace bargaining, and this received bipartisan support. These reforms allowed collective agreements to override restrictive award conditions that held back productivity. However, the unions remained central to most negotiations. The 1996 reforms of the Howard government extended the workplace bargaining system into the non-union sector and provided the choice of individual agreements known as Australian workplace agreements. Workplace bargaining has meant that wages and employment conditions are negotiated in businesses rather than being determined by third parties with little knowledge of the particular needs of that business-bodies such as industrial tribunals, unions, employer bodies or government. Workplace bargaining has avoided the strangulation of the one-size-fits-all award system imposed by a tribunal. The circumstances of every business, of every employer and of every employee are different. Workplace agreements ensure that wages and conditions reflect the circumstances of a business and its employees which are more likely to make the business more competitive and be relevant to people's changing needs. Workplace bargaining aimed at improving productivity has become the basis upon which improvements in wages and conditions have been achieved. Without improving productivity, increases in wages and improvements in employment conditions cannot be sustained. Improved living standards cannot be achieved. The evidence is there for all to see. Under the Hawke-Keating Labor governments from 1983 to 1996, real wages decreased by 1.8 cent, homeowners were hit with 17 per cent interest rates and, by 1993, almost one million Australians were unemployed. In contrast, the coalition government reforms since 1996 delivered increases in real wages of 20 per cent, while interest rates and inflation remained at historically low levels. The OECD said in 2006 that Australia's ‘recent macroeconomic performance continues to be impressive' and that, ‘Living standards have steadily improved since the beginning of the 1990s and now surpass all G7 countries except the United States.' The Australian economy has been a standout. It may come as a surprise to the minister that workplace flexibility has been critical in underpinning that economic performance. It was critical in allowing the economy to weather the economic stocks of the Asian financial crisis; it was critical in weathering the tech bubble burst and other economic challenges. The management of our trillion-dollar economy was handed to the new government at the last election. I must say that watching the new Treasurer struggle every day does not instil in the opposition any confidence in his ability, and I am sure that it does not instil in the Australian public any confidence in his ability to manage a trillion-dollar economy. The Treasurer is clearly out of his depth, and it is terrifying to think of the consequences should a genuine economic crisis develop. The nation cannot afford to have a Treasurer who panics when confronted with detail and who is incapable of answering the simplest questions about his new responsibilities. He has yet to answer any question on his understanding of the potential impact of the government's industrial relations reforms; hence the need for a Senate inquiry to give the Australian people the answers that the Treasurer is incapable of providing. The opposition believe that the amendment we propose to Labor's new individual employment contract recognises the need for there to be a range of workplace bargaining options, from collective agreements between an employer and a group of employees to agreements between an employer and individual employees, depending upon what best suits them. The significant workplace reforms of the Howard government over the past decade or more have aimed to increase the flexibility of the labour market, which has in turn generated higher productivity, higher real wages, increased labour force participation and lower unemployment. The most recent national unemployment figure of 4.1 per cent would have only been a dream under the previous Labor government. I note that it is substantially lower at 3.3 per cent Western Australia, and that can be attributed to the strong economic growth over the past decade and to the reform of the labour market. It is no coincidence that the period of labour market reform coincides with the growth of the economy and the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs. Labor would have you believe that the strong economy has come about through good luck. The mining boom fell into the nation's lap like manna from heaven. Labor would have you believe that workplace reforms did not play a role. The truth is that the mining boom would have passed Australia by if we had not become a reliable supplier to world markets. If Australia had continued to be a country beset by industrial disputation, we would not have been considered a reliable trading partner for the emerging economies, including China, or for our more traditional partners, including Japan and Korea. Last weekend, I spoke to a number of senior mining industry executives. One told of his experience in the mining sector over 20 years. In the early 1990s, he left Australia to work overseas. At that time, the sector was suffering constant industrial disputation. There were strikes over the most insignificant of issues. In fact, in his sector there had been a strike over the flavour of ice-cream at the site kiosk. In his particular resource sector at the time, South American mining companies were the preferred suppliers as they were more reliable than Australian ones. South American mining companies were more reliable than Australian mining companies in their ability to deliver on time. This executive returned to Australia about two years ago. He described the resources sector of today as a different planet from that of the early 1990s. He said he was stunned at the change of culture, the gains in productivity and the cooperation between management in and staff to ensure the smooth and efficient running of this particular operation. He pointed out that Australia had overtaken South America as the preferred supplier, but that we remain in a highly competitive environment and cannot afford any hint of a return to the bad old days of industrial disruption. In 1992, 1.6 million working days were lost to strikes. This has fallen dramatically to now be at the lowest level in more than 100 years. There are workplaces that have not experienced a strike in a decade. We are in a period of industrial harmony that is unprecedented, and it is no coincidence that we are also in a period of unprecedented economic growth. Why have we entered a period of industrial harmony, which has delivered real wage increases? It is because there is no compulsion for employers and employees to have unwanted third parties interfering in the bargaining process. If employees wish to have a third party negotiate on their behalf, that is their right and they are able to do so, but it should not be forced upon them. Even in unionised workplaces where no employees are on individual agreements, the availability of individual agreements has had a calming effect on the behaviour of unions. The union officials know that, if their behaviour or demands become unreasonable or they push the employer too far, the employer has the option of bypassing the union and negotiating directly with their employees. Many employers have not used individual agreements and prefer to negotiate collectively with their employees, but they do not want to be at the mercy of unreasonable demands or disruptive behaviour. They must have other options available to them. While around eight per cent of the Australian workforce are currently on an individual agreement, the mere presence of individual agreements as an option for employers is enough to make unions drop their excessive claims, behave reasonably and even talk about productivity gains. It is fair to say that one of the major forms since 1996 has been to give Australian employers and employees the right-and I would say the basic right-to conduct their business and negotiate their workplace agreements without compulsory reference to a union. This reflects the changing nature of the Australian workforce and its changing needs and circumstances. Whereas a generation ago over half the private sector were union members-in the early sixties it was about 61 or 62 per cent-currently more than 85 per cent of private sector employees no longer choose to join trade unions. The working public is passing judgement on unions and their effectiveness in lifting the standard of living. Rather than take us back to an era of industrial relations that has long since passed, we need to continue to embrace reform. I had hoped that Labor would admit that it recognises the need for flexible working arrangements. After all, this legislation specifically enables existing individual agreements to continue to operate for five years-not for six months or 12 months but for five years. Yet Labor would have you believe that individual agreements are unfair. If they are so unfair, why are they lasting for five years, a period that could encompass not one but two federal elections? It is to be expected that the Senate inquiry will provide the evidence base that the government has so far failed to adduce on the significant benefits to the economy from the retention of flexibility in the workplace relations system. The balance of this bill seeks to abolish Australian workplace agreements. Given the proposed amendment to embrace Labor's individual employment agreements, with Labor's no disadvantage test, as five-year agreements instead of transitional two-year agreements, the opposition will not oppose the amendment. The bill also seeks to refer to the Austrare- lian Industrial Relations Commission the task of award modernisation and simplification. This is a process that has long been coalition policy but was opposed by the Labor Party for years until just a few months before the 2007 election. We welcome Labor's change of position on this issue. There are currently over 4,300 federal and state awards. There are over 105,000 employee classifications. This is a complex, unwieldy system. The reduction, simplification and modernisation of Australia's complex and unwieldy system of awards are a necessary step in improving productivity. However, given that the government proposes to abolish the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, some might be forgiven for thinking that it will add to the confusion and complexity if the Industrial Relations Commission is tasked with the award rationalisation process in its dying days-yet it will be a new body proposed by Labor that will in fact oversee the implementation of the new awards. The handling of the rationalisation and simplification of awards is an area that is best covered by the Senate inquiry. The bill also seeks to introduce 10 National Employment Standards to replace the five existing employment standards, to underpin Labor's new no disadvantage test that is to apply to all agreements. We welcome the fact that it will apply to individual ments that are being introduced by Labor. The proposed 10 standards have been released. There is to be a period of consultation before an exposure draft is published. I would note that the majority of the new standards relate to how much time one can have off work and there is no mention of the word ‘productivity' in the substantive part of the proposed 10 standards. Given the concerns already voiced by employers about the potential for increased regulation, red tape and cost to business, this is another significant line of inquiry for the Senate. As to other provisions in this bill: there will be a new commencement date for agreements-that is, upon approval rather than lodgement with the Workplace Authority; and there are changes to the termination conditions for collective agreements-some pre Work Choices certified agreements can be extended and varied on application to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Yet the government is reserving its most significant industrial relations changes for some years yet, including the establishment of a truly national industrial relations system. This was coalition policy, now adopted by Labor. But we can have no confidence that this new era of federal-state cooperation, so touted by the Rudd government, will actually see the creation of a truly national industrial relations system as promised by the Prime Minister prior to the last election. We will see the state ministers digging in their heels. We have already had the unseemly spectacle of the Minister for Industrial Relations from New South Wales",52
30,Mr MORRISON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,Very unseemly.,57
31,Ms JULIE BISHOP,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"it was a very unseemly spectacle-overthrowing the Rudd government's idea of a truly national IR system. The creation of a single body called Fair Work Australia has been put off for some years, again leaving the Australian Industrial agreeRelations Commission in limbo. It has been told it will cease to exist, that some of its members will be appointed to the new body and some will not-clearly an indication that those who behave according to the Rudd government's agenda will be appointed and those who act independently will not. This also raises a number of logistical let alone constitutional issues, but that is legislation for another day. The abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission is a matter of considerable concern to a great many in the building industry, but once more Labor has put that off, presumably beyond the next election date. And there is the roll-back of the small business exemption from unfair dismissal laws. This is a matter of considerable concern to small businesses across Australia, for people who have been employed by small businesses since the introduction of the unfair dismissal exemption but particularly for the long-term unemployed. This exemption works for the benefit of long-term unemployed-those who would not otherwise get an opportunity for a job. Small business believe that, as long as they are not hampered by having to pay ‘go away' money, they can give someone the opportunity to take on a job. The exemption from unfair dismissal laws is all about the long-term unemployed. It is not about those with a job; the focus is on those who do not have a job. We have seen the most dramatic shift in the long-term unemployed in many, many years. Structural unemployment is very hard to shift, yet in Australia we have seen a dramatic decrease in the number of long-term unemployed because employers are giving people a go. Yet the roll-back of the small business exemption from unfair dismissal laws has been put off for another day. One could be forgiven for presuming that Labor wants to continue to reap the benefits of a decade of reforms for as long as possible before it has to pay back its debt to the unions. Why else would Labor not bring forward its laws to roll back the exemption from unfair dismissals? It would be a very simple piece of legislation. I am sure it could be drafted overnight, yet Labor has put it off to a much later date so that it can continue to reap the benefits of the long term unemployed being given the opportunity of a job. The 4.1 per cent unemployment figure that we have seen recently has not come about by accident. It means there are more people in the workforce, and that includes long-term unemployed who are for the first time in a long time being given the chance of a job. Given that the unions spent more money on an advertising campaign in the last federal election than both major parties combined, the unions will be demanding their pound of flesh. Today we read that the National Secretary of the CFMEU is ignoring the government's calls for wage restraint, is ignoring the suggestion that wage claims should be based on productivity gains and is ignoring the fact that the ABCC has played an important part in cleaning up the building industry. We will see continuing disruptive union activity break out across this country. We have to ask what the government will do to prevent a wages breakout that will feed into inflation and that will lead to the kind of sion that Australia experienced in the 1990s, the last time Labor was in government. Work Choices is no longer coalition policy. We will not oppose the passage of this bill. We will not oppose the abolition of AWAs. But we urge the government to support our proposed amendment to extend the Labor Party's new individual contracts with the Labor Party's own no disadvantage test. We urge the government to support this in the interests of a better, more flexible and fairer workplace that reflects the reality of workplaces and reflects the reality of the needs of employees and employers in the 21st century. It is time for Labor to admit that flexibility in the workplace is underpinning our economic reforms. I urge them to support our proposed amendment.",57
32,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise to speak in favour of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 and to speak against the proposed amendment to be moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I say firstly that this is a fundamental bill. This is the beginning of the end of Work Choices and is a reflection of the people's will. This represents the mandate that the Labor government was provided with to enact legislation to repeal Work Choices. I am very happy, indeed proud, to be at the dispatch box to speak to this particular matter. When Labor published its workplace relations policy, Forward with Fairness, in April last year, it made a foundation promise to abolish Work Choices. This bill marks the beginning of the end for Work Choices. As well as preventing the drafting of any new AWAs, this transition bill will make other amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996-including allowing existing users of AWAs to make individual transitional employment agreements during the transitional recesperiod up until 31 December next year-and introduce a genuine no disadvantage test for individual transitional employment agreements and new collective agreements. It will also enable the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to modernise the awards. The bill also repeals the requirement for employers to provide a copy of the Work Choices workplace relations fact sheet to their employees. Of course, as we know and as the Deputy Prime Minister made clear in question time, this was a pointless yet extravagant exercise that required companies to distribute government propaganda at the expense of the taxpayer. After the forest of other pamphlets and the plague of mouse boards, we will now remove the capacity for taxpayers' money to be spent on such an outrageous waste. A more substantial workplace relations bill will be introduced into the parliament later this year to ensure the government's new fair, flexible and productive workplace relations systems will be fully operational by 1 January 2010. Once operational, the workplace relations system under a Rudd government will not include AWAs or any other statutory individual employment agreement. Working families have agreed with Labor's view that they are entitled to a safety 10 National Employment Standards. Having listened to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I can see she has no concern with that particular part of the government's intention. I listened to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and in 30 minutes we had a meagre amendment proposed and nothing else. It was like I was listening to someone who wanted to rationalise Work Choices but vote for this bill-that is, put up a minor amendment, not insist on it and effectively accept the view of the government that we need to fundamentally change the law that exists. Those 10 basic employment conditions include maximum weekly hours of work, requests for flexible work arrangementswhich, of course, denies the assertion made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that there will not be flexibility-parental leave and related entitlements, annual leave, personal carer's and compassionate leave, community service leave, long service leave, public holidays, notice of termination, redundancy pay and a fair work information statement that must be provided to employees. This bill is a reflection of Labor policy and the will of the Australian people. As chair of Labor's industrial relations task force and shadow parliamentary secretary for workplace relations last year, this bill is a great moment for me and indeed a great moment for this country. Over the last two years I spent much of my time travelling around and visiting 60 electorates, hearing directly the concerns of working families about how Work Choices had begun to erode their employment conditions and threaten their job security. I heard from administrative workers who were sacked after 20 years of loyal, effective and competent service for no reason and with no compensation. I met young workers in retail, tourism and hospitality who were forced to work 12-hour shifts net of on Saturday and Sunday with no penalty rates and no overtime. This was done legally. Mr Robert interjecting",58
33,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,I see the member opposite laughing at the fact that young workers were affected by Work Choices. Mr Robert-What wage increase did they get?,59
34,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"When he gets his opportunity, he can get up on his hind legs and tell us why he is in a party that supported Work Choices. The fact is that there was the capacity to do that legally; employers were able to do that to very vulnerable workers. Indeed, in a House of Representatives employment committee inquiry last year-and I was in attendance at this meeting-a peak employer representative said, without any shame or any concern at all, that the great thing about Work Choices was that it made lawful all previous employment breaches that were illegal in the hospitality industry. Mr Robert-What is his name?",59
35,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The man said this in answer to a question, and it is in the transcript. I will find the transcript if you want me to embarrass this man. I can assure the member opposite that he said that the great thing about Work Choices is that it made legal what had been illegal in the hospitality industry. For me, that sums up Work Choices-a law that sanctions actions that were considered by earlier governments, Labor and conservative, as illegal. Interestingly, and underlining the decency in most people, the people who spoke with me around the country in every state and territory were less worried about the loss of their own employment, their own employment security and their own employment rights and more worried about the effects that Work Choices would have on their children, their grandchildren and people they had never met. This is in stark contrast to the admission made this week by the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who said that many cabinet ministers of the Howard government were not aware of the adverse effects of Work Choices. We are supposed to believe that the cabinet ministers of the former government were not aware of the adverse effects of Work Choices. This beggars belief. I know the previous government was out of touch, but for me to believe that cabinet ministers did not know the effects of Work Choices would have me conclude that they were incompetent beyond belief or insensitive to the concerns of ordinary working Australians. Mr Farmer interjecting",60
36,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The member opposite should know that. The member who represents Western Sydney should know how many constituents of his were adversely affected by Work Choices. But, of course, he does not live there anymore, does he. He has gone to North Sydney. I understand where the shadow minister has moved to. I have been to his electorate. I went to his electorate for a launch of Green Corp; he did not turn up, I noticed. Mr Farmer-Did you invite me?",60
37,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I did indeed. The ministers of the previous government say they did not know the effects of Work Choices. That beggars belief because out there in the community people knew that workers were hurting and that more was to come. We know that, if the Howard government had been re-elected, they were going to go further. They were going to introduce ‘Work Choices Plus'. They were going to continue with it until there were no entitlements for workers left in this country. That was their plan, and the people of Australia knew that and chose not to support the re-election of the Howard government. The election result is a testimony to that fact. While the Australian public made their position on AWAs crystal clear in November, it seems to me that those opposite are still debating their position. The public knows that there is still division in their party room. This division leaves the voters unclear as to whether the advocates or the critics of Work Choices will prevail. That is the problem for the public. They know there is division in the opposition; they just do not know whether the advocates or the critics of Work Choices will prevail. Following the postelection declaration by the outgoing workplace relations minister that Work Choices was dead, it seems that some members of the Liberal Party have insisted on performing CPR. One of those was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who, for 30 minutes today, managed to speak against Labor's plan but then let us know that she was going to vote for it. She spoke against the bill for 30 minutes and foreshadowed a meagre amendment, which the opposition will not insist upon-and then they are going to vote for the legislation. So are we supposed to believe that the previous government know not what they did? I know the previous government were out of touch-I have just said that-and we know the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is still out of touch, but this proposition is very hard to believe. I note that in yesterday's press conference the Deputy Leader of the Opposition announced that the Liberals would not oppose the passage of this bill. Is this the same uty Leader of the Opposition that said she was going to defend AWAs to the death? Is this the same Deputy Leader of the Opposition that supported the deferring of the bill to matter. a Senate committee? Was it a backflip or a somersault with a triple pike, or was she rolled in the party room and had to get up here and put a position she does not believe in? And why is that so important? I will tell the House why it is important. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who spoke just before me, is the person to draft the alternative plan for this country in the area of indusvisions trial relations, the people of Australia should know where she stands on this matter. Noone is clear on where the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for workplace relations, stands on these particular matters. All we do know is that her position changes day by day. Day by day the Deputy Leader of the Opposition changes her view. To extract an unequivocal commitment from her would be like getting one from Hamlet. In September 2004-and this is where it all began-the then Prime Minister, John Howard, announced during the election campaign the industrial relations policy of the then government. In September 2004 we heard the supposed plans of the government that was seeking to be re-elected. On that day there was not one mention of any element of Work Choices. Prior to the 2004 election the Prime Minister announced the coalition's IR policies with no reference to any of the pernicious provisions of Work Choices. The Liberal's Work Choices legislation-and I have said this before in this place-was conceived in secret and rammed through the parliament and down the throats of ordinary working families. This was a shameful and disgraceful act. I have yet to hear the opposition accept responsibility for that behaviour. I am yet to hear them take any responsibility Dep- for introducing the deliberate capacity for people to be exploited by rogue employers. There was not one word of contrition from the opposition with respect to that particular This occurred, as we know, because the former government had control of both chambers. Up until then we had been saving the Liberal Party from themselves. That is effectively what we had been doing. Because the government did not have a majority in the Senate, we managed to civilise some of their IR laws. I do not agree with all the proof the 1996 act, but I would have to say that that act was civilised by the Senate. But after the election, which gave the coalition the majority in the upper house, we could no longer save them from themselves. Their true IR policies were reflected in the laws that were enacted through Work Choices. We could not save them from themselves. It is important for me to comment briefly on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's view about pre-Work Choices AWAs, because she tries to put forward that pre-Work Choices AWAs was Liberal policy. It was not Liberal policy. The only reason that there was a no disadvantage test in the 1996 act was because the Senate insisted upon it. If it were not for Labor, the Democrats and other minor parties insisting on a no disadvantage test, there would not have been a no disadvantage test pre-Work Choices. So we were able, to some extent, to civilise what was uncivilised in terms of their industrial relations policies. The legislation went through-it was rammed through parliament. The Senate inquiry lasted for five days. It did not leave Canberra. Members of parliament were refused the right to debate on behalf of their constituents. We had a situation where the bill-a radical piece of legislation-was rammed through the parliament. We knew then what would take place. Apparently ministers of the previous government did not know. The government then sacked the first minister, the member for Menzies, but kept the law. It sacked the minister but kept the law. It blamed the messenger. But giving the member for North Sydney the reins would not change a thing. As I said at the time, Hockey might have been the jockey, but it was still the same old horse-and what a nag it was. Effectively, that is why the opposition finds themselves across the chamber. As Minister for Employment Participation, my key objective of course is to get people into work. We need to have a fair, effective, productive and innovative industrial relations system to make sure this country benefits. But it is important for the opposition to take stock of their position. The diftimes ficulty of all oppositions is to reconcile the fact that they lost the election. There is a process whereby people go through periods of denial. There is no doubt that the previous government denied the Australian people the chance before the 2004 election to decide whether they supported Work Choices. They denied MPs the right to debate Work Choices when it was introduced into the House. They denied a proper Senate inquiry for the most radical industrial relations laws the nation had ever seen. They denied-to themselves as well, apparently-that Work Choices was hurting working families, and today they are still in denial. We had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for industrial relations effectively say nothing about the concerns the opposition have with Work Choices.",60
38,Mr HUNT,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the minister for his psychological insights and I call attention to the state of the House. (Quorum formed)",62
39,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,WORKPLACE RELATIONS," Obviously, the opposition do not want to have a debate about Work Choices. You have the shadow minister at the table, the member for Flinders, trying to prevent me from finishing this contribution to the debate. Work Choices will be killed off by this government. It was our commitment and it is the will of the Australian people. (Time expired)",62
40,Mr ROBERT,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"It is somewhat ironic that the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 is being introduced into the House at a time of record low unemployment across the nation and at a time when we have the lowest level of industrial disputes since records began to be kept over 100 years ago. Indeed, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made it very clear that in the early 1990s more than 1½ million days were lost due to industrial disputation. In recent it has virtually gone to nil. This bill has been brought into parliament at a time when real wages have increased by almost 20 per cent, with accompanying increases in productivity, over the preceding decade. Furthermore, the bill has been introduced at a time when Australia has eclipsed other nations-notably Brazil-with large mineral reserves. Australia is now a preferred mineral trading partner. At such a time, with economic prominence on our side, this bill is being introduced. For the government to claim brazenly that these achievements owe nothing to the flexibility and the stability of our industrial tions system, including the use of individual agreements, is naive and, in all probability, dogmatic. To adequately reply to economic challenges, flexibility in the workplace is fundamental. A hallmark of this requisite flexibility is the concept of an individual agreement, which has been a vital element of employment agreements in this country for almost a decade. The Deputy Prime Minister said in her second reading speech that individual agreements are an unnecessary element of a modern industrial relations system. She further had the effrontery-and, dare I say, the industrial ignorance-to state, in reference to abolishing all individual agreements, that higher productivity and lower inflation would follow. Au contraire, Deputy Prime Minister! One could argue that Cuba's dictatorial left-wing President has left the building and perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister's outdated ideology could follow out the same door. For the Deputy Prime Minister to state that tightening labour markets, reducing industrial flexibility and almost guaranteeing unfettered union involvement in future industrial relations will increase productivity and lower inflation is simply absurd. I think the Deputy Prime Minister has got carried away with her active verbs. She should have stood up and told the truth plainly and used the words ‘lower productivity and increase inflation'. But clearly I do not live on planet Gillard-and nor, frankly, do the bulk of businesses. Individuals must be free to enter into an agreement with an employer. The big question is: why is this right being denied by the government? Why can't a worker organise an agreement with an employer that suits both of their circumstances-unencumbered by a third party, such as a union, or a third party instrument, such as an award? Any argument that individual agreements are somehow inherently evil just because they allow relathe bargaining away of entitlements for higher wages is clearly defeated, as many union collective agreements have done exactly the same thing. The question is: what is the difference between the union collective agreement and the individual agreement? The answer: union involvement. This bill is not about individual agreements; it is about the individual being involved without the strong-arm tactics of the union. The deputy opposition leader made it very clear that Work Choices is no longer opposition policy. The government have touted in preceding weeks that they want this bill through parliament in just four weeks. This leaves little to be desired. Four weeks is not nearly enough time to conduct any sort of rigorous detailed economic modelling for a substantive change of this nature-a change that seeks to strip out the very flexibility that has led to record low unemployment and a record low level of industrial disputation. This bill seeks to reverse in excess of 10 years of modernisation of the Australian workplace. It is clear, however, how strongly the government feel about the importance of this ‘back to the future' approach. It is astounding then that the government do not even want to endeavour to ensure that the amendment is economically sound. The government would have you believe this bill is about workers getting their fair share of rights in the negotiation processes between employees and employers, but may I suggest that this bill has potentially greater consequences. It will have the potential to put inflationary pressures upon the Australian economy in a time of increasing interest rate pressure, as the Reserve Bank exercises its monetary policy. It will allow for unfettered wage breakouts in the absence of productivity gains. It will reduce the willingness of employers to expand their employee levels, with a consequential increase to unemployment in the long run. The risk of rushing such changes to our workplace relations system is significant, and changes to the way we interact with our employers and employees frankly deserve greater respect-more so than a hastened process in the name of political expediency. May I suggest quite strongly that if the government cared so much about working families as their rhetoric suggests, they would encourage the greatest level of scrutiny of this bill and might indeed express some gratitude towards the scrutineers. I strongly contend that a stringent Senate inquiry is the best way to apply this level of scrutiny, in fairness to the working Australians who will be impacted by the government's rushed approach to this bill. It is fundamental and indeed sound economic sense that proper modelling and proper economic reasoning be applied to the assessment of this bill. Labor's transition bill seeks to allow extant individual agreements to run their course for up to five years from their signing. It will also allow a second type of individual agreement, an individual transitional employment agreement, or ITEA, to be created for new or existing employees for up to two years. These ITEAs are set to expire universally on 31 December 2009, for those organisations that already use individual agreements. ITEAs will be subject to Labor's no disadvantage test, a test that is supported. The move to create ITEAs has the potential to provide business with some of the flexibility that it requires to allow projects be completed within suitable horizons, yet a maximum of two years is far too short. Frankly, anyone who has ever owned and operated a business knows this only too well. Furthermore, the creation of ITEAs is only allowed for organisations that have extant individual agreements within their employment structures. It does not cater for new organisations developing and looking for flexibility. This is a bill that looks backwards and not forwards. The coalition is seeking to make ITEAs last for five years, simply to provide the degree of certainty for employers and employees that is needed for long-term, diverse projects. Employers cannot operate with a less than two-year level of certainty and a less than two-year horizon on their employment structures. The expansion of businesses that currently use individual agreements will be impeded by the relatively short period of certainty afforded by ITEAs while the government looks to develop its new awards structure. I warned in my first speech of the dark spectre of union involvement cresting the horizon of Australian businesses. Already, the unions are promoting ‘rights' in the draft National Employment Standards such as the ability to take sick leave apparently without a medical certificate and to take advantage of a whole range of other leave provisions. It is of great concern that Labor's new National Employment Standards and some of the elements of the transition bill have the potential to increase the total cost of employment without providing for productivity gains. This equals higher inflation in any sound economic text. Increasing costs to businesses will feed into higher prices and add to inflationary pressures that will put pressure on monetary policy and hence interest rates. These changes therefore necessitate rigorous to scrutiny-the scrutiny of a Senate inquiry. Labor does not have a mandate to put the economic welfare of Australian families at risk. It fails to empathise with the struggles of employers or to understand that some businesses will not be able to cope with higher costs. Employers in Australia are not all large, faceless publicly owned corporations listed on the stock market. In many cases, they are family businesses, small retailers and service providers. They are sole proprietors who are out not to suppress workers but to follow their dream of setting up a business and building a future for their families. Fifty per cent of employees in this great country are employed by small businesses so, before this reckless government sets out on a warpath against small businesses, it should at least do them the courtesy of having a Senate inquiry. My electorate of Fadden, together with the other two great Gold Coast seats of Moncrieff and MCPherson, is the small business capital of the nation. There are over 11,000 individual agreements in Fadden. The percentage of individuals in Fadden on individual agreements is higher than the national average. This is an agreement between an employer and an employee. This is an agreement between the corner shop owner and the people who come to work that meets all of their requirements. This is an agreement for those in the highly competitive boat-building industry to allow for longer shifts but higher pay which fits in with the workers' requirements and what they are able to do. This is about small business people who run newspaper shops, outlets and private services firms. This is about agreements with employees that meet employee circumstances in a rapidly changing 24-hour world. We cannot put the livelihood of these small business people at risk. This bill needs extensive investigation. The consequences of this bill need to be understood. The unintended consequences-which, may I suggest, the government has not even begun to consider-need to be thrashed out within the construct of a Senate inquiry. A reduction in workplace flexibility and a return to mandatory collective agreements will increase the rate of strike action. It will increase the risk of the type of wage and inflation break-out that drove the economy into recession in the seventies, eighties and nineties. Frankly, I find it staggering that the Labor government has rejected an offer from the opposition to schedule an additional two Senate sitting weeks in the first half of this year to expedite the Senate inquiry process. Rather than seeking to bully the Senate into rubber-stamping her legislation, the Deputy Prime Minister should respect democratic processes and ask the Prime Minister to schedule additional Senate sitting days. I understand that a militant union movement wants its pound of flesh. I understand that a militant union movement wants a return on investment for the money it has poured into the Labor coffers. I understand that a militant union movement is agitating for what it wants for getting this government into power. But we must note that, for the majority of businesses using individual agreements, though they will be permitted to use the new ITEAs-the new individual agreements-the two-year period is too short. It needs to be five years to provide the proper economic horizon those businesses need, irrespective of militant union demands. I clearly reserve the right to fight for new organisations to have the right to enter into individual agreements, noting of course that they will abide by the 10 National Employment Standards. The bill is rushed. It needs sound economic modelling. It needs to take account of the full gamut of intended and unintended consequences. It needs to go to a Senate inquiry. A reduction in workplace flexibility and a return to mandatory collective agreements will increase the number of strikes and the type of wage and inflation break-out that drove the economy into recession over the previous three decades. Only by maintaining individual agreements with a strong five-year horizon will this be averted.",62
41,Ms KING,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise today in support of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008. In following the member for Fadden, I note that, whilst he is a new member in this place, I was here for the initial debate on the Work Choices legislation and I remember the lack of economic modelling, the lack of transparency, the failure of the government to inform the electorate during the election that it was introducing this extreme industrial relations reform to the Australian public and the guillotining of the legislation through this place. I think the position is being extended far more courtesy on this bill than we were on the Work Choices legislation when we were in opposition. This bill keeps our promise to the electorate to abolish the Howard government's extreme industrial relations laws. This bill keeps our promise to establish a fair and anced industrial relations system here in this country-one that protects the rights of Australian workers and helps to grow the economy. In November 2005 I stood in this House and condemned the previous government's introduction of Work Choices, one for which they had no mandate. The legislation that the previous government passed through this House crossed a hundred years of a fair and balanced industrial relations system in Australia. That legislation was not given appropriate time for debate. There was no transparency about it and there was little scrutiny. As I said before, the debate was guillotined in this House and there was certainly little courtesy given through the Senate. Work Choices had absolutely nothing to do with reform. Work Choices was one party's ideological obsession, and despite the backflip on supporting this legislation I am still not convinced that given just half a chance the Liberal Party would not do it all over again. Work Choices was not about boosting productivity or increasing employment levels. It was nothing more than the most extreme attack on working families that this country had ever seen. The laws that were introduced back in 2005 undermined the pay and conditions of hard working Australians. Not only that but they undermined family life. The previous government was willing to sell out the Australian people based on its own self-centred ideological obsession. It sucked money out of the public purse with its taxpayer funded propaganda campaign-and we saw the mouse pads here opyesterday in the House. The previous government did everything in its power to avoid public scrutiny on Work Choices and to avoid telling the truth about these laws, refusing to release statistics on AWAs and refusing to tell how it had stripped out many conditions for working families. Haven't things changed! A few years on bal- and things can change. I can think of two great examples that we have seen recently that show the Liberal Party seem to have changed their support in relation to Work Choices. We saw the first example of a change in attitude within the Liberal Party on Four Corners just recently. On Four Corners this week it was compelling to see how out of touch the previous government actually were when it came to industrial relations. Let me quote a passage from Four Corners. The member for North Sydney, Joe Hockey, stated on Four Corners: Quite frankly when I took ... the jobof Minister for Employment and Workplace RelationsI don't think many ministers in Cabinet were aware that you could be worse off under Work Choices and that you could actually have certain conditions taken away without compensation. And once I started to raise those issues with colleagues and they became more informed about the impact of Work Choices we introduced the fairness test. What is debate in parliament about? Surely, members of the government who stood in this place supporting Work Choices would have informed themselves about the impact. Surely, ministers who all voted for Work Choices would have informed themselves of its impact. Case after case after case was raised here in this parliament during question time that demonstrated the impact of Work Choices-the stripping of penalty rates and award conditions out of Australian workplace agreements for little or no compensation. You would think they would have known. The previous federal election also sent a clear message on Work Choices. That was sent on 24 November 2007 when the Australian people voted for a new approach. The message could not have been clearer. The Australian people understood that Work Choices would leave them worse off and they resoundingly voted against the government that introduced it. They voted against Work Choices and against AWAs. The government made a clear, unequivocal commitment to the Australian people late last yeara commitment to restore fairness in the workplace to families across Australia. Australia's workplace relations laws needed a new approach. In electorates across the try, Labor Party candidates were selling our message, as I did within my own electorate of Ballarat. The Australian people were well aware that by voting for a Rudd government they were voting for a new workplace relations system. The vote is in and now in this parliament we see many, many new facesfaces that are here today because they stood for office with the party that is willing to work with the Australian people on industrial relations policy. They stood up for families that demanded their government give them a fair go within their workplaces. The bill we are debating in the House today keeps Labor's promise. It keeps faith with our promise during the election campaign. With the introduction of the bill, restoring fairness to the workplace relations system has begun. This bill will amend the Workplace Relations Act with the abolishment of Australian workplace agreements. This bill will amend the act to return fairness to workers whose pay and conditions were stripped by Howard's legacy, and it will abolish the Howard government's so-called fairness test and implement a genuine no disadvantage test for all workplace agreements. Under this proposed legislation there will be no new AWAs. The bill prevents the making of new AWAs from the date of commencement. The Rudd Labor government believes that in a strong industrial relations system there is no need for AWAs. The Rudd Labor government believes that all Australian employees are entitled to a safety net. That safety net comprises 10 National Employment Standards. The National Employment Standards will provide simplicity, fairness and flexibility for all employees. And we will provide this without the administrative burden that has developed through Work Choices. The National Employment Standards include: maximum weekly hours of work; requests by parents for flexible coun- working arrangements-something I am about to become a little more interested in, I guess, not that I was not before; parental leave and other entitlements; annual leave; personal and carers leave and compassionate leave; community service leave; long service leave; public holidays; notice of termination and redundancy; and fair work information statements. Our standards outline the required safety net that all employees deserve. AWAs overrode the safety net, and that is why I back this bill 100 per cent. By implementing a new modern safety net, there is no need for AWAs or any form of statutory individual employment agreements. There is no need because the expectations of employers are met fairly in a way that is flexible for employees. But we will not forget about those people that are currently on AWAs. We acknowledge the concerns that some of them may have. The Rudd Labor government has created a special instrument for employees on AWAs, to make a smooth transition to the government's new workplace relations system. A special instrument called an individual transitional employment agreement, or an ITEA, is proposed in this bill and will be available to employers who employed an employee on an AWA as at December 2007. Such employers may use this instrument for new employees or for existing employees who are currently subject to an Australian workplace agreement. These individual transitional employment agreements will have a nominal expiry date of no later than 31 December 2009. After this date, Labor will have introduced its National Employment Standards and a modern, simple award system. This is a reasonable transition for employers and employees to Labor's new industrial relations system. After this date, employers will have no reason to want to access any form of individual statutory employment contract. It is also important to learn from the mistakes of the previous government. It is important to ensure our system does not disadvantage hard working Australians. Interestingly, the member for North Sydney also is on record as saying that once he started to raise the issue with colleagues and they became more informed of the impact of Work Choices-again, a bill that had already been debated in this House, that they had already voted on-they then introduced the fairness test. But this so-called fairness test was not fair. The fairness test was not fair because provided no proper protection for some award conditions and zero protection for others. The fairness test will not apply in the future. The test also created a backlog of agreements piled up waiting for the checks. This bill will end the compliance problem and create a more streamlined industrial relations system. Under our new proposal, there will be a new no disadvantage test. The no disadvantage test will cover all individual and collective workplace agreements. To pass our proposed no disadvantage test, ITEAs cannot disadvantage an employee against an applicable collective agreement or, where there is no collective agreement, an applicable award and the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. The test is a reflection of the Rudd Labor government's commitment to working Australians across this country. As it stands, when a workplace agreement is lodged with the Workplace Authority it is required to pass the fairness test, for below a certain level. A failed fairness test can result in a costly compensation payment for employers. This will change once the elements of this bill become law. Under our proposed transition arrangements, ITEAs for new collective agreements and for existing employees will not begin until the Workplace Authority director has seen that they actually pass the no disadvantage test. A Rudd Labor government has also proposed in this bill to repeal the provision of Work Choices that enabled employers to unilaterally terminate a collective workplace agreement-agreements that, once past their nominal expiry date, could give employers power to return staff to a limited number of standards, standards that in some cases were un-Australian and simply unfair. This government has no choice but to repeal this section of Work Choices. By doing so, we ensure that our proposed ITEAs will meet our it national employment standards and leave no room for loopholes. Another simple yet important change which we have introduced in this legislation is the requirement for employers to provide a copy of the workplace relations fact sheet to their employees-something we were also required to do. Businesses I have spoken to have said that this was just another one of many administrative burdens that had no real purpose for an employer or in fact an employee. Requiring employers to provide a fact sheet on workplace relations was nothing more than a last-minute attempt by the Howard government to sell their Work Choices package. It was unnecessary and it will stop. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will also have the responsibility of checking those pre-Work Choices certified agreements that wish to be extended. The commission will have the power to grant any application made for an extension, so long as it is satisfied that both employer and employee agree with the terms of the arrangement. The bill implements sensible transitional arrangements, phasing out of the former government's Work Choices legislation while requiring flexibility and transparency. During the last federal election, this ernment also gave a promise to the Australian people that we would create a new modern award system. This new modern award system is a must if we wish to have a fair and balanced safety net for all employees. The bill that I support today comes good on that election promise. This bill allows for modernisation of awards-modern awards that protect entitlements such as penalty rates and overtime, awards that ensure a fair safety net, awards that ensure minimum award entitlements and awards that allow flexible working arrangements. The opposition's position on this bill remains to me unclear. The opposition has a choice not only in this chamber but in both chambers to support this bill, to support the mandate given to this government by the Australian people at the last election to abolish Work Choices. Many of us watched that somewhat excruciating press conference yesterday from the opposition spokeswoman the announcing that the Liberal Party have now somehow seen the light and will support the bill in the House, if their amendments do not go through. Despite the fact that the opposition controls the Senate, the opposition spokeswoman was still unclear about what they would do in the Senate, getting bogged down in Senate procedural matters rather than making a clear, unequivocal commitment that they would let these bills pass unamended through both the House and the Senate. Working families needs these laws passed. The Rudd Labor government stand firm on our industrial relations policy. All Australians know our position-they knew it before the election. Our position to abolish Work Choices and to eliminate Howard's ideological legacy of AWAs has always stood firm. This week has been another interesting week from the opposition in relation to its govposition on Work Choices. It is no wonder the party opposite had trouble understanding Work Choices, the legislation it introduced, because at present they seem to be having trouble finding a position on industrial relations overall. First they supported Work Choices and backed AWAs 100 per cent. Then the opposition decide that the so-called fairness test is required, because maybejust maybe-those AWAs that they introduced did actually strip conditions from lowpaid workers. They would not believe any of the cases we introduced into the House during question time but they thought: ‘We've got a problem here, so let's introduce a fairness test.' Then just last week we had the opposition in almost complete denial that they had lost the election, claiming that it had every right to seek the continuation of AWAs and that it would oppose this bill. Now the opposition as of yesterday is supporting the abolition of AWAs in the House-not sure what they will do in the Senate. It is difficult to predict what will happen next. Will the members opposite in the House support Work Choices or is it dead? Does the Liberal Party support it in the House but not in the Senate? We are going to wait and see. The Australian people deserve to know where all members of parliament stand on such important issues. As the Prime Minister said yesterday in question time, the opposition is flip, flop, flapping when it comes to Work Choices. And, if they get back into office, I am not convinced that it will not just be some of the same old tricks again-the same old tricks because the old Howard legacy is still woven into the ideological minds of the Liberal machine. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can tell you for certain today that the Rudd Labor government has a firm position on industrial relations for this country, and this is just the start with bill. This bill represents the view of many Australians and it represents this government's commitment to the Australian people that we took to the election campaign. It is the Rudd Labor government honouring our pact with the Australian people by abolishing Work Choices and unfair Australian workplace agreements. I commend the bill to the House.",66
42,Mr RANDALL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I am very pleased to speak today on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008. We know that, as previous speakers have outlined, this bill seeks to amend the Workplace Relations Act of 1996, make a number of changes to the framework for workplace agreements and enable the process of award modernisation to commence. I am speaking on this bill today because I have a vested interest on behalf of my electorate. Many people would not be aware that in the Canning electorate there are more than 20,000 people on registered individual agreements, AWAs-whatever you want to describe them as. It has one of the highest numbers of people on AWAs in Australia. The highest number of people registered on AWAs in this country is in the electorate of Kalgoorlie, held by my friend Mr Barry Haase. We will examine why this is more of a Western Australian phenomenon in a moment but, suffice to say, the new member for Brand, Gary Gray, has one of the highest numbers of people on AWAs as well-individual agreements that are negotiated in the workplace. For those who think this is all about the mining industry, let me put their minds at rest. In Canning, there is one large miner and it is Alcoa. Interestingly, most of the workers at Alcoa are on union inspired agreements on behalf of the Australian Workers Unionsomething I will tease out further when I get this my address-in-reply speech, because we know that the current member for Maribyrnong had something to do with activity around that area. I will further elaborate on that later. The fact is that many contractors around Alcoa are on individual flexible agreements. So the workers at Alcoa are not, but the contractors in and around the area are. But the greater number of people that are on flexible agreements in the Canning electorate are not in mining; they are in areas like hospitality, construction, customer service, the tourism sector and even local government. I say to the journalists who stop us at the door in the morning on a regular basis: most of the journalists in this country are on individual agreements or AWAs. Many of them have said to me just privately, ‘Gee, I don't want my flexible awards and conditions being disrupted by the interference on behalf of the unions by the Rudd Labor government.' But let us talk more about the bill before the House today. This bill is designed to remove Australian workplace agreements from the industrial relations scene of this country. The government want them terminated as an industrial instrument. In her second reading speech, Minister Gillard announced that from 13 February 2008 the Australian Public Service would no longer offer AWAs. That is because she can do that. Why has the Australian Public Service been singled out? The reason is that it is heavily unionised. We know that most of the public service organisations in this country have almost 100 per cent union membership, so it is pretty easy to do it at that sort of workplace. But we also know that in this country less than 17 per cent of people in the non-public sector have decided to be a member of a union. For my part, I used to be a union rep when I was a schoolteacher. I see the role of the union often to be quite constructive in terms of bargaining on behalf of their members when there are issues in the workplace. But when the unions decide to become political operatives, as they have done over the last few years, and inject themselves into the workplace purely for craven political reasons then they have gone beyond their brief. They are not there for the workers; they are there for themselves. Most of the union bosses, if they are not in this place, are out there as hereditary peers of the Labor Party, feathering their own nests. How many union bosses do you ever see sitting in cattle class? They are mostly up in the front of the planes while their workers are sitting towards the tail. Mr Griffin-Sitting next to you!",70
43,Mr RANDALL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"And sitting with the member opposite as well. Would you deny that? They are sitting with you as well. When the workers go on strike, do the union bosses go on strike? No. There is one rule for the union bosses and there is one rule for the workers. The union bosses use the workers as fodder to get themselves into a place like this. This place has become a retirement village for former union bosses. Let us go through them. We have the member for Batman; previously we had Bob Hawke, a former member for Wills; we have Simon Crean, the member for Hotham; the member for Throsby; and the member for Charlton. This is the progression of the union bosses. Eventually their retirement package is to come here. I wonder if Sharan Burrow will make her way here eventually and that will be her reward. The reason this bill has been so passionately sought as the first item of business is that the union organisations not only put the members opposite here through their preselections but they also then decide what those members can do or say in this place. The first order of bidding in this House is because the unions having paid a very big price to get the Labor Party into office in this country. The figures vary from $30 million to $50 million. We know that, in individual electorates, unions placed so-called research officers, who were just people on the ground. For example, the former member for Petrie, Teresa Gambaro, told me that a union in her electorate had people there for months and months acting as extra officers on the ground. I wonder if the general union membership knew that that was where their union dues were going-to involvement in a political campaign at that level. She tells me that, in the last few weeks of the campaign, public servants from Queensland were given two weeks leave to go and work street corners and doorknock on behalf of the union to unseat her. And they were successful. There is no doubt about it: the unions were woken up and they gathered together in a very strong force. They worked very much in marginal seats and we saw the effect that they had-except in Western Australia, and that is where I will return to, cause it is my responsibility to outline the case there. One of the reasons Western Australia had such a good result at the last election was that so many people on AWAs were happy with their lot. A former Labor senator, John Black, in an article in the Australian newspaper pointed out the correlation between individual workplace agreements and voting intentions. One of the reasons is that people who can strike an individual agreement generally get a better deal. We heard the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and many other portfolios in this place yesterday talking about entitlements being removed from people when they took on AWAs. What she dishonestly did not say was that, when they agreed-and I emphasise the word ‘agreed', because nobody could be made to take an AWA or an individual agreement; they chose to-to go on an individual agreement, they did so knowing that they would get a better deal. So, if they traded off some spurious things like picnic days-there was an award for picnics-for higher wages, what is the matter with that? In fact, I am aware of workplaces in Western Australia-bakeries, for example-where the casual workers were saying, ‘Could you take away some of those holiday entitlements from us, because we're students and we actually want more money in our hands today because we want to pay the bills and be able to live a lifestyle today rather than at the end receive a lump sum.' Ultimately people had a choice. This is what we as the former government were able to give the people of Australia: choice. The choice was theirs alone and they could choose to get themselves a better deal. But the Labor Party, even today, will dishonestly continue to tell you that things were stripped away and people were made to do things and they were worse off. At the end of the day, be- people received more money. One of the incongruous things about this bill, which I will return to in a moment, is the $100,000 limit. What the Labor Party and the minister have done-and I think it is quite good, actually, even surprising-is, in place of the individual agreements that were on offer as AWAs, put in this bill the individual transitional employment agreements or ITEAs. ITEAs are for people who are currently on individual agreements and want to continue on them when they expire. People who are not now on any form of agreement as such will not be able to sign on to an ITEA. In fact, they will end up on a union inspired collective agreement. One of the things the minister has done with the ITEAs-and, believe me, I must commend the minister on this-is that she has actually put in place what we consider to be a very good safety net or no disadvantage test. That is good for workers because, if you cannot be worse off, your only choice is to be better off if you choose to be on an individual agreement. If you choose to be better off and stay on an ITEA, that is good-there is nothing wrong with that. From that point of view, we would like to see the ITEAs. As has already been said, we will be voting for this in this House-there will be no opposition to that at all. The minister is going to put to the House an amendment which will extend ITEAs from two years to five years. People will say, ‘Why five years?' Because currently in a state like mine, Western Australia, there are people still able to sign on to an AWA which will run for five years. Why not have the synergy for people who would like to continue on an award that is struck today to continue for another five years? We know they are not all bad when we see companies like Telstra, the Commonwealth Bank and Australia Post continuing to offer their workers AWAs. Of course we must again explain that these people are offered AWAs as a choice. It is not mandatory; you cannot make them. It is as a choice. Why would people choose an AWA? Because they can tailor their job to a more flexible arrangement and get more money by trading off things that they do not deem necessary in their particular contract which would remain under an inflexible award. This legislation, as I said, is something that we have agreed to. We know that the ITEAs will be tested by the Workplace Authority director and will then take effect as long as there is no lessening of conditions and we know, if people tried to offer lesser conditions, that under the legislation before us there would be penalties and remedies for non-compliance, so that way forward is good. But I now refer to the fact that, in today's Australian, Alan Wood, the Economics Editor, has placed on record his concern about the way forward under the Labor Party in terms of workplace relations. He lists a number of motherhood statements made by the minister. They are all altruistic and very good, but in the end the fact is that the Labor Party will probably be unable to do any of this because of their exposure to and their compromising by the unions. I have listened to a lot of first speeches by those opposite. I have been impressed by the quality of members that I have met on both sides. But there are obviously some standout members-we know the member for Charlton, Greg Combet. I listened to his first speech and I congratulated him on it afterwards. He is a very articulate and obviously well-versed person, particularly in his area of expertise, and that is workplace relations. What he did say which struck a chord with me was that, when the unions ran their scare campaign against Work Choices, within six weeks of running this very expensive campaign they had 60 per cent of the Australian people in their corner. This demonstrates that this scare campaign, like the ones the Labor Party ran previously on GST and the privatisation of Telstra-and you will notice they are not talking about rolling back any of that-really bit. At the end of the day, I will agree-and this is why we are agreeing to this-maybe the previous amendments made in 2006 were too bold in the fact that they did not provide the safety net and the fairness test that people were concerned about. It was not only the workers-it was their parents and their families-that were convinced by this advertising campaign. That is why we are going to support this way forward. In terms of people in my electorate and even in the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate, it is interesting that this legislation allows flexibility for people on over $100,000. In my state-and it is probably why people are happy and wanted to see the flexible arrangements provided by the previous government continue, so that is the way they voted at the last election-there are many people on over $100,000. You do not have to be a wealthy mining executive to get that. There are truck drivers, steel fixers and sheet metal workers in the Pilbara who are on well over $100,000. So you are going to have two classes of people. I put out a press release before the last election, and it is relevant today, saying that the electors in Canning-and, I would say, the rest of Australia-were going to be unfairly treated because those on under $100,000 could be excused for missing out on the ‘fair' part of Labor's Forward with Fairness policy. What happens to the aspirational worker who wants to earn more than $100,000? If he does not get there, he is then being dragooned into the inflexible award arrangement-the union inspired agreement-that has been put before him or her. This is typical of the ideology of the Labor Party: ‘We not only want to take over your workplace; we want to drive down your wages and corral you into an inflexible agreement.' As we know, the previous government was able to increase real wages for workers by over 23 per cent in the 11½ years it was in government. The previous Hawke-Keating government bragged about driving wages down and they only increased wages by less than two per cent. On one hand, you have one side of politics wanting to see real wage and productivity increases and, on the other, you have the other side wanting to control the worker so that they get a worse deal-as long as they control them; that is the endgame here. They want to control and dragoon the workforce so that it is ‘one size fits At the end of the day, the Australian people will judge this government on reducing the flexibility of the workforce. One of the reasons why Australia is one of the model economies of the world is that we have historically low unemployment and low inflation. We hear them screaming about inflation, and the fact is that we have never had inflation above three per cent. It was the skill of the previous government in all that time that kept inflation low while still having low unemployment. Very few governments ever have low unemployment and low inflation. Generally there are peaks and troughs that go with unemployment and interest rates, because they cannot control them. This was done not only because we reformed the taxation system but also because we reformed the workforce so that it would be more flexible and more productive. As Alan Wood says in his article today, at the end of the day this will not be done with the existing award system and there will be no gain without real pain. That is where we are heading with workplace relations under Labor-a lot of pain.",71
44,Ms GRIERSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise to support the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008, which is the first step in abolishing the former government's unfair and extreme Work Choices laws. I have just heard the member for Canning speak on this bill and I must take him to task on one comment, and it is a fairly salient point when you look at the former government's inability to understand just what Work Choices did to people. He mentioned my colleague the member for Charlton, Greg Combet, and his maiden speech. Mr Combet said that, after the ACTU's advertising campaign, 60 per cent of the public were very much behind the campaign. The member for Canning said that that represents the power all'. of scaremongering. It was not a scaremongering campaign. When 60 per cent of Australians switch on because of an advertising campaign, it is because the campaign links into their real beliefs and experiences and to their understanding of the threat to their livelihoods. That is why that campaign was so successful-because out there millions of workers around Australia identified with those sorts of threats and insecurities and they did not want it to happen, not just to them but to their kids, their family members, their neighbours and their friends. So I congratulate the ACTU and my new colleague Greg Combet on the work they did. It is absolutely undeniable that three months ago, on 24 November 2007, the Australian people voted a resounding no to Work Choices. In doing so, they voted for change and elected a Rudd Labor government-a government that takes its mandate for change and for abolishing Work Choices in particular very seriously. With this bill the government delivers on a key election commitment that was strongly endorsed at the ballot box. Labor could not have been any clearer about its commitment to getting rid of the Work Choices laws. In December 2006 the caucus elected its new leader and deputy leader of the then opposition, and they both made very clear their promise to abolish AWAs and restore fairness to the workplace relations tem. In April last year Labor released its Forward with Fairness policy, which again made clear that, if elected, Labor would abolish Australian workplace agreements. Six months ago, Labor released its Forward with Fairness implementation plan, which set out the sensible transitional arrangements a Rudd Labor government would adopt for implementing our promise to abolish AWAs. Throughout the whole of last year every member on the government benches campaigned long and hard in our respective torates across Australia to make clear Labor's commitment to get rid of AWAs and introduce a fairer, simpler and more balanced workplace relations system. Unlike those opposite, who never sought a mandate at any election for their extreme Work Choices laws, well before the 2007 election the Australian people were left with no doubt as to Labor's position on Work Choices and our steadfast commitment to abolish AWAs. Getting rid of AWAs and all statutory individual employment agreements has always been central to Labor's workplace relations policy and we could not have been any clearer with the Australian people. That the former government spent more than $60 million of taxpayers' money campaigning against Labor on workplace relations makes clear that members opposite were acutely aware of Labor's policy. Indeed, there was barely a day last year when the former government did not criticise us for our policy position. Day after day they sought to attack Labor for wanting to introduce a fairer, simpler and more balanced workplace relations system in this country. In such a system there is no place for AWAs or any statutory individual employment agreement, since the essence of these agreements is to override the safety net. Labor believes that all Australian employees are entitled to a safety net of 10 national sysemployment standards, and we believe that employees earning less than $100,000 are also entitled to an extra safety net provided by modern simple awards. Yet members opposite continue even today with the charade that AWAs are some kind of panacea for the economy-no matter that the evidence of how AWAs have unashamedly ripped off Australian working families time and time again continues to mount. All is well according to them, but just this morning the shadow minister for workplace relations came into elec- the House and foreshadowed an amendment to this bill in the hope of extending the life of AWAs and keeping Work Choices alive just that little bit longer. It is so hard for them. Apparently death by a thousand lashes is their preferred option for working families. Such tactics are nothing more than a deliberate attempt to deny the Australian people what they voted for. Members opposite treat the Australian people with contempt. When are they going to accept that Labor has a mandate to abolish AWAs and put in place a fairer, simpler and more balanced workplace relations system? That is, of course, what this bill sets out to do: it implements our transitional arrangements and it prevents the making of new AWAs from the date of the bill's commencement. Despite the former government doing its best to hide the facts about AWAs, Australian working families have felt their impact over the last couple of years and they have rejected them. Eighty-nine per cent of AWAs did cut at least one protected award condition. Eightythree per cent removed two protected award conditions. Fifty-two per cent removed more than half, six or more, protected award conditions. Sixty-eight per cent excluded annual leave loading. Sixty-three per cent excluded penalty rates. Seventy per cent excluded shift loadings. Unfortunately, there were stories our media around Australia every day that illustrated these examples. In my own area in the Hunter, I have a quote from April of a Rutherford tow-bar fitter who was sacked for requesting light duties after incurring a work injury-one of the victims of Work Choices. I know of two cases where workers were threatened to be sacked if they asked for time off to attend the birth of their childrenthese were fathers, of course. Those sorts of cases are what alarmed the Australian public. Those sorts of real experiences certainly contime vinced the Australian public that they did want Work Choices. The impact of the Work Choices legislation was particularly harsh on women in the workforce. Analysis last year showed that less than 20 per cent of AWAs contained family friendly provisions, and, meanwhile, women on AWAs working a 38-hour week earned almost $90 a week less than those on collective agreements. Last October, a report from the New South Wales Office for Women compiled data from the Newcastle community legal centre and other Sydney branches and it stated that female employees were definitely more vulnerable under Work Choices. The report found an instance of a woman having her hours severely cut after revealing to her boss that she was pregnant. Another woman was pressured to sign an Australian workplace agreement that would have cut her hourly rate from $17 to $12, and instead she gave up the job. Of the 220 employment cases handled by the community legal centres, it was found that half of the women dismissed without warning were no longer protected by unfair dismissal laws. I congratulate community legal centres. I know what a great assistance they are to people not just in employment disputes but with disabilities and specific social needs as well. As the first woman to represent the federal in seat of Newcastle, I am very pleased to support the Deputy Prime Minister, the first woman to hold that position and the first woman in Australia to be Acting Prime Minister, who has introduced such an important bill, which will help working women. So, for all Australians, the sooner that no new AWAs are signed the better. Upon commencement of this bill, no new AWAs will be signed. It is with some amusement, I suppose, that we all watched the backflip performed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition before question yesterday. I still remain confused as to not her position, having heard an interview with her this morning on ABC radio and then seeing her in the House earlier. Confusion is definitely alive and well in the ranks of the opposition. I do welcome the fact that the opposition have finally decided not to keep Work Choices alive in its entirety for as long as they possibly could and will be supporting some of this legislation. I think some of those opposite-perhaps like the member for Paterson, who suffered swings of up to 15 per cent from working families in his electorate and barely held on to his seat-will perhaps be considering their options a little more carefully when it comes to such legislation. In my own electorate, 40 per cent who responded to a survey were particularly concerned about Work Choices. They will be pleased today. One of them told me: My employer changed the title of my position, added additional responsibilities and reduced my monthly pay by 10 per cent. Another constituent said: I have been offered a lower paying job along with 71 other staff. I am choosing to leave the company and dread facing new conditions in the workforce. Yet another constituent said: I had to sign a contract for employment which was 20 to 30 pages long, and I did not really derstand it. It also stated the employer could me go with 24 hours notice. Another person, from Hamilton said: Since this contract has been put in place, my pay has dropped significantly for sick day and holiday inclusions. And a constituent from Lambton said: My 18-year-old daughter was given casual work, only to find her AWA includes no penalty rates weekends. Young people do not have the knowledge to be able to understand what they are ing. That is exactly why the Australian public responded so well to the ACTU campaign. This is what was happening to them, their children and their family members. Fortunately, this legislation is the first in the coffin of Work Choices and the Australian people will take it out on the opposition if they refuse to join us in hammering that nail. I join the Deputy Prime Minister in calling on the opposition to help us get this legislation through the House and through the Senate by Easter. The bill does introduce sensible transitional arrangements to allow employers and employees who have been using AWAs to prepare for the full implementation of our new system in January 2010. Employers using AWAs as at 1 December 2007 will be able to offer individual transitional employment agreements, ITEAs, to existing employees on AWAs and to new employees. Importantly, ITEAs may not be used to strip existing employees off their collective agreements. The bill also extends the operation of transitional arrangements such as NAPSAs until the commencement of Labor's new workplace relations system. The bill also abolishes the previous government's so-called fairness test-I remember that fairness test; my goodness! All the advertising money in the world just could not sell that sham. It also establishes a true no disadvantage test for all workplace agreeun- ments. For ITEAs, the no disadvantage test is let applied against an applicable collective agreement in the workplace or, if there is no such agreement, against an applicable award. Certified agreements will generally continue to operate in accordance with the current rules. They may no longer be terminated unilaterally following the nominal expiry date on 90 days notice, unless the AIRC is satisfor fied that the termination is not contrary to the public interest. Pre Work Choices certified sign- agreements can be varied and extended by agreement, so parties to those agreements can avoid a double transition. The bill also establishes the process to create new, modern awards by 31 December 2009 that are simple and easy to understand nail and apply. Together with the National Employment Standards, the awards will form an integral part of the safety net for working Australians under the government's new system. The Australian Fair Pay Commission will perform only the annual review of minimum wages, as any other exercise in relation to pay scales and minimum wages will interfere with the AIRC's award modernisation process. I have great confidence in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's ability to harmonise and modernise our award systems. The government has already started consultation on the National Employment Standards, which will be the 10 key minimum entitlements for all Australian employees and will apply from 1 January 2010. This consultation is a refreshing change from the former government, which did not consult key stakeholder groups about Work Choices, let alone consult the Australian people at any election. This bill also removes the obligation on employers-quite a burdensome one-to hand out the former government's workplace relations fact sheet. This obligation was really part of the former government's hard sell on Work Choices. They spent $122 million in taxpayer funds on advertising trying to sell Work Choices. I was pleased to see the last of those pamphlets being pulped on Monday. Sadly, those mouse pads discovered yesterday still need a home, and who knows what else we will find? Perhaps the former government could have directed their information campaign-as they called it-to their own cabinet. After all, we did discover on Four Corners on Monday night that many of them, including the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Joe Hockey, did not even know the detail of Work Choices. Perhaps they could have saved some money by sending a memo to cabinet rather than printing hundreds of thousands of mouse pads and pamphlets. More broadly, this government is committed to reducing the waste associated with the former administration's advertising excesses. This includes asking the Auditor-General to approve advertising or information campaigns with a budget of more than $250,000 and to verify that they are not political and provide essential public information. It is something we will all welcome. In speaking on this legislation and considering the hardship that employment uncertainty creates for working men and women with children, I digress and take this opportunity to draw to the attention of the House the recent job losses within the steel industry in my electorate of Newcastle. Certainly, these workers are on collective agreements. The Hunter is the region with the highest take-up of collective agreements in Australia. We have a very cooperative relationship between our employers, unions and workers. After the closure of BHP and the end of steel making in Newcastle, OneSteel was demerged from BHP and continued a significant presence in Newcastle, particularly in the manufacturing of steel and metal products. At the time, it was evident that OneSteel had been spun off with poor capital equipment and limited capital for investment. I do pay tribute to the OneSteel workers and management, particularly Geoff Plumber, who worked cooperatively to build OneSteel into the successful company it has become. Last year when OneSteel, seeking efficiencies and ways to increase its competitiveness, merged with Smorgon Steel, the pain for Newcastle began again. Plants were rationalised and of course the first ones to go were those older plants in Newcastle, the same plants that kicked off the business growth and success that OneSteel has enjoyed in recent years. That particularly hurts. Last year, OneSteel announced the closure of the pipe and tube plant, with a loss of 240 jobs. Last week, OneSteel announced the closure of its bar mill at Mayfield, with a projected loss of a further 220 jobs. I am told the former Smorgon-Comsteel bar mill will absorb 40 of these workers. Of course, some of the older workers may see the redundancy offer as a favourable early retirement option. But 440 working families have had to face uncertainty regarding their future employment and have had to make decisions, hoping their choice will be the right one for their family's long-term financial security. I know that OneSteel will ensure that all workers' entitlements are paid in full, and I know that our government will ensure that Centrelink and the Job Network are ready to give maximum assistance to these workers and their families. I am also aware that in the first round of job cuts 80 per cent of those who actually left OneSteel found alternative employment. So there is a market in our manufacturing sector for skilled workers. I sincerely hope that the workers currently facing redundancies will also find satisfying and long-term employment. The closures at OneSteel will have further implications. It seems that OneSteel will cease making a certain spring steel in a particular bar size from 2009. This product is used in spring making by manufacturers in Newcastle, Adelaide and Queensland. It is used by Bradken in iron ore wagons in the Pilbara. It is used by the mining industry and I know there is concern amongst these manufacturers that they will not be able to access this product. I am asking on the record for OneSteel to clarify whether this latest closure will mean the loss of this product. I am sure that when the merger was looked at by the previous government and its agencies there would have been some assurances that products would still be available to local manufacturers. It would be a great pity if these closures and restructures by OneSteel saw our local manufacturers forced to import raw bars from China or India. I am told there is a world shortage of this material and that there will be problems in assuring a supply of the grade and quality that is required. So I do ask OneSteel to clarify that situation for me. I also hope that in the Hunter the unions, my colleagues and I can assist the OneSteel workers into better employment options. I support the legislation before us and congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister on her sterling work in this field. Her clarity is something to marvel at and certainly her ability to put forward this legislation so quickly is something we all take great pride in.",74
45,Mr BROADBENT,WORKPLACE RELATIONS," Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, I am sorry you are leaving the chair at this stage because you were so much a part of the success of the former government. When we hear from the member for Newcastle about the situation she has just raised with the eSteel employees, we know it is the fact the government has been handed a Holden Statesman, state-of-the-art, powerful economy that is going to allow those people who have lost their positions, or who have been made redundant, to go on and get a job. Their skills will be claimed and nurtured by the rest of Newcastle. That would not have been the case before the Howard government came to power. I am reminded that, over these last 10 years, there were those who made constant criticisms of the Howard government. No government will ever go without criticism. Also, it is very easy to be against something-for 10 years, it was very easy for people to be against whatever the Howard government did-but it is very hard to be for something, to look at what could be the best for our community and to chase that down, to look at ways that we can encourage people into the workforce and grow our workforce right across the nation. I cannot forget the power of small businesses as a result of the changes to the industrial relations that we are talking about today. These changes started in the HawkeKeating years and went through into the Howard years. Perhaps the Australian people said at the last election, ‘You've taken them one step too far.' But what we have today is the political reaction. The legislation before us today, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008, is the political reaction to the election that we have just had and to the conversation that we had with the Australian people about Labor's position as against the government's position over the 12 months in the run-up to the election. But we should understand that this new Labor government has a debt of $20 million to pay to the union movement. Part of this legislation is clearly to pay that debt. Coming out of small busiOn- ness myself, my concern is that the response of the new government will go too far and it will begin to offend the strong economy that has been handed to it. In an interview with Gerard Callinanradio ABC Gippsland-former minister Peter MCGauran, the member for Gippsland, was asked: ‘What was so different about your seat of Gippsland and Russell Broadbent's seat of MCMillan in this election campaign? And what was the difference in the state election?' Peter MCGauran explained that Gippsland does not take its current prosperity for granted. We are different. I know there are parts of Australia that have gone through massive change and that people have had to reskill or go into different areas, Gippsland has been different. On the industrial relations front, our ions know very well that their local members have supported them over a long period of time. Going right back to when I was the member for MCMillan from 1996 to 1998, I remember how we were working through the regional forest agreements with the support of the union movement. There were changes in the pulp and paper industry. There were changes in the dairy industry that we had to deal with. There was the loss of white-collar jobs throughout the whole of Gippsland. There were massive changes to the power industry with its privatisation. That caused very high levels of unemployment and enormous pressure on the community. As members of parliament-and I describe Peter MCGauran; me; Gary Blackwood, the member for Narracan; and Russell Northe, the member for Morwell-we are but reflections of our community, the times that we have been through and the unions that we have worked with. Industrial relations is very, very important to us-the power industry, the pulp and paper industry and the enterprise agreements. Small businesses were very happy with the unfair dismissal provisions that the coalition government put in place; they made changes to the legislation of the previous government. The extremity of what we went through as a community meant that the whole of Gippsland was a hair-trigger for the nation. The reason the attack from Labor fell on deaf ears across Gippsland was that the unionsthe people in the community-knew that their members in parliament were reflecting their concerns in this place and wherever else they needed to. From Peter MCGauran's activity and his support for me in regard to dairy farmers most recently, I know that he is listening closely to his community. Mr Deputy but Speaker Scott, after receiving a phone call from home, I can report that it has been rainun- ing in Gippsland since early this morning. You might think that that is no big deal for Gippsland. Queensland has been having enormous problems with rain, but we have been aching for rain for a long time. So, on behalf of my dairy farmers and my local community, I want to let you know that it is raining in Gippsland and that that is good news. Good news was part of our election campaign. We talked about the positives. The negative was not going to run in MCMillan and Gippsland because we had taken a long time to get to this point of prosperity. It was embarrassing to have 25 per cent of the kids in your area out of work. There was no answer for it. What were you going to say-75 per cent got a job? What about when 18 per cent of your community could not get a job? In some parts of Gippsland unemployment is still high. What we saw with the Howard government's strong and careful economic management and in the thrust of industry and small businesses down the eastern seaboard of Australia-and no-one can disagree with this-was the creation of some 250,000 jobs. That was only in the last three years. It is about real people with real jobs. What were those jobs? My argument here is that, if Labor are going to overreact on this issue, they will do damage to those people who received those jobsand they were not part-time jobs. What would an employer do if they were worried about an employee coming on? They would put them on part time and if it did not work out they would cut their hours. What did they do this time? In this last three-year period, they put them on full time, 95 per cent of them worked out, the employers were happy, the employees were happy and nearly 250,000 people got jobs. This has got to the point where the unemployment figures across Gippsland that I just talked about, which were so high, have come down to less than five per cent over most parts of Gippsland. That is remarkable. It is remarkable for the nation that the unemployment rate could be down to 4.1 per cent. It must have galled the opposition during the Howard government years that there were such remarkable economic figures and such remarkable budget surpluses. Ms George-Talk about the bill.",79
46,Mr BROADBENT,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I am talking about the bill. This is what this bill is all about: the relationship between employer and employee. It is not true, as Labor have promoted, that every employer is a rogue. That is the message that you were sending across. You sent that to big business and small business. Your shadow spokesman at the time threatened them with retribution if they did not fall into line, and had to be called to account. Who by? By the then opposition leader, Mr Rudd. He had to call the now Deputy Prime Minister of this country to account. However, I digress. This is about the relationship between employer and employee. This argument has been going on in this place for 100 years. I do not believe that Labor in office will make the sorts of changes that you are promoting that you will make. I do not think that you will be able to pay this $20 million debt to the union movement. I do not think that they will get all they want from you, because there are people out there who know that this country will run better while we have this industrial relations program. I am quite supportive of what you have put forward, because you have individual workplace agreements. I am supportive of that. I cannot go back on what I have said before. I am a person who supports flexibility in the workplace, and I will continue to support flexibility in the workplace. There has never been a time when you could not join a union in this country and could not have the union go into bat for you. I will give you an example. I will go back a bit and I will talk about the relationship between the unions and me, because it is important. When we were doing those regional forests agreements, the CFMEU rang me and said, ‘We are not at that round-table that you are about to have with the Prime Minister.' I rang Graeme Morris, who at the time was the PM's offsider. I said, ‘Graeme, the CFMEU want to be at the table.' He said, ‘I'll have to talk to the boss'-John Howard-‘about that.' He did. The member for O'Connor sat next to the Prime Minister at that round-table. I knew that my unions in my area were represented at that table. That is how we work. I say to the members in the House that our relationship and what we did-and when I say ‘we' I am talking about Gary Blackwood, the Russell North representatives, Peter MCGauran and I-were totally in support of workers and unions in our area. We have never moved from that. And, by the way, they did not forget it at the last election, either. They did not forget who had been their supporter and who had looked after them and represented them in this place. That is why they voted the way they did in MCMillan: because they had a representative, they knew that they had a representative and they supported that representative. There were people who felt that they needed collective bargaining support. There is no doubt about that. They had their say. Obviously, 40 per cent of people were concerned about Work Choices. Whether Work Choices was the catalyst for discontent with the government or time was up, nobody knows. But what we do know is that the people of Australia have spoken, and I for one respect what they have said. I believe that the shadow minister, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, has very clearly stated her case and been very clear about where we stand as a party and what we are prepared to put forward to this parliament. But you must remember that there are consequences. If you get this wrong, there will be consequences. Governments cannot afford to get things like this wrong, because they affect the lives of individual people. A lot of people have gained employment in this country under the excellent economic management of the Howard government. We have had very low unemployment and reasonable interest rates-especially compared to what I have been used to in the past, when interest rates were 22 per cent for small businesses and 18 per cent for households and you had something like 20 per cent of people unemployed. I remember those things. I do not expect everybody in the House to remember those things. I do. I see interest rates at eight per cent, and that is what I was paying 35 years ago when we moved into our house. These things are important for the daily lives of people. As I said the other day, laws are important because they affect those at the bottom level of employment-such as those people along the eastern seaboard who got jobs under the Howard government. I believe that the Howard government will be seen by history as having a proud record of economic management and that the Treasurer of the day, Peter Costello, will be seen to have managed this economy very well. Who were the beneficiaries of that? Not the old union movement, with their ‘We'll keep the jobs for our boys, thank you very much, and lock in the jobs for them.' Instead, the jobs filtered down to those who were less skilled, unskilled and unable to get a job. If we have one responsibility as parliamentarians in this place it is to have regard to those people who are least able. Ms George-You abandoned them.",81
47,Mr BROADBENT,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"That is one thing that we did not do. We did not abandon them. We got a whole lot of those people into work. What could happen here if the elastic band that has been pulled by the Labor Party on industrial relations is let go and springs back too far is that the least able to get employment will be first affected, not those who have already locked in a job in the union movement. A reasonable amendment will be put before this House, which could be easily accommodated by the Labor government except for the political charge against them by the union movement. If that charge were not there-if they were prepared to consider a reasonable amendment put forward-then we could go on progressively. Whilst the arrangements in this bill being discussed today are important, the real hit will come later, when the government proposes greater reform. This is the response to the election campaign. The greater response to the changing of awards, which will come later on in the parliamentary term, is the one that the these Australian nation will have to watch more carefully. If the government are going to try to pull us back even further than where we have been in the past, those who are least able will pay the highest price. These are important issues for the nation; otherwise, we would not be addressing them. They are not, and never have been, the only issues. This morning I was thinking through these issues and I came to think about my own family and our employment of people over a long period of time. I know that there are those who have worked with us who speak very well of my dad and mum and our family as employers. I know that most of the people who employ people in this country, especially in small business, cherish their workers. Are there a few rotten apples in life? And that will continue to be the case. Yes, we do need workplace arrangements that allow people to be protected. I think that with what we have come to put in place here, if there is a safety net, people will feel more comfortable. But let us not do anything in the legislation on industrial relations laid down by this House to offend the economy as a whole. When the economic modelling for the changes proposed in Labor's legislation comes out, we need to be on guard to make sure that this is not just an ideological push because we want one thing and they want another. This should be about what will benefit the nation as a whole and benefit our young people into the future. Yes, it was clear to me that there were some people, grandparents particularly, who worried about whether their children would be able to join a union and be protected. Yes, they can now and they have been able to in the past. As I said, we will be supporting this legislation, but I commend the proposed amendment to the House.",82
48,Ms GEORGE,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I have listened to the contribution from my friend the member for MCMillan and I must say that I was quite confused about the essence of his speech. He asserted, as have other members on his side of the chamber, that somehow the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008, speedily brought into this House by the Deputy Prime Minister, is somehow a debt to the union movement. The member for MCMillan should understand that this is a debt to the Australian people. The Australian people spoke very loudly and clearly at the last election, and there can be no doubt in anybody's mind that the Your Rights at Work campaign touched the reallife experiences of so many people across the length and breadth of Australia that even the Yes. so-called ‘Howard's battlers' deserted the government in droves. It is their rightful expectation that among the first issues to be debated in the 42nd Parliament will be a transition bill to get rid of the most extreme, unbalanced and regressive industrial relations policies ever inflicted on the Australian people. Central to that agenda, of course, was the law of the individual contract so much supported by the former Prime Minister and the former Treasurer. They wanted the individual contract to be the centrepiece of their new industrial relations regime. By so doing, they overturned the hundred years of history of a fair conciliation and arbitration system that was the envy of many countries in the world, a system that had an effective award base that provided a safety net of industrial conditions for all Australian working people. So let us forget about this nonsense that somehow this bill is a debt to the union movement. I think the Australian community spoke very loudly and clearly, and today we see in the debate on this bill our commitment to the Australian people to get rid of individual statutory arrangements and to bring into being a fair, flexible and balanced industrial relations system. I heard the contribution from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition this morning and I thought it revealed a rather naive and selective interpretation of the legacy of the Howard government's approach to industrial relations. Her comments in the debate this morning were as confusing as her party's flipflopping about the issue of AWAs over the last few days. I am very relieved, as would be the Australian people, that wiser heads appear to have prevailed in the party room yesterday-at least until this point in timeand that now they are saying Work Choices is dead and, along with it, the AWAs, those insidious instruments that were used to undermine the conditions of so many working people across our nation. For the record and, in particular, for the benefit of new opposition members, I want to say a little about the history of the former Prime Minister's attitude to the issue of industrial relations in this nation. Anyone who knows anything about that history knows that the former Prime Minister was very much on the public record as having a very well defined position about what he wanted to achieve over his many decades of involvement in public life and in this parliament. Certainly John Howard never did anything other than publicly disclose that his long-term agenda-an agenda he pursued for all the time that he was in parliament-was to overturn our unique system of conciliation and arbitration and the protection that working people in this nation had, from the early days of the Harvester judgement to the creation of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, under a system which understood that everybody needed to have the underpinning of fair and decent industrial entitlements and standards. The Four Corners show the other night was really revealing about many issues. I nearly choked when I heard Joe Hockey, a former industrial relations minister, say this on TV: Quite frankly when I took over the job I don't think many ministers in Cabinet were aware that you could be worse off under WorkChoices and that you could actually have certain conditions taken away without compensation. And once I started to raise those issues with colleagues they became more informed of the impact of WorkChoices we introduced the fairness test. The interviewer said to Mr Hockey, a former industrial relations minister: You're saying to me that Cabinet colleagues were unaware that you could be worse off? JOE HOCKEY: Some were, yeah, yep. LIZ JACKSON (To Joe Hockey): Care to name them? JOE HOCKEY: No, not really! (Laughs) Not really! Then Andrew Robb, also a senior minister in the Howard government, said: I think it was the most powerful symbol of the fact that we had stopped listening and that we'd run our race and that we'd been there so long, that we were no longer alert to the views of the Howard battlers, the people who'd put us there in the first place. It is hard to believe that this level of ignorance prevailed around the cabinet table. If it did, I contend that it was a gross dereliction of duty and responsibility to the millions of hard working Australians and their families for cabinet ministers to say on the public record that they had no idea that certain conditions could be taken away without compensation. If there was that ignorance, it does not absolve cabinet members of their complicity in the most extreme industrial relations legislation ever visited on the Australian people. I wonder whether their ears were closed when, in the very early days of the Work Choices regime, a brave shop steward called Mrs Harris, who worked for Spotlight, came forward. Mrs Harris said on the public record, ‘I was a former supporter of the Howard government, but I can't support a government that takes away long-established entitlements from decent working people.' Do you remember the Spotlight AWA? What the Spotlight AWA did to the workers in that and enterprise was very common. We found that that Spotlight agreement had no penalty rates for Saturday or Sunday work and no penalty rates for public holidays. If a worker on the Spotlight AWA worked on a public holiday, they got $14.30 an hour in compensation, compared to their award rate of $35.70. Their only compensation was a day off in lieu at ordinary rates. In that agreement, and so common among all those agreements in the early days of the Work Choices regime, there were no overtime payments, no paid rest breaks, no annual leave loadings and no meal, uniform or first aid allowances. People like the former minister for industrial relations go on the public record and say that they sat around the cabinet table but had no idea of these terrible things that were happening to ordinary working people. You knew, because the Office of the Employment Advocate actually did a survey of the first 250 AWAs. What did that show? Nearly one in five of them excluded all award conditions and replaced them with the barest of the five minimum legislated standards. We know from that survey that two-thirds of them scrapped leave loadings and penalty rates. We know that more than half removed shift allowances and around one-third modified overtime loadings and rest breaks. Yet the former industrial relations minister can get up and say on the public record in a TV interview that they did not realise that all of these terrible things were happening. Their ears must have been closed, because everybody on the opposition benches who was talking to their community and listening to their constituents knew the tragedy that was occurring out there of people being unfairly treated in the workplace and having their long-standing entitlements ripped away without any proper compensation. For the new members of the opposition, let me just remind you that John Howard was on the public record all of his life in politics as saying that one of his long-term dreams was to overturn a system that had worked so well in this country, a system that provided a balanced and fair industrial relations framework and, as I said earlier, a system that was the envy of many countries around the world. In 1996, when John Howard was first elected, he wanted to visit on the Australian community a very similar industrial relations outcome to the one he achieved under Work Choices. But, much to the satisfaction of the Australian community and working families, the Senate in those days put a brake on the most extreme parts of the proposals. When the Howard government introduced its first IR bill in 1996, it sought even back then to abolish the no disadvantage test that Labor had put into place to ensure that enterprise bargaining was built on a framework of decent and fair minimum standards. I think it would be appropriate for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to familiarise herself with the history of the no disadvantage test and to understand that that test only survived because the Senate at that time rejected the extreme conditions that John Howard wanted to first introduce back in 1996. The majority of the Senate committee that looked at John Howard's first industrial relations bill back in 1996 said: The protection of conditions underpinning agreements is one of the most important provisions available …",83
49,The SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for Throsby will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Interest Rates",85
50,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the minutes of the last Reserve Bank board meeting, which reveal that the bank contemplated putting up interest rates by half a per cent and that it is concerned about a wages break-out. What is the Prime Minister's plan for preventing a wages break-out leading to higher inflation and higher interest rates for Australian families?",85
51,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question. The challenge that we face this year is: how do we handle the overall inflationary problem which has been left to us by the previous government?,86
52,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,86
53,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whereas our friends opposite may find that difficult medicine to swallow publicly, it is simply the statistical reality that they have to get used to. It is not our say-so; it is the ABS's say-so. But let us go to the question of wage restraint, which was the core part of the Leader of the Opposition's question. The first thing we can do, and that we can do nationally, is to show some leadership. I am pleased about the fact that members on my side of the House, supported by the opposition, have decided in a modest way to demonstrate an appropriate level of restraint on our part, modest though it is, for the first year and a half-from now through until the middle of next year. That is important, particularly when we are confronted with statement after statement, report after report, by CEOs across the country, where unfortunately restraint has not been the first order of business for them when it comes to their own salary arrangements for the future. The second element goes to how we best deliver also on this government's pre-election commitments when it comes to tax cuts. There has been a lot of debate about this. We on this side of the House take seriously our commitments to working people. Were we to take the advice of some and not deliver those commitments to working people, the argument that would be advanced right across the country in the various industrial negotiations that would subsequently occur would be extraordinary-namely, that the absence of the tax cuts which have been promised to working families would not provide a basis for restraint in the subsequent wages demands. We therefore regard that as an important measure in moderating overall demand in the economy, in particular when it comes to demands by those who will be engaging in industrial negotiations this year. That is the second point. The third point is: what do we do about the overall inflationary challenge when it comes to public demand? That is where this government has laid squarely the challenge to those opposite: do you believe that we need to rein in government expenditure-the Minister for Finance and Deregulation asked this very clearly yesterday-or do you not? We believe you do because it is the aggregation of private demand and public demand which creates the fundamentals of the overall inflation challenge. We have a plan of action on both fronts in order to do what we can to ensure that the inflation problem is kept under control. It is a problem which we inherited from those who preceded us, and we have the course of action underway that I just outlined to the honourable member. Economy Mrs D'ATH (2.03 pm)-My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the economic challenges the government faces and the government's policy response to those challenges?",86
54,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Petrie for her question. The government's challenge is to build a modern Australia that is capable of facing the challenges of the future and, within that framework, for us to have a modern, competitive economy which is capable of dealing with threats to our long term prosperity. Right across the developed world at present we face challenges when it comes to projections for economic growth for the year ahead. We have seen already in the sobering report from the IMF, contained in its World Economic Outlook, the revision down of the growth projection for the global economy from 2007, when it was to render an outcome of about 4.9, down to 4.1 for the year ahead, 2008. What has this been triggered by? A range of factors: instability in global financial markets, occasioned by the downturn in the US housing market, occasioned in turn by what we have seen with the US subprime crisis. And these developments have yet to fully wash through the entirety of global markets and the real global economy. Here in Australia we face a treble challenge. One is to keep a very clear weather eye on these developments in the international economy, particularly the capacity of these developments to wash over the economies of East Asia, where 50 per cent of this nation's trade occurs. The second thing is this: we must remain absolutely vigilant in the fight against inflation. Third, we must also prosecute a bold program of microeconomic reform to ensure that we can build long-term productivity growth so that this economy can be competitive in the long-term future, given the challenges we face. The inflation challenge that we face is substantial. Firstly, this is the highest level inflation this country has seen in 16 years. When we took over office from the Howard government we inherited a level of inflation higher than that which the Howard government inherited from the Keating government. Those members sitting opposite need to be very mindful of that fact. Secondly, those inflationary pressures have been building for a couple of years. Thirdly, look at the Reserve Bank's Statement on Monetary Policy and their projections out, based on where the economy was standing in the final quarter last year-inflation numbers beyond the three per cent band through 2008, through 2009 and into the middle of 2010. These are substantial economic challenges, substantial challenges on the inflation front, and therefore demand a course of action. When it comes, therefore, to the impact of these high levels of inflation, it has of course washed through to what we have seen in interest rates moves. We have had 11 consecutive interest rates rises. This has placed enormous pressure on working families, to the point where when this government took office from its predecessor they were (1) running inflation at the highest levels this country has seen in 16 years and (2) giving to working families interest rates which are the second highest in the developed world. That is what we received by virtue of our predecessors by way of an economic inheritance. The question of course is what to do about it. The legacy problem I have referred to, but the beginning of wisdom in terms of how you deal with the problem is to recognise that a problem exists",86
55,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order relating to the abuse of question time by using it to make statements. Furthermore, I am terribly disappointed that he won't give Swannie a go! Mr Albanese-On the point of order, Mr Speaker: yesterday you indicated that it was of appropriate that someone on this side of the House raise issues at the time if points of orders had been clearly used to disrupt the functioning of the House. That is clearly what is occurring with the member for O'Connor's point of order. It was not a point of order, and I ask that you take action against him. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, further to the point of order: the Prime Minister himself said that he wanted fewer ministerial statements in question time and more ministerial statements after question time. We have accommodated those ministerial statements after question time. The member for O'Connor has a very good point: this is a prime ministerial statement about the economy. We deserve the right to have the opportunity to respond. We cannot do that in question time but we can do it through a debate on ministerial statements.",87
56,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hopefully, people have read overnight page 188 of House of Representatives Practice, about points of order. We are slowly getting to the point where we are dealing with things at the point in time. If people want disruption, you can have arguments over points of order all you like. Let us get a few things straight. The second part of the honourable member for O'Connor's point of order was not a point of order and was disruptive. The other question that he raises is something that the House will have to come to grips with, because if you all went away and listened to yourselves today and last year you would have problems. The question that was asked of the Prime Minister was in order. The answer that the Prime Minister is providing is in order. If House has problems with the length of the answer, that might be something that the House would like to bring its mind to through the Procedure Committee or other avenues. It is a great risk for me to put this on the record in that you might consider time limits for questions, because I do not believe that is the way we should really go if we are fair dinkum about sitting down and thinking about question time and the way that it should operate. The other observation I would make is that this early in the life of the government, whatever people believe is by way of ministerial statement or explaining the government's position, it is all new. It would seem legitimate that, in the early stages, we have questions that ask the position of the government and that it is explained. I believe that later today we might see the proper use of a ministerial statement, where something that may have in the past been announced outside of the chamber will be exposed and introduced inside the chamber. If we take a collective deep breath and work towards improving the way in which this place operates especially at question time, reduce the number of points of order and get on with the proper operation of the House, I will try to assist that.",88
57,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact that we in the parliament and the nation face is as follows: we have inflation running at 16-year highs and we currently have working families, as a consequence of that, paying the second highest interest rates in the world. That is the challenge that we face. That is the challenge we have inherited from our predecessors. The question arises as to what we now do about it. The beginning of wisdom with this lies in recognising that you have a problem. The core challenge which remains unanswered in the this debate is: do all members of this House recognise that we have a challenge in dealing with the inflation problem? If I listen carefully to those opposite in their recent contributions in the debate, I hear the member for Wentworth referring to the inflation problem as a fairytale; the member for Higgins, only six months ago, saying that the inflation rate was right where we wanted it; the Leader of the Opposition disputing the real relationship between inflationary movements and interest rates; and the good old Leader of the National Party giving the classic three-point National Party response to any problem: spend, spend, spend. The core question that we face is: how do you deal with the inflation challenge that we have now inherited? We on our side of the parliament-the government-have articulated a five-point plan to deal with the budget surplus, with the encouragement of private savings, with the skills crisis, with infrastructure and with participation, all of which are critical elements in bringing the inflation genie back under control and boosting long-term productivity growth. Part of the participation problem lies in having not only effective tax policy settings and effective welfare policy settings but also effective industrial relations policy settings. That is why we, the government, have put forward a fair and balanced industrial relations system for the future of this nation, embodied in the interim arrangements introduced by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in the bill which is currently before the parliament and as reflected elsewhere in our policy. We on this side of the House have a clear-cut policy when it comes to industrial relations. Our opponents do not. In December they said that Work Choices was dead, in January they said it was back alive again, in February it was dead again-and still we seem to have a bit of a flutter, based on the statement by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in terms of what may still happen in the Senate. In particular, I draw to the attention of honourable members a statement made today by the good old member for Canning, who, when asked, ‘Wouldn't AWAs be gone forever after five years?' responded: ‘But anything could happen in five years, you know. You could have a different government after five years.' Therein lies the point. Whereas they may say that Work Choices and AWAs are dead and buried or fluttering away there for a bit, the truth is that they lie in the back drawer and lie in the top drawer, ready to be taken out should the opposition assume office at the next election. You can just see it. There it is: Work Choices is dead one minute, back again, dead the next, then waiting for the next election. You can see them with the defibrillator prongs waiting to bring Work Choices back to life-zap, zap. On the day after the election, bang-it is back into life. No-one knows where the Liberal Party stand on industrial relations. They have not made up their own mind on this. They are a party that has lost touch and lost direction. Economy",88
58,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer to the comments from the Minister for Finance and Deregulation at the Press Club on 6 February when he said that he did not believe that there was a problem with respect to the states' relative budget and debt positions. Given that state Labor government debt is projected to grow to $80 billion by 2011, does the Treasurer agree with his finance minister that this level of government debt is acceptable? Is the Treasurer seriously contending that a dollar spent by a state government has less impact on inflationary pressures than a dollar spent by the federal government?",89
59,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. It is very important to understand that state government expenditure on critical economic infrastructure is a very important part of lifting the productive capacity of the economy. Those opposite do not seem to get it. They simply do not seem to understand the importance of critical economic infrastructure in this economy and, because of their failure to provide political and economic leadership in this area over 11 years, there are now inflationary pressures in the economy-elevated inflationary pressures, which have caused seven interest rate rises in the last three years alone. So we on this side of the House do understand the importance of critical economic infrastructure. It is absolutely essential that it goes in place if we are going to lift the productive capacity of our economy and put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates in the long term. Why are we getting these questions today? Because they are so embarrassed about their complacency over the last 11 years and because their failure in infrastructure gives lie to any claim they have to economic competence. Of course, the other thing that gives lie to their claims of economic competence is the seven interest rate rises that this country has experienced in the last three years on the back of the highest elevated inflation in 16 years. That is the parting gift of the Liberal Party of Australia to the people of Australia. But we take the fight against inflation very seriously, which is why the Prime Minister has put forward his five-point plan. I will quote an authority on infrastructure-this is from Governor Glenn Stevens to the Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee on 21 February. He said: Balance sheets of governments in this country, and large, are in very good shape.",89
60,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Opposition members interjectingHe is referring to state governments as well. They will not have any trouble borrowing money from the lenders of the world for a reasonable project. How inflationary is that?

Workplace Relations  is to the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations: will the minister update the House on the recycling of promotional materials relating to government policies?",90
61,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moreton for his question and I know of his concern for fairness and balance in Australian workplaces. The Rudd Labor government is determined to get rid of the scourge of Work Choices and the scourge of Work Choices propaganda. The former government waged a war with Work Choices propaganda; we are now trying to wage a war on that propaganda and get rid of it. On Monday I reported to the House that the Prime Minister and I had arranged for the pulping of 436,000 Work Choices booklets. Yesterday, I reported to the House that we were getting rid of 100,000 Work Choices mousepads. Yesterday in this parliament I was convinced that I was winning the war against Work Choices propaganda, but it is with a heavy heart I am forced to report to the House: there is more. I am sorry about it, but there is more. There are 102,341 plastic foldersunfortunately, more than 100,000 of them. Mr Albanese-What are you going to do with them?",90

I do concede that for some people this propaganda could come in handy. I can imagine that when the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition produced their ‘Work Choices is dead' statement they did it at a computer with a Work Choices mousepad, they signed it with a Work Choices pen, they filed it in a Work Choices folder and then they had a drink out of a Work Choices fridge. I understand that this propaganda can come in handy to some",90
64,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,91
65,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One with a fridge magnet on it-a Work Choices fridge. You would not want to doubt their bona fides, would you, as they sit in their office, cocooned in with their Work Choices propaganda, remembering the good old days when they had the political honesty to walk to a dispatch box and defend Work Choices? Now of course they still believe in Work Choices, but they do not have that political honesty anymore. The Work Choices propaganda is the propaganda of the Liberal Party, paid for unwillingly by Australian taxpayers, by a government that believed in Work Choices. This is a Liberal Party that still believe in Work Choices. If they want some things to remind them of the good old days, they can just ring my office. We have got a lot of them waiting for you! Economy",91
66,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the claims, reported today, by the National Secretary of the CFMEU that the union will ignore the government's calls for wage restraint and seek pay rises well in excess of inflation and not based on productivity gains. Given the concerns of the Reserve Bank about the potential for a wages breakout, will the Treasurer guarantee there will be no wages break-out of the kind that drove the economy into recession under the previous Labor government and left one million Australians unemployed?",91
67,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. Many years ago, far-sighted governments put in place enterprise bargaining, where wage rises were linked directly to productivity at the workplace level. And that is the policy of the Rudd Labor government. That is the fair and balanced system that we are going to put into place, a fair system where all participants in the system must adhere to the law. That is the policy of the Rudd Labor government. But it is so ironic today that we should receive these questions from those opposite, because only last year they looked the Australian people in the eye and they told them Work Choices was something they fundamentally believed in. They told the Australian people it was the secret to economic success in the future. They told the Australian people it was the key to productivity. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked a specific question about the words from the National Secretary of the CFMEU about the fact that that union is ignoring the government's claims about wage restraint and is going for wages well in excess of inflation. If the Treasurer is not able to answer the question, we can get someone who can.",91
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The Treasurer has the call.,91
69,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite do not know whether they are Arthur or Martha when it comes to Work Choices. They simply have not got a clue. They have not got a clue because they have not got a plan to fight inflation. They do not have a plan to fight inflation at all. They put all their policy power into the Work Choices basket and, for political expediency, they threw it overboard yesterday, leaving them with no plan for the future. Well, the Rudd Labor government has a plan for the future, and it includes a fair and balanced industrial relations system, one which will be based on productivity to create wealth well into the future. Workplace Relations",91
70,Ms REA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. Will the minister detail the stability and certainty that the government is providing for Australian employees and employers in its workplace relations policies?",92
71,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for the question. This side of the House believes it is very important that Australian employers and Australian employees can plan at work with certainty, knowing what the law is going to be. We believe that that certainty should not just last for a limited period of time; that certainty should be there for the long term, because people make long-term arrangements at work. That is why we published, before the last election, all of our policies in industrial relations: so Australian employers and Australian employees could see what it was that a Labor government would provide if elected. We have before the House the legislation that delivers the first bit of that policy, and we will have a substanmatter tive bill that delivers the rest of the policy. But the certainty on this side of the House is met on the other side of the House by confusion, by flip, flop, flap and then fuddle. Mr Hockey-Fuddle?",92
72,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Fuddle. And before the last election these were the people that walked to the dispatch box and defended Work Choices day in, day out. Just a few short months ago they were at the dispatch box defending Work Choices. The current Leader of the Opposition talked about how much political capital and philosophical determination had been invested in workplace relations. The member for North Sydney, then the relevant minister, said in the context of the election campaign: The workplace relations system of the Coalition is providing benefits to workers, businesses and the economy as a whole. It must be retained … They believed in Work Choices before the election, and the truth is they actually believe in it now. They are pretending that they have had some road-to-Damascus conversion and they no longer believe in Work Choices. They are pretending that they no longer believe in the Australian workplace agreements, though one would have to say in the last 48 hours the degree of confusion on that point from the opposition has been absolutely remarkable. But apparently, if the statements of the opposition are now to be believed, they will give passage to Labor's bill through the parliament, and indeed today coalition members at the relevant Senate committee for the bill did not vote at all on a resolution to put the timetable for the Senate inquiry back to the timetable that Labor had asked for. Originally the Liberal Party in its defence of Work Choices had sought to draw this out to keep Work Choices going as long as humanly possible. Today the Liberal Party, confronted with a proposition that they come back to Labor's timetable, that they deal with this bill before Easter, did not even vote on it. So we are now in a situation where we believe-it is hard to know; it changes minute by minute with the flip, flop, flap and fuddle-that the opposition will vote for Labor's bill and we believe that the opposition will process Labor's bill in the Senate before Easter, as Labor originally asked. What could cause this remarkable change of heart from a party that believed in Work Choices and has always believed in industrial relations extremism and advocated it right up until yesterday? I would have to say I think I know what has fed into this change of heart, because I have come upon a secret Liberal strategy document. It is the secret plan that shows why the opposition has now repositioned on Work Choices. This is a secret plan that says that the opposition would be best advantaged by adopting Labor's policy and offering to fast-track it. Isn't that starting to happen? They are fast-tracking Labor's policy now, as we ask. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is echoing Labor's words, talking about a fair and flexible industrial relations system. They are adopting this policy of pretending to close the gap on industrial relations and endorse Labor's plan. This is a policy that talks about them losing their reputation for industrial relations extremism and Work Choices by pretending to endorse and give swift passage to Labor's policies. When you analyse this secret plan, the position of endorsing Labor's plans and giving it fast track is not because they should change their view substantively-that is not what this secret document says they are going to do. They are going to change their view cosmetically, because if they change their view cosmeticallyMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order-again, it relates to relevance. The Deputy Prime Minister was not asked about alternative views. Specifically, the question was about their current policy. I ask you to bring her back to the question or, if it relates to the current debate, to rule it out order subject to section 100(e) of the standing orders.",92
73,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the question was about certainty and stability for Australian employers and employees. So I think what a Liberal opposition believes in pertains to that question, because we are talking policy settings people are entitled to know for the long term. This secret policy document talks about pretending to agree with LaborMr Hartsuyker- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is on relevance. The question asked about certainty for employees and employers, not any secret documents.",93
74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Prime Minister is relevant. On the point that the member for North Sydney raised, yet again it is a standing order that covers the question. In any case, I do not think that the Deputy Prime Minister is reflecting upon proceedings before the House at the moment.",93
75,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This secret document lays bare that the reason for this strategy is so business will come back into dialogue with the opposition and they can ‘do some deals'-that is the terminology used-that they can have refunded. It is all about business fundraising. That is what this secret plan is all about. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The answer has been going for well in excess of five minutes now. The Deputy Prime Minister is now referring to documents that I understand come from a private sector organisation. It is not part of the question.",93
76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat.,93
77,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This secret document of from a Liberal Party strategist that includes the secret plan-it is all about attracting business fundraising, not about substantively changing their position on industrial relations. This is a document that lays bare a strategy to pretend that they have given up industrial relations extremism and then, if they are re-elected in the future, to go straight back to industrial relations extremism. I take it that the Liberal Party, the members opposite, think I am wrong. Well, if I am wrong, they can come to the dispatch box and say one thing: that a re-elected Liberal government will never introduce AWAs or statutory individual employment agreements again.",93
78,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister is well and truly starting to debate the question.,94
79,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is on relevance. The Deputy Prime Minister has moved considerably from the question and the answer that is required. It is well known that the lition will not be opposing the government's workplace relations legislation.",94
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! As reminded by the member for Cowper, the question went to certainty and uncertainty in regard to workplace legislation.",94
81,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I conclude on this: the question of certainty and stability for Australian employers and employees would be assisted by a simple answer from the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-or whoever is in control these days-to a question. That question is this: would a re-elected Liberal government reintroduce Australian workplace agreements or a statutory individual employment agreement of any nature-yes or no? And if they do not answer that question then clearly it is about a secret plan to bring back Work Choices, should they ever return to the government benches. The party of Work Choices are still the party of Work Choices and they will always be the party of Work Choices. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I ask that the Deputy Prime Minister table the secret document that she was quoting from.",94
82,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Government members interjecting Mr Hockey-Well, she says it is our secret document-table it!",94
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. Mr Hockey-Table it! Table it!,94
84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for North Sydney! He requested action to be taken. I am about to take it if he would be quiet. Was the Deputy Prime Minister reading from a document?,94
85,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I made reference to but did not read from a document. Treasurer",94
86,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is coato the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister explain to Australians with a home loan how they can have faith in a Treasurer who when asked important questions about the economy dismisses them as a ‘pop quiz' and then confesses that ‘sometimes I will have the details on hand and sometimes I will not'?,94
87,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. When I think of working families in Australia dealing with mortgage rate pressure, they have one thing and one thing only in mind: 11 consecutive interest rate rises in a row as a response to the economic policy settings put in place by those opposite. Working families across Australia are struggling to make ends meet. They have been dealing with the mortgage pressures which they have been confronted with-11 increases in a row-on the back of mounting inflation pressures in the economy and an inflation genie let out of the bottle by those opposite. I would have thought that those opposite, if they were serious about dealing with the long-term economic challenges of Australia, would accept that we have an inflation problem. I do not hear any recognition from those opposite that we have one at present-none whatsoever. Six months ago the member for Higgins said, ‘It's just fine and dandy.' We have had the member for Wentworth saying, ‘It's all just a fairytale.' Is there an inflation problem? If you do not recognise that there is an inflation problem, how can we embrace a common set of policy undertakings in this place to deal with an inflation problem? For example, what do we then do when it comes to eliminating unnecessary waste and expenditure through government departments and through the razor gang exercise that we have embarked upon? Because, when it came to the waste of government funds, the growth in government outlays in the last financial year was, I am advised",94
88,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: the question to the Prime Minister is, ‘Can Australians have faith in his Treasurer?'",95
89,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And what is relevant to working families is whether we have a plan to deal with inflation, a plan to deal with terest rates, a plan to deal with unnecessary government outlays-a plan of action on each of the above. For 11½ years those opposite sat there, fiddled, allowed the macroeconomic policy settings of this country to become unravelled by a loose approach to fiscal policy and a nonagenda on productivity policy. When it comes to cute questions asked by those opposite, I am advised by those around the tracks that when the NAIRU question was raised by the chief of staff of the Leader of the Opposition about what to ask in parliament this week, his first response was that they were talking about the Prime Minister of India in the postwar period. You can run as many pop quizzes as you like. We will get some right; we will get some wrongMr Andrews- Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: the question was about the Prime Minister's confidence in his Treasurer. Some minutes have passed and he has not even mentioned the Treasurer.",95
90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It seems the House wants these points of order fully explained to them. I will rule that the Prime Minister is orderMrs Bronwyn Bishop-Of course you will.,95
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Mackellar will absent herself from the House for one hour. The member for Mackellar then left the chamber.,95
92,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question posed by the honourable gentleman opposite has no logical premise to it in the first place. If there were any serious engagement of the economic debate in this nation about what we will be doing in the future on inflation, on interest rates and on cutbacks to unnecessary budget outlays, we would start to have an engagement of proper economic policy deinbate. I will tell you what the Treasurer of the Commonwealth has been doing in the 2½ months since we have been in office",95
93,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,95
94,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,sitting there in an Expenditure Review Committee of the cabinet cutting and burning the outrageous engagement,95
95,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! It strikes me, the question having been asked, that now the question has well and truly been directly answered should not be an invitation for those on my left to raise their voices. They will sit there quietly.",95
96,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why this House has absolute confidence in the Treasurer is because the Treasurer is engaged in day-today, week-toweek meetings in the Expenditure Review Committee of this government and cabinet cutting and burning the outrageous examples of waste and misallocation of public funds in which those opposite have engaged. The Deputy Prime Minister today has given you one example after another, one item of waste after another-$122 million worth of this in outrageous self-indulgence in public outlays, all contributing to public demand and all therefore adding to the inflation burden in the economy. That is what the Treasurer has been doing. The Treasurer has also been engaged with me in how we advance a productivity agenda for this nation for the future, how we make sure that we engender long term productivity growth through a human capital revolution, investing in skills and investing in infrastructure. These are the areas where this Treasurer has been engaged. The Treasurer has the absolute confidence of the House, the government and the parliament, because we are dealing with a record of mismanagement by those opposite, and they stand condemned. Wage Price Index",95
97,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on the wage price index data released today and its implications?,96
98,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question because this is a very serious matter. The wage price index for Australia grew by 1.1 per cent in December and by 4.2 per cent over the year. As we have said, this is a very, very tight labour market, so we need to be alert to the skill shortages and labour shortages in the Australian economy, something those opposite were not alert to for 11 long years. These are solid wage rises, but we need to ensure they are closely linked to productivity growth. As I was telling the House earlier, our industrial relations system, where wage rises will be linked to productivity growth at the firm level, is absolutely critical. It it is balanced and it is the key to our future prosperity. As the Prime Minister indicated before, so is our capacity building agenda, so is doing something about the skills crisis, so is providing some leadership when it comes to national infrastructure and so is enhancing workforce participation. They are all absolutely critical to the productivity agenda that this government has in hand. It stands in stark contrast to the approach of the current Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. They do not have a plan for the future. The shadow Treasurer has a plan for himself but he does not have a plan to fight inflation. Do you know what the Leader of the Opposition said in a radio interview a couple of weeks ago? He said that there was no link between inflation and interest rates. That is how economically illiterate and ignorant the Leader of the Opposition is when it comes to these basic economic facts about what we must do to tackle the inflation challenge and build prosperity for the future. The shadow Treasurer says inflation is a fairy story. It is not a fairy story for people sitting around the kitchen tables of this country who are finding it very hard to make ends meet. This government has a plan for the future. The opposition have no plan for the future at all. They just have a plan to take each other's jobs. Economy",96
99,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer, and I refer to my question to the Treasurer yesterday about Australia's two-speed economy. Given the budget cuts proposed by the government, what measures is the Treasurer considering to ensure the impact on Australian families is not disproportionately severe in states such as New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, where economic growth last fiis fair, nancial year was well below average and considerably less than the rate of growth in the mining boom states of Queensland and Western Australia? Mr Wood interjecting",96
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for La Trobe is warned!,96
101,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question because I have just outlined a plan that we have got to tackle inflation. But I want to make a couple of points about the relationship between fiscal policy and monetary policy, because it is pretty true to say that monetary policy is a blunt instrument. Why is monetary policy a blunt instrument? It is a blunt instrument because it hurts working families. It is a blunt instrument because, when inflation goes up, interest rates follow. One of the problems we have had in this country is that the lax fiscal policy from those opposite is pushing up inflation, and inflation is not something that is confined just to one state or another. Inflation is not confined to Queensland; it is not confined to Western Australia; it is Australia wide. So we have to deal with that inflation problem. We have to deal with it to take the financial presstantial sure off working families. We deal with it through our five-point plan. That is our plan, and those opposite do not have one at all. Pakistan",96
102,Ms PARKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the foreign minister update the House on recent developments in Pakistan?,97
103,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. The Australian government welcomes the largely peaceful conduct of parliamentary elections in Pakistan on Monday of this week, 18 February. Members, of course, would be aware that Pakistan has had to overcome very significant difficulties to see the conduct of election. The election was of course delayed by the shocking assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December of last year, but we welcome the fact that the elections have now been conducted. When I rang the then foreign minister of Pakistan, Mr ul Haque, to relay Australia's shock and sadness at the assassination of Mrs Bhutto, I made the point that the Australian government very strongly believed that the best way forward for Pakistan was to pursue the election, the best way forward for Pakistan was to have an election where there was full and free participation and which was conducted in a peaceable manner, and that the best way forward for Pakistan to combat extremism and terrorism was by restoration of democracy and restoration of the rule of law. Whilst the Pakistan election commission will not formally complete and declare the election for the next couple of days and whilst we will not see, for example, any independent international observations either from the US teams or from the EU teams until later tonight or tomorrow, it is clear that the opposition parties have made very subgains. The party of the late Benazir Bhutto, the PPP, led since her assassination by Mr Zardari, at last count had won up to 87 seats. The PML-N, led by former Prime Minister Sharif, has won 66 seats out of the 268 seats up for contest. So it is quite clear that for the first occasion at a democratically held election we see the demise of a Pakistan government which has for the first occasion run its full term. We will await with interest those formal reports of the election observers and the full and complete conduct of the election by the Pakistan election commission. We will of course be watching the election aftermath and its consequences very closely, but we are this very pleased that President Musharraf has indicated that he is prepared and willing to cooperate with any new government which is formed out of the parliament as a result of these elections. We believe that that is very important and we encourage all parties in Pakistan to engage in such discussions in a peaceful and constructive way. Stability, democracy and the rule of law are very, very important to Australia. That is because any adverse implications for Pakistan, particularly any adverse implications for the south of Pakistan so far as extremism and terrorism are concerned, have adverse implications and consequences for the over 1,000 Australian troops in the south of Afghanistan. Deleterious consequences for Pakistan lead to deleterious consequences for Afghanistan. It is very important that Australia and the international community support very strongly the extension of democracy in Pakistan, the extension of the rule of law. We look forward, after the conduct of a relatively peaceful election, to seeing a peaceful transition to a new government in Pakistan in cooperation with the current President. Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry FRAN BAILEY (2.52 pm)-My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of the appointment of Roy Green and officials from the trade union movement to conduct the government's review of the textile, clothing and footwear sector? Why has the government again ignored Treasury advice that the Productivity Commission conduct the review?",97
104,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly welcome the question from the honourable member. As is the case with the automobile industry and is the case with the clothing and textile industry, they are very, very important manufacturing industries in this country and we make no apologies for the urgency with which we approach the problems challenging these industries. The principal problem challenging these industries at the moment, among many, is of course our exchange rate. We will from time to time take decisions about inquiries and involve the full expertise of the federal bureaucracy and agencies in those inquiries. The Productivity Commission will be involved in any future inquiry into the textiles industry, just as it is involved in the auto industry. Rail Infrastructure",98
105,Ms CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and relates to the Australian National Audit Office performance audit report tabled last week entitled Administration of grants to the Australian Rail Track Corporation. Would the minister advise the House of the report's findings and outline the government's approach to investing public money in infrastructure?",98
106,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bass for her question. I note the critique of the leader of the National Party of the Australian National Audit Office: that it is just more money for bureaucratic inquiries. But, no, these are actually inquiries making sure that taxpayers' funds are used efficiently. I am not surprised that the National Party are so concerned about the operations of the National Audit Office because, given their concentration on National Party porkbarrelling, the National Audit OfficeMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The question did not ask about the National Party at all. There was no reference at all to it in the question. If he does not want to answer the question, we can have someone ask a question that does want answering.",98
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am hoping that the minister for infrastructure is making preliminary remarks about the Audit Office. I would indicate that it is not assisted by subquestions being fired across the chamber. I call the minister.,98
108,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The ANAO report outlines how the former government made three special grant payments to the Australian Rail Track Corporation: $450 million in June 2004, $100 million in June 2005 and $270 million in June 2006. Why were these payments made in June each year? The Audit Office finds that these payments were made ‘in the context of assisting to reduce higher than expected budget surpluses'. We have in this nation a significant infrastructure deficit, but were the excess funds used to improve productivity? No. It was just bailed out at the end of the financial year to get the funds off the books. The ANAO report goes on to say this about the $450 million payment in June 2004: … prior to the grant being approved, the ARTC was not asked to provide any formal advice on specific areas in which a grant of that quantum could be applied ... It was as if they said: ‘We have $450 million. Here you go. Do with it what you like.' That was the attitude. Then the government put out a release. They said that it was for rail realignments of the New South Wales North Coast line. It sounds worthwhile. But what does the Audit Office say the money was used for? The Audit Office says that the money that the government said was going to the New South Wales North Coast was used on the lines from Melbourne to Junee. No wonder they lost the seat of Page on the New South Wales North Coast during the election: they could not find it; they did not know where it was. That is just one of the recommendations of this Audit Office report. Indeed, the National Audit Office is thinking of changing its name to the ‘Nationals Audit Office', because every week there is a new report being tabled in this parliament about the pork-barrelling and the waste and mismanagement of expenditure over there. There was so much money that they did not know what to do with it. I heard an interesting story the other day about the Nationals and their use of spending when it comes to infrastructure. During the campaign, the now leader of the National Party rang up some people in Singleton and said that he was going to pay a visit. If you are in Singleton and the National Party are coming to town you think: ‘You beauty! Here come the big bucks. Singleton is going to get some allocations of funding. Here it comes.' The now leader of the National Party was in Tamworth and he drove down to Singleton. You have to drive through Muswellbrook to get to Singleton. When he got there the announcement was about the Muswellbrook bypass. He did not actually know that you should probably announce the Muswellbrook bypass funding in Muswellbrook. When it comes to the National Party, it does not matter whether it is funding for Junee to Melbourne, instead of the New South Wales North Coast, or announcing the Muswellbrook bypass in Singleton-it does not matter, because the Audit Office have said this about the management of this scheme: There are no contracts, funding agreements or documented governance arrangements that require the ARTC to use the $820 million in special grant funding on any particular projects or in any particular time frame. That is an absolute indictment of the former government's attitude towards taxpayers' funds. They stand condemned, not just by the government, not just by the Audit Office but by the taxpayers of Australia. Environment",98
109,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and relates to the carbon debate. Could the minister inform the House of his vision for the farm sector in relation to the carbon debate and, in particular, the potential to sequester carbon in our better soils through conservation farming practices? Given that the former Prime Minister sidelined farmers from any involvement in the carbon task force, and the inability of the National Farmers Federation to influence debate, what role does the new government foresee for agriculture's involvement in the development of a carbon market?",99
110,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. When I was visiting New England, the honourable member for New England took the opportunity to take me through and show me some of the particular soil practices that are being engaged in by farmers there. For a long time New England has been in the front line of no-till farming. The same issues were raised by the representatives of AgForce during the visit the Prime Minister and I made to Roma. A lot of focus has been put, at different times, on carbon emissions and land clearing. It is also the case, though, that the different methods of soil use have a significant impact on carbon emissions. Packages put together by the government and announced in our election policy Australia's Farming Future go to some of the specific ways in which we can advance these practices to make sure that farmers are well prepared for the carbon trading scheme. The three particular programs in Australia's Farming Future which will go to some of the issues raised by the honourable member for New England are the agricultural adaptation programs, the adjustment programs and a program making sure that research and development has a particular focus on productivity and on climate change research. Together, those programs add up to $130 million, and that will provide an important part of the way forward on the issues raised by the honourable member for New England. It is important that we finally have a situation where the government of this country is concerned with preparing farmers for a future with climate change. It ence in the world away from the prior government, which denied the climate was changing at all. It is all the difference in world away from that government, which for 11 long years told people there was no need to prepare, there was no need to adapt and there was no problem at all. The report that came from ABARE at the end of last year made clear the real dangers to both our domestic and export markets if we do nothing in terms of preparation for climate change. This government has the Australia's Farming Future policy. We are committed to making sure that we are well prepared, as an agricultural sector, for the future so that we can deal with both adaptation and mitigation issuesin particular, in the soil areas raised by the honourable member for New England-in making sure we have not just a sustainable but a vibrant future for Australian agriculture. Economy",100
111,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. What steps is the government taking to cut back on wasteful government spending? Will the minister explain why spending discipline and addressing the inflation challenge is important for Australian families?,100
112,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Underlying inflation is currently running at 3.6 per cent in Australia. We have had 11 interest rate increases in a row after 20 Reserve Bank warnings over the preceding two or three years about the threats of inflation. Mr Hockey interjecting,100
113,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I will be very generous to the member for North Sydney. This is a final warning. He has interjected on every question today. Mr Adams-Throw him out!,100

115,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Underlying inflation is running at 3.6 per cent, the highest rate for the 16 years. We have had 11 interest rate increases in a row and government spending for the current financial year, and the projecthe tions from the previous government, is running at a 4½ per cent real increase. The rate of increase is way too fast. The Rudd government is committed to cutting into government spending to get it back in line with appropriate fiscal settings to ensure that the budget is putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. That involves taking tough, challenging decisions. We faced the first instalment of this requirement a couple of weeks ago. When we were confronted with choices about the former government's announcements that were made after the budget last year, a whole variety of spending initiatives were wrapped up in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers. There were 220 spending decisions. We went through all of those spending decisions. Some of them were entirely legitimate and some of them were the ordinary business of government, but many of them were a substantial part of John Howard's pre-election shopping list. As a result, we cut $643 million of government spending over four years and, particularly, for the forthcomaway ing financial year we cut $265 million of government spending. That is just a modest first instalment. We accept that, because the real action, the big action, is going to be in the budget. We could not duck or avoid these decisions because we had to legislate on those measures, and that legislation is to be passed by the House today. Some of the measures that we cut included significant government advertising spending. I advised the House yesterday of the outrageous amount of money-$457 million-that was spent by the previous government over the last 16 months it was in office. Some of those things were government advertising and some were specific programs. It was notable that straight out of blocks in responding to these initiatives we had none other than the new Leader of the National Party. He immediately responded, and here is what he said in his press conference in the wake of these cuts being announced. He described the removal of $3 million of funding to the Fishing Hall of Fame as ‘absolute rubbish'. He said, and I quote, ‘We do not have a shortage of money in Australia.' In other words, money grows on trees and the trees are in bloom so we do not really have a shortage of money in Australia. He pointed out that the United States has a higher inflation rate than Australia but it is actually increasing government spending, clearly implying that the solution to any inflation problem is to increase government spending, not cut it. Finally he stated that cuts in government spending of the kind that we have projected will do nothing to reduce inflation. It is notable that in the last couple of days the opposition have placed a lot of emphasis on the question of technical economic knowledge. I would suggest that the little task force that they have beavering somewhere in the bowels of the parliament should pay a visit to the Leader of the National Party's office and give him a bit of a lesson about some technical economic concepts like the impact of public demand on inflation and the impact of government spending on the economy, because at the moment we have a Leader of the National Party who thinks that the big issue facing Australia is the prospect of cuts to the Fishing Hall of Fame. He thinks that there is plenty of money lying around, that there is no problem, that we do not have to worry about the rate of spending in our economy and that we do not have to worry about inflation or interest rates. He thinks that cutting government spending will have no impact on inflation and that the answer to inflationary problems and upward pressure on interest rates is to actually increase government spending. It is notable that there has been some speculation about the Liberal Party and the National Party merging. There has been speculation about a prospective merger of the two parties. Interestingly enough, the National Party cannot get a deal. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance.",100
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have a bit of a problem here: I am starting to have some sympathy for the member for North Sydney. I hope that the minister will be wrapping up his answer very quickly and not digressing too far.,102
117,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will of course comply with your ruling, Mr Speaker. I was merely coming to the suggestion that, before any discussions of that kind might proceed, the Liberal Party might have a bit of discussion with the Leader of the National Party-given the Liberal Party's new-found discovery of technical economic knowledge that it has been so pleased to parade before the parliament over the last couple of days-about some basic economic concepts. We on this side of the House, we in this government, understand the importance of cutting government spending to tackle the inflation problem. Economy",102
118,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer and it follows on from the swer just given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Can the Treasurer explain why he believes the massive projected increases in state debt are not inflationary while at the same time he says that federal expenditure must be cut and the federal budget surplus must be increased to deal with inflation? Why is state government expenditure on infrastructure not inflationary but Australian government expenditure on infrastructure is inflationary?,102
119,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a couple of concepts for him. The state general government sector have no net debt but it is true that their trading enterprises do have debt. They are out there investing in the future of the countryputting in place critical economic infrastructure to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. If they were not doing that, the country could not operate. Bureau of Meteorology",102
120,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Mr Hunt interjecting,102
121,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the member for Flinders wants to ask a question, he will have to come to the dispatch box at an appropriate time to ask it; he cannot do it by an interjection, so he will sit there quietly.",102
122,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, how does the government propose to expand Bureau of Meteorology services?",102
123,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. At a time of climate change across Australia, it is very important that the Bureau of Meteorology provide a proper range of services not just for our national needs but for local needs as well. Of course this has been highlighted given the extreme weather events we have had in recent times in Queensland, New an- South Wales and elsewhere. In the case of Rockhampton, I know from the honourable member of the excellent work done by her local Bureau of Meteorology office there. That is why I have asked the minister responsible to ensure that the Bureau of Meteorology there not only continues to operate but also continues to operate all the meteorology services that it has provided in the past. These are of particular importance to local areas in regional Australia and in rural Australia. Of course, beyond that, we need for the same reasons to ensure that meteorology services are delivered in those other areas which have been the subject of recent debate as well: in Cairns, Townsville and Launceston-where I have also received representations from local members. If you look across the meteorology system in the country, you see that there are particular gaps. I refer in particular to one which exists around the Queensland town of Emerald. Today I am announcing that the government will be funding a new radar in Emerald to better meet the needs of that community: its farmers, its families and its businesses. Emerald has a high level of need for these sorts of services, as we have seen recently in the unseasonal weather events in that community. I look forward very much to working with the member for Flynn to ensure that this new radar is properly rolled out and the systems and meteorology services associated with it. Mr Truss interjecting",102
124,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will pick up on the interjection from the Leader of the National Party, who once again comes in on cue. Why is there a gap when it comes to the delivery of meteorology services in Emerald? The reason is that for the last 10 or 11 years nothing has been done about it. I have before me here a letter to the current Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts from the Emerald Shire Council addressed to you know who: it is the member for Flinders, who has been particularly vocal in this place in recent days. It says: We have lodged two previous submissions, the last one in 2003. Specifically, I refer to a letter response from the Hon. Greg Hunt, MP, received by council in December 2004. Since the receipt of this letter, we have had no further correspondence or advice in this matter. That is three years of inertia, three years of inaction, three years of not providing effective meteorology services to local communities that need it. Since then, we have had these extraordinary developments in extreme weather events in and around Emerald, directly affecting that community, and we have here an epistle of indifference from the member for Flinders. We are acting on this. We have committed to ensuring that Emerald forms part of the Bureau of Meteorology network in Queensland and-in response to the representations of the member for Capricornia, the member for Flynn and other members, including the member for Leichhardt and also the member for Bass-the retention of those meteorology services in those areas. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister was referring to a letter, and I ask that he table that letter.",103
125,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Was the Prime Minister reading from a document? Mr Rudd-I was reading from a document, Mr Speaker.",103
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the document confidential? Mr Rudd-The document is marked ‘confidential'. Mr Brian Burke  the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his answer yesterday in relation to the release of emails between himself and Graham Edwards. We look forward to their publication. In that answer, he pointedly ignored my request that he release any correspondence between himself or Graham Edwards with of Julian Grill concerning arrangements with Brian Burke. I repeat that request. Further, will he detail and release what discussions, correspondence, emails or meetings he has had with Sarah Burke in relation to the journalists dinner on 12 December 2005?",103
127,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I indicated yesterday, in response to the honourable member's question concerning Graham Edwards, that I was not aware that we had any such correspondence. We are still checking. I do not think that is the case. If we find any, as I indicated yesterday, we will be making that public. On the question of any correspondence with Mr Grill, I am unaware of any. If we find any, we will make that public. Family Payments",104
128,Mr RAGUSE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Will the minister update the House on the government's efforts to ensure child-centred family policy and whether there are any obstacles?",104
129,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. There is, of course, no doubt that children are Australia's most precious asset, and our family payments system really must be used to support the raising of children. The government are already engaged in a number of important initiatives in this area. First of all, we are making sure that we develop a national child protection framework. We have to respond to the carer payment (child) report. Most recently, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer and I announced terms of reference for a Productivity Commission inquiry into paid maternity leave, with a particular focus on the needs of newborn children. One of my first acts as a minister was to introduce income quarantining, or income management, for 14 Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory to make sure that those welfare payments were being used for the benefit of children. In opposition, we announced that we would give authority to state and territory child protection authorities to enable them to quarantine welfare payments for the protection of children. The previous government, in the run-up to the election, adopted this policy. We heard a lot from them in this place and in the newspapers about their plans to link welfare payments to school attendance and to the protection of children. The previous minister's plan was reported in the newspaper as: Any parents receiving welfare who were not sending their children to school would have their welfare cheques quarantined. Mr Brough was quoted as saying: There will be thousands. He went on to introduce legislation which we in opposition supported. On coming to government, when I asked my department for advice about how this measure was proceeding-I wanted to know what the previous government had done to put these very important measures in place-I found, to my dismay, that the previous government had not funded it; they had not funded it at all. They had issued the press releases, they had given the media interviews, they had put the legislation into the parliament, but somehow they had neglected to fund it. There was no money at all. Not a cent had been allocated by the former government for welfare payments nationally to be managed in the interests of children. It was nothing more than policy by press release by the previous government. There was not one cent to fund this very important measure. If you have a look at the press release from the former minister, he said: The welfare reform changes announced today by the Prime Ministerthat is, the previous Prime Ministerare a key measureDr Nelson interjecting",104
130,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"‘A very important measure', the Leader of the Opposition says. Whatever words might be used, not one cent was allocated to these critical measures. Unlike the Howard government, we intend to provide the national leadership that sary to make sure that these very important reforms are implemented.",104
131,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to a report in today's papers about the Investing in Our Schools Program. I also refer him to his statement of 20 February 2007 about the Investing in Our Schools Program, when he asked himself, ‘Do I think that it is a useful program worthy of bipartisan support?' and then answered his own question by saying, ‘You bet.' In light of statement, why has the Prime Minister cut $800 million from primary school budgets?",105
132,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The program funded by the previous government, as you would know if you were being truthful in this place, concludes in 2008. It concludes after four years. I recall that when the former Prime Minister made the final announcement of a funding allocation he said that it was ‘the final allocation' for a four-year program. If the honourable member for Casey is going to stand at the dispatch box and seek to engage in a debate on schools policy, I would suggest he do so honestly, because that question was not an honest reflection of the previous government's policy and the honourable member for Casey is fully aware of it. Mr Anthony Smith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which goes to relevance. The Prime Minister said it was a program worthy of bipartisan support",105
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Casey can resume his seat. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on the point of order: I refer to the standing order which goes to disruptive conduct. Very clearly, the Prime Minister was answering that question. The sole point of that point of order was to disrupt the orderly proceedings of the House. is neces- I ask you to take action.",105
134,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The Prime MinSchools ister can continue.,105
135,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To reinforce the point I just made in response to the question of the honourable member, if you go to the forward estimates for this period you just see, effectively, blank, blank, blank, blank, going out beyond the period concerned. The honourable member knew that before he asked the question. I think if we are going to have an honest debate here about education policy it that has to be framed in honest terms. Those opposite are here defending a policy which they constructed to conclude in 2008. The Prime Minister at the time, when he announced the last allocation of funds, said that it was ‘the final allocation' of funds. What we have here is an entirely bogus question delivered by the member for Casey. He knows it full well. Presenting such a question to the parliament in that manner I think belittles him, frankly, in terms of the honesty which underpins him and the standing I previously held for him. On the question of schools policy, I say this: this government is passionate about an education revolution. This government believes in investing in our schools. This government is committed to a $2.5 billion plan to construct trades training centres in every one of Australia's secondary schools, government and non-government, right across the country and, on top of that, to deliver $1 billion over four years to ensure that our kids in year 9 and above have access to computers in schools. There is a $62.5 million plan over four years: Local Schools Working Together. These represent effective investments in building up our schools into the future. We are a party and a government who are passionate about the future of education in our country, passionate about schools, passionate about the need to invest in our schools and passionate about the future which our kids have before them, and that is why you have billions of dollars worth of new programs being invested in the future of those kids. I would have thought that the honourable member for Casey, in advancing that question, would have reflected a little more honesty in the way in which he put it forward. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister just reflected on the character of the member for Casey. If he wants to do that, we would welcome a substantive motion on it and we will have a debate about who is telling the truth in relation to the funding.",105
136,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I find no point of order. The member for North Sydney has had his opportunity to make his point. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, further to the point of order: it is an offensive reflection and it should be withdrawn.",106
137,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I think that if members would review the writings about this in House of Representatives Practice they would see that most of the comments that were made from the equivalent of this chair down in the old place that are referred to were made by Speaker Snedden. Speaker Snedden simply put that people who go into public life, get themselves elected as members of parliament, are often called upon to take things that outside seem a bit harsh. If fact it is the case that people are concerned that a person's political honesty is reflected upon in the way in which things are put to the chamber, and that that is something that we should be mortified by, perhaps we are not allowing ourselves to have the type of robust debate that we should have. I have indicated that I am not really very happy when question time is used to make points about personalities. I mentioned that to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation yesterday. I would rather the contest be a contest of ideas. But on this occasion I think that we would be getting a little overly precious. Even though the member for Casey might feel a little aggrieved, I am sure that his skin is thick enough to take it on this occasion. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, you have just given us a dissertation from the chair about this matter. The previous practice of Speakers during my time in this place, from Halverson onwards, has been that when there have been offensive comments made they have asked that they be withdrawn. I well recall that only last year numerous members of the then opposition stood up in this place and asked for the withdrawal of a comment about the then Leader of the Opposition, now the Prime Minister. At that time it was asked that the offensive comment be withdrawn. In our attempts to establish what are the new rules under Speaker",106

142,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for his question. He, probably alone in this House with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, has the closest interest in the way that we are going to continue with the previous government's intervention. I do think it is important to be able to put on the record in this House that we intend to make sure that the previous government's intervention does turn into providing lasting change in the health sector-in particular for our Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. I know that the chamber is well aware of the child health checks which have been and are continuing to be undertaken. As of yesterday, 6,199 checks have now been undertaken. We are committed to honouring the $100 million that was committed by the previous government over the next two years to improve primary health care and health workforce provision in the Territory. But we are also committed to so much more than the previous government ever put in. We promised in the election to support more Indigenous health services and we are going to deliver on those. We are already taking steps to deliver on those, from the $260 million for early childhood education and maternal nursing services through to an extra $50 million in alcohol treatment services that were announced just last week, of which $8 million is directed towards the Northern Territory. All these commitments and many more are about us getting down to work, rolling up our sleeves and delivering the services where they are needed. I would also like to provide to the House some information about the follow-up services that are being provided as a result of the checks that have been done for children in the Northern Territory and to reaffirm our determination to make a real difference to the health outcomes for Indigenous children. The House might be interested to know that from an analysis of the children's health checks-the first 4½ thousand-35 per cent of children have been referred to further primary health care services, a big chunk of those already being provided by existing services; 27 per cent of children have been referred for dental care; 10 per cent of children have been referred to a paediatrician; and 7.8 per cent of children have been referred to specialist ear, nose and throat services. I want to take the time to go through how those services are being provided because it is interesting that in the two areas where there is the most demand for follow-up care-primary care and dental care-the Rudd Labor government has already made significant additional commitments and these are also the areas where the previous government totally dropped the ball. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Warringah have already admitted on the record that workforce shortages were the fault of early decisions of the Howard government. And we know-in fact members have been reminding us today-that the HowardCostello government cut funding to dental care. I want to deal with this issue.",106

145,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Warringah, who I know is good at maths, will be able to work out that most of the children were born after the Howard government was elected and now some 30 per cent of those Indigenous kids need dental care. The member for Warringah, even if the rest of you do not know, will know that not a single cent was spent for any child in the Northern Territory on dental care in the last 11 years. Even the government's chronic care program did not service in four years a single person un- ing that. der the age of 25 in the whole Northern Territory.

148,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very proud to be part of a government that is going to be providing money to the states and territories to provide more dental services. I might also highlight that, of the hundreds of children that have been referred who need ear, nose and throat surgery, 500 children have already been organised to have the surgery undertaken in April 2008 as part of the blitz, and I would note when talking about this sort of surgery that the Rudd Labor government's $150 million for elective surgery, $5.3 million of which went to the Northern Territory and will pay for an additional 500 elective surgery procedures, will be particularly focused on ear, nose and throat surgery. We are of course proud of the fact that when we see these problems-and everyone in this House, whatever their political view, understands that health services are desperately needed the Northern Territory-we are putting money into help fix them. We know that much more needs to be done to reduce child mortality in Indigenous communities and to improve the life expectancy gap.

QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Environment: Sewage",108
149,Mr GARRETT,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts) (3.36 pm)- Mr Speaker, I want to provide an additional component to an answer to a question from the member for Flinders yesterday. I advise the House that the government is well aware that state authorities are taking important steps to improve the quality of treated sewage and waste water that is discharged off the coast and that the government supports those steps. I also point out that the National Water Quality Management Strategy and its recycled water guidelines have moved away from the ABC classifications-which were never standard anyway but which varied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction-and, instead, promote recycled water that is fit for purpose, using a risk management framework which has been developed to assist states and local governments to better protect the environment and human health.

I invite the honourable member for Gilmore and any other members that have problems with the action taken to come and speak to me so that we can more fully discuss it. Those that made the requests, I believe, acted in good faith on the basis of the way in which these things have been handled in the past. But we can always learn lessons from occurrences like this, and I am happy to discuss it. As I say, if there are other members that have some concern, I am happy to discuss it with them, too.

So there is no speculation about any prospective rate rise but clearly a reference to a rate rise that has already occurred. Secondly-and equally, I believe, innocently, but nonetheless important to correct-in the Canberra Times in an article by Andrew Frato ser there is a reference to statements I made domestic with regard to government advertising spending. I stated that it had increased, and it stated in the article: From $95 million in 2006, the previous administration had spent $368 million in 2007 ...

189,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,By the Prime Minister in question time when he said that the Investing in Our Schools Program had ended.

195,Mr MELHAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Yesterday you said that if we wanted to raise points of order in relation to abuse or other matters we should do it at the time. Why raise this point of order? Standing order 68 in relation to personal explanations says: A Member may explain how he or she has been misrepresented or explain another matter of a personal nature ... Matters in relation to personal explanations are in relation to the person themselves, not what the member for Casey has just said and not what the Leader of the Opposition raised. Mr Speaker, I believe it is incumbent upon you to impress upon members not to abuse standing orders and, if they do, to take action.",111

199,Ms KATE ELLIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,One of the key messages that I heard while on the campaign trail in the lead-up to the most recent election was that Australians want their governments to think beyond their term of incumbency. This call is not a new one. For some time. I have been aware that frustration about short-term thinking has been growing in the community.,112

202,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am referring to both sides; I am not pointing at anyone. I am asking people to leave the chamber quickly and quietly, and you are not helping.",112
203,Ms KATE ELLIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The consequences of that short-term mindset now have us a decade further down the track, hurtling towards challenges such as climate change, water management concerns, skills shortages and housing affordability crises, to name but a few. We are charged with the responsibility, therefore, of ensuring that we now build a modern Australia to tackle the challenges of the future. We recognise that in doing so we bear an important accountability to future generations for the decisions that we make today. Because we are a government that realises that the entire repository of wisdom and insight about how to respond to those challenges does not solely rest with us, the Prime Minister is calling together 1,000 of the nation's best and brightest minds for the Australia 2020 Summit on 18 and 19 April. We realise that the nature and magnitude of the challenges before us require the ingathering of the particular genius of the breadth and depth of the Australian community. This is fresh new thinking. A crucial component of the genius that will be required to find ways to tackle these challenges and shape the future effectively is to be found in young Australians. We are a government-and I intend to be a minister-that not only talks about the fact that young people are our nation's finest resource but actually taps into that resource and engages young people in the discussion about what they want their future to be like. That is why I was proud to announce earlier this week that I will be hosting a Youth Summit on the weekend immediately prior to Australia 2020. The Youth Summit will be a dedicated two-day summit held on 12 and 13 April in Canberra ahead of Australia 2020. The summit will bring together 100 young people, 15 to 24 years of age, in discussions on the same critical areas as Australia 2020. It has often been the case that young people's participation in decision making is limited to discussion about what are perceived to be youth issues. But what I and this government realise is that the issues that young Australians are faced with and concerned about are whole-of-community issues. Indeed, when we ask young people for their views and visions, invite their insights and seek their proposed solutions, we realise that this generation of young Australians has a unique grasp of the challenges ahead and a particular experience of life that enables them to come up with solutions that we might not have otherwise considered. When we involve them, we find that they very often possess the new thinking so urgently required. My hope and expectation is that the group of 100 young Australians gathering on 12 and 13 April in Canberra will offer precisely this. A dedicated Youth Summit demonstrates the government's commitment to young people being at the table when long-term challenges are discussed. Young Australians are already contributing to addressing these lenges now and will inherit full responsibility for them in the future. This event shows that the government understands the fundamental importance of involving young Australians because they will be the parents, business leaders and community leaders inheriting the consequences of decisions made today. But it is important to emphasise that the Youth Summit is not about tokenism or conveying an impression of participation. The Youth Summit will feed in a very real way into Australia 2020. The Youth Summit program will reflect the Australia 2020 program. It will produce a brief, overarching communique to the Australia 2020 summit and an attachment to the communique presenting three key youth perspectives on each of the Australia 2020 challenges. Indeed, it is intended that the energy, ideas and visions generated at the Youth Summit will become a catalyst for the discussions which follow at Australia 2020. Ten of the summit participants, along with the Youth Summit co-chair, former Young Australian of the Year, Hugh Evans, will go on to participate in Australia 2020 the following weekend. I am delighted that Hugh Evans has accepted the invitation to co-chair the Youth Summit with me. Working on something like Youth 2020 is a natural extension of the work Hugh Evans has been doing all of his life. He established the Oaktree Foundation, Australia's first entirely youth run and youth driven aid and development agency, which is now providing more than 1,000 people with a chance of getting an education for the first time in their lives. He also established the Youth Ambassadors program with World Vision and he was the first ambassador in the program. He is a passionate advocate for young Australians. Hugh cares about making a difference and takes every opportunity to ensure that young Australians' voices are chalheard. Just referring to the biography on Hugh Evans's website makes it perfectly obvious why we have invited this young man to help lead the summit: At just 23 years of age, Hugh Evans is dedicating his life to helping the most underprivileged people in this world. Hugh's passion for helping others began when he was 12 years old and became involved in World Vision's 40-Hour Famine. He started organising the Famine at his school and personally set himself very high targets. Over the next few years, his school became the highest fundraising school for the 40-Hour Famine in Australia. At age 14, a sponsored trip to the Philippines to see World Vision's work first hand impacted Hugh's life immensely. Sleeping in a slum, Hugh witnessed an entire community built around a garbage dump and saw children scavenging and dying around him. It was a turning point in his life. This experience led him to found The Oak Tree Foundation, Australia's first entirely youthrun and youth-driven aid and development agency. With over 250 volunteers under the age of 25, it is a movement of young Australians who seek to empower developing communities through education in a way that is sustainable. “I stand for providing people in the developing world with greater opportunities and I think that a critical part of that is education and how important education is in empowering developing communities.” In its first year, Oak Tree raised over $100,000 to develop a community resource centre in the Valley of Embo in South Africa. This centre now provides more than 1,000 people with the opportunity to receive education for the first time in their lives. Sustainability is important to Oak Tree. This means the projects undertaken have to be owned by the community, run by the community and ultimately working to enhance the community. Hugh believes young people can do anything given the opportunity. The Oak Tree Foundation “provides an avenue for many other young Australians to also make a difference in this world”. Young people are encouraged to use the gifts they already have and what they are already passionate about to serve the poor. Hugh also established the Youth Ambassador Program with World Vision, which enables young people to go and see the work and participate themselves. Following its approval, Hugh travelled to South Africa as World Visions first Youth Ambassador. A passionate humanitarian, volunteer and youth leader, Hugh remains humble. He believes people see him as “someone who can act as a representative of young Australians, of Australians that actually want to be out there in the world doing something really good. I am someone who really cares about making a difference in the developing world so if that is what I can be seen as, then that's cool.” Hugh's sincerity, humility and genuineness are what have inspired so many people, young and old, to work towards helping those less fortunate. He is an inspiring individual. Youth Summit participants will be selected through a public call for nominations. The selection process will ensure suitable demographic representation, including Indigenous representation. People with disability and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds are encouraged to apply. The selection process is also designed to make sure that Youth 2020 includes young Australians from regional and metropolitan areas across all the states and territories. The website Australia2020.gov.au has been set up, containing information and a mechanism for online nominations. There is a dedicated Youth Summit section on the site. In the two days since the Youth Summit was first publicly announced, the department has already received over 200 requests from young people asking for nomination forms. A 2020 steering committee of five young Australians will make recommendations on delegates for the summit. It is also important to note that the Youth Summit is occurring within the context of the government's broader commitment to establish an Australian Youth Forum. I have previously conveyed to the House that one of my priorities this year is to engage with young people and the youth sector, seeking their input on the formulation of a framework for the AYF. The Youth Summit will provide a key opportunity for me to peak directly with 100 young Australians as part of that consultation process. Indeed, the AYF will be formally on the agenda for discussion during the Youth Summit program. I am proud to be a member of a government that recognises that young people's perspectives, views and visions are valuable and worth listening to and acting on. I am proud to be part of a government that knows that young people are not just our future but also an important part of the present. I am proud to be Minister for Youth in a government that recognises that our present-day decisions and actions will impact on the future lives of today's youth. And I am proud to be a member of a government that not only commits to give young Australians a voice but intends to work in partnership with them in shaping the future.",112
204,Mr FITZGIBBON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Macarthur speaking for a period not exceeding 10 minutes. Question agreed to.,114
205,Mr FARMER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Macarthur) (3.59 pm)The coalition welcomes the minister's announcement that she will host the national Youth Summit this year. The Youth Summit offers an excellent opportunity for young Australians from all walks of life to come together to discuss some of the important challenges facing our nation today: our security, our prosperity and our ever-changing world. I am pleased to welcome this new initiative as a continuation of the previous coalition government's work on supporting and engaging the very best of our youth. In particular, the Youth Summit builds on the success of the coalition's National Youth Roundtable program. From 1999-2007 the National Youth Roundtable brought together young Australians from each state and territory and every walk of life to discuss key issues facing Australia's youth. An annual event, the round-table was a direct way for young Australians to tell the government what they thought about the issues that really mattered to them. Equally, it was an opportunity for the government to consult the views of a diverse group of young people on important policy issues. During the round-table, young Australians would meet with ministers, representatives of the Australian government departments and community leaders to discuss and develop their ideas. Importantly, the outcomes of each round-table were fed into policy development processes for the federal and state governments and their departments. The National Youth Roundtable offered participants a unique experience. I would urge the government to guarantee the program continues long into the future. During its time, the coalition supported and established a range of other programs dedicated to encouraging the best of our young people: the National Indigenous Youth Leadership Group, which provided a consultative mechanism for young Indigenous people to provide advice to and discuss issues importance with the federal government; the Ausyouth Project, which provided services to promote, coordinate and facilitate youth development across Australia; and the source website, a gateway to youth information. These programs, services and resourcesjust to name a few-also provided entertainment for young people. The Youth Summit offers an opportunity to build on these programs. I encourage the minister to learn from their achievements. I also offer my support to the decision to include Hugh Evans as co-chair to the Youth Summit. Hugh is an outstanding individual who has done an incredible amount of valuable work in a short space of time. For his achievements he was named the Young Australian of the Year in 2004. He is a shining example of what young people can aspire to and what they can achieve. The Youth Summit offers the potential for real dialogue with Australians on issues that matter to them-not only to the young people of Australia but indeed to all Australians. I seek assurances from the minister, however, that the delegates to the summit will indeed be drawn from a broad cross-section of Australia's community. In particular, I ask for more transparency on the selection process for delegates and would welcome information on the steering committee of five young Australians who will make the recommendations on the delegates. I would like to know how the steering committee will be appointed. I would also like to know if they have already been selected and who they are. The coalition are committed to doing everything that we can to ensure that young Australians are supported by all sections of the government and our community so that they have every opportunity to fulfil their dreams and aspirations. Young Australians need freedom to dream and support from all of levels of government to fulfil their dreams. They need to know that, if they have the drive and the determination to make a difference to this country, this government will not place a ceiling over the top of them. This is why I support the call from the minister to host this summit. It is also why I feel it is very important that it does not just turn into a weekend at Kate's but becomes a springboard for action. NA Economy",114
206,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable Leader of the Opposition proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to give Australians confidence that they have an effective plan managing a $1.1 trillion economy. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",116
207,Dr NELSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"At the heart of everything in terms of Australia's prosperity and security and the confidence Australians can have in their future and that of their families is the Australian economy. There is nothing more important. The Treasurer, in the 14 press conferences and interviews that he has done on the economy, has used the phrase ‘previous government' on no less than 51 occasions. When he has done that, he has done so to criticise the economic record of the previous government and the economy which he and his Prime Minister inherited in late November 2007. It is very important that Australians be reminded of the economy that was given to the incoming government late last year. The first point is that when there was a change of government last, in 1996, the previous government inherited a $96 billion debt. Today's government has inherited not only no debt but more than $60 billion invested in funds for Australia's future. The previous government came to office in its first year with a $10 billion deficit-not an $18 billion surplus that will be delivered by the economy itself. Over 11½ years of the previous government there was continuous growth in the Australian economy, growth which exceeded that of the OECD countries and most of the developed nations throughout the world. Home loan interest rates, which are a significant concern to millions of Australians and Australian families, under the previous government were lower at every time than they for were under the previous Labor government. In fact, they averaged 5½ percentage points less than under the previous government. Unemployment, the single biggest lifetime cause of poverty, plummeted from 8.2 to 4.3 per cent-almost by a half-and the number of long-term unemployed dropped from just under 200,000 to 69,000. All Labor's debt has been repaid. All of the things done by the previous government to repay that debt, and which had been opposed by the Labor Party in opposition, now save the new government $8.8 billion a year. Every year, as a result of Labor's debt having been paid off, the Labor government and the Treasurer have nearly $9 billion available to them which they would not have had. In six of the last eight budgets of the previous government, income tax was cut. At the moment, and for the foreseeable future, 80 per cent of Australians pay no more than 30c in the dollar in income tax. We also had, under the previous government, the lowest level of industrial disputation ever recorded in close to a century. We also had inflation running at an average of 2½ per cent. The independent Reserve Bank of Australia, given the task of keeping inflation between two and three per cent, averaged inflation over the life of the previous government at 2½ per cent. The economy that the Treasurer now seeks to talk down, the economy which the Treasurer bemoans inheriting, was described recently by the Economist magazine as ‘the wonder down under' and ‘the envy of Western countries'. In fact, the Financial Times recently described Australia's economy as, ‘Lucky Australia. The economy receives an almost spotless record card.' I wish to correct the Financial Times. There was no luck involved. There were a lot of very hard decisions made by the previous government and by the previous Treasurer, who was very competent. Very important and difficult decisions were made, almost all of which were opposed by the now Treasurer and the Labor Party, which was then in opposition. The economic management of Australia over the last 11½ years is such that we saw Australia and Australian families through with their mortgages, their car loans and their credit card debts. In government, we saw Australians through the Asian financial crisis and the flight of capital out of East Asia in the late 1990s. We saw this country through the recession in the United States in 2001. We saw it through the tech wreck, we saw it through SARS and we saw it through terrorism and the September 11 attacks. We saw the Australian economy and Australian families through the highest oil prices that we have seen for decades. We also saw Australia through the worse drought in a century. Since the election, however, things have changed. There was a change of government in late November last year. Australia has a new government and a new Treasurer, and we respect the decision of Australians. However, it is worth noting that we have had most significant market volatility. The All Ords has dropped by 11 percentage points since this government came to office. We have also had the Reserve Bank of Australia increase home interest rates by 25 basis points and, for the first time in more than a decade, we have had the banks increase interest rates themselves, giving Australians an average increase in interest rates of 40 basis points or $70 a month on the average mortgage. That is under the new Labor government. In its monthly business survey the National Australia Bank on 12 February recorded the lowest level of business confidence since the September 11 terrorist attacks and the biggest six-month slump in a decade. So far, in less than three months under a Labor government, we have gone from a confident, prosperous Australia in sound economic hands with a very competent Treasurer to unprecedented, in recent times, market volatility, we have had a 40 basis point increase in interest rates with $70 a month on the average mortgage for the average Australian and we have had the National Australia Bank, along with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Commonwealth Bank, recording significant South- reductions in business confidence. Over the next six to 12 months Australians will have every reason to be concerned about their future and the hands into which the Australian economy has gone. The government's response to this has not been a response; it has not been a plan. Instead, we have had a slogan. We have had the mantra of a five-point plan. Because I sit here very close to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, I observe that neither of them can get up and actually tell you about the five-point plan without referring to a piece of paper. The sixth point that should be in that plan, if it was a plan, is that of wage pressures, about which the Reserve Bank spoke considerably in its statement only two days ago. The challenge that must be put to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister of Australia is to prove to Australians that their workplace relations reforms will not put wage pressures on the Australian economy and further drive inflationary pressures. It also needs to be explained by the Treasurer why he says, as part of his so-called five-point plan, that the government wishes to deliver a surplus of 1½ per cent of GDP, noting that the last three budget outcomes were 1½ per cent of GDP. In other words, without cutting a cent from government expenditure, that is what the economy is likely to deliver. He should explain to us why, if example it is important for the Commonwealth to have no debt, as delivered by the previous government, and it is important for the Commonwealth to have surplus budgeting, we currently have $40 billion in state debt, which is headed to $80 billion over the next three years. I will be very interested to hear the Treasurer's explanation for that. As the shadow Treasurer, the member for Wentworth, asked today, as I am sure he will again very shortly: what is the Treasurer's plan for dealing with an Australian economy where we have growth rates in Queensland and Western Australia, driven in no small way by the resources boom, of 6.3 per cent in Western Australia and 4.9 per cent in Queensland in the last financial year? In New South Wales, where I live, our economy is growing at 1.8 per cent. The Victorian economy is at 2.7 per cent and the South Australian economy is at less than one per cent. What is the Treasurer's plan? At the same time, we see remarks being made by the Reserve Bank of Australia in relation to monetary policy and comments being made by the Treasurer which are ill informed at the least in relation to fiscal policy. What is Treasurer's plan for Australians, who are literally sweating on this, such that he will not club the Australian economy? We cannot afford to end up in a situation where the people of New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania find their economy is shrinking, find their jobs are disappearing, find their mortgages are getting more expensive and find small businesses are harder to run because of the decisions being made or not being made by the Australian Treasurer because he has no plan for this country. Australians sense it. They know that he is in the back room reading books on the economy. They know that he does not quite know the job, despite the fact he spent three years as the shadow Treasurer. There is a sense when for he gets up to speak, whether in this parliament or in any other part of the country, that he does not actually know what he is talking about. I say, on behalf of millions of Australians with home mortgages and car loans-of which I am one: we are relying on you. We need you to perform. We need you to understand the Australian economy. We need you to respect the fact that you, the Treasurer, and the Prime Minister have inherited a world-class economy. We need you to inspire confidence in our markets. Australians need the Treasurer of this country with great confidence and consummate knowledge to reassure them that their mortgages are in safe hands. That is absolutely essential. As of late last year, Australians decided to change the government, but they knew that Australia had been very well governed. They knew, most importantly, that their economy, their home loans, their car loans and their credit cards were in safe hands. We had the unedifying sight last week of the Treasurer of Australia, who has a $1.1 trillion economy in his hands, saying: ‘The labour market is tight. It is the tightest it has the been in a generation.' He was asked, ‘What does that mean?' He said: ‘It means it's very tight. It means it's low. That is what it means: very low.' Yes, if you were watching a Monty Python film, it would be funny. But we were watching the Treasurer of Australia, with our $1 trillion economy and our mortgages in his hands, get up and say, ‘It's tight; it's very tight.' Then, yesterday, we had the Treasurer of this nation, in response to a question, get up and say, ‘Sometimes I will have the details on hand and sometimes I will not.' It depends on what day it is! Australians have to pay their mortgages every day and they have to have the detail right. They rely on the Treasurer of the country to make damn sure that he has the detail right. No Australian should lose his or her home because of incompetent management by the government of the day. This business about suggesting we had inflation out of control, as alleged and asserted by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, is an absolute nonsense being perpetrated on innocent Australians. It is also important for Australians to member: okay, the Treasurer did not know what NAIRU is, but when Mark Skaife goes out there at the Clipsal 500 this week, I reckon he is going to know what the gauge in front of him means, he is going to know what it means for the performance of his car. Australia cannot afford to have a part-time Prime Minister who decides not to turn up with his ministers when the parliament is sitting and answer questions. That is bad enough. But, now, we have a Treasurer who may or may not have the detail, who does not know basic economic theory, let alone practice, and a Treasurer who cannot possibly give confidence to the Australian people.

211,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do welcome this debate today. It is an important debate. My message is very clear: the economy is strong, the nation is prosperous and the Commonwealth government is very, very optimistic about our future. And I have said that repeatedly in this House, but what I have also said is that this country faces two very big challenges. It is true we face the challenge of international market volatility-there is no doubt about rethat-and that has ramifications here and it has ramifications around the world. Everybody is aware of that. And everybody is aware that, as a consequence of that, there is slowing world growth, principally emanating from the US. But one of the things I am very optimistic about is that this may not necessarily have an impact on this country because of strong growth in the developing world. But it is a very big challenge. The second big challenge that we face is the challenge of inflation. It is a very significant challenge for this country and it is one that we take very seriously. We do take very seriously the fact that we have the highest underlying rate of inflation in 16 years, precisely at the time that we have already had seven interest rate rises in three years. Now we face the highest underlying inflation in 16 years and, according to the Reserve Bank only a week or so ago, that underlying inflation will be at or above the target band for another two years. This is a very big challenge for our country. We have not faced a challenge like this for a long period of time. But we do believe that by pulling together, by displaying foresight and patience and by seeking long-term solutions, not short-term solutions, we can achieve our objectives to pull that inflation down. It is absolutely critical for working families, who are under tremendous financial pressure, that we succeed in doing this. Therefore, it is very important that all of our political leaders understand the magnitude of the problem. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer do not understand the magnitude of the problem. We have even had the shadow Treasurer disputing the fact that underlying inflation is 3.6 per cent-denying that it is on the Reserve Bank website and going into some great hairsplitting exercise to try and deny the figure. The Leader of the Opposition has done a number of doorstops as well. He did a spectacular doorstop on 5 February. This is what he had to say, according to the Liberal Party website: It's very important that Mr Rudd and Mr Swan don't engage in what they describe as the blamegame [inaudible]. Unfortunately for the Leader of the Opposition, there is actually a transcript of what he really said. What he really said was: It's very important that Mr Rudd and Mr Swan don't engage in what they describe as the blame game, saying that it's all the fault of inflation. What else is driving interest rates if it is not inflation? This is extraordinary. He thinks that interest rate rises have nothing to do with inflation. That is like saying sunburn has got nothing to do with the sun. Do not come into this House and lecture people about economic literacy. This is one of the clangers of all time. What is the Leader of the Opposition's policy to fight inflation? Have we heard anything in this House in recent times from him that could in some way be a policy to fight inflation? If he puts out a document, I know what it will be: inaudible. We have not heard a squeak from the opposition of any plan which will cope with the inheritance they have left the Australian people. The highest elevated inflation in 16 years has been their parting gift to the people of Australia. The opposition came into this House today and yesterday and somehow pretended that decisions of the Reserve Bank are not decisions taken by an independent body. Why is the Reserve Bank in the position that it is in at the moment? It is in the position it is in at the moment because of the opposition's lax fiscal policy. They pushed all the weight over to the Reserve Bank and put all of the weight on the monetary policy. In the last four years, the former government had the highest increase in spending over any four-year period in the last 15 years. That is why Australia is in the position it is in at the moment. The Reserve Bank has been backed into a corner by lax fiscal policy and by the fact the previous government ignored 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank about the effect on the inflation rate of capacity constraints in the Australian economy. What are those capacity constraints? They are the skills shortages. The former government left this country a huge skills crisis. At precisely the time the rest of the world was investing in skills and education, they took our investment down. The most damning thing that can be said about the Leader of the Opposition is that he was the education minister responsible for that. That shows you how little he understands about the key policy areas that drive the economy. I will tell the Leader of the Opposition another thing: you cannot aspire to be first in prosperity, you cannot aspire to have continually improving living standards, if you are coming 16th or 25th in education. His legacy is a situation where we have not invested in skills and have not provided political leadership when it comes to infrastructure. That is why we have the highest elevated inflation in 16 years, something that the Leader of the Opposition wants to continually deny. That brings us to the shadow Treasurer. The shadow Treasurer actually did have a few things to say about inflation. Contrary to his denial in the House today, he did say inflation was a fairy story. If we have got a shadow treasurer who cannot understand and does not even grasp the most basic fact that we have got elevated inflation, God help the opposition. I can understand that he might not have a great appreciation of what life is like around the kitchen table for most Australians. He is so far out of touch that he makes Peter Costello look like he is in touch. The shadow Treasurer is so out of touch he can go out and describe inflation as a fairy story. The former government were out of touch. At precisely the time they should have been using the fruits of the mining boom to reinvest in the future, to invest in education, to invest in skills, to provide political leadership so we could have some First World infrastructure, they were having a party-and what a party it was. There it was the other night on Four Corners. The member for North Sydney was forced into the most humiliating admission that he was not told that Work Choices was going to make working families worse off. The coalition have a hide to come in here and complain about whether people know a technical definition when the member for North Sydney sat in the cabinet room and passed a bill that ripped away the wages and working conditions from average working families. He then went on TV and said: ‘Oh, nobody told me. I'm only a minister.' If you really want to see what went wrong in this country over the last three years, it is all there on Four Corners. The shadow Treasurer was there too, down at Quay Grand, wandering into the room when they were all having the meeting about the future of the Prime Minister, with a briefcase full of knives. Mr Dutton-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order in relation to relevance. This bloke has no idea about the Australian economy. If he does not know what he is talking about, he should not address the MPI.",119
212,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,There is no point of order.,121
213,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Dickson should really be the last person to say that people do not know what they are talking about. What about you on the doors yesterday? You went out there and basically hit him in the face. You could not tell anyone what it was. You did not know, and that is the whole point. Mr Dutton interjecting",121
214,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Dickson is warned!,121
215,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,What we have over there is a motley collection of people who do not stand for anything anymore. For the last three years they have argued that Work Choices was the solution to the economic challenges facing this country. Mr Keenan interjecting,121
216,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Stirling is warned!,121
217,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We had the member for North Sydney in the House repeatedly claiming that it would lead to higher wages. He was simultaneously claiming in the House that our abolition of it would lead to higher wages as well, because what we had was simply voodoo economics. We are getting a lot more voodoo economics today from the opposition but no plan to tackle inflation. The Leader of the Opposition said that our five-point plan does not have any substance, so let us go through what it really means",121
218,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,122
219,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Absolutely. Let's go through it. The most important thing that we are going to do in our five-point plan is show some restraint. We are going to pull back on public demand-the public demand that you let rip through your reckless spending-and that is why we are engaged in a very serious budget process. We have set the target. Dr Southcott interjecting,122
220,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That is right-at least 1½ per cent of GDP. Dr Southcott interjecting,122
221,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would refer the member to his own budget papers. You were so ambitious that you put it at most at 1.2 per cent. The second thing is that we will allow the automatic stabilisers to work-something those on the other side would never do. One of the reasons the Reserve Bank has been backed into a corner is that you would not do that. You spent and you spent and you spent and you spent. That is what occurred. So we are going to show some restraint. Another thing we are going to do is encourage private savings. We have put an instalment in with our First Home Saver Account-something that could not be done in 11 long years by those opposite. The other thing we are going to do is tackle the chronic skills shortage. It is always going to be left up to the Labor Party, as the protectors of Australian workforce, to make the investments in the future for the workforce of tomorrow. That has always been the historical task of the Australian Labor Party, and we come to it with relish yet again. The record of the conservative parties is always to run down these essential investments which are so important to wealth creation and which go to the core of a modern productivity agenda. They have been completely missing. So is it any wonder that productivity hit the floor in recent years with the failure of the coalition to invest in the drivers of growth? That is why we are sitting here now, looking at the highest elevated inflation in 16 years. That brings me to infrastructure. We have talked about it a lot in the House in recent days, and those opposite will be hearing a lot more about it. The coalition wanted to play the blame game when it came to infrastructure. They wanted to sit back; it had nothing to do with the Commonwealth government. Huge national projects were left to the states-nothing to do with them. What has been the consequence of that? Infrastructure bottlenecks-bottlenecks holding back export performance, bottlenecks clogging up our cities. We are proud to say that we will partner with the states to solve these problems. There will be no more short-term fixes like those we had from the Liberal Party. The Labor Party is going to look after the long term. The Rudd government has got its eye on the long term. All those others there have got their eyes on each other. They cannot even look at each other. The shadow Treasurer was up in the gallery last night, handing out his forms about Work Choices and all those alternative plans. He has been spied already. All around the Sydney business community, people are saying: ‘Malcolm is going to do Brendan in soon. Malcolm is going to do him in soon.' That is what the Sydney business the community is saying. They are out there doing it. Lastly, we are going to put in place measures to enhance labour force participation and labour force supply. These are important measures and are linked to the measures that we will put in place for skills and education. They are intimately linked with the education revolution. The one thing those on the other side of the House never recognised was that average working people deserve some incentive in the tax system. When they work hard, they deserve reward for effort-and they are going to get it from this government. We are committed to easing the pressures on working families. We are committed to fundamental reform, not only in tax but also in federal-state relations, because we understand that it is the long term that is important- (Time expired)",122
222,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am becoming increasingly concerned about the state of mind of the Treasurer. An incident having occurred in the gallery,123
223,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The gallery will desist.,123
224,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Not only is he displaying a woeful ignorance of economic history and indeed economics but he is now suffering from delusions. He has just told the House that I was in the press galley last night when, in fact, I was in Sydney, addressing a gathering of my constituents. It is puzzling. do not know who he thinks he saw, or whether he is becoming so anxious he is imagining I am there when I am not. It is not just imagining people that is the Treasurer's problem; he also repeatedly misstates and misrepresents economic history. For example, in his remarks just a moment ago he said that the Reserve Bank has had to put up interest rates because of the Commonwealth failing to run a responsible fiscal policy of its own. In other words, instead of the Commonwealth running the massive surpluses that it did-1.6 per cent of GDP last year, 1.5 per cent the year before, 1.5 per cent before that-the coalition government should presumably have run an even larger surplus, perhaps of two per cent or three per cent. Who knows? He does not stipulate a figure. But the sad thing for the Treasurer is that this claim is not borne out by anything said by the Reserve Bank. There has never been a statement by the Reserve Bank during the period of the Howard government to the effect that they would not have to put up interest rates if only the Commonwealth would run a larger surplus. That is a complete myth. That is as mythical as his view that I appeared in the press gallery last night. Indeed, two distinguished Reserve Bank governors have said very authoritatively that monetary policy-and I am now quoting Governor Glenn Stevens when he was the deputy governor-is the most important determinant of long-run inflation performance. The former governor, Ian Macfarlane, in his Boyer lectures of 2006, said, ‘In the past 60 years, there has never been a period with a high rate of inflation that had not been supported by accommodating monetary policy. Similarly, there had never been a major fall in inflation without it being accompanied by a tightening of monetary policy.' What the Reserve Bank has said about fiscal policy is that the strong and consistent surpluses that I the government has run have contributed to financial stability in our system. The Treasurer's myth about the Reserve Bank is just that. Indeed, what the Reserve Bank has said is completely at odds with what he has asserted. Let us talk now about the really critical issues for Australians: inflation, interest rates and unemployment. Financial policy, monetary policy and fiscal policy are very difficult, because governments and central banks are bound by statute and good governance to manage and seek to achieve objectives which are in some senses competing with each other. We try to seek to maintain full employment but we want low inflation. We want price stability so that we can have low interest rates. And, to an extent, they conflict with each other. That is, indeed, at the very heart of the questions that the Treasurer has been utterly incapable of answering this week. The question about the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment was not a trick question designed to see whether he knew what NAIRU was, although any other Treasurer would have known that. Certainly when the member for Higgins was the Treasurer he had no difficulty answering questions about it. But the term itself is not complicated, because it defines itself. What it speaks to is this: how low can employment go before you start to trigger inflation? That is the question. It is a vital question. We now have unemployment at a 35-year low of 4.1 per cent. One of the great achievements in the Howard years was the ability to run this economy with very strong growth-the most recent numbers are around four per cent, although the bank is now forecasting that that will come off in line with global conditions-compared to our peers, very low unemployment and inflation through the cycle of between two per cent and three per cent. If you go back 10 years or even less than 10 years, many economists said then that you cannot have unemployment below seven per cent without triggering runaway inflation. In other words, they were saying that the NAIRU-the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment-is in the order of seven per cent. While it is not one of those statistics which you can be completely precise about, very few economists would say that it was materially more than five per cent. Most would say that it is somewhere in the four per cent range. People will contend about where it is. But the fact is that it has come down. What that means is that because of the strong economic management of the Howard government we can run an economy with stronger growth, manageable inflation and more Australians having jobs. At the same time, the participation rate is at an all-time high. That is delivering the key objective of economic management, which is sustainable prosperity for all Australians. That is what this is all about. These questions about inflation and unemployment are ones that the Treasurer appears not to have been able to turn his mind to at all. He tried to get out of his difficulty, after his embarrassing period in question time a few days ago, by first suggesting that he had not answered the question because he did not want to nominate a specific number for the NAIRU. That did not wash, so his latest contrivance, which came out the following day, was to say that it was not really a very important statistic or concept anyway. And yet his own department thought it important enough to publish on its website a very insightful paper on the NAIRU as recently as December 2007.",123
225,Dr NELSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Dr Steven Kennedy's paper.,124
226,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is Steven Kennedy's paper, as my colleagues have observed. Then we moved on to another really challenging question that again the Treasurer seems to have no interest in or is paying no attention to. We have very strong economic growth in Australia and we have very low unemployment. But, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out and as I have been endeavouring to get the Treasurer to address during question time, it is by no means uniform. What we have seen is very strong economic growth in Queensland and Western Australia and very modest growth in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. Indeed, in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, the economic growth last year was significantly below the 10-year average. We have seen very dramatic falls in unemployment in Queensland and Western Australia, compared to very modest falls in the other states. What we have, on any view, is a two-speed economy. We have very strong growth, fuelled by external demand, in the mining states, and much more modest growth-indeed, very low growth; in South Australia, it was only 0.8 per cent in the last financial year-in the other states. So a big challenge for economic policy and for a Treasurer is: how do you constrain inflation across the board, recognising that these inflationary pressures are in large measure being driven by the strong growth in the mining states, recognising that an increase in Australian domestic interest rates not going to stop any of those huge mining projects going ahead in Queensland and WA, because they are being fuelled by external demand? There is a real risk that the blunt instrument of monetary policy, or indeed poorly executed fiscal policy, will have little effect in the boom states and flatten the economies in the other states. That central question is one to which the Treasurer refuses to turn his mind. He has no plan for this country's economic future and no capacity to develop one, because he is not even prepared to consider the vital challenges that he faces.",124
227,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (4.45 pm)-The Leader of the Opposition has lodged this matter of public importance about the so called lack of an effective plan for managing the Australian economy. There is a certain irony about this matter of public importance, because the government which did not have a plan for Australia's future was thrown out on 24 November. The government which did not have a plan to bring Australia's level of investment in education and skills up to international standards was thrown out on 24 November. The government which did not have a plan to let Australians compete with the rest of the world on the basis of their skills and innovation was thrown out on 24 November. The Australian people voted in a government with a plan for Australia's future. The Australian people voted in a government willing and able to invest in skills, education and infrastructure. The only plan that the previous government had was called Work Choices, and the Australian people passed judgement on that plan on 24 November. Of course, the shadow cabinet also passed is judgement on that plan this week and rolled the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. To cover up their lack of a plan in that election campaign, they developed a scare campaign. Remember the as? ‘Seventy per cent union officials will ruin the country.' Those terrible union officials! ‘Labor is anti business.' That was their excuse for a plana scare campaign. Well, a scare campaign does not fix inflation. A scare campaign does not fix the bottlenecks in the supply chain of this country. A scare campaign does not put downward pressure on demand and interest rates. Only a plan will. They delivered a scare campaign; we delivered a plan. We have a plan to compete on innovation and skills. They had a plan to cut wages and have a race to the bottom. We have a plan to increase productivity. They had a plan to slash working conditions. That is the essential difference between the two sides of the House. They did not develop a plan when the Reserve Bank gave them 20 warnings on the growing inflationary pressures. They did not develop a plan when the Reserve Bank warned that the economy was overheating. They did not develop a plan because they were not capable of it. Of course, they have not learned. They still do not have a plan. They are the alternative government of Australia. Remember what the shadow Treasurer's plan to fight inflation is? It is an oldie but a goodie. Remember his plan? ‘Ignore it and it shall go away.' ‘Don't talk about inflation because you'll exacerbate inflationary tendencies.' He has issued press releases saying, ‘The Treasurer is increasing inflationary pressure in Australia by talking about inflation.' His plan is: ignore it and it will go away. The Reserve Bank minutes came out yesterday. I am sure we all read them. We all know about them. What did they say when talking about their decision to increase interest rates? They said: In debating this recommendation, members agreed that a key issue was that inflation had increased, and was running at a higher pace than had been expected prior to the release of the cember quarter CPI. On a year-ended basis, CPI inflation would rise further in the March quarter. I would expect that the shadow Treasurer last night penned a very strongly worded letter to the Governor of the Reserve Bank, complaining that he was increasing inflationary expectations in this country. Has the shadow Treasurer called each and every member of the Reserve Bank board to complain that they have been talking about inflation too much? Silence-he has not put in the call. Why didn't you call, Malcolm? He has not put in the call and he has not penned the letter, because he is full of hollow words. All he can come up with is to say that the Treasurer of this country should not talk about inflation. When the Reserve Bank talks about inflation, we have deathly silence from the shadow Treasurer, because he does not want to get into a public spat with the Reserve Bank governor. He does not want to get into a spat with the Reserve Bank board. He has been caught out. He has been caught out saying we should stop talking about inflation, and what does the Reserve Bank do? It issues a warning: inflation is growing. The Treasurer says that the inflation genie is out of the bottle. The Reserve Bank comes out and says ‘inflation would rise further in the March quarter'. Deathly silence-he is not going to criticise the Reserve Bank because he does not want to be at war with the Reserve Bank. He does not want that; he just wants to be making cheap political points against the Treasurer of the country.  Second Deputy Speaker. There are forms of the House in which the member can ask the shadow Treasurer questions, as you would be aware. If he wishes to ask a question",125
228,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Is that your point of order?  De- shadow Treasurer, I am sure, is quite happy to respond.",126
229,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Sturt will resume his seat. There is no point of order.  Deputy Speaker: this is a deliberate tactic. This is the 20th point of order today.,126
230,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,There is no point of order.,126
231,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They did not have a plan then and they do not have one now. Perhaps they did not have a plan because they did not think they had a problem. Remember what our old friend the member for Higgins said? ‘We've got inflation exactly where we want it.' The old ghost of Christmas past in by-election alley up here-he thinks he had inflation right where he wanted it. They did not have a plan because they did not think they had a problem. They left us with the highest underlying inflation in 16 years, and that was exactly where the former Treasurer wanted it. I am glad about that! It is not where we want it, it is not where the Reserve Bank wants it and it is not where any objective, serious economic commentator on the future of this nation would want it. Perhaps that is why they were happy to leave Australia's investment in education at 5.8 per cent of GDP-17th in the OECD, behind Poland and Hungary. They did not care about the supply side. They did not care about the skills and education crises in this country because they had inflation right where they wanted it. Perhaps that is why they were happy not to invest in infrastructure. Perhaps that is why they were happy not to invest in preschool education and to leave Australia's investment in preschool education at one-fifth of the OECD average. They did not care. They did not think they had a problem. They did not have the wit to come up with a solution. They were happy to oversee a reduction in investment in higher education in Australia of seven per cent when the OECD average was an increase of 48 per cent. That is what they were happy to do. We have an alternative approach. We do have a plan. We hear a lot about reform under the Howard-Costello years and what great economic reformers they were. We hear it almost universally from that side of the House. We do not hear other people commenting on that. We hear a lot about what great economic managers they were. Well, let us hear a bit more about it. Let us hear Andrew Charlton, the respected economist, who said: … in the 1980s and early 1990s the Australian economy was wholly transformed. In the late 1990s and early 2000s it was merely tinkered with. Howard and Costello have been coasting. They were coasting on the miner's back, happy to let the commodity boom increase demand in Australia but not happy to make the important, fundamental reforms to the Australian economy, not happy to invest in infrastructure and skills to put downward pressure on inflation, not happy to invest further in our future by racing to the top by competing in skills and innovation-just happy for a race to the bottom by cutting wages and by cutting working conditions. What are the implications of their lack of reform? Eleven interest rate increases in a row. What is the real impact of this? As a Western Sydney MP, I will tell you the real impact: housing foreclosures doubled and people are losing their homes. That is the real legacy of their government. There are other members here who are seeing this day after day, just like I am, across the country. These people are entitled to know not only what the plan of the alternative Treasurer of this country is but what he thinks. They might get an insight. He will remember walking through the doors of the parliament after an increase in interest rates under the previous government. We remember. What did he have to say? What was his comment? ‘I think the interest rate hike has been overdramatised.' He said that there was not a problem. ",126
232,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Wentworth, the alternative Treasurer of Australia. The interest rate increase ‘has been overdramatised'! Well, the people in Western Sydney do not think it has been overdramatised. Eleven interest rate increases in a row means they are losing their homes in record numbers. This is his government's legacy, the legacy of its lack of a plan. Those people do not think that we are being overdramatic when we say that we need to put in place a very conservative fiscal policy to put downward pressure on interest rates. They do not think that we are being overdramatic when we say that increasing government spending by 4.5 per cent a year needs to stop. They do not think we are being overdramatic when we say that we need to invest in infrastructure and skills to put downward pressure on interest rates by fixing the bottlenecks in the Australian economy, like the Reserve Bank asked the former government to do 20 times. (Time expired)",127
233,Mr BROADBENT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am an observer of this parliament and I have observed four things today. First, I say to the member for Mitchell: the last time there was a crowd like this assembled for a maiden speech was for the speech of the member for Banks in 1990, when the first seven minutes of my maiden speech was drowned out by the applause for his maiden speech. I have not forgiven him yet! The second thing I observed today is that the Prime Minister of this country did not endorse his Treasurer at the table. The third is that the Assistant Treasurer just outshone the Treasurer. If you have two things going badly for you, you do not want be outshone by your assistant, and that is exactly what happened. The fourth thing I observed today-if I can just get this out without interruption-is that the shadow Treasurer outshone the Treasurer of the day, which must be embarrassing for the new Labor government. The Treasurer said that they are the great protectors of the workers of this nation. I tell you that, in my area, the paper and pulp producers, the power industry workers, the farmers and the working families voted Liberal. When the unionists down in my area were asked who they were going to vote for, 40 per cent of them said that they were going to vote for Russell Broadbent in MCMillan and Peter MCGauran in Gippsland, because the rhetoric that was coming from the Labor Party before this election campaign said very clearly, ‘You are expendable for our city votes.' Take this on board, Assistant Treasurer. That is the truth. That is the rhetoric that came through to them. You can talk about that till the cows come home, but that was the case. You have not got a plan. You have proved that you have not got a plan. There is no plan coming from the government. You said you had a plan before the election. The moment you were elected, there was no plan. You want us to give you a plan. As you did with the ‘me too' before in the election campaign, you want us to give you a plan. You want 1,000 people to come here and give you a plan. What about the governance of the nation? You copied the Howard government's policies. You have not got a plan to govern for a $1.1 trillion economy. The Australian people need confidence in the Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer and all of those representing the Labor government in this place before they put their hard earned savings, their homes, their farms and their businesses in the hands of this new Labor government. Today, they have not got that confidence, as was proven by the Prime Minister himself. ",128
234,Mr BROADBENT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Would our minister at the table like to keep his mouth shut so I can get out what I need to say? The government has inherited one of the strongest, most can robust economies in the world. Everybody in this House should recognise the expertise of the Howard government in the management of the economy over the last 11 years. The inheritance they have delivered to this new government is not only a robust economy but also the lowest unemployment in all of those years. Those who are my age or older will remember how high unemployment was in this nation. You all knew somebody who did not have a job. Now most of you do not know anyone who does not have a job. There are jobs and opportunities out there. The member for Newcastle spoke today about the loss of jobs in the steel industry and about the opportunity to get out and get a job. The former government have returned the most robust economy to any government ever; it has never happened before. Oh, the Kennett government delivered to the new government in Victoria a very large surplus, which it has now spent. The government, rather than inheriting a $6 billion deficit, has received a $15 billion credit to this nation. The stewardcurrently ship of how it handles the economy is now to be tested. (Time expired)",128
235,Mr DANBY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Listen to the cheek of the contrived claims of the opposition about this side not having the confidence of the Australian people, just after the federal election when people made an emphatic choice that this side of the House has their confidence to run our $1.1 trillion economy. What fiscal irresponsibility when those opposite spent millions of dollars on advertising for Work Choices and hundreds of millions of dollars on regional rorts. Who can forget the Tumby Umby Creek that we spent millions of dollars clearing before it was subsequently cleared by rainfall? No wonder the excellent member for Grayndler, the Leader of the House, pointed out that we should be calling the National Audit Office ‘the Nationals Audit Office'. We ought to be going through every piece of expenditure of the previous government and seeing the gross irresponsibility in Work Choices, regional rorts and the fake technical colleges that were built around this country-the gross capital expenditure that was spent on them when they did not have any students. Over the past few days the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Bradfield have sought to use this great forum in a cynical manner, asking questions of my colleague the Treasurer that do not address the economic issues that matter to ordinary Australians, using obscure formulas, such as NAIRU, which I understand the Governor of the Reserve Bank regards as surplus to requirements. The shadow Treasurer will no doubt accuse it of knowing nothing about monetary policy either. As ever, those opposite are doing nothing to either help or ease the growing burden of inflation impacting on ordinary people and their families. To deny that inflation as it stands is a problem-as the shadow Treasurer has said repeatedly-is something that I cannot believe. On this side of the House we can only conclude that the member for Wentworth is more focused on a figure much closer to his heart, that of the Leader of the Opposition's record-shattering nine per cent approval rating. Perhaps by understanding that inflation is being persistently forecast at the higher end, or exceeding the target band set by the Reserve Bank-as the member for Prospect has just explained-the Leader of the Opposition argues that lowering expectations should be taken more seriously. The member for Wentworth might be able to grasp the seriousness of the problem his party has unceremoniously dumped on working families. The shadow Treasurer and his colleagues may in time even get through the first step on the road to fiscal policy rehabilitation. Hope is a wonderful thing. It is a feeling I commend to the House. Unlike those opposite, we are committed to dealing with the economic challenges facing Australia that the previous government washed its hands of after 11 long years, rather than revisionism writ large. Instead of the Costello cruise control, the Rudd government will, under the able management of the member for Lilley and the member for Melbourne, work to claw back the significant structural economic problems left virtually untouched by the Howard-Costello regime. Thanks in no small part to the previous government's inaction, Australia is unique among large-scale exporters of minerals in maintaining not just a significant current account deficit but one that remains impervious to virtually unprecedented terms of trade as a result of the runaway expansion of China and the demand for our exports. With a current account deficit in the vicinity of $5 billion impact that such an imbalance has on both interest rates and a highly valued Australian dollar has helped to ensure not just that the inflation genie is out of the bottle but that it stays out.",129

240,Mr HAWKE,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The 24th of November 2007 marks an important milestone both for Australia and for me personally. It is a source of mixed celebration and grief, for it was the coincidence of my election to parliament and the anniversary of my mother's death from cancer when I was a 10-year-old boy. My mother was a teacher with a deep connection with special needs kids. She believed in caring for others and instilled the same values in my sister Lydia and me. Each day we attended her lessons after school that she held especially for us. It felt like an unfair hardship when the other kids were outside playing cricket, but I now realise that there is no way I would be standing here today without the gifts of love, support and knowledge my mother freely gave us. I want to thank my father, Richard, who is here today in the gallery, for taking up the mantle of the responsibility as a single parent with gence and care. Dad sacrificed a great deal for Lydia and me and we never went without, even though our new lives were more modest than they might have been. My family is part of that great Australian story of post World War II migration. I pay tribute to my grandparents who worked so hard on their arrival from Greece in a new land. They succeeded in building a strong and extended family through difficult times. Today our family consists of small business proprietors, property owners and loving families. As a believer in the importance of the individual and as a person who has spent the odd occasion counting votes, I note that my grandma, Yaya, who is also here today in the gallery, has voted Labor at every election since her arrival in Australia in 1953. However, after my selection as a candidate, Yaya voted Liberal for the first time at the 2007 federal election. Opposition members-Hear, hear!",133
241,Mr HAWKE,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I hope to be able to reproduce that effect on others. I also recognise my uncles, aunties and cousins who have made the journey to be here today and whom I love greatly. Family is vitally important to me and it is also a fundamental mainstay of my community. I do not think it is an accident that Mitchell combines the highest level of couples with dependent children in Australia with a high rate of church attendance, charitable giving, income, property ownership and low levels of unemployment. The vibrant flavour of the Mitchell community, businesses and schools flows from the work, faith and family ethic of the place. It is a powerful combination. The self-reliant community of Mitchell is truly blessed, but there are many individuals, families and regions around Australia which are not as fortunate and sometimes rely on the governdiliment to make ends meet. I particularly note that the most rapid growth in government expenditure since Federation has been in human services and welfare payments, with governments taking up the slack of struggling families. The loss of human dignity involved in ever-increasing reliance on the state is a trend I want to resist. We need to ensure that government in this country does not become our unwanted father, mother, brother or sister. We must do what we can to ensure we promote the family as the model of a free, self-reliant, hope-filled life even though, as in my own case, it may not always be achieved for good reasons. A loving marriage and a caring environment in which to raise the next generation of young Australians is, at least for me, an aspirational goal. I think is sensible to resist attempts to redefine, relax and reinterpret such an important institution. When you give away this ground, you never get it back. That was also a view strongly held by my predecessor, the Hon. Alan Cadman, who served the people of Mitchell for 33 years. Today I would like to acknowledge his extraordinary service in this place. Alan is widely respected amongst people in Mitchell, who appreciate the energetic service and representation that he gave in this place throughout his career. Mitchell houses so much history from the early days of European settlement, with places such as Bella Vista Farm and Castle Hill Heritage Park to name just a few. It is home to the site of the first and only attempted rebellion by convicts against early colonial rule, at the Battle of Vinegar Hill. But the north-west of Sydney is also home to one of the most important events in Australian history, one that has sadly passed with inadequate recognition. In 1789 the young colony of Sydney was in a crisis. The government farms in my electorate at Castle Hill had failed to produce any crops. The people were starving. In desperation in 1791 a convict named James Ruse and his wife were to host what Governor Phillip described as an experiment. Governor Phillip granted the convict James Ruse a small uncleared piece of land and made him an offer. If Ruse could successfully farm the land, not only would he become a free man but also that land would be his. By 1791 what began as an experiment had demonstrated that the individual, his family and his enterprise could do something that the government with all of its power could not. James Ruse and his family were the first Australians to successfully run a farm and the first citizens to take themselves off the government store and sustain themselves without government support. I it am especially proud to represent a region of Sydney that is home to the first free enterprise in our nation's history. Today Mitchell is home to an enduring legacy to the success of individuals and their enterprise. What began as a failed government farm today houses the Norwest Business Park, another vastly successful experiment. The Norwest Business Park hosts the headquarters of some 500 businesses. These range from the iconic Woolworths to the Australian start-up medical company ResMed, from the global multinational Wyeth to many medium and small enterprises. The park employs 20,000 people and in time this number will grow to 40,000. The Norwest Business Park covers almost the same amount of ground as the Parramatta CBD and is a shining beacon of private enterprise, innovation and investment. While I want to see Australia produce more great global companies, I know that almost all of them began as a thriving small business. It is family owned and operated businesses that form the sparkling golden seam of Australian commerce and I am proud to represent a party that so strongly supports small business. From my time as a manager for a major retailer I know how difficult it can be to compete against the big players. Well-meaning bureaucracy must not carelessly add weight to the burdens of the risk-taking, job-creating entrepreneur. We must work to reduce regulation, reduce the compliance costs and reduce the amount of time lost in working for the government. Most importantly we must make it easier for a person or family to start their own business and get it off the ground. There is something perverse in our attitude to risk when it is so simple to pour your entire life savings down the throat of a poker machine yet it is so complex, costly and restrictive to start your own enterprise and get it up and running. I was privileged to grow up in the suburbs in and around Mitchell. The citizens of those suburbs are at the top of the table for charitamany ble donations. Baulkham Hills Shire has one of the highest birth rates in Sydney and one of the safest driving records. Crime is low. Voluntary organisations like Hills Community Aid Information Service and Hills Family Centre take on those who need extra help in our community and do a marvellous job. We have a high proportion of service clubs in a small geographical area. Some 11 Rotary clubs and six Lions clubs, the local SES, the Rural Fire Service and the wonderful 355 Committee Network are all well served by volunteers and a strong proportion of churchgoers and Christian people. One in every five people in Mitchell works as a volunteer. Our social fabric is strong not through government decree, legislation or handout but from the principles of looking after your neighbour and doing unto others as you would have them do unto you. My own service as an officer in the Australian Army Reserve reinforced to me how important it is to serve some cause greater than self, and I want to acknowledge our famous local regiment, the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers, and the Royal Australian Armoured Corps for providing muchneeded mobility and firepower to the battlefield. Sir Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor General of New South Wales, after whom the electorate is named, was a great explorer and surveyor. If he were surveying Mitchell today he would note the inadequate and underdeveloped state of our infrastructure. He would note the poor state of many roads, the lack of a rail line, inadequate broadband and the overall failure of planning in one of the fastest-growing areas of Sydney. Successive governments have failed to deliver vital infrastructure. They have also failed to source other potential solutions, such as encouraging private capital to meet the enormous demands of growth. Urban fringe areas in so of our major cities are suffering from governments who cannot or will not fund the infrastructure so sorely needed but will not allow the private sector to provide an alternative solution. This issue of Labor's misguided attempts to plan for the future of Sydney by limiting growth affects almost all of the Mitchell electorate in one way or another. Central planning has produced policies that are denying young people and young families the opportunity to get ahead. By rationing land, they have caused land prices to skyrocket; by imposing high fees and regulatory imposts, they have caused long delays and extortionate costs; they have increased densities in suburbs against the wishes of existing residents and buyers; and dilapidated infrastructure, which was never designed for these sorts of densities, has become choked and overloaded. In short, it is not urban consolidation they have created but urban congestion. In and near my electorate, which covers some 12,900 hectares and is all within one hour's drive of the Sydney CBD, there are thousands of hectares where minimum lot sizes remain between two and 40 hectares as a result of past archaic policies of urban consolidation. This is land which would be highly sought after for housing if not for the implementation of absurd policies that see minimum lot sizes as high as 100 acres within an hour's drive of the Sydney city and only minutes away from other major town centres such as Castle Hill and the new Rouse Hill. Currently that land is sitting there doing nothing. It is too sive for farming but it is much cheaper than the land right next door that is being sold for housing. It is an incredible waste of resources and a major contributor to Sydney's unaffordable housing problem. Affordable housing is part of the great Australian dream, and if states continue to fail so badly in the provision of this basic function there must be a role for the federal government. We have already seen the erosion of housing affordability that the first three decades of these types of policies have produced. Measures should be taken to lift the restrictions against housing on the urban fringe and slash the exorbitant levies and charges that are currently applied. Young Australians deserve better, and I will work in this place to ensure that Mitchell can be an affordable place to live for young Australians. I have been fortunate to learn about strong advocacy. I joined the Liberal Party in 1995 when political correctness was at its height, after 12 years of Labor rule. I then went to work in the political sphere, gaining experience and insight into how to produce real outcomes from government. I want to acknowledge and thank those who gave me my political start: the Hon. Ross Cameron, Senator the Hon. Helen Coonan, the Hon. David Clarke and Ray Williams. I also thank those who have assisted me along the way: the Hon. Tony Abbott, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop, the Hon. Brendan Nelson, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull and Senator Connie Fierravanti-Wells. Their support, friendship and service have given me the experience, inspiration and determination to be an effective representative. I owe a huge debt to the Mitchell FEC and its branches, to the New South Wales state executive and state council and to Nick Campbell, vice-president of the New South Wales division. I also want to thank my campaign managers and friends expenAndrew Jefferies, Matthew Connor, Mark Lewis and Dominic Perrottet. I also thank the New South Wales Young Liberal movement, the New South Wales Young Liberal executive and the Australian Liberal Students Federation. The Liberal Party is the party of Menzies, of John Howard and of James Ruse. It is the party of the individual, the small business owner and the hard working mums and dads of Mitchell. It is the party of the defining spirit of this country that proclaims that if you have a go then you will get a fair go in return. I am proud to represent such a great political party in this place. But my election was not without some small degree of controversy. Some Liberals think that the election of such a progressive younger person to this place is the thin end of the wedge. For example, one elderly Liberal matriarch declared that the election of Alex Hawke to the federal parliament would be the death of conservatism in the Liberal Party. I want to reassure honourable members who may be anxious about this matter that I bear no hostility to conservatism. My brand of Liberalism is more interested in what we support than what we oppose. I want not just to resist those things that are harmful but to support those things that are good. I derive no satisfaction from opposing the growth of state sponsored welfare if I cannot fan the spark of family, enterprise, self-reliance and human dignity. I am more interested in arguing the merits of the high standards we have inherited than in obsessing about the failings of those who fall short-recognising, as I do, that all of us are but dust and clay. I am a big believer in the ideas of grace, forgiveness, redemption and a second chance-Christian values that have seasoned secular culture in a way that makes it more humane and our world more inhabitable. We Liberals must accept the responsibility to make our political values relevant and persuasive. We must reach out to each successive generation. I am for sustainable environmentalism and practical reconciliation. I am for the US alliance. I am for the state of Israel. I am committed to the war on terror. I want to see Australia fulfil its proper role as a regional leader, especially in supporting our neighbours and friends in Papua New Guinea, East Timor and the Pacific. I am a supporter of democracy as a global language, of trade not aid, of the rule of law and the power of the individual. Australia, thanks to the Howard era, is still a free and open society; a naturally egalitarian place not hidebound by rank or birth; a place where merit, work, character and tenacity are still the most important factors in determining a person's success. There is more to be done and more that we can do for those who do not yet enjoy the benefits of modern Australia. This can and should be done through strong communities, by taking responsibility for one another and not by outsourcing the role to government. Two hundred and twenty years from our founding as a nation, life is much more complex than it once was. Understandably, government plays a broader role than it once did. But overreliance on the government is holding our nation back, eroding our enterprise, eroding our instinct to take responsibility for ourselves and for each other and, most of all, eroding voluntary association. My commitment to the people of Mitchell is to stand up in this place for our community-for its great spirit of enterprise, its dividualism, its spirit of volunteerism and its aspirational goals. It has become fashionable to dispense with aspirational goals, especially among the modern class of urbane, professional politicians. There is a species of leader whose achievement is to offend noone, who stands for nothing. He or she has the great advantage of never being guilty of failure because they never advocated a standard that they might fail. I prefer the approach of Theodore Roosevelt, who said: It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly … who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at best, knows … the triumph of high achievement; and who, at the worse, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat. It is in that great spirit and in this great arena that I humbly devote myself to serving the people of Mitchell and the people of Australia for as long as I am fortunate enough to remain a member of this place. Debate (on motion by Mr Byrne) adjourned. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT (ENHANCED ALLOWANCES) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 February, on motion by Ms Macklin: That this bill be now read a second time.",133
242,Mr ABBOTT,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I congratulate the member for Mitchell on a splendid maiden speech which managed to combine a robust expression of political phiinlosophy and a hymn of praise to his splendid electorate. I cannot help but recall Alex Hawke's statement of some years ago that ‘you don't join the Liberal Party to be left wing'. It is good to see that he has not lost his gift for pithy expression in the translation to this House. The bill that we are now debating, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Allowances) Bill 2008, is an important but uncontroversial bill. It implements an election commitment of the former government, which in a slightly modified form was adopted by the former opposition as part of its ‘me too' policy. The bill in question increases the utilities allowance for pensioners to $500 a year. It extends the utilities allowance to other beneficiaries of pensionable age and extends it further to disability support pensioners and people on carers payments of any age. It also increases the seniors concession allowance to $500 a person and it increases the telephone allowance for pensioners, carers and disability support pensioners with an internet connection. These are laudable objectives. These are worthwhile benefits. They will help some three million people at a cost of some $4 billion over the forward estimates period. So, obviously, the opposition supports these measures and I congratulate the government for moving so swiftly to bring these benefits to people who need them. I will make a few observations. We can only afford to pay these increased allowances because our economy is strong and has generated a very strong revenue base. I think the former government deserves considerable credit for that. The fact that the former opposition repeatedly stated before the election that there was not a sliver of difference between the then government and the then opposition on economic policy is perhaps the finest tribute there can be to the economic work of the former government and, in particular, the good work of the member for Higgins. I hope that the new government does nothing to jeopardise that economy and to put at risk the revenue base which makes these kinds of payments affordable. I should also point out that these latest improvements adopted from the policy of the former government are in keeping with the former government's record of generosity towards pensioners. I remind the House that it was the former government that increased pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. It was also the former government which shared the benefits of our prosperity more equally than has perhaps ever been the case in a period of sustained economic boom. It is often said by members opposite that under the former government the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. This was not the case: the rich got richer-sure-but the poor got considerably richer too. In fact, work by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, based here in Canberra, shows basically that the top and the bottom deciles of income in our society-the millionaires and the merchant bankers on the one hand and the pensioners on the other hand-all went up by approximately the same high percentage over the life of the Howard government. Those whose positions improved most were lowand middleincome earners with children, which is as it should be under a government which wants to do the right thing by the battlers of our country. I shall conclude by raising two queries for the new government. I note that this particular election commitment was accompanied by an additional commitment to provide pensioners and other beneficiaries with reciprocal concession entitlements in every state. In other words, if I have a concession entitlement as a pensioner in New South Wales and I find myself on a bus in Melbourne, I should get the same discount, the same benefit, as a pensioner there. I note that the former government was heavily criticised for making a similar commitment some years ago but being unable to negotiate this with the states. While I know that the new government made a $50 million election commitment to fund this national pensioner concession entitlement, I do not underestimate for a second the difficulty of negotiating with the states. I think it would assist the House-and I am sure it would interest pensioners and other beneficiaries around the country-if members opposite, in debating this bill, could us know what the state is of the new government's negotiations with the states to try to bring about this laudable objective. The final point I make is that in estimates yesterday the relevant minister, Senator Sherry, neither confirmed nor denied a question about whether the government was planning, as part of the budget process and the cuts which the minister for revenue is vociferously promising us, to limit pensioner entitlements to the utilities allowance and to the seniors concession allowance. I think it would put to rest the potential anxieties of the three million people who stand to benefit from the bill we are now debating if the government was able to assure them that it was not giving now only to take away in the budget. I think it was a remarkable answer from Senator Sherry to simply say on something as important as this, ‘I cannot confirm or deny the matter raised.' Surely it would not have hurt him or the government to say there are absolutely no plans to cut, reduce in any way limit these particular benefits, and I call on members opposite to supply those words, the words that Senator Sherry was unable to supply in estimates yesterday.",137
243,Ms KING,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I note that the member for Warringah has the opportunity to ask those questions directly of the minister during consideration in detail, and I assume he will take up that opportunity. I rise to speak on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Allowances) Bill 2008, which follows through on one of Labor's key election promises. This amendment will offer older Australians, veterans, people with disabilities and carers further assistance towards making ends meet. This amendment will provide an increase in the utilities allowance from $107.20 per year to $500 per year, to be paid quarterly with payments made in March, June, September and December. This let amendment will also extend the utilities allowance to include people who receive the disability support pension and carers, as well as those who receive the widow B pension, wife pension and bereavement allowance. The seniors concession allowance will increase from $218 per year to $500 per year, also to be paid quarterly. Also included in this bill is an increase in telephone allowances from $88 per year to $132 per year paid to veterans, income support recipients of age pension, senior health card holders and also those who receive carer payment or disability support pension. This increased payment is specifically for those who have an internet connection and recognises that cost. I am very pleased to be standing before the House to add my support for this bill, which delivers one of Labor's key election promises. I know how important these additional payments are and how much they will ease the financial burden of those in our or community who are eligible. In my electorate, around 28,000 people will benefit from this bill. These are people who struggle every day to make ends meet. These are people who have worked hard all of their lives to make this country a great nation. They are veterans who have sacrificed years of their lives and who have risked or experienced being imprisoned in enemy territory, incurring disability or injury in the defence of this great country and often risking death for our country. These are partners of those veterans who have raised families on their own and who stepped into farming and industry to keep the country going whilst their loved ones were away fighting for us. These are people who experience disability in their lives and who face challenges that few of us sitting here in this House can ever imagine. These are people who spend their lives caring for others, often under difficult circumstances. The increased allowances acknowledge the day-today struggle of people on low fixed incomes to make ends meet. The issue of trying to make ends meet has been expressed to me over and over again by my constituents ever since I became the federal member for Ballarat in 2001. Time and time again, I hear of the experiences of those who find it harder and harder to pay their bills. These stories come to me through my office, through emails, in person at my mobile office or at stalls at the local Trash Trivia. Everywhere I go people are telling me that the cost of living is increasing and that it is becoming increasingly difficult to make ends meet. This is even more so for those people who are on fixed limited incomes. Their stories turned into a tidal wave in 2007, when I was lucky enough to travel this great country in my capacity as Chair of Labor's Family Watch Task Force. I spoke to thousands of Australians in shopping centres, markets and street stalls all over this country and I take this opportunity to thank all of those families for sharing their very personal stories with me. I am very proud that this government is committed to trying to assist working families. Whilst this task force focused on families, I could not help but consider and listen to how the themes of high cost of living and difficulties in making ends meet impact on veterans, age pensioners, disability pensioners and carers. Some of these people, through no fault of their own, are unable to access job market at all. An overwhelming number of constituents made this point during the election campaign, taking the initiative to telephone or call into my office to ask what Labor would be doing for those who live on pensions or benefits. It was particularly gratifying when we released Labor's Making Ends Meet plan for older Australians, people with disabilities and carers during the election campaign, and the feedback that I received on that policy from the people whom it would directly assist confirmed this for me. My office received an overwhelming number of requests for this policy and then received a great response from those it would help the most. It was touching to hear the people of my electorate tell me that this would ease the burden for them, that it would help take the pressure off and that it would relieve the financial stress being experienced and, of course, the emotional toll that goes and with it. This, along with our other election commitments, does help those who need it the most. As I stated previously, the cost of living is an issue for everyone but more so for those who are on low fixed incomes. The cost of housing, the cost of groceries, the cost of petrol and the cost of utilities are real concerns for the vast number of Australians, and I hear in question time that it has suddenly become a concern to the opposition-finally! Labor knows all too well the difficulties inherent in trying to make ends meet, because Labor went out and listened and then moved into action to develop a suite of initiatives to help the Australian community out. Labor has already announced an inquiry into grocery prices to ensure that Australians are not paying more than they should be at the supermarket. The inquiry will look at all facets of the grocery industry, from supply right through the chain to retail level. The report will be presented to the Minister for Compethe tition Policy and Consumer Affairs by 31 July and will then be scrutinised to ensure that the Australian community are getting a fair deal with their weekly grocery billsomething that has a direct impact on those on fixed incomes. The ACCC has also been asked to provide advice on how to establish a dedicated website that focuses on grocery prices as well as how they can deliver a periodic survey of grocery prices in supermarkets. This will help all citizens, but particularly those who find it difficult to physically shop around to disabilities or caring commitments. These are real measures that will help people, but particularly those on fixed incomes. I am sure my colleagues would also agree with me that one of the major strains on the family budget is the cost of petrol. It is also one of the most frustrating issues for constituents, who constantly question why there is such a huge fluctuation in price, often unexplained. One very positive and responsible thing that the government can do is to ensure that we have a fully competitive fuel market  Walker as the government's nominee for petrol commissioner shows the public that the Rudd Labor government is serious about a fair go at the petrol bowser and will not erate unfair pricing or advantage flowing through, to the detriment of the Australian community. Mr Ciobo interjecting",139
244,Ms KING,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I note the member for Moncrieff again at the table interjecting. The opposition showed no interest whatsoever in these issues. In fact, when I tabled the Family Watch report, which clearly showed how concerned families in Australia were about grocery and petrol prices, the then government ridiculed it-‘That's not an issue, not a problem at all.' Families in fact have never been better off, we were told. So I would like to hear what the opposition proposes to do. In the 11 years of the Howard government the average home rose in cost from four times the average wage to seven times the average wage. A three-bedroom rental has risen by 82 per cent whilst vacancy rates have been slashed in half. This is the legacy of the Howard government, which chose to ignore this crisis. The crisis that has escalated over a decade cannot be fixed overnight, but we must begin the process of alleviating this crisis right now. Labor has done due this by developing policies implementing a First Home Saver Account, a Housing Affordability Fund, a National Rental Affordability Scheme and a better approach to land release. This will begin immediately to relieve the strain on those who have up until now believed that home-ownership was a pipe dream. As well as the Rudd Labor government taking action on the cost of groceries, petrol and housing, the bill that we are debating today will take the action necessary to provide assistance to 2.7 million Australians who are doing it tough. I am especially pleased to lend my support to increasing the rate of telephone allowance from $88 a year to $132 a year, specifically tol- for those who have an internet connection. Whilst this increase will be meaningful financially, it is also meaningful in terms of what it actually signifies for people. Extending this payment to recipients of disability pension and carer payments is a natural extension of this allowance. It acknowledges the benefits of internet use and the growing use of this technology amongst older people and people with disabilities and carers. For people with disabilities the internet can be a link to a world that may not be able to be accessed any other way. For those in the community with mobility issues the internet can be used as a way of dealing with day-today activities that can prove challengingordering groceries, online shopping and keeping in contact with loved ones. For those of us who have communication or anxiety issues the internet can be a safe form of connecting with others. Disability specific chat rooms have flourished, and this shows how accessible these sites are for those who are unable, for various reasons, to link into faceto-face support or social groups. The internet is also a powerful learning tool, giving many people access to a world that may not be able to be accessed any other way. It is no longer impossible to have a nificant and important relationship with someone who shares the same challenges, interests or hobbies who may live halfway around the world. For carers it can be a connection to others who may be experiencing the same challenges or a link to a crisis service when it is needed the most. It can be a way of keeping in touch with friends when it may be impossible to get out of the house. It can be an instant connection to someone when you feel that you are all alone. It can be a way to relax when the opportunity to go out may not be available. With families often scattered across the country, older citizens can now keep in touch with their children and grandchildren. I must admit that I took great delight when I met with a very young 88-year-old who was communicating with her grandchildren in America for the very first time via the internet in one of my local community internet places, which was a wonderful thing to see. With increasing technological sophistication, and a soon to be much improved broadband network, grandparents can send and receive photographs, video footage and emails from their loved ones, their children and their grandchildren. This increase in telephone allowance for the purpose of assisting with the costs of an internet connection sends the message loud and clear that Labor is about keeping families connected to each other and keeping everyone connected to the community. It provides real assistance to those who need it the most. It acknowledges the modern world that we live in, recognises the modern challenges and provides a modern approach to meeting those challenges. Those in our community who receive a disability support pension, carer payment, wife pension, widow B pension or bereavement allowance, and those in our community who are under qualifying age and receiving a sig- service pension or income support supplement, will for the first time, under this legislation, be entitled to a utilities allowance. This is long overdue. Labor recognises that these groups in our society are doing it tough and are entitled to some additional assistance. Labor recognises that the additional allowance-increased from $107.20 to $500-is also long overdue. These community members have been most patient as they have watched the cost of petrol skyrocket, the weekly groceries bills add up and the costs of gas and electricity continue to climb. This is the legacy of the previous government, which was obviously deaf to the calls from those on low fixed incomes and their advocates that budgets were strained to breaking point. Labor did not dismiss those calls. We listened carefully and then we got moving. We heard that quarterly bills added a great deal of stress at that time in many households, which is why the increased utilities allowance will be paid quarterly-at the time that bills are due. That just makes sense. This amending bill also increases the annual rate of seniors concession allowance from $208 to $500 for all eligible self-funded retirees. The original concession allowance was introduced in December 2004 and has, to date, been paid twice a year. This bill ensures that seniors concession allowance is paid quarterly, along with the utilities allowance. This timing of the allowances will provide the maximum benefit for this payment, alleviating the difficulties of finding the money to pay the bills that all seem to arrive at once. One of the things I would like to talk about within the context of this bill is the government's plan to develop a new way of indexing the pension. This government intends to introduce legislation later this year that will change the way pensions are indexed, providing for a real formula that is based on the real prices that consumers are exposed to. The formula will take a basket of goods that reflects what pensioners actually buy-meaning more emphasis on utilities and food and less emphasis on whitegoodsand add this as a new element to the indexation formula. The end result will mean that the age pension will increase according to the basket of goods, the overall CPI or 25 cent of male average earnings. Whichever is the highest will determine the new pension rate. This is another election promise that Labor is preparing to deliver. The speed with which Labor has got to work shows our commitment to those who are often silenced through their circumstances. These are the people that Labor has traditionally supported and, now in government, we are continuing that tradition-those on low or fixed incomes who continue to contribute to society despite the challenges that life has presented to them, those who provide the caring that makes our country a richer place, those who were willing to sacribonus fice their lives for our freedom, veterans and those who have worked hard all their lives and who now care for grandchildren or devote their time to volunteer activities communities. I am very pleased to stand here today, on behalf of all those people in my electorate who will benefit from these changes, and commend the bill to the House.",141
245,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I listened to the previous speaker, the member for Ballarat, with a good deal of interest because, as she spoke, anyone who was listening and did not have a knowledge of the background of this bill, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Allowances) Bill 2008, would have thought that it contained original thought-that the Labor Party had managed to have an original thought that it put forward as policy as we went forward to the last election. But, to those people who are aware, this was one of those policies known as Labor's ‘me too' policy. It was a policy announced by the then coalition government on 23 October 2007 entitled ‘More Support for Pensioners, Self-Funded Retirees, People with Disabilities and their Carers', only to be followed on 1 November 2007 by the Labor Party's release of their per policy called ‘Making Ends Meet: Federal Labor's Plan for Older Australians, People with Disabilities and Carers'. So the bill has its origin in coalition policy. Indeed, it has antecedents. The policy was first developed for the 2006-07 budget when the coalition provided a bonus payment equal to the annual amount of utilities allowance for each person of age pension age eligible for that allowance. It was extended to other groups of older Australians who were recipients of the mature age allowance, partner allowance and widow allowance, and they also received the bonus. In the budget for 2007-08, the coalition provided a one-off pension seniors payment of $500 to everyone of age or service pension eligibility for the utilities allowance or the seniors concession allowance. That was finally developed into the in our policy of 23 October 2007 which I mentioned previously and which is the antecedent of the legislation that is now before us. In other words, the very simple proposition I am putting is that, if the opposition-or, rather, the opposition as we now are-had not put forward this proposition when it was in government, this legislation would not be before the House because it was, as I said before, one of the ‘me too' policies which Labor adopted. In proposing this utilities payment, it should be acknowledged that the coalition developed this policy within the framework of recognising the worth of individuals, not the collective that the government will continue to apply. We recognised that individuals needed assistance with their utilities payments as they came around, just as we had recognised this in our very much earlier policy when we said the CPI was not a sufficient index for the age pension and, indeed, for service pensions because veterans' entitlements to these utilities and concession allowances are a fundamental focus of our policy and the ‘me too' bill that we see. The policy that we introduced to change the indexing of age pension and service pensions from CPI to MTAWE-male total average weekly earnings-was simply to recognise that older Australians who had given enormous service and sacrifice in bringing up families and contributing to the wealth nation were not being properly rewarded for what they had done by the utilisation of the CPI, which of course had been Labor policy for 13 years prior to that. So we made that promise and, on coming into government in 1996, we in fact honoured that promise. And MTAWE became the index that increases were measured by. When we came into office and we started to see the growth of wages again-which of course they had not done under Hawke and Keating when the policies that they had introduced suppressed wages-we saw a need to ensure that pensioners were not left behind. It was this concern for the individual person who had made a contribution, not the collective-that group over there, and the individual can be sacrificed to the group-which prompted that change in policy. The bill that is before us enables an increased utilities allowance of $500 to be paid to people receiving the age pension, mature age allowance, partner allowance, widow allowance, service pension, veterans income support supplement, carer payment, disability support pension and DVA invalidity service pension; to holders of the Commonwealth seniors health card; and to pensioners, carers and people with disabilities. These people will receive $500 per person or couple. It will also be paid to self-funded retirees, who are eligible for $500 each. This legislation was born of the concern and recognition that a great number of people had a need for this increase. It is very important that our policy, which this bill reflects, was to increase the utilities allowance payment and extend it to disability pensioners, particularly, who had created quite a voice for themselves so that they would be heard. The then government, the now opposition, recognised that voice and the fairness of what they had to say and extended this to them. As I said previously, the of the then opposition and now government ‘me too'd' that policy. I was also pleased to see that this bill fulfils the Labor Party policy to increase the telephone allowance for older Australians, carers and people with disabilities from $88 to $132, provided they are eligible to receive income support and have an internet connection at home. This also applies to veterans and their dependants, provided they too have an internet connection at home. This is recognition of the fact that the fastest growing group of people in the community who are taking up use of the internet is the over-55s group. Very early in the piece, when I first took over as Minister for Aged Care back in 1998, the over-55s made very low use of the internet and now, as I said, they have become the fastest growing users of the internet within our community. So it is pleasing to see that that has been delivered upon. The third thing that Labor promised was, again, a take-up of an earlier coalition policy, which was to negotiate with the states to have the states give reciprocity for travel concession. This is one of the real contentious issues that older Australians have had for many years. In 2001 we, as the then government, made a commitment to undertake to negotiate with the state governments to see that recognition take place. The Labor Party has said that, because all governments in Australia are now Labor, it will be able to negotiate an outcome which other people could not negotiate. It is true to say that the state governments would not sign on to the agreement-for whatever reason they had, they refused to sign on. Although the money was put forward by the federal government to compensate the state governments for the cost that they would have, it did not happen. In the papers that it put forward to be costed prior to the election, the Labor Party put forward $50 million to compensate state governments over four years for the cost of negotiating these reciprocity arrangements. There is not one word about that in this bill-not a syllable. It was with great fanfare that the Prime Minister, as he now is, announced the policy back then on 1 November 2007. He even put his picture on the press release, ‘Making ends meet-national travel concessions for older Australians', in which he said: For example, a bus driver in New South Wales will be able to apply the standard concession when an older Australian presents a valid State Government Seniors Card even if it is from another State or Territory. This will include long distance rail travel on routes like the Indian Pacific, the Ghan and the Overland. Reciprocal transport concessions will help older Australians who like to travel to visit their children and see the country. Federal Labor will end the buck-passing between the States and the Commonwealth. He also said: That's because all governments in the country are now Labor and they will be easily able to discuss these things and implement them because they are all Labor. And yet we get this bill before the House today, brought in early-and I commend that because it is important that the utilities allowance and concession payments be made, even though the indexation date has been postponed by the legislation from 20 March to 20 September. It shows that there is no movement at all on this important issue of the transport concessional card. I repeat that a big fanfare was made by the government saying that they would be able to achieve outcomes because they could all talk with one voice. And yet there is not a word; there is nothing in this bill about it and nothing to explain why it is not being dealt with. It is simply a bill to bring in what is basically legislation to enact a previous government's commitment, the now opposition's policy. I listened with interest to the debates in the House today, particularly during the MPI, about the way in which the government are going to deliver on other promises. The first one they made was that they would bring down interest rates. Since they have been in government, interest rates have gone up. They said they would bring down grocery prices. They have appointed a commissioner to oversight them. They said they would bring down petrol prices. Petrol prices have gone up, as indeed have grocery prices. So the three big issues for which they made promises-reduce interest rates, reduce grocery prices and reduce petrol prices-have failed, failed and failed. What is their policy to deal with this inflationary pressure, the effects of which these utility allowances are grandmeant to meet some of the payments for? It is very simply this: they are restoring all the power of the trade union movement that had diminished in the last 11½ years-restoring that power to the unions so they will again become a monopoly player. The impact of that is to be inflationary. There is only one tool that the government has to use, and that is trying to force people out of jobs to increase the size of the unemployment pool so that pressure can be taken off inflation. The government can use all the weasel words that they want, but at the end of the day what Treasurer Swan is saying to the Australian people is, ‘You can't have the employment that the coalition government gave you and have low inflation.' Well we did it. We said: ‘When the economy is booming and when there are surpluses and we've gathered in too much money'-we do not need that amount of money to deliver the things that are needed for people-‘we will give it back to you, the people. We will give you back your money.' So people felt that when prices were rising and they got a tax cut, they had some more money in their pockets. This brought back the pressure to stop pushing for higher wages, which in turn brought back the pressure to start pushing higher prices to pay for the higher wages. In addition to that, it stopped the money remaining in government hands. Governments, no matter of which persuasion, like to spend the money they have in their hands. So, if we had not had that tax cut policy, we would have had the triple whammy: we would have had a government with the money still to spend, we would have had people pushing for an increase in wages and we would have had employers pushing for an increase in prices to pay for the increased wages. We would have gone up exactly the same way and down the other side, as we did under Paul Keating with the ‘recession we had to have'. Treasurer Swan stood here today and he said, ‘This is the highest inflation we've had'-four per cent I think we are talking about-‘for 16 years.' You bet. What happened 16 years ago? We were coming off the back of the worse recession that we had had, engineered by Paul Keating. And what did we have? What was the result of that? It was one million people unemployed. When you have one million people unemployed, of course inflation will come down. And that is the blunt tool that this government is using. It can talk about the Reserve Bank and it can talk about its planned cuts in expenditure full from the budget, but everybody knows that, because of the strength of this economy-the one that it has inherited-there will be in excess of 1.5 per cent of GDP in the surplus without it doing anything at all. But the Australian people have to know: the government is the enemy of full employment. It is the enemy of full employment because it is handing back the monopoly power to the trade unions to push for wage increases. And that has begun already-you hear the voice of the head of the CFMEU; you see the strikes that are starting already. So when we see a bill like this being implemented in legislation today, which is bringing in a coalition policy that was designed to make sure that individuals who are older are able to participate in the growth of the economy, we see this measure as a ‘me too' bill. What we are really seeing are the hardships those people are going to suffer because of the policies that this government is going to implement. Gone are the restraints, full-on will be the pressure. The opposition will be supporting this bill. We are pleased to see a policy that we promised being implemented, even if we are unable to do it ourselves-but we are able to support it. We are pleased to see the $58 increase to recognise the importance of the internet-that is per year, I might add. We are disappointed that we have seen no progress talked about at all on the question of travel concession cards, and we are very disappointed to see that we seem to have a government that is hell-bent on dismantling the economy, which was in a strong condition when it inherited it. This will be to the disadtransport vantage of ordinary individual Australians but will be to the huge benefit of the collectivist union movement.",143
246,Ms HALL,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Shortland) (6.12 pm)Congratulations on your re-election to this parliament, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, and your election to the Speakers Panel. I know that you will shed your wisdom upon this House in that position and I look forward to speaking in the parliament with you in the chair. The contribution by the previous speaker was quite interesting. Yes, this side of parliament are about the collective good. We care about all pensioners, all senior citizens, all veterans, all people on disability pensions and all carers. We are not about the individual; we are not about our mates, as the previous government was. One thing that was a trademark of the Howard government was the fact that it always cared about the individual as long as they were its mates. This legislation is not about the mates of the Howard government; it is about those people who look to the government for support. The other issue that the honourable member for Mackellar raised was transport concessions and reciprocity with the states. I have to put on the record that the Howard government could never get agreement from the states. Why? Because they were locked in the blame game, they were not serious about it. All they wanted to do was have a go at the states. They would say, ‘We'll commit this money' and know that there was absolutely no way that they were ever going to deliver because they were too busy blaming the states for every problem that they had. I think the member for Mackellar really needs to make sure that she remembers facts as they were. As far as the Rudd government is concerned, we have made a commitment of $50 million to introduce a national seniors' concession scheme for senior card holders, and that will be introduced by January 2009. The Rudd government delivers on its commitments. The Rudd government is not a government of core and non-core promises, as was the Howard government. It is a government that is very mindful of the seniors, the veterans and all of those people the Howard government made an art of doing over each and every time it introduced legislation into this parliament. The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Allowances) Bill 2008 delivers on a Rudd election commitment. It delivers advantages to a large number of people throughout Australia. The Shortland electorate is the 10th oldest electorate in the whole of Australia and, as of the 2006 census, it has the 10th highest proportion of people over the age of 65. I know that over a very long period of time those people have been finding it very hard to survive under the mean-spirited Howard government that was previously on the government benches in this House. That is why this legislation will benefit the people that I represent so much. This bill increases the annual rate of the utilities allowance from $107.20 to $500 per household and provides for the allowance to be paid in $125 quarterly instalments rather than biannually. What does that mean? It means that pensioners, seniors and carers will be better able to manage their budgets. Bills for utilities actually come in quarterly, so people will not have to wait for those biannual payments to be able to pay their bills or manage their finances. The allowances are locked into the time that the bills come in. This bill extends, for the first time, the qualifications for the utilities allowance to people who are under pension age and receive a disability support pension, carer payment, wife pension, widow B pension or bereavement allowance and to people who are under the qualifying age and receive a service pension or income support supplement. I would like to concentrate on that for a little bit. The Howard government constantly refused to acknowledge the needs of these people. Every time the Howard government introduced measures for things like one-off payments and the utilities allowance to people on disability support pensions, my office was swamped with people who were in receipt of the disability support pension and were missing out. They felt very much that they were second-class citizens. They felt that the Howard government was discriminating against them. They would tell me that they had very high needs. Quite often a person who is on a disability support pension will have to pay much higher pharmacy bills because they require pharmaceuticals to assist them in their daily lives. They have a number of extraordinary costs, as do pensioners, but the Howard government refused to acknowledge the needs of these people. When I stood up in this parliament last year and spoke about the then government's one-off payments and I brought this to the attention of then Minister Brough-a member who is no longer in this parliament-he stood up in this parliament and said, ‘People with disabilities have never been better off than they are under the Howard government and any problems they are having have been caused by the states.' Isn't that the blame game at its extreme? Firstly, he was arrogantly denying and not recognising the problems that people with disabilities have, blaming them, to a degree, for the fact that they have a disability; secondly, he was passing the blame onto the states and saying, ‘We are doing the right things; it is all the states' fault.' I feel that the people of Australia ally recognised the then minister's treatment of people appropriately, and he is no longer in this House. Under this legislation, the seniors concession allowance will increase from $218 to $500, the same as it is for pensioners. They are being brought into line. Previously pensioners were receiving $107.20 and seniors were receiving $218. So both groups will now receive $500, and I think it is appropriate that pensioners and eligible self-funded retirees should be treated the same. The bill increases the rate of telephone allowance from $88 to $132 for certain income support recipients who have an internet connection at home. This is something that I think will be welcomed. It is available to pension-age income support recipients and to disability support pensioners-once again recognising that people with disabilities have the same needs as other pensioners-carer payment recipients and self-funded retirees who hold a Commonwealth seniors card. The internet is a very important way for people to communicate with others, and it is becoming more and more important each and every day. If a person is in some way restricted in their mobility-if they have a disability and are confined to their home, or if they are older and frail and cannot get out-the fact that they can use the internet actually brings the world into their home. So I think that this is a very important initiative. I would also like to mention the Australian seniors internet fund. The Rudd government will be establishing a $15 million seniors internet fund to establish free internet kiosks in key community locations such as senior citizens centres and neighbourhood houses Currently only one in five Australians over the age of 65 have access to the internet. There is a very active seniors group in my electorate, at Lake Munmorah, who have developed a very popular computer club. actuThey are constantly seeking funds to expand it because there is such demand for the internet within that area and a number of them are unable to have computers in their home. This, to me, is an example of how the Rudd Labor government's legislation will benefit constituents in the Shortland electorate. I would like to go through and highlight a couple of issues. Under the Howard government, senior Australians, people whom I represent in this parliament, were really suffering. The cost of living pressure facing older Australians on fixed incomes was increasing each and every day. It was only this week that a senior pensioner from Caves Beach in the Shortland electorate contacted my office and welcomed the fact that the grocery price inquiry was taking place. In Swansea there is only one supermarket and the prices there have increased by 20 per cent. She went along and spoke to the supermarket manager and was told: ‘Bad luck if you don't like it. We are the only supermarket here; you've got to lump it.' I think it is very important that we acknowledge the fact that the Rudd government are listening to the needs of people. We are actually recognising the fact that pensioners, seniors and veterans-the veterans who have fought for Australia-are doing it hard. They have done it really, really hard. is because of that that we have made these changes. It is because of that that the transport concessions will be introduced. It is cause of that that we are having the inquiry into grocery prices, and it is because of that that a petrol commissioner has been appointed. These issues have not arisen since the election; these issues have been on the table for a very long time. And these are issues that the Howard government constantly ignored. This legislation shows the different approach of the Rudd Labor government-a government that listens to and acknowledges what seniors have contributed to Australia in the past, acknowledges the fact that people with disabilities have the right to be treated in the same way as other people and acknowledges the fact that cost of living pressures make it very hard for those people. As I have already mentioned, this legislation delivers on key election commitments. There are no core and non-core promises. The Prime Minister has said that he will deliver on all the commitments he has made to the Australian people, and this is one of those commitments. The government has committed over $4.1 billion to deliver a plan to help make ends meet for seniors. There is a $3.7 billion utilities allowance increase. That is an increase of $500 a year for recipients. It has also been extended to recipients who were not previously entitled to it. The telephone allowance increase will have an impact on access to the internet. Once again, that is a very good initiative. The other initiative that I think is very important is that the government is developing a new index for pensions-a basket full of goods that more accurately reflects the goods and services that a pensioner buys. There is more weighting on food and utilities and less on whitegoods. I have pensioners talking to It me constantly about how the increase in grocery prices is impacting on them. They have highlighted the increase in fruit, vegetables be- and meat prices in particular and have indicated that quite often they are unable to afford those items. They have brought to my attention that not only are prices going up but also, while some prices may remain the same, the actual content in the package has decreased. They say a new way of looking at how the index is developed is long overdue. Once developed, this will be added as an extra element in the indexing formula so that the age pension will increase by the new pensioners basket, the overall CPI or 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings, whichever is higher. In other words, we recognise that we need to revisit this. This is welcome legislation. It is something that the previous Howard government could have fixed, but they just ignored the needs of pensioners. They denied the fact that pensioners were doing it hard. As the then Prime Minister said, ‘Australians have never been better off than they are under the Howard government.' I am very proud to be able to stand in this parliament today to support this legislation. It is legislation that delivering on the Rudd government's commitment to the Australian people at the last election. I know that I will be standing in parliament time and time again talking on legislation that is delivering on commitments to the Australian people, because the Rudd Labor government is about delivering. The Rudd Labor government is not about weasel words; it is not about moving away from the commitments it has made. It is not about core and non-core promises. It is about delivering to the Australian people. I support the legislation before us in the House today.",147
247,Mr WINDSOR,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Allowances) Bill 2008, which addresses the utilities allowance, the seniors concession allowance, the telephone allowance and a number of changes that the previous member mentioned in relation to the indexation processes. These measures will benefit a large number of people and are obviously intended to do so. In my electorate of New England, the issue of the age pension is one that is raised in my office and the lic arena quite often. Only in recent days, the Northern Daily Leader, the major daily paper that comes out of Tamworth, ran a series of stories on old age pensioners and how they are struggling to make ends meet. I have made the point before, and I would like to take the opportunity with this legislation to raise the issue once again, that a nation which in recent years has been able to establish massive surpluses in terms of budgetary processes should be able to give a bit more back, even more than this particular package, to those who are of the generation that created the circumstances out of which those surpluses are now being generated. If we reflect on that group of people, we realise that they are mostly people who were not involved in superannuation schemes as peois ple younger than them would be. There is greater opportunity these days to have some participation in superannuation arrangements this and hence do a bit more for one's own retirement. But a lot of the people who are struggling now-and a lot of members have spoken about these people-are of a generation that did not have that opportunity. In some circumstances they did not have the expectations that younger people of today would have in terms of their spending power and the activities that they derive from the economy. I would suggest to the government that, if there are going to be surplus budgets in future, our older people should benefit. Our older people-our pensioners and our veterans, and I know there are self-funded retirees as well-are the ones who created the circumstances for the economy to develop so that we could have surpluses in the budgetary processes. The veterans made many sacrifices to make sure that this land remained a free land and that we can have the democratic processes that we enjoy today. This bill encapsulates two groups who have made an pub- enormous contribution to the society in which we live today. In my view, neither group is recognised to the extent that it should be. As I have said, if there are surpluses available, these are the first people that we should look to-not in some sort of vote-buying exercise but in an attempt to equalise the playing field so that, as members, we do not constantly hear of some of the hardships that pensioners are going through in their daily lives. The other issue I would like to raise rectly in relation to veterans of the Second World War. We still have an absurd situation where veterans who gave up their time to serve Australia in the Second World War but do not have what is called ‘qualifying service', which means having an angry shot fired at them in combat, still do not receive gold card health benefits. They are dying at the rate of 1,200 a month, and most of those people are well into their 80s. Particularly given the economic circumstances where there have been surpluses derived, I would have thought that, given their age, these ple should be treated exactly the same as other World War II veterans, irrespective of whether they served overseas but did not have an angry shot fired at them. These people are not going to be with us forever, so it is not a projection of funding for 100 years once the gates have opened. Many members in this House would have people in their electorates who gave up five years of their lives to serve their country, be here to defend it while others went overseas. My father went overseas and he would have been a great lot of help if the Japanese had come to Werris Creek! He was in Egypt and it probably would have taken him a while to get home to defend my mother. The people who enlisted and stayed in Australia were available to go wherever they were sent by the government of the day. We are treating those two groups of people very differently. The people who went to Egypt qualified because they went to war. Those who stayed here just hung about. They did not do anything. But in terms of having the capacity and the training to defend the nation if called upon, if the Japanese had advanced through New Guinea and invaded Australia, they were the people who were going to defend our land, not other people's lands. I call on Prime Minister Rudd to show some compassion for these people. It is time that we overis dicame this ridiculous notion of qualifying service. A man in my electorate trained for five years. On a couple of occasions he was going to be sent overseas and then they retrained him to stay here. Then he went into the paratroopers just in case something went wrong. In five years he had a number of accidents out of aircraft and suffered injuries. Now he is in his 80s and is suffering the consequences of those injuries. When he goes into a surgery for a consultation or any medical assistance, he can be with another 85-yearpeo- old man who happened to go to Egypt and they will be treated differently by the system. I think that is a disgrace. In my electorate a man called Ken Colton, who only died last year, had obviously been affected by this notion of qualifying service and felt he was regarded as a second-class soldier. It was not because he was not prepared to go overseas and fight but because the government of the day determined that to his unit was to stay here. His unit was to go from Darwin back to wherever to defend the nation in case it was invaded. I make that plea once again. It has fallen on deaf ears for about six years. As I said, those people are dying at a massive rate. I make the plea that we recognise those who are left and provide those veterans with that little bit of extra help in terms of access to the gold card. The other issue that the legislation covers is disability. I take the opportunity, with a little bit of licence in relation to the bill, to raise this issue. I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services is here, because it is an issue that he may well have some regard for. It is the issue of young people with disabilities who are currently housed in nursing homes. It is an issue of quite inappropriate housing-not that I am being critical of nursing homes. There are something like 6,000 young people who are currently housed in nursing homes which are essentially built for old people. A lot of those young people have a lot of life in front of them and really need different resources provided to them. A number of groups in my electorate have been working on a regional model so that services can be delivered to those young people with disabilities. A few years ago I travelled down to Hobart. I was in Tasmania on committee business, but I took the time to go to look at a model in Hobart called ADARDS. It was not an issue of young people in nursing homes; it was an issue of people with dementia. But the style and the model of the building and the way in which the services were delivered was something that we should all look at. It tailored the resources the specific needs of the people. In that case they had dementia. In this case there are young people with disabilities that need to be housed in more appropriate circumstances than they are now. I look forward to working with the new parliamentary secretary on this particular issue and other issues in relation people with disabilities. I have been a member of that voluntary committee within the parliament and have had a number of interests in that particular area. Deputy Speaker Burke, I do congratulate you on your appointment. One of the things the legislation is trying to do is make it easier for pensioners. There is something that we should look very closely at. I know petrol and grocery pricing is the political flavour of the day, to go across the chamber to what the government are going to do. I wish them well in their attempts. There are going to be a number of difficulties in looking at grocery prices. There are things that the government can do, and that the former government could have done, in terms of petrol pricing. A long time ago I did economics at university. I remember very little of it, and I have never practised in terms of being an economist, so do not denigrate my statements. One thing I do remember is that if a country has a comparative advantage in a trade area it should actually take advantage of it. That applies in a number of areas. In the petroleum field it applies. We have an absurd situation in this country. I know it was introduced for very good reasons, which were probably lies at the time, but the politicians of the day got away with it. I speak of the excise on fuel. If we really want to do something about fuel, we have the capacity to do something about it: we have a taxation regime. With the excise of 38c a litre plus the GST of 12c or 13c, you are looking at 51c a litre in tax. I know this to new fellow that is going to fix up all the bowsers so we will all get cheaper fuel will do a tremendous job, but he will probably have an influence of about 2c. If you are living in the country, with the sales volumes that go through some of the bowsers at petrol stations and other places, that 2c will be to more than subsumed in the margins of the operators. If the government are serious about putting Australia in a position where business activity can have some degree of comparative advantage, let us start looking at the taxation system that we have developed in this nation. I hope I am not verballing the man, but I think Tim Fischer was one person who, when the GST arrangements were being discussed through the late nineties, actually wanted to do something about the inclusion of the excise regime on fuel. I think he was overruled because the mathematics, in terms of the percentage of the GST to recoup the required income, would have meant that the GST may well have been about 13 per cent on sales. The boffins of the day assumed that 10 per cent was as high as you could go without revolt from the people. It just shows how some of our taxation system is derived. If the government are serious about looking at taxation-and I do not agree with the surplus that is being put back to the people; I think it will be inflationary and the government will pay a penalty for that; but they believe they are doing the right thing-and if they are serious about really taking the lid taxation and the impacts that taxation has in terms of economic activity, they have to look at fuel taxation as one of those things that particularly impact on country people. It is not so bad in the city, where there is an option of public transport and other things, but in the country it is something that you just cannot get away from. As members of parliament we have our fuel provided by those hard working taxpayers, so we do not necessarily feel it. But it is something that small business and other people are affected by. I will now get back to the bill. The other day, the Northern Daily Leader reported a story about a pensioner who had moved to a smaller village because of the lower cost of housing, but they still needed a vehicle to access services because there was no public transport there. This happens a lot in country communities. Obviously, the cost of a vehicle and the cost of fuel have an impact on the way in which people can survive on a pension. Many would say, ‘If you are a pensioner and you can't afford a car, you shouldn't have one,' but in some cases that means a pensioner cannot get to a doctor or to a service. Pensioners cannot afford to pay the price of rental accommodation even in a town like Tamworth, for instance, so they go to the smaller communities where that cost is cheaper. There are a number of things that the government should do about the old age pension, but probably the most important one in my view is the indexation arrangement. This has been a farce for many years. It has not kept pace with the real cost of living for these people. I make the plea once again, which must be for about the 50th time. There is a new government. The old government was not prepared to have a serious look at this issue. It sort of dummied the pass to the veterans on many occasions-that might be a off good election slogan; I must remember it! The veterans of the Second World War, whether they served overseas or stayed in this country to defend the nation from attack, are the very people who created the circumstances where we could have an age pension and a parliamentary system where issues such as this could be debated. It is time that we treated all these veterans the same in terms of their access to healthcare arrangements.",150
248,Mr SHORTEN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"MaribyrnongParliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services) (6.46 pm)-Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, may I congratulate you on your election. I would also like to thank the preceding speakers for their contributions-in particular, the member for Ballarat and the member for Shortland, who are tireless campaigners for pensioners and self-funded retirees, and the member for New England for his interest in young people and nursing homes. I also thank him for his kind words. I certainly look forward to working closely with him on those matters and to visiting his electorate to investigate further the places to which he referred. The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Allowances) Bill 2008 will give much-needed financial support to about three million eligible Australians, including pensioners and self-funded retirees, who are finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet. This bill will amend the social security law, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 to give increased and more timely financial support to older Australians, people with a disability, carers and veterans. This bill will help older Australians receiving income support payments such as the age pension and veteran service pension by significantly increasing the utilities allowance. This measure will benefit over 1.7 million aged income support recipients, 250,000 Commonwealth senior health card holders, 700,000 disability support pensioners and 120,000 carer payment recipients. The annual rate of the utilities allowance will increase from $107.20 to $500, and it will be paid in quarterly instalments of $125 for singles and eligible couples combined. This equals a total annual payment of $500 for singles and $250 for each member of a couple. The allowance will be paid quarterly in line with the timing of utility bills. Paying the allowance regularly allows older Australians peace of mind and certainty that they will have the funds on hand to The bill also expands the qualification criteria for the utilities allowance to cover ple under pension or qualifying age and receiving a carer payment, people receiving a disability support pension-particularly pleasing to me as parliamentary secretary for disabilities-people on the invalidity service pension, a partner service pension and income support supplement, a bereavement allowance, a widow B pension and a wife pension. This equals a total annual payment of $500 for singles and $250 for each member of a couple in one of these new groups. Under these two elements, more Australians will receive more assistance to help with their utilities costs. The bill also significantly increases the rate of seniors concession allowance which is paid to self-funded retirees from $218 to a total annual payment of $500 for each eligible individual self-funded retiree. In another change to make life easier for seniors, this higher rate will also be paid on a quarterly basis, on the same day as the utilities allowance. Lastly, the bill provides a higher rate of telephone allowance for older Australians, carers and people with a disability, if they receive income support and have an internet connection at home. This higher rate of telephone allowance will be available for eligible veterans and their dependants who have an internet connection at home. The new rate of $132 for singles will be available to those who have a home internet connection, which is an increase from the standard rate of telephone allowance of $88 a year. This will allow older Australians, as well as their carers, and people with a disability to stay in touch with their loved ones via the internet. Affordable home access to the internet has the potential to connect them to a whole new world of communication, information and pay their bills. entertainment. The member for Warringah wondered peoabout our commitments to pensioners' reciprocal transport concessions. The Rudd government is delivering on all of its election commitments, including the national reciprocal transport concessions for senior Australians. This would apply to all seniors who have a seniors card, enabling them to get transport concessions when they travel interstate. The Rudd government is committed to working with the states and territories to implement this commitment. In a brave new era of cooperative federalism, we are determined to succeed where the previous government failed or simply did not even try. We have put $50 million on the table, doubling the funding offer from the previous government, and we are confident of a result. In response to the member for Warringah's second issue related to the budget: like the previous government, the current government does not discuss its budget processes. This legislation is the latest in a long line of Labor government social security innovations, proving-if any proof is necessary that Labor is the party which cares about all Australians, which understands that families need support and assistance. The Whitlam government was the first to commit to indexing pensions to cost of living increases and it delivered in its first six months the single mothers benefit, the first Commonwealth income support payment for single parents. Then came the Hawke and Keating governments, which introduced the family assistance package, child support payments and replaced the unemployment benefit with the Newstart job search allowance-linking for the first time social security payments with an active employment participation strategy. The Hawke and Keating governments introduced the sole parent pension and set it at the same rate as the age pension. They replaced the ancient invalid pension with the disability support pension. Then came the superannuation guarantee charge, requiring employers for the first time to make private contributions to employees' superannuation to protect workers from poverty in retirement, with a comprehensive system bringing financial security for all not just some. I have gone through this because Labor has always been the party which truly cares for and supports Australia's working families, its older people and its pensioners. I commend the bill to the House.

250,Dr SOUTHCOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, and congratulations on your election to this high office. I am pleased to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Assistance) Bill 2008. In the 2007 budget the Howard government announced an extension of FEE-HELP to the vocational education and training sector. This was to improve an anomalous situation whereby the VET sector had some courses with high fees but was the only sector with postsecondary qualifications without an income-contingent loan scheme. On 21 June 2007 the Howard government introduced the Higher Education Support Amendment (Extending FEE-HELP for VET Diploma and VET Advanced Diploma Courses) Bill 2007. This bill provided an amendment to the Higher Education Support Act 2003 enabling FEE-HELP to be extended to the vocational education and training sector, specifically providing financial assistance to individuals undertaking full-fee diplomas and advanced diplomas, and this was later extended to graduate certificates and graduate diplomas following evidence given to the Senate committee examining the bill. The intention of that bill was that VET FEE-HELP be available for diploma and advanced diploma courses; where full fees are charged; where there are arrangements for credit transfer for a higher education award; and only to VET providers that are corporate bodies. Unfortunately, due to a drafting error, the legislation did not allow for the writing of guidelines to reflect this intent. VET FEE-HELP will not commence until the second half of 2008-that was the intention-and so the problem will be easily fixed in time with this bill. The Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion carried on during the second reading speech as if she was the first minister who has ever had to amend a bill. I simply point out to the House that this drafting error was not picked up by either the then opposition or the Senate committee which examined the bill. It was not raised in submissions. It was found when the time came to write the guidelines. This is something that would have been corrected had the now opposition won the last election. It is something that is now being done by the current government. Having said that, the opposition appreciate that the full intent of our 2007 budget initiative to extend FEE-HELP to VET is reflected in this amended bill. Extending FEE-HELP to VET courses has been welcomed by stakeholder groups and the VET sector. Submissions were sought for the initial bill, and there was strong support for the bill from the Australian Council for Private Education and Training, ACPET. However, along with the International College of Hotel Management, they encouraged expansion of the bill to encompass vocational graduate certificates and graduate diplomas. This amendment was taken up by the Howard government and will allow for VET FEE-HELP to be provided for these courses when all other eligibility criteria met. A Treasury working paper in April 2007 by Bruce Chapman, Mark Rodrigues and Chris Ryan entitled HECS for TAFE: the case for extending income contingent loans to the vocational education and training sector provides a sound economic argument in favour of extending income-contingent loans to VET students. Students should not be deterred from undertaking VET courses as a result of potentially short-term financial constraints preventing them from financing their further education. Higher education loans have been available since 1989 for Commonwealth-supported university coursesHECS-HELP-and in 2005 the coalition government extended this to include FEEHELP for non-Commonwealth-funded courses at universities and eligible private tertiary providers. FEE-HELP was recognised in the Treasury paper as being an ‘important innovation in Australian higher education financing'. Research undertaken by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research shows that in 2005 there were 833,700 students who undertook fee-for-service VET courses-that is, full-fee VET coursesequating to 12.6 per cent of VET revenue. The intention of the bill was to extend income-contingent loans to the vocational education and training sector-broadening the base from higher education, where FEEHELP is available to assist students to pay up-front costs. Fees payable by full-feepaying students vary between courses and training providers. One example provided in the TAFE futures survey 2006 is $13,000 a year for hairdressing and $6,060 for a diploma in multimedia, with high equipment and teaching costs impacting on the up-front fees required for each course. The general FEE-HELP loan limit is currently set at $80,000-with $100,000 for dentistry, mediare cine and veterinary science. VET FEE-HELP offers a means of costsharing between governments and students. There is extensive research as to the benefits of cost-sharing, suggesting that, as there are benefits both to society and to the individual, cost-sharing offers an equitable solution for the financing of further education. However, as there may be a time lag before the student is able to realise the financial benefits of their education, government assistance in meeting the up-front fees for study may enable students to increase their qualifications, when without assistance there is a potential barrier to VET participation for some students. The TAFE futures survey of 2006 indicated that fees presented a major deterrent, particularly to those living in areas with a high dependence on social security and those in low-paid jobs. Particular note is made in this report of the increased difficulties faced by students in paying the additional costs associated with the higher level courses. Under the previous coalition government, payments were made to encourage the uptake of VET courses. These payments included income support, training vouchers, skills vouchers for basic training and tax-free wage top-ups. For apprentices there was support for tool kits and fees. VET FEEHELP furthers these measures, specifically targeting full-fee, higher level qualifications. These payments are intended to assist in boosting the number of students undertaking qualifications in areas of skill shortages. cupations facing skill shortages vary across Australia. However, in areas of high employment such as northern metropolitan Perth, shortages are evident for electricians, registered and enrolled nurses, motor mechanics, carpenters and childcare workers. Attracting people into these industries requires a multifaceted approach, improving incentives and addressing the reasons why people are reluctant to enter into these occupations. VET FEE-HELP removes the disincentive of up-front fee payment for full-fee students. This goes part of the way to boosting enrolments in these courses. With increasing demand for skilled workers, there is a need to assist those who wish to undertake VET courses that can lead to future studies. Over the next 10 years it is expected that over 60 per cent of jobs will require high-quality technical or vocational qualifications. However, to date only 30 per cent of the population have these required skills. Monash University research has indicated that this will require a 1.9 per cent increase in the overall number of VET qualifications gained each year. The courses eligible for VET FEE-HELP cover a wide range of industries, including hairdressing, construction, engineering and mining, electrotechnology, and hospitality and tourism. Skill shortages are apparent in a number of these areas across Australia and offering VET FEE-HELP to students wishing to undertake studies in these areas helps address these shortages. Limitations have been placed to ensure that VET FEE-HELP is only extended to those courses for which higher education credit transfers are possible. These qualifications can then lead to further education prospects. This amendment provides a minor technical correction to the original legislaOc- tion, ensuring that the extension of FEEHELP is restricted to those originally intended to receive it, identified as eligible full-fee-paying students undertaking TAFE diplomas, advanced diplomas, graduate certificates and graduate diplomas with VET providers who have credit transfer arrangements with a higher education provider in place for each of their qualifications and providers who are corporate bodies. This was the original intention of the bill introduced by the former government and, as such, the opposition supports this bill.",155
251,Mr HAYES,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I rise to support the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Assistance) Bill 2008. Largely what this bill does is to lend support to the original intention of the VET FEE-HELP provisions when they were introduced into the Higher Education Support Act 2003. Like any parent these days, we all want the best for our children. In my instance, I am very fortunate that two of my sons have progressed through the vocational education system. I know that as a parent we do want the best and also realise that not ryone is going to want to access tertiary education. Therefore, we need to have varying pathways to guide young people in the direction of a career. I think it is very important that we have proper pathways for students who wish to continue with further study and, as I say, do not simply have, or seem to have, only the option of tertiary education. The bill before us lends support to the original intention of VET FEE-HELP, and that is to assist students with the up-front costs of full-fee VET courses. However, the way it was originally drafted could see VET FEE-HELP being provided much more broadly than was originally intended. This bill helps direct the VET fee assistance in relation to both full-fee courses which are offered under the VET system and courses which go on to give higher education credit transfer, which is very important when we are talking about increasing the skills and abilities of students. Hopefully, in undertaking these courses, having the ability to transemployment fer credit will lend itself to higher educational attainment as well. I think it is important that we reflect on the developments that have been made in the VET system. For most people, vocational education once meant TAFE colleges. These days a revolution has occurred in vocational education, and private providers are providing a very significant service in vocational education. The intention of this provision is to make sure that those private providers provide all the information that is required by the Minister for Education in order to attract up-front VET fee payments for students undertaking those courses. These are matters which probably should have been taken care of when this was originally dealt with in the last parliament, but something that I think is common ground to both sides is that we want the system to work. Moreover, not only do we want it to evework, we want it to work in the manner that was originally intended, and that is like what occurs with FEE-HELP. VET FEE-HELP is there to assist to some extent the decision making process of students going to undertake courses to increase their skills and who, as a consequence, have to shoulder the burden of up-front fees. This is what the scheme is designed to do. It is one that should probably have been looked at more fully when it was originally put forward, but it is one which we are certainly prepared to now commit to and finalise. It will provide opportunities not only for young people but also for those students who are committed to increasing their skills, particularly with a view to being in a position to compete in the everchanging modern job market. As I understand just from the research that has been conducted in my electorate of Werriwa, it is predicted that, in the not too distant future, over 60 per cent of the positions which will be made available for localised will require some form of technical or vocational educational qualification. Certainly they may not always be at diploma or advanced diploma level, but it is interesting that people are now looking to the future, planning the recruitment of skilled labour and making assessments at this stage that they will be looking for people to have VET qualifications as a prerequisite for employment. If that occurs in Werriwa, I imagine that it will not be far from the mark in the electorate of anybody else in this House. I am happy to stand here and support the bill. It will at least bring this matter to a proper conclusion so that VET FEE-HELP can be brought to bear to assist those people who it was originally intended to assist and to apply to those courses to which it was originally intended to apply. To that extent, I support the bill.",157
252,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"In following the member for Boothby, who spoke earlier, I will just very briefly make a couple of points in relation to this debate. Obviously the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Assistance) Bill 2008 is a technical amendment to the reforms that were announced by the previous government in the last budget to extend FEE-HELP to the vocational education and training sector. The legislation came in in June and passed through the parliament. There was a technical problem with the legislation and, consequently, the new government is now amending it. I share the views of the member for Boothby, who pointed out quite eloquently that, when the Minister for Education introduced this bill, she seemed to be acting as though the need for a technical amendment to correct an error is something that has occurred one or two times since Federation. I say in a friendly manner-she will know that is certainly my nature-that she should prepare herself for many more amendments in the years to come. I do not say that with any disrespect to her officials who are here, but bills do get amended. Whilst I can understand the minister hyping up the fact that the amendment is necessary and that there was an error made at the time, and blaming the previous government for that and everything else she can think of on any other issue, it is the case, she knows it-and let the Hansard show that the minister, who is at the table, is smilingthat she will face many amendments to her own legislation. It might not be for a few weeks or months, but the minister will be back in here, I presume consistently, attacking herself for the technical errors in future bills. We are very, very glad to hear that and we will be the first to give her praise if she does not ever have to pass an amendment to any bill that she introduces, be it in workplace relations, education or social inclusion. We are very glad to hear that there will not be any errors. She made that declaration in the first week of parliament. She looks relaxed; her officials look slightly less relaxed, and I can understand that. They cannot agree, but rest assured that they know that, just as this bill is being amended, there will be many other amendments. My understanding is that this was perhaps picked up in the explanatory memorandum but not the bill. But the important point that the member for Boothby made was that this was always going to be picked up. In fairness to the departmental officials, who now work for a new government, I certainly believe that this technical error was always going to be picked up with an amendment. It was picked up in good time, because these new measures-which are very welcome and will have a major benefit to the vocational education and training sector-start in the second half of this year, so hyper claims about cost blow-outs and major catastrophes with regard to the need for the amendment do not really apply. We are here in the second week of the sitting in February supporting the amendment, and it will go through very quickly. You will have many months before the new scheme actually starts. By then, I am sure that she will personally be going through other legislation that she introduces-and she has a very busy load with and workplace relations, education and social inclusion; we accept that-line by line to ensure that there are no technical errors made or amendments needed. But these amendments to the substantive bill illustrate the importance of the measures announced by the former minister during last year's budget which were legislated through the parliament. They will make a major contribution to vocational education and training. They were very much welcomed by the sector at the time. I do not specifically the Labor Party, when they were in opposition, demanding that FEE-HELP be extended to the vocational education and training sector-they may well have, but I do not recall that being something that was regularly spoken about by the then opposition. I am glad that they support the initiative that we introduced during last year, that they support it wholeheartedly and that they realise that these reforms, which were the past government's reforms, will make a very major contribution to the sector. So we are supporting this amendment bill. We will support the other amendments that the minister will need to bring forward in the future years as well, if they are of a technical nature. We will be happy if they do not come forward-because she has announced that there will never be another amendment. That is fine. But if it turns out that, due to no fault of her own, these things slip through, then we will be there to play a bipartisan role on technical matters.",159
253,Ms GILLARD,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (7.17 pm)-in reply-I thank every member who has contributed to this debate. I thank the shadow minister for education for his contribution. Clearly, he is a forgiving man, and I think that is a delightful personality trait! I would hope that I will not have to rely on his forgiving nature too much in the future. But, should I ever need to rely on that, clearly he is someone who, by dint of personality, will be forgiving should that time come. In relation to the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Assistance) Bill 2008, as I indicated at the start of this debate, it completes the arrangements consistent with the original policy intent of recall the VET FEE-HELP legislation introduced last year. These amendments were necessary to allow the legislative guidelines that sit under the VET FEE-HELP legislation to be drafted in line with the intent of extending the higher education FEE-HELP arrangements to the VET sector. If one were being unkind, one would say that the failure that this amendment bill seeks to rectify was caused by the previous government's ineptitude; if one were being a more generous soul, one would say it was in the nature of things. But, whatever analysis one brings to it, clearly there were flaws in the original legislation and we need to make sure that they are rectified, and this has been given a very high priority by the Rudd government. It is essential to bring this legislation forward to assist students studying in high-level VET programs this year. VET FEE-HELP assistance will be restricted to full-fee-paying students while requiring credit transfer arrangements for diploma and advanced diploma courses that can be assessed on a course-by-course basis. This will provide the greatest degree of flexibility to the sector while ensuring that VET students get appropriate recognition for subsequent studies in higher education and receive credit for what they have already done. Aligning student financing arrangements between vocational education and higher education in this way will reduce the administrative burden on dual-sector providersand I know that you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, are familiar with the operation of those in Victoria, as am I in my local electorate-and will help improve the movement of students between the sectors. It will underpin the move to higher skill levels in Australia's tertiary education system, a key contribution to improving productivity. Once again I thank all members who have participated in this debate. I thank the opposition for their support for this legislation and ence. their quick processing of it. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",160

255,Mr TURNBULL,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"The Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 seeks to introduce a number of measures that lapsed in the previous parliament. I am particularly pleased to see the provisions relating to a carbon sink forest. Part of the previous government's commitment to dealing with climate change was taking on the battle against deforestation everywhere in the world-in Australia and internationally. We established the Global Initiative on Forests and Climate, which was a world-leading effort to take on that part of human activity, deforestation, which constitutes 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. In that respect we were genuinely leading the world-we brought together an international conference-and it is no accident, and in large measure due to Australia's hard work and our leadership, that deforestation was such an important issue, and its connection with the greenhouse challenge such an enormous issue, at the Bali conferI am also delighted to see the tax offset for the equine workers hardship wage supplement payment. Again, that is a carry over from the previous government. And I know that my colleague the shadow minister for finance will be pleased to see the provisions relating to superannuation lump sums paid to a member having a terminal medical condition; again, that being placed back into the legislative process here in this bill. But this bill also contains a malign element which should not be bundled up with what are, essentially, administrative matters-that is, it picks up items of legislation that lapsed in the last parliament. The linking of those very important and very positive measures with a piece of legislation to remove tax deductibility for contributions to political parties is designed to make it difficult for the House to properly consider the important issue of campaign finance. I foreshadow that we will be moving an amendment to address that matter later in this debate. There is nothing more important in our democracy than contestability. The thing that keeps governments honest is the fear that they may be turned out. If we get to a point where governments-and this would apply to governments of any political persuasionwere so entrenched in their incumbency that they could never practically be removed then we will have lost what lies at the very core of the democratic process. At the moment, we have the Australian Labor Party in government in every parliament in Australia. The Australian Labor Party not only has the benefits of incumbency, which are considerable, but also has the benefit of an enormous financial advantage in terms of fundraising and money for campaigning. In every election over the last decade, we have seen the Labor Party-be it at state or federal leveloutspending by many times the Liberal Party in their campaigns and in particular in their advertising in the media. The question that we have to ask ourselves, as Australians committed to a contestable democracy, is what price democracy if one side of politics has an inordinate share of the financial resources available for campaigning? How has that come about? Years ago, the trade unions would give money to the Labor Party and business, particularly big business, would give money to the conservative parties. There was a rough equivalence. What has happened in recent years-and I speak with some personal knowledge of this, having formerly been the honorary federal treasurer of the Liberal Party-is that the larger public companies have either ceased to make political donations at all or, when they have made donations, split them fifty-fifty. Of course, state governments are controlled by the Labor party and have enormous leverage over property developers and the hospitality industry. Look at what the Labor government in New South Wales has done for the hoteliers of that state by putting poker machines in every hotel. That is a wonderful contribution to the social welfare of the people of New South Wales! It has done a great job for party fundraising but it means that the Labor Party now has at least as large if not a larger share of contributions from the business sector as the Liberal Party. All of this is publicly disclosed; this is all a matter of This is not a contentious observation. At the same time, the Labor Party has 100 per cent of the donations that come from the trade union movement. So, as every year has gone on, Labor's financial advantage has become greater and greater. That has put us in the position where we have to ask ourselves: what price democracy? Where is the contestability? Look at a government as hopeless, flawed and failed as the New South Wales Labor government and it got re-elected not least because it was able to spend five times as much on television advertising as the opposition was. There is no longer a contestable democracy if one side of politics has such an enormous advantage. Senator Faulkner is seeking to entrench that advantage even greater; he seeks to take Labor's existing advantage and make it greater still. This proposal to remove tax deductibility for donations obviously affects the Liberal Party but it does not affect the Liberal Party exclusively because, of course, it means donations to the Labor Party are non-tax deductible as well. If the government were seriously committed or interested at all in removing tax deductibility for donations to political parties then it would take some action with respect to the activities of trade unions-because trade unions are tax-exempt, union fees are tax-deductible and the unions are the largest single source of funds of the Australian Labor Party. If they were serious about this and said, ‘No, we only want to have after-tax dollars, dollars on which tax has been paid, going into political parties,' then, when a trade union gave a million dollars to the Labor Party, it would be obliged to gross it up for the tax and pay the tax to the Australian Taxation Office. Then you would get some degree of equity, but we see nothing of the sort. What Labor is seeking to do is take a playing field, the contestable playing field of fact. democracy, upon which the great political parties of this country contend-and it is already tilted in favour of Labor when it comes to financial resources-and tilt it even further to give itself incumbency and an ability to resist a challenge from an opposition with the same kind of impregnability that it has been able to achieve in the states around Australia. This is a big moral issue. It is not just nancial issue; it is not just goes to the very heart of our democracy. We cannot afford to allow our democracy to become less contestable than it is today. I am, and have been for many years, very committed to campaign finance reform. I would love to see a day when no unions or corporations could give donations to political parties. I would love to see a day when only individuals on the electoral roll were able to give money to political parties-with an annual cap. I would support that but this is a big issue and one that this parliament owes the nation a careful consideration. That is why we will be shortly moving an amendment to take this obnoxious element of this bill-and indeed all the related campaign finance issues-to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for careful consideration.

256,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Flinders Electorate: Warley Hospital",163
257,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise two serious matters: the cutting of health services and the cutting of education services within the electorate of Flinders. Most particularly, as members of this House may be aware, on 31 January this year, under the watch of the Rudd Labor government, Warley Hospital, a bush-nursing hospital which is community owned and has lasted for 84 years, closed against the will, against the desire and against the good interests of the people of Phillip Island. Warley Hospital closed because, out of an act of pure ideological vindictiveness, the Rudd government stopped a payment of $2½ million which would have given that hospital contemporary life and a long-term future. It would have given the people of Phillip Island significant health care, not just over the next decade but a fi- over the next generation and over the next a political issue. It half-century. Let me go through some of the facts very briefly. This is a hospital which had received significant federal support over the last decade. But, most importantly, it had been starved of assistance from the state of Victoria. The hospital had warned that it would face a difficult future if it were not able to receive public beds. This community owned hospital served the people of Phillip Island for 84 years, but it was being denied access to public beds to serve the public on Phillip Island. It was finally knocked back late in 2007. At that point the hospital sought emergency assistance from the federal government. This occurred on the eve of the election. A promise was immediately made by the Prime Minister, through the Prime Minister's office, and the health minister, Tony Abbott. That promise was to guarantee the future of Warley Hospital. That was followed by a short process of inquiry to receive as much information as possible, which led to the pledge of $2.5 million in order to guarantee Warley Hospital a future. Warley Hospital was the centre and heart of the Phillip Island community. It was not a so-called private hospital, as the health minister in this place has sought to argue. It was a not-for-profit, community owned and community generated bush-nursing hospital. It provided services such as accident and emergency services after hours, postoperative recovery services and the very important service of palliative care, of providing a home and place for those who are facing their last days, in a way which was accessible to residents of Phillip Island so that family could be near those who were facing death. This is a fundamental role and it has been a part of the island and part of the health services, as I said, for 84 years. After the election was over, contrary to expectations, the new government did not accept the pleas and the requests of the Phillip Island community, the board of Warley Hospital and of all of those involved. Instead of matching that promise made by the previous government, we saw Warley Hospital axed. The money was denied and, worse than that, there was no response from either the Prime Minister or the health minister to letters sent in late January by the chairman of the board of Warley Hospital. There was no response to the request that they face the people of Phillip Island and explain why this hospital was about to be closed down, and there was no response in the most important element, which was the desperate request for funding. This hospital has gone. The evidence from the local community is that people are being sent to Wonthaggi, a hospital that is itself experiencing serious difficulties, so it sometimes takes two or three hours before they can find a hospital to treat people with accident and emergency problems. This is a real blow to the community. On another occasion I will deal with the impacts of the loss of Investing in Our Schools Program on primary schools such as San Remo Primary School, Cowes Primary School and Lang Lang Primary School. But now we grieve for the loss of Warley Hospital. (Time expired) Speaker: Election Newcastle Electorate: Sport",163
258,Ms GRIERSON,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation to the speakership. I did have a previous opportunity but at the time, in question time, you were being so stern and there was such a profound silence in response that I did not like to spoil the moment. As much as I miss sharing a bench in this chamber with you, and I miss your wise counsel, sharp wit and great humour, I am so proud that it is being shared with the Australian public. The question time tragics in my electorate are telling me that they very much appreciate the new style of the new Speaker. It is grand final time in the A-league and I am proud to inform the House that on Sunday evening the Newcastle Jets will play the Central Coast Mariners in the grand final. I notice that the member for Robertson, a rival in this, is here and I am sure she is supporting her team. While we have made the finals in each of the three years of the A-league competition, this is our very first grand final. Last year the member for Hindmarsh's team knocked us out; I enjoyed very much watching that game with him in Adelaide. So in Newcastle we are abuzz with excitement. That we have reached this point is a tribute to the owner, Con Constantine; the club's executive and staff; its coach, Gary van Egmond; and all of its wonderfully talented players, not to mention the dedicated fans. On the weekend, former Socceroo Craig Foster wrote that the Jets, along with Queensland Roar, were the best teams to watch this the season-a fine tribute to our young squad, from a great of the Australian game. The city of Newcastle has got right behind our Jets in the three years of its existence, and it is great that we now have two teamsthe Jets and the Knights-competing at the highest level, in two national football codes and receiving such wonderful support. Like thousands of Novocastrians, I am looking forward to travelling to Sydney on Sunday to cheer them home. But also like many thousands of Novocastrians, I will miss the home-ground atmosphere. Like them, I was also very disappointed that, had we qualified first for the grand final, we would not have had the opportunity to host the grand final at our home ground-EnergyAustralia Stadium-because our stadium's capacity, currently around 24,000, is just not sufficient for a grand final crowd. It is also not big enough to host Asian Cup or World Cup matches, which require 40,000 seats-competitions which Australia has indicated it may bid for in the near future. It would be a tragedy for our region if we were to miss out on those opportunities because our stadium still is not up to international standard. I was first elected into this place in and I continually lobbied the former government for federal assistance to help upgrade our stadium. Ten thousand signatures on a petition were lodged, but not one cent was forthcoming for Newcastle. I am pleased to report to the House that the Rudd government is following through with its commitment at the last election to contribute $10 million to help create several thousand more seats at EAS. Mr Bruce Scott-It sounds like porkbarrelling to me! Roll out the pork!",164
259,Ms GRIERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"We expect this funding to become available in April or May this year and I would be very surprised if it spent already. Adding to the state government's recent funding, we are now moving forward after 10 years of neglect by the Howard government. I hear the member opposite saying ‘pork-barrelling'. I remember the former Treasurer's team, the former Prime Minister's team and the team of the former member for Lindsay, Jackie Kellyand I remember quite a few announcements of stadium funding, but none for Newcastle. I will keep working with my colleagues in government, with the Hunter International Sports Centre Trust and with the community to make sure more funding becomes available to build the new western grandstand we would all so dearly love to see. In the past we have missed out on hosting Rugby World Cup matches. An economic study done by the local university shows that we have missed out on $130 million in economic activity that it is estimated a redeveloped stadium would bring in. The city of Newcastle now boasts two codes and two top-ranking teams-the Jets and the Knights-using the stadium year round. I congratulate the Knights on their victory in the opening trial game for the 2008 season, and our Jets have qualified for 2001, the Asian Champions League in 2009. We really do want to be part of the Asian and World Cup bids in 2015 and 2018. I will be cheering the Jets home in Sydney on Sunday, and hoping the member for Robertson is not quite as happy as I am on the day, and I will keep working towards the day when we can cheer them home in a grand final at EnergyAustralia Stadium-and when we can cheer on the Socceroos in international matches held at EnergyAustralia Stadium.",165
260,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I simply say to the honourable member for Newcastle that while the chair is supposed to be benevolent in most matters, within the A-league there is is not only one victory-a Melbourne victory. Regional Partnerships Program",165
261,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I rise here today to ask this new Labor government, led by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, to honour the commitments the previous coalition government made to the people of rural and regional Australia-particularly the communities in my electorate of Maranoa and those who were redistributed from Maranoa into the new Labor seat of Flynn. The Labor Party has criticised the National-Liberal coalition over the highly successful Regional Partnerships program. We have been accused of pork-barrelling, a charge that I reject outright. I am not going to apologise to this Prime Minister or his Labor counterparts for working hard for the people of Maranoa. I certainly am not going to apologise for the hard work and the tireless efforts of my constituents to better their communities. In my electorate of Maranoa, the Regional Partnerships program, together with the Balonne Shire Council, for instance, and the Queensland government, has provided the people of Dirranbandi-a town of about 500 people-with a community swimming pool. Together with the Barcoo Shire, the Regional Partnerships program has built a community centre for the western town of Stonehenge, a town of around 40 people. Aramac Shire was able to build a medical precinct. Charleville was able to build a skate park for its young people. The Tara Shire Council was able to provide its community with extended day care facilities. And in the Diamantina shire, Birdsville was able to build a medical clinic. The Rudd Labor government has accused the Liberal and National parties of rorting and pork-barrelling the Regional Partnerships program into coalition electorates. So does that mean that the new member for Flynn and the Prime Minister-a Queenslander-is not going to support the extension of aged facilities in Blackall, which is now in the new Labor seat of Flynn? Will his own member for Flynn support him? And where is Chris Trevor, the member of Flynn? He has been very quiet since his election in November. What is he going to say to the communities of Muttaburra, Tambo and Alpha, who have been told that their projects, previously approved by a coalition government, might not be able to go ahead after all? ‘Sorry, the coalition was pork-barrelling. No motel for Muttaburra. No new business and cultural centre for Tambo. No new show grounds and rodeo ring for Alpha'? Does the member for Flynn want to tell his constituents that the Labor governmentwhich boasts to be a government for all Australians-is happy to put $2 million into the Tree of Knowledge project in Barcaldine, which is obviously a symbol of the birth of his own party, but does not want to improve the aged-care facilities in Blackall? When the member for Flynn visits the pool in Muttaburra, built with Regional Partnerships funding, will he tell them that it was a result of pork-barrelling? Or is he going to realise it is a vital asset to the Muttaburra community-a place to teach kids how to swim, a place to gather socially, a place which provides hydrotherapy to the elderly? When the new member for Flynn goes to Blackall, is he going to tell them that he will not help provide them with more aged-care places because it is pork-barrelling? If he is going to go up there, I am happy to go with him to that part of the old Maranoa, where the Regional Partnerships program helped to build community centres, pools, saleyards and medical clinics. I am happy to go there with the new member for Flynn, and when he points out that he considers that these are pork-barrelling projects, I will be happy to look on those projects with pride. I certainly will not be apologising. These Regional Partnerships projects are vital to the outback communities of Queensland. Since 2003 there has been some $10 million provided to Maranoa communities through this program. The Maranoa electorate covers almost one half of the land mass of Queensland. It covers the equivalent of almost 3½ times the land mass of Victoria. And yet during the six-week election campaign, Labor promised $5.3 million for regional projects for the seat of Flynn alone. I will support those projects, because they will help those communities, but do the Prime Minister and the member for Flynn think that the $2.4 million Barcaldine Tree of Knowledge project is more important than the motel accommodation for Muttaburra or the aged-care facility in Blackall? Will they honour our commitments to the other communities of rural and regional Queensland? If the new Prime Minister is serious about governing for all Australians, he must not abolish this highly beneficial program; he must continue to support all the communities of outback Queensland. After all, he says he is from Queensland and he is there to help. I call on the member for Flynn to go and see the Prime Minister and make sure those projects, supported and approved by the former coalition government, proceed. (Time expired) Business Enterprise Centres",165
262,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I too would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on gaining the high office of Speaker. This is also my first opportunity to speak freely in this new parliamentary term and my first chance to note for the record the views that stem from my constituents within Hindmarsh and to speak about those who take a chance in life with the aim of better caring for themselves and their family. I am speaking about the many people who take a risk in developing or buying into a small to medium business-the people who are up to the challenge of being their own investor, boss and, in many cases, primary employee. I am also talking about the family enterprises-be they the corner shop, the trades, contractors, hairdressers, bakeries, food processors, mechanics, component producers, artists or tourist operators-where mums and dads work together on the product, the marketing and the accounting, and usually out of a very small business premises that may even be the family home. Businesspeople such as these come from all walks of life and, naturally, engage in an almost infinite variety of enterprises. Their spirit of self-confidence and hard work is to be encouraged-not just in sentimental terms from afar but also, where possible, with effective assistance. This Labor government believes this wholeheartedly. Some used to say that one of the goals of the Labor Party was the transformation of members of the working class into that which owned their own means of production and a level of economic independence. Businesses around the country, whether they are starting from the ground up or whether they are established, receive assistance towards all of these ends through community organisations run by the very people of the business sector whom others may wish to learn from and possibly emulate. These are business enterprise centres, and they provide terrific services to budding and expanding businesspeople. At no cost or minimal cost and with full confidentiality, they provide independent advice on starting, maintaining or expanding a business, on import replacement or on developing export markets. There are two business enterprise centres within my electorate of Hindmarsh and both of them do an exceptionally good job. One of them is in the inner west of Adelaide and one is in the inner south. Successes in such ventures mean a secure income for the businesspeople themselves, their contractors and their employees and, of course, it also means a more dynamic and affluent community in general. I visited the two business enterprise centres that service the area of Hindmarsh as one of my first duties after being elected to parliament in late 2004. I visited with then shadow minister Tony Burke, who was keen, to say the least, to see what was happening on the ground in Adelaide's western suburbs. We visited both the Inner Southern Business Enterprise Centre, which is located in Morphettville, and the Inner West Business Enterprise Centre, which was then located in the inner western suburb of Mile End. Such centres do warrant Commonwealth support. Too many times we have heard of smart technological and business ideas leaving local areas for other states. Too many times we have heard about products that could have been developed in Australia being developed overseas. Many reasons exist for such losses, but this Labor government is committed to assisting small businesses to succeed where possible. Labor is committed to providing the backing to enable people who know about small to medium business to provide advice and help to those who are in unfamiliar territory. Businesses tell me and my colleagues that they want a one-stop shop for advice to consolidate and grow their businesses-and this Labor government is committed to assisting this to continue into the future. Two such commitments were made toward the Hindmarsh area in the lead-up to the 2007 federal election. The current Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Emerson, committed $300,000 of annual federal funding to both the Inner Southern Business Enterprise Centre in Morphettville and the Inner West Business Enterprise Centre in the western suburbs. Forrest Electorate: Roads",167
263,Ms MARINO,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to call on the federal Labor government to deliver on its funding promises to my electorate of Forrest. In particular, I refer to funding for the Bunbury port access road and the Bunbury outer ring road-projects which I strongly promoted during the election process. Federal Labor must understand that when it makes such funding promises it needs to actually deliver, giving very clear planning and timing direction on the rollout of funds. The member for Batman stated during the election campaign that the Rudd Labor government would work in partnership with the Western Australian government to deliver a new deal on the Bunbury port access road and the outer ring road in Forrest. In fact, federal Labor committed $136 million towards the Bunbury port access road stages 1 and 2 and the outer ring road stage 1. They beat a path to the local newspapers and announced it at every possible opportunity to ensure that the voters of Forrest were well informed on what the Labor Party would do once they were in government. The Prime Minister was quoted in the Australian on 9 February saying: ‘We were serious about our commitments to the people before the election. We intend to implement those commitments.' But now, some three months on, there is still no sign of any of this funding and, indeed, it is impossible to get any response from the minister's office as to when it is likely to happen. The Mayor of Bunbury himself stated to a group of industry professionals on Monday, 18 February 2008 that he had made numerous calls to the minister but he was still waiting to have questions answered as to when this funding would happen. This is a critical regional infrastructure project and crucial to the issue of public safety. Four major highways converge at the Eelup roundabout in Bunbury, creating the worse black spot within the entire state. The Bunbury port access road and outer ring-road projects will allow trucks travelling north and south on the Old Coast Road and South Western Highway to bypass Bunbury and directly access the port. The Bunbury port access road will link the port to the new Perth-Bunbury Highway and South Western Highway. I am most concerned for the logistical infrastructure planning that has already gone into developing this project-a project, I might add, that will provide essential improvement to traffic flow and public safety by eliminating the bottleneck at the roundabout and making it safer for everyone. The roads dovetail into the expansion plans for the Bunbury port and the future Bunbury waterfront concept. I call on the Labor government to keep its promise for this much-needed road funding and to allow the funds to flow urgently for this vital regional project. Further delays will only add to the escalating cost blow-outs. Projects such as these affect the lifestyle, well-being and road safety of all those who live and work in the south-west. They are urgently needed to cater for the increase in industry and population growth. Federal Labor is overdue to deliver on its promise to the residents of the south-west and actually start the process. If these funds do not flow immediately, then it will be clear that federal Labor is not committed to road safety and regional development in the south-west of Western Australia. I call on the government to get on with the job at hand and provide the already approved funds to facilitate the expansion of key economic and social infrastructure in Forrest. Dental Health",168
264,Mr DREYFUS,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to speak about two very important election commitments the Rudd government has made to the Australian people in the area of dental health and what this will mean for my electorate of Isaacs. I want to start by recallnong ing the actions of the former Liberal government in this area. In one of its more miserable acts, the Howard government scrapped Labor's Commonwealth Dental Health Program on taking power in 1996, which ripped more than $100 million from public dental services. This had an enormous impact on the lives of ordinary Australians in need of dental health care. The Howard government followed this act of meanness with more than a decade of blindness to the problems affecting dental health. And there are many problems: one in four adult Australians has untreated dental decay; one in five Australians cannot afford to get the dental care they need; one in six Australians has avoided eating certain foods because of problems with their teeth over the last 12 months; and 50,000 Australians are hospitalised each year for preventable dental conditions. Statistics produced by the National Oral Health Plan indicate that there are more than 220,000 people on public dental waiting lists in Victoria alone. Nationwide the figure is over 600,000. Despite this, the Howard government continued to avoid a national solution to a national problem, leaving it to the states to clean up the mess. State and territory governments have more than doubled their investment in public dental care over the past decade, from $205 million in 1995-96 to $503 million in 2004-05. In my own state of Victoria, the state Labor government has provided an additional $158.2 million to oral health over the past seven years. Despite this extra investment, the length of public dental waiting times continues to be unacceptable. At the Central Bayside Community Health Services in Parkdale, in my electorate, the public dental waiting time for dentures was 30 months as at June 2007. Over in Springvale, at the Greater DandeCommunity Health Service, the waiting time for general services was 32 months. At the Frankston Community Health Service, the waiting time for general services was 35 months. The fact that it will take a pensioner more than three years to get a denture is truly appalling. This is the direct consequence of the actions of the previous government in relation to dental health. In contrast, the Rudd government will establish a Commonwealth Dental Health Program to provide up to one million additional dental treatments. In addition to this, the government will assist working families by establishing the Teen Dental Plan. Under this program, families who receive family tax benefit A will be able to claim up to $150 towards the cost of an annual dental preventative check. These programs are focused on ending the blame game between the federal and state governments and getting on with the job of providing access to dental care. These two initiatives will be welcomed by people in my electorate of Isaacs. The first program I mentioned, the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, will see $290 million provided to facilitate up to one million treatments. That is one million additional treatments that this government will provide over three years. It will help to lieve the pressure that has built up over the last 10 years. I know that the families and pensioners who need to visit the Central Bayside Community Health Services in Parkdale or those who need to visit the Greater Dandenong Community Health Service or those who need to visit the Frankston Community Health Service-all services which do wonderful work in the community-will welcome this funding. The other program I mentioned is the Teen Dental Plan, which is a program to provide up to one million teenagers with a subsidy of $150 towards the cost of an annual check-up. I look forward to seeing the benefits of these programs in my electorate and throughout Australia. Murray Electorate: Water",169

Despite the announcement that, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, it is a controlled action, the Victorian Minister for Planning has announced that an environmental effects statement is not required and that instead he will simply produce a project impact assessment report. I want to know why the EES is not to happen. I want to know what the minister in this House, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, is going to do about the Victorian planning minister's refusal to supply an EES.
