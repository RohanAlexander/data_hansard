8,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon noticeReferring to his answers to questions relative to advertising . the referenda in New South Wales country papers, given on the 27th ultimo1. Is he aware that through the advertisements not being sent direct from his office, or through the Government Printer of New South Wales, the newspapers lost 20 per cent, of the amount they would otherwise have received ? 2. What was to prevent these advertisements from being sent direct to the papers instead of through a private advertising agency? 3. Why did not he invite tenders for this service from the advertising agencies? 4. Is it his intention in the future to farm out advertisements, or will he have them sent direct to the newspapers, so that they shall receive full payment for the service? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are:1. No . 2. The New South Wales Country Press Cooperative Association was authorized to act on behalf of the newspapers concerned. 3. It is not considered advisable to utilize private advertising agencies. 4.

In Committee of S t if f l y (Consideration resumed .from 3rd November, vide page 2274): Divisions 1 to 5 (Home Affairs), ,£824,915.",14
9,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs) [7.38] A sum of .£40,000 appears as "" towards cost of the Military College,'' The Minister will have the support of the whole Committee in doing everything necessary to make the College sumcient for its purposes.",14
10,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The Committee has taken a division on an item subsequent to that.,14
11,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I merely wish the Minister to tell us what is meant by the words ""towards cost""? I wish also to obtain [82] some information with regard to the proposed vote of £ 2 2 , 5 0 0 towards the cost of the construction of the Kalgoorlie to In this con- Port Augusta railway. When the B i ll providing for the construction of this line was introduced, it contained a provision practically making the Consolidated Revenue liable for the cost of construction, but on a question being raised by the Opposition the Prime Minister said that the Government would withdraw the appropriation clause. It was pointed out by the honourable member for Richmond that the procedure usually adopted in the State Parliaments in regard to the construction of railways is first of all to lay upon the table of the House plans and specifications and books of reference, showing the whole contemplated scheme. I do not know what is the practice in the other States, but the honourable member for Richmond said, quoting from the Queensland Hansard, that in Queensland, it was usual for the Parliament to refer the plans and books of reference to a Select Committee for report upon the proposed line. When the Frime Minister was reminded of this procedure by the Opposition, he, and the Minister of Home Affairs also, promised that, before an appropriation was made, detailed information would be laid before the House. The Minister, however, is now asking the Committee to make the first appropriation* for the construction of the railway, although he has not submitted to us either plans, specificaresults are tions, books of reference, or any information whatever. Mr KING O'MALLEY - This proposed vote is towards the construction of a railESTIMATES. way that will cost ,£4,000,000.",14
12,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Does the honourable gentleman think the item has been submitted in the proper way to the Committee ? He has our support in carrying out this railway, and we are anxious that it shall be constructed as soon as possible; but there is a proper business-like method of procedure to follow, and I submit that it has not been followed in this case. I presume that the Minister will lay on the table of the House books of reference and other information relating to this proposal. The Minister, by instinct, is a business man.",14
13,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Why does the honourable member diffeientiate between the Minister's instinct and his achievement?,14
14,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Minister is always protesting that the House should follow business-like methods, and I am sure that if he were sitting in Opposition his business like capacity and instinct would lead to his insisting upon more information being given in this case. Will he tell us whether it is proposed to enter upon the work of constructing the line during the next twelve months; and, also, whether the final survey has been made ? We should be put in the position that every State Parliament occupies before it authorizes any big undertaking. This proposed vote of £ 2 2 , 5 0 0, perhaps, not intended for the actual construction of the line, but is designed merely to provide for preparatory work. The Minister will, I hope, give us some information on the subject. Let me make it perfectly clear that the Opposition are eager to assist him in his desire to carry out this work, but we want to know what we are doing. I presume that the honourable gentleman will submit to us a detailed estimate of the cost, based upon information as to the class of rails and other material to be used. I wish now to refer to the item of £ 2 , 5 0 0 towards the construction and alteration of lighthouses, and I should like to know whether, during the next twelve months, a final decision will be arrived at regarding the lighthouses more urgently required upon the Australian coast. From two to four lighthouses need to be erected as soon as possible on ""the Queensland coast, and one or two lights are also urgently required along the Soutli Australian coast. question is likewise of great importance to Tasmania and Victoria. Mr KING O'MALLEY - And especially to Queensland.",14
15,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"All the States are interested in the matter. I understand that an officer has been appointed to furnish a report on this question of the lighting of the Australian coast. Can the Minister also state what particular lighthouses are likely to be undertaken this year ? I do not think there is any necessity to wait, because the Minister could easily determine upon several of the leading lighthouses that are necessary. He could proceed with the plans for their acquisition and construction, ancl, in the meantime, could make further inquiries as to lighthouses required in addition to those already mentioned in the report. I understand that on some part of the Queensland coast, ancl in other parts of Australia, improved beacons and minor guiding lights are required. Perhaps the Minister can explain what is being done in have that respect.",15
16,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [7.51] - To wards the close of the discussion on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Raihvay Bill I suggested that the line should be extended along the 33rd parallel, from the neighbourhood of Lake Eyre, to connect up with Broken Hill , and thence due east to Sydney. I understand that, at present,, the New South Wales Public Works Committee have before them a proposal tois connect Broken Hill with Sydney, and, if the line were taken along the 33rd parallel, as I have suggested, we should have a transcontinental line not touching' the sea, or approaching anywhere closeenough to the sea to be attackable from the sea, between Sydney and Fremantle. That would be a great advance on the present proposal from a defence point of view. The Minister undertook at the time to take the suggestion into consideration, ancl I take this opportunity of urging upon him its extreme importance from a defence point of view. If any enemy gained the command of these seas, the line proposed in the Bill could be cut at Port Augusta with the utmost ease ",15
17,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That is the line for which' this House has passed the Bill .,15
18,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am not asking the Minister to alter the Bill . He could bring, down an additional Bill . The sectionfrom Lake Eyre to Port Augusta, conThe necting the line with the South Australian system, is, I think, necessary in any case, but the direct line along the 33rd 1 parallel to Broken Hill should be constructed coincidentally with that fromBroken Hill to Sydney. I hope that, ir* the near future, we shall see a further Bill introduced for that purpose, from a defence point of view purely and simply.",15
19,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"Darwin-Min ister of Home Affairs) [7.54]--It is impossible within the next eight months to spend a large amount of money. The timewill be taken up chiefly in calling for tenders ancl receiving them, and issuing ordersfor the materials required for construction. The chief materials required for construction will be rails and sleepers, and it is not at all likely that even the first batches of these will be delivered before the beginning of the next financial year, much less that money will be required to pay for them. The Engineer-in-Chief, Mr Deane,. saysThere arc some preliminary expenses, which I pointed out in my minute of 30th ultimo; but. even if these matters can be settled and the' work put in hand, it will be impossible to spend much money over them during the present financial year, so that the amount proposed to be voted should be sufficient for all purposes.",15
20,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"But you will not go on with the work until you lay plans and specifications before Parliament? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I do not know what we will do. We may not be ready, but we want to get ready. question is, when will Parliament meet next year? The suggestion of the honourable member for Wentworth will have careful consideration; but, of course, it will have to go before Cabinet, which will have the final decision.",16
21,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra - Minister of Trade and Customs) [7.56] - Eve r since it was intended that the Commonwealth should take'control of lighthouses, beacons, and buoys, the inefficiency of some of our lights, on account of the increased speed of vessels, and for other reasons, has been brought under my notice, and, probably, uncier the notice of other Ministers who preceded me in the Department. That is why I considered it advisable to obtain expert advice on the subject; and no exception has been taken, so far as I know, to the qualifications of the gentleman appointed for that duty. It is not possible for the expert to inspect all the existing lights, except when the vessels which go out to providore them are available-that is once in every three or six months. As soon as Commander Brewis was appointed, we communicated with the States, and asked when their vessels would be going out, so that we could fit in his arrangements with them. Commander Brewis is now in Tasmanian waters. The honourable member for Darling Downs asks what lights are considered by the expert to be the most important. The only report which it has been possible for the expert to lay before the Department concerns the Bass Strait lights. Most people who use the sea consider that the south-eastern corner of Australia is the most dangerous. Captain after captain has said that he has practically passed the whole of the dangers before the Wilson's Promontory light opens out. only £2,500 has been set down on the Estimates, that is considered sufficient to make a start with the most urgent lights. Speaking from memory, I believe that the recommendation is to alter the Wilson's Promontory light from a 12-mile to a 25-mile light, to place an unattended light upon one of the islands of the Glennie Group, and another unattended light at Cape Liptrap, and to alter the light further along to the [82]-2 east, at or near Cape Howe. It is estimated that 4,000 vessels pass that corner of Australia every year.' Although it was originally estimated that to alter the Wilson's Promontory light, and to put additional lights in the places I have named, would cost about £60,000, it is now possible, by the use of unattended acetylene The lights, on what is known as the AGA system, for the same work to be done for less than £8,000. As soon as the Lighthouses Bill is passed, we shall proceed to take action in regard to this matter. The papers will be sent to the Department of Home Affairs, in order that the work may be put in hand as soon as possible.",16
22,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Has not the Minister received a report about Queensland yet?,16
23,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No j the Queensland report is being prepared. On the day when the expert arrived from New South Wales, there was an opportunity for him to go away in the tender that visits the Tasmanian lighthouses. He was only in Melbourne two or three hours, because he wished to make an inspection of the Tasmanian lighthouses immediately. As soon as I receive his report, I shall make recommendations to the Cabinet. If the amount already appropriated for the purpose is not sufficient to enable urgent and necessary work to be commenced, I shall recommend the Treasurer to brinir down Supplementary Estimates, with a view of doing all that is necessary in that regard. As to beacons, I understand that the expert will make some recommendations with regard to the Barrier Reef, but, until I receive his report, it is impossible for me to state what will be done. He has already been round the coast as far as Port Darwin for the purpose, and his report, when completed, will be comprehensive as to the coast as far round as Brisbane.",16
24,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond) [8.2] - I should like to have a definite statement from the Minister of Home Affairs with regard to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Although railway. The honourable member for Darling Downs has drawn attention to the fact that the sum of £22,500, which we are asked to vote for the purpose, is practically for the building of the line. It commits Parliament to the total expenditure for the whole line. During the progress of a previous debate, the attention of the Minister was drawn to the fact that it was customary, before money was voted for railway works such as this, to give Parliament full particulars. On page 1427 of Hansard for the present year it is reported . that when the honourable member for Darling Downs-followin g up something that I had said a little while before-aske d the Minister whether he would promise that before any appropriation was made by Parliament for this line he would lay upon the table of the House plans, sections, books of reference, and so on, the Minister of Home Affairs said, "" We will give the fullest information."" The Committee is entitled to that information before voting this money. Seeing that the survey has been completed a considerable time, I fail to see why the information has not been furnished. It surely could have been made available to honourable members. The Minister is ever priding himself upon, pressing honourable members with, his great and undoubted business capacity. I put it to him, as a business man, whether he, in the conduct of his own business, when ing what was tantamount to a deposit on - a contract which would involve him in an expenditure of £4,000,000, would not insist on knowing what the terms of the contract were? Surely his business instincts will tell him that that is merely reasonable proposition to put' before ness men?",16
25,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Is the railway to be built by day labour, or by contract?",17
26,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"That is another point as to which we are entirely in the dark. We are entitled to a full statement of the policy of the Government. What are they going to do? How do they propose to construct the line-by day labour, or by contract? Is purely Australian-manufactured material to be employed in the construction of the railway? We ought to have a quantity of information on these points. What the Minister has already said, we knew before. We knew from Mr. Deane's report that the money was simply for preliminary work. But what we did not know, and what we still want to know, is the policy of the Government. We want to have some idea of the way in which the line is going to be built. That information should be furnished before we vote this money. The same remarks apply - perhap s to a fuller extent-to money voted for purposes of the Federal Capital site. I had an opportunity, of which I availed myself recently, of visiting Yass Canberra. For my own part, I can say that I am very glad indeed that the ment with regard to that matter was negatived on Friday last.",17
27,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member must not discuss that matter now.,17
28,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I shall not discuss the amendment. I am simply expressing my pleasure that it was negatived.,17
29,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member is not in order in discussing the Capital site at all. The Committee has passed the line of the Estimates dealing with it.,17
30,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I understand that the whole subdivision is under discussion.,17
31,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The division taken, on Friday was on the question that item 2 of subdivision 3 be reduced by £66,000. That question was discussed in every phase, and imand the item was disposed of.",17
32,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, I think that if you look at the records you will find that the amendment pay- on Friday was to reduce the whole item by £66,000. I believe that, under the Standing Orders, it would now be in order for an honourable member to move for the reduction of the item by any lesser sum, though I do not think that the honourable a member for Richmond proposes to submit busiany amendment on the subject.",17
33,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I think that what the honourable member says is correct.,17
34,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Do I understand, then, that I can discuss the proposal to spend money on the Federal Capital site?",17
35,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Yes , the honourable member will be in order.",17
36,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I was very pleased with the site, which, I think, is admirably suited for the particular purpose for which it is to be used. It is certainly infinitely better than I had been led to believe that it was.  the country at its best.",17
37,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I was informed by those who have been at Yass-Canberra frequently that it was looking even better six months ago. My point now is, however, that the matter under discussion is not being dealt with by the Minister of Home Affairs in a business-like way. First of all, he comes down with no information as to the £.100,000. He made no attempt at an explanation, until it was absolutely dragged out of him, as to how much money was going to be involved in the work. Eventually we found out that by voting the amount proposed we were committing ouramend- selves to an expenditure of £313,000. Before we proceed further with this undertaking, we should have from the Minister a full and clear statement as to the policy of the Government in that regard. should be informed how the undertaking is to be financed. Indeed, the Minister should disclose the intentions of his Department, so that we may understand exactly what we are asked to commit ourselves to, because, as he admitted the other night, the £ 3 3 i ° ° ° to which we shall be committed T by voting this item of £ 6 6 , 0 0 0 will be only a very small portion of the total outlay. In the future there must be an enormous expenditure in connection with the Federal Capital; ancl, therefore, I think that the Committee are entitled to a statement from the Minister as to the policy of the Government, and how it is proposed to finance this vast undertaking. Surely he does not intend to proceed from hand to mouth, taking a drib here and a drab there, and adopting a policy of utter d r if t , until carries. he is committed to the expenditure of an enormous amount, without the faintest idea of where the money is to come from. Is that the position which he is taking up? Has he not any clear, definite idea of how the whole of this scheme is to be finally worked out; and, if he has such an idea, will he not take the Committee into his confidence? Surely that is only a business like view to take. When we remember that we have not yet acquired a single foot of land in the Territory outside the grant from the State and the acquisition of Acton Estate, and that we will have to acquire an enormous area from private owners, it should make us pause. From what I saw of its character the other day, we are not going to get the land for nothing. It is carrying a sheep and a half to the acre over the greater portion of it .",17
38,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,Where ? Mr MASSYGREENE The Federal Capital site.,18
39,Mr FENTON,Unknown,No .,18
40,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"During my visit I took considerable trouble to get into touch with persons who had been in the district for years. I found that on Duntroon, an estate of about 28,000 acres, there were about 27,000 sheep, 300 cattle, and 80 horses. The cattle have been there for a long time, too. Mr KING O'MALLEY - And they ""hog f at . """,18
41,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"As the Minister has interjected, the cattle are fat. I did not see a single poor beast, or horse, or sheep. This country will cost us a big sum.",18
42,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Do you want to put a bit on the price?,18
43,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,No . The question of We price will have to go to arbitration.,18
44,Mr FENTON,Unknown,There are not a sheep and a half to the acre there.,18
45,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"If the honourable member doubts my statement, why did he not come and see the country for himself?",18
46,Mr FENTON,Unknown,It is a barren waste.,18
47,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"If the honourable member will make a visit, he can see much better crops growing on Duntroon Estate than he can see on some of the land within 20 miles of Melbourne.",18
48,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I have been there. I saw plenty of bleached bones.,18
49,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Apar t from the fact that all these sheep and cattle and horses are on the property, I do not know how many hundreds of thousands of rabbits it When the country is properly rabbited, as it should be, it will have a still greater carrying capacity. I think that the honourable member ought to know that.",18
50,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I suppose you know that fat rabbits and starving stock have been taken off the same property sometimes ?,18
51,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"That may be, but when we find fat rabbits and fat stock on a property, we have a better proposition still. I think that the general character of this country must be perfectly evident to every honourable member. I do not say that it is all of the same character, because it is not. It comprises very good hills; some of them are remarkably good, while others are poor; but the flats are very good indeed, and, with up-to-date farming, they will produce excellent results.",18
52,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,On e would think that you were selling the estate.,18
53,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I am endeavouring to impress upon honourable members what an excellent property we have up there.,18
54,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,You r speech sounds like . an auctioneer's preliminary to a sale.,18
55,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"We have to consider what the property is worth on the market as an ordinary farming proposition. We are not going, I repeat, to get the property for nothing, but will have to pay a considerable are amount for it .",18
56,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,T h i r t y shillings an acre.,18
57,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,And the rest.,18
58,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,And you are a trustee 1,18
59,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"If I were a trustee, I would boom up the property a good deal more than I am doing.",18
60,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,But you are a trustee the people.,19
61,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"No doubt. I am enceeding deavouring to point out that we are asked to commit ourselves, not only to the extion penditure of a particular sum, but also the cost of resuming a very large area country, which, as I said, will run into considerable amount.",19
62,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,You should have voted with us the other day.,19
63,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"We must not lose sight of the fact that Australia will have to vide for an enormous expenditure. It be necessary for Parliament to finance two transcontinental railways, the Northern Territory, the Army and the Navy, and lighthouses; in fact, we have taken upon our shoulders all sorts of responsibilities.",19
64,Mr FENTON,Unknown,All the more reason we should not play with the Federal visit Capital toy.,19
65,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"We can see that in next half-year we shall have to provide an enormous expenditure. That is one the reasons why I am trying to-night to press on the Minister the necessity of ing the Committee into his confidence, especially as regards finance. The honormountains able member for Maribyrnong referred just now to what he called the Federal Capital "" toy."" It is my impression that it is posbits, sible to finance the Federal Capital scheme and make it pay for itself.",19
66,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"If it is good land, I am with the honourable member every time.",19
67,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I believe that the whole scheme, if properly handled from the outon this Capital site. set, can be made to finance itself; and should like to know how the Minister poses to tackle the question. I ask for some other shilling is spent. definite information as to the particular scheme, if the Minister has one in view, he must, seeing that he applauded my in this connection. I have a scheme in own mind; but I do not propose to weary honourable members with it to-night. It is not necessary to pledge the credit of Australia to any appreciable extent; at the same time, it is possible to inaugurate a vigorous policy and carry out the work on proper lines.",19
68,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"Barker) [8.22] We ought to have full particulars as to cost of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta way. This is a big undertaking, of I approve; and, as the Minister is a good business-like man, I know that he will not businesses. proceed unless everything is in proper order. My own opinion is, however, that for ought to be a Public Works Committee, or some body of that kind. Instead of prowith this railway as a scheme by itself, the Government ought to direct attento the construction of a railway through to the Northern Territory, which would pay of from the start. This would be much better a than developing a. territoiy belonging to other people.",19
69,Mr CANN,Unknown,To whom does the Territory belong ?,19
70,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"To Western Ausprotralia and South Australia; and it is land will over which we have no control. There ought to be some definite scheme in regard to the Northern Territory; and I dare say the that, before long, the Minister of Home Affairs will tell us what he proposes to do. As to the Federal Capital site, I know why . something of land, and when I paid a of inspection, I saw nothing like what the honourable member for Richmond has the described. He told us that the land at for Yass-Canberra will carry one and a-half of sheep to the acre. If that be so, I am imglad to hear such good news, for, persontakally, I saw neither sheep nor cattle, and was told that they had all been sent to the to wait for the grass to grow. The honourable member further told us that on the Federal Territory he saw fat rabfat sheep, and fat cattle; but, if so, that is a sight which cannot be enjoyed in any other part of Australia. Fat sheep and fat rabbits do not flourish with one another, because fat rabbits mean that there are no fat sheep. We shall live to be ashamed of ourselves for spending money As the honourable I member for Echuca said, there ought to be proa referendum on the question before anThe honourable member for Richmond said that he had a as scheme by which the Federal Capital, could words be made self-supporting; but I think it my will be a dead loss from the start, and we cannot afford any loss at the present time.",19
71,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I have dozens of and yet, applications for land.",19
72,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"The land will not carry any people. Why does the Commonwealth seek to deal with land? That the ought to be left to the States. It is quite railenough for the Commonwealth to secure which land for building purposes, without going in for grazing, farming, and other similar",19
73,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Does that objection there apply to the Northern Territory ?,19
74,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"There is a vast difference between Yass-Canberra and the Macdonnell Ranges, which, we are told, can carry 20,000,000 sheep. It has a 15-inch rainfall, and most fertile land, suitable for the growing of wheat, and so forth. We should be better employed in developing the Northern Territory than in dealing with this miserable Capital site, which never was wanted and never will be. Surely we have sufficient capital cities in Australia already, with aggregations of population? I hope and trust that this Parliament will never spend anything on a Capital site, or any other scheme that is not self-supporting. I was much surprised to hear the honourable member for Richmond suggest that the Federal Territory would finance itself, for we know that he is a good business man, and understands Australia. The honourable member has not seen very many nice dairy farms in that country.",20

I really wish the Minister would give us the benefit of what he really knows of the Yass-Canberra site. It is all very well to build a Military College there, because the site is far enough away from civilization, affords abundance of room for drilling, and plenty of rabbits for shooting practice. I hope honourable members will be very careful before they sanction any further expenditure, because all the money we have is required to develop Australia generally on proper lines.",20

I thought that, as a man of the soil, the honourable member would have been able to give a better idea of the carrying capacity of the land at Yass-Canberra than his estimate of a sheep and a half to the acre.",20
80,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Has the honourable member been there?,20
81,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Yes . When I spoke against this particular site before, I said that I had not seen it, and quoted from the statements of Ministers and others who had visited the site. I can speak now from a personal knowledge of the country, which has more than confirmed me in the opinions I previously held concerning it. The honourable member for Richmond is anxious to know exactly how every item of the vote for the Federal Capital is to be expended.",20
82,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,No ; I want to know the broad lines of the Government's financial scheme.,20
83,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I have no desire to block the Estimates, though I should have liked to block a particular vote the other day. I should have been glad to have had the assistance of the financiers, and those who know something of land values; but I found the honourable member for Richmond, and other honourable members, when they had the opportunity to prevent this expenditure, swinging in behind the Minister of Home Affairs. The honourable member for Richmond voted away £100,000 for expenditure on the Yass-Canberra site. Now he irrigation wishes to know exactly how that money is to be spent.",20
84,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"No ; we know how that £100,000 is to be spent.",20
85,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Wit h all the honourable member's shrewdness, he is following the old plan of locking the stable door after the horse has been stolen. The only lands that I saw at the Capital site which would be likely to cany a sheep and a half to the acre, were the alluvial flats on Molonglo Creek. Of the three estates which have been referred to, I should say that that on the road to the Murrumbidgee is the best. It is rather late in the day now for the honourable member for Richmond to complain about these particular items. There is another matter to which I should like to direct the attention of the Opposition. They are accustomed to hold up their hands in horror whenever anything in the shape of a Socialistic proposal is submitted for consideration. But they have assisted to carry votes for expenditure on the Capital site; and, no doubt, will assist to pass further votes for the same purpose, although the money will be spent on the most Socialistic schemes that have ever been carried out in Australia. The Federal Territory, being our own, we can do as we like with it, unrestricted by the limitations of the Constitution, and without let or hindrance from the High Couit or the State Government. No doubt when the Governcommencing ment bring forward their advanced ideas in connection with the Federal Capital, orable members opposite, including the orable members for Darling Downs, Richliminary mond, and Parramatta, will be found asbinding sisting to carry them out.",20

I am somewhat surprised, however, at one excuse that the Minister urged more than once with regard to the smallness of the proposed vote, when he asked whether it was to be expected that the Government would go on with work relating to the railway before the Bill had been passed. I did not expect the actual work of construction to be proceeded with beforehand, but the preparatory work might well have been pushed on to a much is larger extent than it appears to have been. The Minister knew perfectly well that the Bill , providing for the construction of this railway, being a Government measure, was just as certain of being passed with the majority behind him, as it is certain that himself will draw his salary next month. am very much afraid that the smallness of the proposed vote is an indication that a there is going to be a good deal ' of the "" ca' canny "" business about the construction of this railway. It is well understood these Estimates are something in the nature of a forecast of the expenditure that way will be required during the forthcoming year, and, that being so, I want to know what the Minister is going to do, or, We ought to rather, what he is going to refrain from doing, in connection with this large and important work, since he is not asking for more than £ 1 9 , 0 0 0 , by way of a new vote for the current financial year. I have not see yet heard a satisfactory explanation, in toview of the fact that the Government are pledged up to the hilt to construct the railway, and I hope that the Minister will avail himself of an early opportunityto take the Committee into his confidence and let us have proof that the Government are pushing on energetically with the work. I have now a small personal matter to bring know before the Committee. I am not given to with the "" parish pump "" aspect of politics, but I am much surprised to find that the electorate of Perth,' which be has, in many of its subdivisions, been clamoring for increased postal facilities, has not, with the exception of a revote of £ 5 6 , been allotted a single farthing for the building of oflicial post-offices. Post offices are being built all over Western Australia, and it is very singular that the electorate of Perth, which includes all the suburbs of the capital city, should have in the rebeen left out in the cold.",23

There are, particular, two suburbs in my electorateWest Leederville and North Perthwhich are urgently in need of these postal facilities. I am sorry that the Postmasterwork General is not present; if he were he would bear out my assertion that those two suburbs have been asking for post-offices for several years, and have not yet succeeded in convincing the Government that there any necessity for their construction. shall expect the Minister to give some planation, and, in the meantime, I ask him to make a note of my remarks, because I think we are entitled to know why the suburbs I have named have been allowed to remain so long without the postal faciliTerritory ties to which they are entitled.",24

129,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Moreton) [9.0] - Th Committee are entitled to more informawho tion regarding the items under considerater tion. We are getting information from the Minister little by Httle regarding some large items. He gave us an idea just now of what he proposed to do by interjecting with regard to the Federal Territory that "" She is a bonzer when she is irrigated."" I take it from that remark that part of We about £ 3 8 , 0 0 0 on the Territory last year, and I suppose that amount has been increased by this time to about £ 5 0 , 0 0 0. It is too early yet to judge of the results, as a good deal of the money may have been the sunk in preliminary works that do not show in themselves; but I must confess that there is very little result showing there at present. The Military College is certainly a credit to those who are responsible for the done there. The item of £ 5 3 , 0 0 0 for Naval Barracks, & c , is described as "" towards cost."" Will the Minister give the Committee some information as to what the total cost will be? We are committing is ourselves to a work which may run us into 1 many hundreds of thousands of pounds, and exare going to work in a very expensive way. The Minister is making a serious mistake in purchasing land, which will cost the Department more than it would cost to put up the whole Naval College on Federal at or near Jervis Bay. I notice, also, that there is some doubt in the mind us of the Department as to where the railconway to link up the Federal Capital with naval Yass is to be run. Perhaps the Minister can give us some idea on that point. When (DarwinI was there the other day, I was told that it was to be run in a way which, to my mind, would so split up the site as to completely spoil it. It is unwise to run a railof way through the heart of the magnificent which, we are assured by the Minister, peris going to be established there. There is another matter which needs the Minister's immediate attention. I understand that the the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has urgent representations to the Minister and the Postmaster-General' that arrangefor ments should be made to enable the men working there to bank their money. There is a large number of men employed, and as there is no Savings Bank on the spot are obliged to lose half a day to go to Queanbeyan to put their money into safety. Where a number of men are living 0 0 alin tents, it is not safe for them to have money lying about, or to carry it about with e them. I am given to understand by those are not directly interested in the matthat many of the men go into the town to put their money away safely, while some very hang about the town and spend money which otherwise they would not spend. This difficulty could be easily overcome if the Department would allow their man to go out there once a fortnight, collect the men's savings, and take them into Queanbeyan. A postal official from Queanbeyan visits the Territory once a fortnight now, and the men can purchase postal notes, but they cannot bank their money. It is altogether unfair that the men should be asked to pay 5s., and lose half a day, to go into Queanbeyan, or else run the risk of losing their savings. One of the workmen told me he was carrying £ 2 0 on him, and did not know what to do with it , as he was living in a tent.",24
130,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"That is remarkable, when we have such a strong financial expert as the Minister.",25
131,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Seeing that the Minister has given out to the world that he could run the earth if he were given a chance, I was rather disappointed that he was not running this little bit of the earth more on business lines than he is doing at present. I hope that by next pay-day the men will have some facilities for safely depositing their money. Many of the works done, or partly done, in the Territory are certainly creditable to the Minister or to the Department. The roads that have been laid down are well done. where credit is due it should be given, and although very much does not appear to have been done with the £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 that has been spent, wherever permanent works have been put down they have been well done, and I congratulate the Minister on that, at any rate. I hope the Minister will shortly give us an estimate of what the total cost of the Naval and Military Colleges will be. If we vote £ 5 3 , 0 0 0 now, how much shall we have to vote in order to complete the Naval Barracks and other items specified?",25

176,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The only condition under which the Minister of Home Affairs would have been entitled or persuaded, if I may say so, to make a statement, would at the instance of the Post and Telegraph Department, to the effect that facilities would be provided for the general public. In my capacity as Postmaster-General may say that, where there is any desire on the part of the public to realise the responbrought sibilities of dark days, and to put a few Minister himself. shillings in the Savings Bank, that desire will be met and encouraged by the Government. If there is any indication of any possibility of business in the Federal Capital Territory to justif y the a branch of the Savings Bank, a brancli will be established.",29

As to the Naval College, I may, in the absence of the honourable member for Adelaide, and as the Minister who represented the Minister of Defence for a number of months, inform honourable members as to the position. There was a most extraordinary agitation in Australia some little time ago, caused, I believe, by a belief on the part of some people that the British Empire was in peril, and a Dreadnought fund was established. A number of us did not believe that the Empire was in such desperate straits as depicted; but a number of patriotic citizens subscribed, I believe, about £ 4 3 , 0 0 0 to form the nucleus of what was ultimately intended to be a fund of £ 1 , 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 wherewith to present a Dreadnought to the Mother Country.",29

191,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If the honourable memdesires to take the floor, I shall be glad to give way to him. I speak of a position that was reached as the result, if honourable members please, of a political agitation. £43,000 was realized, and the question arose as to whether that money was to be returned to the subscribers or devoted tn some other way to the defence of the country. When that proposition was submitted the establishment of a naval college for Australia was admitted to be a necessity, and those responsible for the fund which had been collected handed over the money subscribed for that purpose. It was accepted by the Minister of Defence, and the site for the College was selected in the vicinity of Sydney.",29

214,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"But this is the time to ask this question, when we are dealing with the vote for the Naval College.",30
215,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The responsible Minister should be able to give us the information for which we ask.,30
216,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I think the honourable member has been allowed sufficient latitude in the interruption of my speech, and, though I am not Minister of Defence, I say that this particular site was selected on the recommendation of a Committee, the members of which visited all the localities under the consideration of the Naval authorities at that time.",30
217,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"And they ""recommended, first of all, that the College be established in Commonwealth to Territory at Jervis Bay.",30

The question arises : Are we going take advantage of the offer of £43,000 be made available in the establishment a college for the training' of persons who will subsequently be drafted into our for the defence of the country? Whether the College is established at Middle Head, in Sydney Harbor, or at some other site, the necessity for it is immediate. Its tablishment is not dependent upon a view which might subsequently be held as to suitability of Jervis Bay or any other for the purpose. It must be undertaken this particular time. The Government, ral Territory. under the advice of, I may bepardoned for saying, the most distinguished Minister of Defence who has occupied that position in the Commonwealth, propose to establish the College, at the. site which has been chosen. : Mr GROOM - Why make comparisons?

This is an urgent ter recommended by the distinguished Naval officer who was brought, from the Country to advise the Commonwealth Gomation vernment in the matter of naval defence, and are we to refuse the generous offer the subscribers to the Dreadnought fund because the proposed Naval College is not to be established in Federal Territory?

We have not yet been able to initiate a concrete esscheme for the establishment of all our factories in Commonwealth Territory. The the view advanced byhonorable members opplace posite apparently is that we should not at establish a naval college outside of Fede",31
228,Mr GROOM,Unknown,No attack has been made. All that was asked was an explanation of the Government policy in the matter.,31

They were asked that certain facilities should be afforded to the men working in the Federal Territory, and I expected to be told that the matter would be immediately rectified, but instead of that ment we got a general account of the difficulties which the Department of Home Affairs has to face, the question of banking generally was dealt with, and the main issue was ignored. This Labour Government, which I have supported through thick and thin from the beginning, wobbles along behind its predecessors. At the camps where men are employed under the State Government, facilities are given for the payment of wages into savings banks. On the railway works, in the Buffalo, the paymaster makes provision for that. What was there to prevent the Minister of Home Affairs from telling us that the same thing would be done in the Federal Territory?",32
240,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I have said that it will be done. The Minister of Home Affairs could not make a statement on behalf of my Department.,32

I thought that the Naval College was to be. at Jervis Bay, and in communication with the Military College; although there is - no statement to that effect on the Estimates, I assumed that that was intended. The Postmaster-General has told us that certain persons subscribed £40,000 towards the construction of a Dreadnought, and the honourable member for Eden Monaro asked if they made it a condition to handing the money over' to the Government that it was to be spent on a naval college to be established at Port Hacking. The Minister did not say that there was such a condition. If there was not such a condition, there was no reason for referring to the fund at all. ' If there was such a condition, it is outrageous that, to become the recipient of a miserable £40,000, the Government should set aside the policy recommended by its naval, and military advisers. .",32

Possessing the knowledge that I do of the conditions of the Defence Department, I think he ought to accept my statement that this is a genuine attempt on the part of the Minister of Defence, acting on the advice of his most responsible expert advisers, to establish a college in a direction that will be best calculated to secure the effective defence of Australia.  ask what the ground is going to cost?",34
278,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,It cannot cost more than the amount included in the principal item.,34
279,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"But the £43,000 subscribed by the citizens will be over and above the £53>ooo to be expended by the Government.",34
280,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"My honourable friends apparently assume that the total sum of £53,000 is going to be expended on the Naval College, but they will see, on looking at the item that it is towards the cost of Naval Barracks",34
281,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Has the Minister the tails of each subdivision of the item?,34
282,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I have not.  Home Affairs has the details?,34
283,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"No ; he has not, and would be most injudicious to say definitely what was going to be done in regard these propositions if he had them. There are a Naval Barracks, Submarine Depot, Naval Gunnery and Torpedo School, Naval Training School, Naval Boys' Training School, and Naval Midshipmen's College. The whole of those necessities are heaped under the vote of £53,000. I am very sorry, but I have tried to get hold of the Minister of Defence in order to obtain the particulars of each of those items. I think honourable members might reasonably assume that this is a vote which is intended to carry out the defence scheme of naval instruction for boys to fit them to go into the Australian Navy. I think honourable members might also assume that the Government have taken all reasonable precautions to see that the site most suitable and most advantageous has been picked in order to secure the best results. I would ask the honourable member, on the strength of the statement that has been made to him, to allow this item to pass without forcing it to a vote.",34
284,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs) [10.11]. - I think the Minister has quite misconceived the tone of the discussion. He was out of the chamber when the questions were, asked.",34
285,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I explained that.,34
286,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Whil e the Minister explained it, he made several attacks by insinuations. In the first place, he attacked us for having a "" Dreadnought policy,"" but we have the satisfaction of knowing that, not only was the Dreadnought accepted, but the whole of the Naval Unit, including a Dreadnought, was accepted. I do not want to say anything more.  You know that is not right.",34
287,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"My statement is correct, but I do not wish to raise that issue now. The Minister raised all these issues, which we do not want to discuss. All we said was that this item was a large one, and that a whole series of matters was grouped together in it. We simply asked the Minister two questions-What was the extent of the commitment, and what were dethe items upon which we were voting? We made no charge of incompetence against any Minister or other person. In fact, anything we said would not be in the way of an attack upon the Minister of Defence. it We simply wanted information to which we were entitled. The question asked by to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the honourable member for Bourke, as to whether the sum of £43,000 influenced the Government in any way in fixing upon the site",34
288,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I say "" No"" phatically.",35
289,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I accept the Minister's assurance without the slightest hesitation. At the same time, the question was very natural, because the honourable member Eden-Monaro, who is a very close of the parliamentary papers, probably remembered that, on the 18th November, 1909, the House ordered a letter to be printed. I presume the question was based upon that letter, which was written by Allen Taylor, Lord Mayor of the Government, offering a sum of between £ 3 5 , 0 0 0 and £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 to be used by' your Government 01 this Committee",35
290,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That was the vernment.,35
291,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am quite aware of those conditions. thatfor the erection of a Naval College for education and training of the officers for proposed Australian Naval Squadron. . . . ditions may have taken place. On receipt of your acceptance of this offer, the money is available, the only conditions attached to the g if t being",35
292,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Then there are conditions, notwithstanding the Minister's, assurance ?",35
293,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That was the Fusion vernment.,35
294,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"There is no necessity warmth in this matter. Is it wise to raise party issues upon Works Estimates in question with any desire to embarrass the which we are all interested? The Minister said no conditions were accepted, cept his assurance.",35
295,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That was not for the Naval College, was it? '. Mr GROOM - Yes . The conditions mentioned in the letter were1. That the college be established in or within the precincts of the city of Sydney. . 2. That the erection be commenced within reasonable time, to be indicated by you in acceptance.",35
296,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Ye t when I nothing but reasonable questions, and J raised the question, the Minister insulted me!",35
297,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I do not care site is so long as the expert recommends it as being the best. I would say, "" Put the Naval College on a site in the electorate of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, if that is the best site."" The policy of this House in this matter should be ta put aside all external considerations, and be guided solely by the question of which is* emthe best site for the efficiency of the Navy. Unfortunately, the papers regarding the recommendations as to the site have not been laid upon the table of the House. They, may be confidential documents, and, if they are, and the Minister says that the expertsfor have recommended the site, I would not. student raise another word against it.",35
298,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"In all probability, the papers were put on the table of the Library six months ago. If they were not, I give* Mr the honourable member my assurance that Sydney, to they can be so placed.",35
299,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I accept the Minister's assurance that this site has been recommended.,35
300,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,B y Captain Chambers.,35
301,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"B y the expert, as best, previous Gosuited for the puipose.",35
302,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,In order to comply with,35
303,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Minister says not. the Honourable members must not be too rash... the Subsequent negotiations removing those con-, When citizens are patriotic enough to offer the Government large sums of money for publicpurposes, the Government ought to accept' the offer readily and willingly. But no; conditions which would be contrary to the. advice of the experts ought to be imposed.. GoThe honourable member for Bourke raised the subject in a very quiet, dispassionate,, for and well-reasoned speech. He made a fair, request, and I am sure he did not put his' v Minister, nor should the Minister think thatj and I acwe desire to embarrass him.",35
304,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I do not think for a moment that my honourable friend is trying,; to embarrass us. j",35
305,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am sure the Minister will accept our assurance that we are not trying to do so, but in the heat of the Cupmoment, so to speak, he made statementsa which certainly were not fair to this side, your of the House. We have been assisting him in every way this evening, and have asked^ t think that, on the whole,. Ministers have' attempted to supply us with the informawhere the tion they possess.",35
306,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [10.19].' - - I still think we ought to know how much' the Commonwealth is going to pay for the> site before we pass the item. The questionI asked was fair, and it is no answer for) a. Minister to say that, because an Acting Minister is absent, he is not able to the information. When these items brought down, the necessary information s'hould be in the hands of the Minister in charge. Is this vote in addition ^£43,000 which is to be handed over to the Commonwealth ? 1. Mr Frazer - Yes , to carry out all worlcs that are enumerated in item 5 subdivision 7-Nava l Barracks, Submarine Depot, Naval Gunnery, and Torpedo School, Naval Training School, Naval Boys' Training School, and Naval Midpurposes. shipmen's College.",35
307,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The Minister left out the only words which have any portance in this discussion- "" towards cost."" Every shilling that we vote can be expended on purchasing land, where it exceedingly dear. It is not fai r Committee to propose to establish this Colit lege and. these buildings on land which'.has to be bought on certain conditions, when are not told how much money is to be spent on the land alone.",36
308,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,My honourable friend is absolutely wrong-this is the total cost.,36
309,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"That statement in accord with other assertions of the Minister, who says things about these votes of which he knows nothing - Mr. Mr Frazer.:- I see now' that the money to be voted is "" towards cost."" - Mr MCWILLIAMS - The should read his own Estimates. Here we large bave a Minister who is taking charge' of Estimates which he has not even read. The 'honourable gentleman ventured to say that I was entirely wrong in stating that this vote is ""towards cost,"" when, if he had read the Estimates,.he would have seen that those very words appear.",36
310,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The Minister said so immediately afterwards.,36
311,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The Minister should at least read the Estimates of which-, he is in charge.",36
312,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That is the only point which the honourable member has been' able to make, and he is quite welcome to it.",36
313,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Thes e are not the Postvicinity of Sydney. master-General's Estimates.,36
314,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I know that they, . Mr. are not his Estimates; but he is in charge of them. No information is given to us, however, and the Minister whose Departcussion, ment they concern is absent. We ought know definitely why the site of the is, not to be .within Federal Territory,',and.. whether the Dreadnought money is being give handed over to the Commonwealth Governare ment, under the condition that the College should, be in the vicinity of Sydney.'.':",36
315,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,There . is.' no condition. to ' the That is the information that I have.,36
316,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The Minister said a little while ago, "" to the best bf my the belief."" I agree with the honourable memof ber for Bourke that these buildings, which will be of a permanent character, should be within Federal Territory. We. have taken, over an enormous area of land for Federal Is it reasonable that we should, spend money on establishing a Federal in-', has stitution elsewhere ? We can have the land imat Jervis Bay for nothing. Why spend' money on purchasing land elsewhere? It . is one of the most unbusiness-like proposals is ever put before an Australian Parliament. to this Those who know Jervis Bay are aware that is one of the best .harbors in Australia. [ Moreover, in the interests of the cadets: we themselves, it would be better that theyshould not be trained in the immediate vicinity of a large city. Every argument, used in favour of establishing the Military College at Duntroon can be used with still is more force in regard to the Naval College..'",36
317,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Why ? MCWILLIAMS - Because if it be in the best interests of the military cadets and of the country that they should be Minister trained at a college distant from one of the cities, it will be equally advantageous ; that the naval cadets should be trained at j a college that is not in the vicinity of Syd^ ney. I believe that the first expert opinion furnished to the Government was ^avoidable to the establishment of the Naval C61 "" : lege at Jervis Bay: . But for some reason or other that proposal was turned down -. If we pass this vote, we shall commit the Commonwealth for all time to the establishment of the Naval College in.the vicinity of Syd-. ney. We shall make a mistake by sq doing.' Ministers would be wise to reconsider, their decision, and to determine to establish the College in Federal Territory, and in a situation where the students may be removed from such temptations as exist in the MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports)' [10.28] - The Committee require a great deal of information on the point under disand I think it would be well for : .to progress to be reported now.
