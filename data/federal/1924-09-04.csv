Will a limit be placed upon the associated banks in the inflation or extension of credits based upon the further accommodation provided in this temporary issue of notes?",13
18,Dr EARLE PAGE,METAL MANUFACTURING,"The answer the honourable member's questions are as follow: 1. There is not to be a temporary inflation of the note issue, but a seasonal expansion, low:the Notes Issue Board having decided temporarily to increase the issue of notes in accordance with the following plan :Advances of notes' up to £5,000,000 the aggregate will be made available the banks as required, and will bear terest at a rate not exceeding 2 per cent, palities. above the highest rate allowed by the banks on fixed deposits, repayment to be as to £3,000,000 not later than 30th June, 1925, and as to £2,000,000 not later 31st July, 1925. Any bank sistance under this arrangement will be required to lodge cash or approved securities in London against the advances made here, the bank to receive the interest actually collected in respect of such cash and securities while held by the Notes Issue Board. 2. It would seem that there will not inflation, but that extension of credits, upon the further accommodation, wil l be necessary in order to meet seasonal demands. These credits, of course, will be of a temporary nature. BANANA INDUSTRY. Mr J. FRANCIS asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I.

Mr Bruce;-Tb e answers to the honourable member's questions are as fol1. Yes. 2. Representations have been made on various occasions since 1921 by public bodies in New in South Wales, and more recently by the Lord to Mayor of Sydney, as a result of a meeting of incitizens of Sydney and surrounding munici3.

OLD-AGE ANDINVALI D PENSIONS.",14
20,Dr EARLE PAGE,PASTORAL FINANCE,"On the 2nd September the honourable member for Maribe any byrnong (Mr Fenton) said he underbased stood that, while applicants for old-age and invalid pensions in the cities are required to state their claims for a pension to a magistrate sitting in camera, applicants in country districts are sometimes required to give in the open police court a detailed account of their private circumstances. He asked rae if I would issue instructions that applicants are not to be distressed by a public inquisition, and that in future all applications be heard in camera. I have inquired into the matter, and find that the position is as follows:- . The Invali d and Old-age Pensions Act provides that every claim for a pension shall be heard by a magistrate, and that the hearing shall be made in open court if for any reason the magistrate deems it advisable. In the capital cities and in some of the larger country centres, the hearing is - conducted by special magistrates who are officers of the Pensions Department. In these cases the investigations liaVe always been conducted in camera. In the remaining country districts the claims are investigated by police magistrates who are state officers. The hearing takes place at the District Court House, and it is a matter for the magistrate's own discretion as to| whether the case is heard in open court or in camera. In all the years of pension experience there has never been any complaint to the department that a pension claimant has been subjected to harsh treatment of the nature indicated. In view of the statutory provision referred to and the absence of complaints, it would not seem advisable to interfere with the discretionary power which is vested in the magistrates.

32,Mr MAHONY,WAYS AND MEANS,"Dalley) [ 2 . 5 8 ] - I rise most reluctantly to a question of privilege. The Prime Minister, by moving "" That the question be now put,"" has deprived me of my privileges as a member of this House. I appeal to honourable members to see that not only my privileges but theirs also are preserved. While a member is moving a specific motion the Government should' not use its majority to rally the serried ranks of Stodge, and compel us to remain silent so that its faults shall not be debated.",16
33,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"On a point order, I ask whether the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) has the permission of the House to make a statement.",16
34,Mr SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - The honourable member has received no such indulgence, and I was about to call his attention to the fact when the honorAYES. able member for Lang rose. He is not speaking on a question of privilege at all. The Prime Minister, in moving "" That the question be now put , "" only operated a standing order which has received the sanction of this House. The first part of Standing Order 262A reads as follows: After any question has been proposed, either in the House or in any Committee of the NOES. Whole, a motion may be made by any member, rising in his place, and without notice, and whether any other member is addressing the Chair or not, "" That the question be now put,"" and the motion shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. I am obliged, not only to interpret, but also to enforce the Standing Orders. When an honourable member, as the Standing Orders give him a right to do, has moved "" That the question be now put,"" that motion must be put forthwith, without amendment or debate. That procedure does not give rise to a question of p r i v i PAIRS. lege, and the honourable member for Dalley is not entitled to make a speech on the subject now.",16
35,Mr MAHONY,WAYS AND MEANS,"I accept your ruling, Mr Speaker, and I have no desire to cavil at it in any way. But I desired to make a protest because, Sir John Monash having been called upon to make a report, the Government, is deliberately withholding that report from honourable members.",16
36,Mr SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS,"Order! The honourable member is not entitled to speak at all at this stage, unless he addresses himself to a question of order. I ask the honourable member if he proposes to do so?",16
37,Mr BLAKELEY,WAYS AND MEANS,Is it in order for the Government to keep back Sir John Monash's report?,16
38,Mr SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS,"I am not concerned with the conduct of any party in the House; my sole concern is to interpret and enforce the Standing Orders that have been sanctioned by this House. of Mr MAHONY - Hav e I not the right,, in common with all other honourable members, to demand that this informatio n shall be made available to the House?",16
39,Mr SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS,Order !,16
40,Mr MAHONY,WAYS AND MEANS,"I protest against the secrecy of the Government, and the smother-up tactics that it is adopting.",16
41,Mr SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS,"Order ! The honourable member is not now exercising a right he possesses, but is abusing the rights of Parliament;",17
42,Mr MAHONY,WAYS AND MEANS,So is the Government.,17
43,Mr SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS,"I will not hear the honourable member further. TARIF F BOARD BILL . SECOND READING. . Debate resumed from 3rd September {vide page 3929), on motion by Mr. PRATTEN - That the bill be now read a second time.",17
44,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,Corio) [3.2] - Thos e who had the privilege of listening to the debate on this bill yesterday must have contrasted that debate with those memorable debates on the tariff that took place in this House in 1906.,17
45,Mr BLAKELEY,WAYS AND MEANS,Has the honourable member recently read the debates of 1906*,17
46,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"Since I have been a member of this Houses I . have endeavoured, as far as possible, to acquaint myself with the events that have occurred in the Commonwealth Parliament. The discussion yesterday fied me that the greatest need of Australia today is the cultivation of an Australian sentiment, and convinced me that honourable members have not a proper conception of the views of those whom they represent, in regard to the encouragement of Australian industries.",17
47,Mr JACKSON,WAYS AND MEANS,Does the honourable member think that an imported sentiment would do as well?,17
48,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"I do not think it would. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) yesterday delivered a very carefully prepared speech. He being a pronounced free trader, and I a protectionist, it is natural that I should disagree with many of his contentions. I believe that he has missed the Australian sentiment. In his opening remarks, the honourable member said that the Minister  opinion, introduced this bill coincidentally with the opening session of the Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva, and he believed that if would lead to a renewal of international hostility.",17
49,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,I did not say that.,17
50,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"I wrote down the words as the honourable - member said them. My belief is that the addition of two words was necessary to properly complete the honourable member's sentence; he should have said that the introduction of this bill would lead to a renewal of the International Harvester Company's hostility, and he would have been a little nearer the mark. I admit at once that the act has not operated, as satisfactorily as we might desire. I do not know of any measure that has been passed by this or any other Parliament that has pleased everybody. It is not humanly possible to interpret an act of this nature in a way that would give satisfaction to the whole of the people. One of the objections raised by the honourable member to the continuance of the Tariff Board was its leaning towards the manufacturing interests of Australia. He went on to say that, as a result of the protection which the manufacturers are given, (they are ftble to charge excessive prices for their products. His contention was that the tariff is responsible for the present high prices of materials. The facts prove the reverse to be the case. I have here a sheaf of satis- information, a portion of which I may be permitted to quote, relating to the prices of agricultural machinery that is being sold to the farmers of Australia. On page 10 of this year's report of the Tariff Board, we find the following sentences dealing' with agricultural implements:During the year 1922-23, agricultural implements to the value of £748,159 were imported. Of this amount, £304,571 were for implements of a class or kind not manufactured in Australia, and were admitted free of duty under the British preferential tariff, or 10 per cent, under the general taritt. The balance of the amount, viz., £443,588, covered implements of a class or kind manufactured in Australia, and mostly paid duty at 20 per cent, or 22J per cent. British preference, or 30 per cent, or 35 per cent, general tariff. Seed and fertilizer drills formed the largest individual line imported, and accounted for £110,941. The locally-made drills are sold to farmers at prices considerably lower than that charged tor imported drills, and the demand for the Australian drill is gradually increasing. When the final figures for the year 1923-24 are available, they will show a material decrease in the number of imported drills as compared with the previousyear. Harvesters, and metal parts of harvesters, £62,056; cultivators and harrows, £33,044; and ploughs, £34,719, for m the bulk of the balance of dutiableimplements imported. - Statements have often been mad© by honourable members to the effect that the Australian made.article is dearer than the im ported one. I shall quote the latest figures to disprove that statement.",17
51,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"Who made that statement ? ' Mr LISTER - It has been made frequently during this session by members of the Country party. shall quote can be verified. When asking for this information I emphasized that it must be thoroughly reliable, and I have 'no doubt, after perusing some of the price lists from which the figures are taken, that it is accura'te. The following table show3 the prices of Massey-Harris implements in New Zealand, where no duties are imposed upon them, and Australian implements in Australia: Masse y-H n rris Prices MCKay's Prices in In New Zealand. £ 8. ii.

52,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,Why does the honourable member not state that the bases of the quotations differ?,18
53,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,The bases do not differ.,18
54,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,Why does not the able member include the cost of carriage gradually in both instances ? *,18
55,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"All the figures I have quoted represent cash .prices to the farmer. I am satisfied that the average farmer in this country does not know the facts, for if he did he would not continue to buy imported implements when locally manufactured implements, which are equally, if not more, efficient, are obtainable at a lower price. The statistics I i Mr MANN - What have those prices to do with the Tariff Board ?",18
56,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"A good deal, because the honourable member said yesterday that certain manufacturers of agricultural machinery are making excessive profits.' My answer is that if excessive profits are being made by Australian manufacturers they are small compared with the profits that are made by the importers. Moreover, the money that is paid for i m Difference ported articles is lost to Australia, in f a v o r . whereas money spent in buying a locallyof the Australia.

A few days ago, reference was made to the reaper and That machine and the mower hoe, and rake are the only imported implethe ments that are cheaper inNew Zealand the Australian-made articles. The explanation is that old-established firms the like the Massey-Harris Company, and the International Harvester Company, are able, as a result of mass production, to sell those products at slightly lower prices than are charged for the Australian-made machines.",18
58,Mr SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS,"Rt. Hon. W . A. W at t ) . honor- - I "" think the honourable member is d r if t in g into a discussion of the whole tariff.",18
59,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"During the debate yesterday direct reference was made by one honourable member to a manufacturing establishment-the largest of its kind in the southern hemisphere-that is located in*my electorate. I had interjected that many Australian manufacturers of agricultural implements were struggling, and the honourable member for Perth interjected, "" Sunshine.""",19
60,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,Did I? The member might quote me correctly.,19
61,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"I have quoted the honourable member correctly. No harm would be done if a little sunshine were let into the dark recesses of the honourable member's mind, which appears to be clogged up with the theories of Cobdenism. Honourable members cannot shut their eyes to the fact that the smaller manufacturing concerns require protection.",19
62,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,"What about the company that, with a capital of £40,000, made £40,000 in profits ?",19
63,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"Some firms may be making fair l y big profits, but why does a man employ labour? Is it merely to provide somebody with a job? object is to make profits.",19
64,Mr SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS,"Order! I feel obliged to direct the attention of honourable members generally tp the fact that the measure before the House is not a tariff bill. It is a bill to make four amendments in the T a r i ff Board Act, and, strictly speaking, honourable members should confine their remarks to those four proposals. They cannot be allowed to discuss, under cover of this Bill , all the rates or effects of the tariff.",19
65,Mr FENTON,WAYS AND MEANS,"I rise to a point of order. Last night when the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham) was called to order for references which I thought were quite relevant, I made a disorderly remark, and said that in the afternoon some honerable members had been allowed to wander from Dan to Beersheba. I desire now, sir, to direct your attention to the fact that by clause 2 the board is to be empowered to inquire into "" any revision of the t a r if f ."" This bill seeks, amongst other things, to amend section 15 of the principal act, which includes amongst the matters which the board may investigate(i ) Any complaint that a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded by the tariff, and in particular in regard to his charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods; or (i i) acting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public; or (i i i ) acting in a manner which results in unnecessarily high prices being charged to consumers for his goods. honourable The proposal to amend that section opens up a fairly wide discussion of tariff issues, and, in my judgment, allows of comparisons being made between prices charged in free trade countries and those charged in protectionist Australia. Having regard to that fact, is it not possible, Sir,, for you to allow a little more latitude in the debate?",19
66,Mr SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS,"I am particularly anxious, as I think' I should always be, not to restrict unduly the rights of honourable members, but the Standing Orders are imperative and parliamentary practice leaves me no option. Debate must be confined to the motion before the Chair. At the present moment the motion before the Chair embraces a small bill, which No ; his seeks to make four amendments in the Tariff Board Act of 1921. In the strictest parliamentary sense, the four amendments are the only issues before the House. I realise that when they are being discussed related matters inevitably come into the minds of honourable members. For in stance, it is impossible to discuss the work of the Tariff Board without considering the possibility of adopting something more effective. But although such questions are related to the question before the House, they are still separate from it . It is, therefore, my duty, subject to such leniency as I can extend, to prevent honourable members from wandering over the whole tariff field, and to confine their remarks to the principal act and the amendments proposed by the bill.",19
67,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"I quite appreciate your position, Mr Speaker, and as I shall have another opportunity when the Estimates are before us to discuss this matter, I can accomplish no good by endeavouring to submit the further facts and figures with which I am armed. The honourable member for Swan when speaking yesterday insisted that the board had exceeded its duties, and he took particular exception to its action in waiving certain duties for one day.",19
68,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,For the benefit of some people.,20
69,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"And re-irnposing them subsequently. Such action was justified. The Minister for Trade and Customs  ted persons to import certain goods that could not be manufactured here. Subsequently their manufacture was commenced in Australia, and a duty imposed, and the Minister, in order to keep faith with the importers whoi approached him in the first place, waived the incidence of the tariff on the day that those goods arrived in this country.",20
70,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,I quoted hundreds of such cases.,20
71,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"There have been many of these requests, and, in agreeing to them, the Minister has acted rightly. In this way many Australian industries have been protected. The honourable member - for Swan (Mr Gregory) said that, under the provisions of the Tariff Board Act, no assistance was given to primary production. But since that measure has been in existence Parliament has been doing very little but passing legislation providing for bounties and other assistance to primary industries. I take strong exception to the statement of the honourable member.",20
72,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"Unde r the tariff, £100 is taken from the producer, and in return he gets £10 by way of a bounty.",20
73,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,The honourable member knows perfectly well that many primary industries have been materially assisted by this Parliament.,20
74,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,I should prefer to be without such assistance myself.,20
75,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"The honourable member is speaking for himself. He knows that were it not for the sop, as he has called given by the Government, the bulk of our primary producers would find it almost impossible to make a living. If Austra lian industries are to progress, we must insist on greater efficiency, and this can bs obtained by promoting keen competition among our own manufacturing interests. I shall support the bill. The experience of the last few years has proved conclusively that the Tariff Board is very necessary to this country. The ramifications of the Trade and Customs Department have become so extensive that it is impossible for the Minister or his officers to make the inquiries necessary to enable them to deal justly with persons seeking either the remission or an increase of tariff duties. The bill should be passed at the earliest possible moment to ensure that the board's operations shall not be detrimentally affected. I agree with the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) that evidence before ""the board should be heard in public. I do not think that the manufacturers of this country have anything to hide respecting their claims before the board, and they certainly will not object to their evidence being heard in public. But there must, of necessity, be a limitation to open hearings of evidence.. We cannot expect these people to place, the whole of their books and their private affairs at the disposal of the public or their competitors.",20
76,Mr FOSTER,WAYS AND MEANS,They are not asked to do that.,20
77,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"This .country has derived great benefit from the operations of the Tariff Board. The manufacturing interests,, and also the primary interests, have been greatly assisted. The board does not, as has been said, act partially. Different interests are represented on it , and nothing but good can emanate from its deliberations. Its members are imbued with the desire to make recommendations to the Minister which they believe to be in the best interests of Australia generally.",20
78,Mr THOMPSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"New England) [3.45] - I wish to dispel any belief, either in this chamber or outside of it , that the members of the Country party have a desire to injure the secondary industries of Australia. The majority of the members of that party are sound protectionists, and their aim is to establish a protectionist policy for the secondary industries and at the same time to it, secure some measure of protection for the primary industries which are the backbone of the industrial life of the community. That being so, they can fairly claim to be fulfilling their duties and functions as members of this Parliament. I do not think any honourable member of this House would refuse the primary producers the protection that is due to them. The only difference of opinion, as far as I can gather, concerns the method by which this can be achieved. The interests of the primary producers can best be protected through the agency .of the Tariff Board. I regard that board .as an essential part of the protective .policy of Australia. Before it was appointed I always believed that the method of applying that policy was crude and liable to error. It is impossible for members of Parliament to give .an expert opinion respecting the obligations of our various manufacturing industries. Yet we have seen members of this Parliament, without any real knowledge cf 'life industries with which they were dealing, raise duties in a sensational maimer, thereby inflicting further hardships upon a section of the community an'l giving a very substantial benefit to undeserving manufacturing The old .method of fixing duties was neither sound nor scientific. orable member, be he free trader or protectionist, will argue that a member of this Chamber., no matter what knowledge he may 'have of a particular industry, is competent to decide what alteration of the tariff should be made involving, perhaps, millions of pounds to that in dustry. In almost every industry and organization in the - world there is some method of inquiry or investigation 'by experts. The previous Government, in appointing the Tariff Board, conferred a great 'benefit upon ""this country, and it 'Should 'be permanently - established as part of the protectionist policy of Australia. The Tariff Board has been so successful that I do not think it will ever be abolished. Protection is now the established policy of Australia^ ;and is not a - political issue in these da.ys. The majorit y of 'honourable members of >this chamber are convinced >that it is the only practicable policy for a country like ours. N.o party could hope for success in an election campaign if it opposed protection, or even suggested a serious .general reduction in our duties. Our object should be to so adjust the 'tariff that it will inflict as little hardship as possible upon the consumers, and the only 'rational means - for doing that is the T a r i ff Board. have had some experience of the board, and I believe that, although it has been most effective, it can be made .a still better investigating authority. Honourable - members know that, 'before the appointment of the board, a great deal of lobbying was done in this House manufacturers and others who desired preferment for their own industries. Mr E . RILEY - That will still be done. [158]",20
79,Mr THOMPSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"The Tariff Board is not so susceptible to outside influences as honourable members of this Parliament, and is much, more likely to give a sound and reasoned judgment on the various matters that are put before it . We can rely upon its judgment. Mr E . RILEY - I shall rely on my own judgment.",21
80,Mr THOMPSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"The honourable member - usually does, but it can hardly be denied that the board is much better fitted than Parliampnt to pronounce s sound judgment on the measure of protection that our various industries need. It has now - made - a close inquiry into interests. practically all of our manufacturing and primary industries,, and no serious fault No 'hon- has been-found with it . It has been contended in this debate that the board has .usurped the .powers of Parliament, but It H n k that too much power has been placed in the hands of the Minister. The board would work much more satisfactorily if it .were given similar authority - to that exercised by the Public Service Arbitrator. His awards must be tabled in Parliament to give honourable members an opportunity to lodge an objection to them if they so desire. All the reports of the Tariff Board should be similarly tabled for the same purpose. The Minister for Trade and Customs should not be authorized to give effect to the board's - recommendations. It was never intended or desired that he should have that power, for it belongs properly only to Parliament. The board should conduct : - its inquiries like a petty court. Its members should not be seated upon a rostrum, and should be surrounded with as little frill and formality .as possible. It is certainly unnecessary that an imposing array of lawyers should be present at its sittings. Its present methods of inquiry are much too loose, and its operations have been satisfactory up to now more by good fortune than good management. The manner in which the board inquired I into the tobacco--growing industry is an excellent illustration of the loose way in which it operates. Last year, in this chamber, I pointed out that, owing to. the methods adopted by the British-Australasian Tobacco - Company, the interests of the by tobacco-growers were being most in juriously affected. I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs to request the T a r i ff Board to inquire into the matter. He promised to do so. I learned nothing more about it until I read in a paragraph in the Sydney press some weeks later that the board had held an inquiry, and in consequence of certain information supplied to it by the representatives of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company had decided that the tobacco growers were receiving fair treatment. I immediately telegraphed to the Minister for Trade and Customs a request that the tobacco-growers should be permitted to state their case to the board. Minister agreed that that should be done, and the board visited Sydney for the purpose. I am particularly interested in the tobacco-growers, for many of them are my constituents. They visited Sydney specially to attend the meeting of the board, but discovered that, although they had had no opportunity of being present when the British-Australasian Tobacco Company presented its evidence, the company was to be represented at the sitting by its principals and lawyers. This company is the only purchaser in Australia of the tobacco-growers' products. pointed out that the company had already submitted its case, and asked that the growers should be allowed to present their case without interruption or interference. The inquiry was conducted fairly, and eventually an agreement was reached by the parties concerned. thought that that was the end of the matter, but on reading the annual report of the board which has just been placed in the hands of honourable members, I was surprised to find that that was not so. It appears that another inquiry has since been made into the industry, and that an agreement has been made with the South Australian tobacco-growers, concerning which the growers in the eastern states have no information whatever. They were not consulted in any way. That is not as it should be. These hole-and-corner, back-stairs methods should not be tolerated.",21
81,Mr MATHEWS,WAYS AND MEANS,Has the honourable member complained to the Minister about this?,22
82,Mr THOMPSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"I have not done so, for I did not know of it until I perused this report. I trust, by the way, that all honourable members will read the report of the board, for it is a most valuable document. Not only should the board meetings be conducted in a more business-like way, but more time should be devoted to the matters which are under consideration.. The Sydney inquiry into the tobacco-growers' case was altogether too hurried.. The chairman of the board was present at the first day's sitting, but ho was not able to attend the meeting on the second day on account of having other business to transact, and on the last day the tobacco-growers were only given one The and a half or two hours in which to complete the presentation o£ their case. Hurried investigations, of that kind cannot be expected to give satisfactory results, nor can they be sufficiently comprehensive for the purposes they are expected to serve. The Tariff Board should visit each of the capital cities regularly, and also the principal provincial towns. Due notice of the visits should be given to all parties likely to be concerned, in order that they might have an opportunity to submit evidence to the board. I do not agree with many of the statements contained in the latest report of I the board. I was present at the inquiry into the tobacco-growing industry, and, therefore, I can say definitely that some of the statements made by the board in that case are inaccurate. That leads me to suggest the desirableness of making arrangements for taking a full shorthand I report of the proceedings of the board. The present tendency is towards having a verbatim report taken of every important inquiry affecting private or public interests. Only in that way can accuracy and efficiency be guaranteed. '",22
83,Mr WEST,WAYS AND MEANS,Are not the shorthand writers of the department present when an inquiry is being held ?,22
84,Mr THOMPSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"No . The board merely submits a condensed report, which may, or may not, be accurate. Considering the importance of the matters inquired into, the possibility of inaccuracies creeping in, and unsatisfactory results following is very great.  visory, not a judicial body.",22
85,Mr THOMPSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"I realise that the board has no judicial status, but I do not think that that in any way removes the necessity for havine the proceedings reported fully and accurately, and eventually placed before honourable members, thus enabling them to investigate the statements that have been made. board, in dealing with secondary industhat happening. tries, may make recommendations in volving an extra cost to the consumers millions of pounds. It may also make Board recommendations which seriously affect the life of some of our primary indusand reporttries. This important tribunal is allowed to submit notes that have been taken from the minutes of the proceedings. extra expense that would be incurred in hishaving the whole of the proceedings full y reported in public would be amply justified, because honqfable members would then have a permanent record of the inquiries. ' I do not think that the cost would be prohibitive. I listened with interest, yesterday, to the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr . Lazzarini). It appeared was endeavouring to enunciate his party's policy of new protection. He desired the Tariff Board should be empowered to recommend the withholding of considerafar tion from any industry that did not pay the award rates of wages.",22
86,Mr LAZZARINI,WAYS AND MEANS,Why board not have that power?,23
87,Mr THOMPSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"I do not say that it should not. But if it is given such wide power its character and its functions will be completely altered, and it will virtually become a. little parliament, with power almost equal to that of the High Court of Australia. I do not think it is the desire of honourable members to invest the, board with such a power. The majority of our industries are subject to awards, and it should not be necessary for the Tariff Board to inquire about the rates of'wages that are being paid. I do not think there is an induetry in any state that does not work under industrial legislation.",23
88,Mr LAZZARINI,WAYS AND MEANS,"I referred to a special case, in which the awards were not being observed.",23
89,Mr THOMPSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"The administradustries in relation to the tariff. tion of the industrial laws of that parproposed ticular state must have been very lax. I do not think it is within the province I am in entire agreement. of the Tariff Board to act as a punitive body, superimposed upon the state authohas rity. If the honourable member thinks the matter out more closely, I think will admit that his proposal would place power to makeinquiries. in the hands of the Tariff Board too a power, which may be open to serious abuse and have a boomerang effect against the policy which he and the members of his party advocate. The Mr Lazzarini - We are not afraid of",23
90,Mr THOMPSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"Sectio n 15, subof section 1,- paragraph h of the Tarift Act of 1921 provides, that the M in ister shall refer to the board for inquiry Any complaint that a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him The by the tariff, and in particular in regard to (i) charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods; or ',ii) acting m restraint of trade to the detriment of the public; or (iii) acting in a manner which results in unnecessarily high prices being charged to the consumer for his goods, and shall not take any action in respect of any of those matters until he has received the to me that he report of the board. That paragraph distinctly gives the Tariff that Board the powers that were formerly vested in the Interstate Commission. So as I have been able to ascertain, the board has not exercised that function. If it has, I am not ' aware that reports of should the its inquiries are on record, or that public notice has been taken of those inquiries. The board has the power to inquire into the operations of any combine or trust that is acting in restraint of trade, buH I do not think that that power has ever been exercised by it . Most of its inquiries have been the result of references by the Minister. Section 15, sub-section 2, of the act provides that a number of other matters may be referred to the board, including the general effect of the working of the customs tariff and the excise tariff in relation to the primary and secondary industries of the Commonwealth; the fiscal and industrial effects of the customs laws of the Commonwealth; the incidence of the rates of duty oa raw materials and on finished ox partly finished products; and any other matter in any way affecting the encouragement of primary or secondary inI t i?i to excise the words, "" in relation to.the tariff."" W it h that proposal The effect of the sub-section is that, unless the matter some relation to the tariff-in other words, unless it is a question'of imposing he or altering a duty-the board has no I think it great should be a function of the board to make inquiries and recommendations in regard to any primary or secondary industry in Australia. If the provisions ot that sub-section had been observed last year, I do not think the board would have had the power to inquire into the tobacco-growing industry and' various-other industries'. ""With the majority of primary industriesi t is not so much a> question of tariff alteration or imposition as - it isa question of investigating the conditions of the industry to see what can' be done to put it on a better footing. I therefore, think that inquiry should be held into any proposal for theimprovement of the condition of any primary 'or secondary industry, and any proposal relating to the operations of an alleged trust or combine. Clause 2 ofi the bill providesInquiries conducted by the board relating toa) any revision of the tariff; or 6) any proposal fora: bounty, shall be. held in public, and. evidence, in inquiries shall, subject to the* next. succeeding' sub-section, be taken in public. Am I to understandthat all other inquiries need not be held in public ? I think it should be made quitedefinite that all inquiries by thebeard shall' be held in public. Unless that is dene the claim' can be made by persons who axe not seeking a bounty or an alteration of the tariff that the inquiry should beheld in private. I impress upon honourable members the advisability of holding all inquiries in public: On the first day of the inquiry into the tobacco industry the board decided that it should, be held in public. Press reporters were present, and' the newspapers on the following, morning published fairly full reports of the proceedings. I have no doubt that those reports proved beneficial to. the tobacco^ growers. On the second day the board decided that the inquiry should, be held. in camera. My experience was: that the growers then, did not do quite so well.",23
91,Mr BLAKELEY,WAYS AND MEANS,Was the request for the inquiry to be held in camera made by the representatives of the growers or the tobacco combine?,24
92,Mr THOMPSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"We do not know, The board merely decided on the second day that it would be. in the; interest of all parties not to hold' the inquiry in public. The representatives of the growers did not make, the request.. I thought it was a> mis*take, and I said so: at the time, but the board had its way. After the agreement had been entered: into between the representatives of the growers and' the British Australasian Tobacco Company, it was decided that that agreement should not be published' until a certain period had elapsed. We did not know what was the reason for the delay, but we were not in. a position to dispute the. authority, of the board. Some newspapers published, garbled and inaccurate, statements which, later had.to.be corrected. My experience of the board convinces me that the proper thing is to restrict to. the lowest possible limit the. matters that may beinquired' into im camera. The act. provides; that' any member of a the board: may compeL a witness to: give evidence' upon oatih. That power hasi not been very greatly exer* cised..

I ' consider that the clause at present leaves the door open to all sorts of abuses. I do not contend that the-members of the board will fail in their duty to the publicbut, under the extended powers whichi it is proposed to. confer, upon it,, its work, will be largely increased, and. eventually it will be necessary to enlarge the personnel of the board or to give it power to delegate to otherpersons certain of its; duties.

I ' claim' to be able to interpret the English language when I see it , and I assert that there is nothing, in the bill to prevent the board from secretly agreeing, with a private concern to take evidence in camera. One of the most important duties of the board is referred, to in paragraph h, sub-section 1, section 15, of the principal act;. It should be made quite plain that inquiriesunder that provision must be held in public. A f t e r careful study of the work of the Tariff Board, the original act, and the amending bill, I am satisfied that the Government has power to make the board an instrument' of"" the greatest value to the. peopleo f Australia. I support the continuance of the board, irrespective of the adterations made in its constitu1 tion, becaiuse it ' is, in general, a useful institution'. It prevents the imposition 1 of: high duties:' without: proper - inquiry.

Board so constituted that why it will be able to deal justly with all primary and. secondary industries. If it is to. he ai really effective instrument for the scientific application of the tariff, the primaiy producing interests must receive an increased amount of attention. Every protectionist recognizes the vital im1 to Australia of manufacturingindustries, and. not . being able to see the position through of a conthe eyes of the free traders, we are such quite unable to appreciate their logic. it is The protectionist' opinion is that with out strongly intrenched manufacturing a country like Australia has no chance' of achieving industrial or canimereial greatness. At the same timei on we must not; forget that the primary pro- m ducers' axe theback-bone of Australia. to A f t e r alii the manufacturers merely 1 5 the r a w materia! which the p r i m a r y producers provid'Sj and it is a lop1 sided for m of protection which gives to the for m e r aM tfee cream and leavesto the latter the skim: milk. It is' with in the 1 1 power of theT a r if f Board to do more to 1 assist' theprimary producers' than it has done. I was pleased to read this paragraph in the board's annual report:The Tariff Board wishes to dispel the sion entertained in many quarters that it only interests itself in recommendations connected with manufacturing or secondary industries. As a matter of fact, a large portion of the 'board's time has been devoted to the consideration of matters relating to primary production, and that particular attention has given to the development of many important primary industries is illustrated by the following cases:The report then goes on to enumerate tobacco, hops, grapes, broom, corn, box timber, maize, and agricultural imple-. ments. I mention that paragraph in order to show that it is quite possible for the functions of the board to be extended beneficially to primary production, and I think it would be well if when the new board is constituted, a subcommittee were created for the special purpose pf investigating the conditions of a number of primary industries. If it is proper to place before honourable members reports regarding the conditions of big manufacturing industries, similar reports in an amplified form regarding primary industries should be available to Parliament. If that were done, the eyes of many honourable members would be opened. The functions of the board should include an investigation of the wheat-growing and dairying industries, and all branches of primary production, to ascertain whether it is possible by a revision of the tariff or the payment of bounties to improve their general economic condition. If the board undertakes such investigations the protectionist members of the Country party will be very well satisfied with its work and favourable to its continued existence as a permanent part of the fiscal machinery.",25
94,Mr FOSTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"Wakefield) [4.34] During the discussion of the tariff in 1921 I was one of the first honourable members to urge the Government to create a Tariff Board. Indeed, I warned the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Massy Greene) that I would resist the tariff from beginning to end unless I was assured that a board would be appointed to watch the operations of the new duties in the interests of the manufacturers, their employees, and the public. I confess at once that the operations of the board have gone a long way outside the limits which I at that time illu- indicated. However, I believe the members of the board to be exceedingly able, fair-minded, and conscientious men. A striking tribute to their fitness for the work they are discharging was the declaration by the Chamber of Combeen merce and the Chamber of Manufactures immediately after the appointments were made that they were excellent. I was hopeful that as both those bodies were satisfied, the members of the board would strike the happy medium, and not go to fiscal extremes. ' Mr GREGORY - What do those chambers say today? - Mr Foster - The Chamber of Commerce is dissatisfied with some phases of the work of the board, but I do not hold the board responsible. It is simply an adviser to the Minister, who as political head of the department must accept reeponsibility, and he naturally keeps as near as possible to the fiscal policy which he most approves.  Government.",26
95,Mr FOSTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"When he is a member of a composite government, half the Ministers of which believe in one policy, and the other half in the opposite policy, how is he to come to a determination upon a recommendation of the board 1 Either he must divide himself in two, or give to one section of the Cabinet a little today, and to the other section a little tomorrow. I believe the members of the board have . worked conscientiously, consistently, and indefatigably. The quantity of work thrust upon them has demonstrated that the Customs Department can no longer be conducted by a Minister without the assistance of such a body. From personal acquaintance with the operations of the department I know that, other than the Minister i i i charge, there is no member of the Government whose nose is kept more continuously to the grindstone. The work of the department is growing every day, and it would be a physical impossibility for him to discharge effectively, without assistance, the onerous duties imposed upon him, particularly in coming to decisions upon technical matters. I , therefore, am strongly in favour of the creation of an independent board apart from the officers of the department. I know there are excellent officers in the department, bub there is often a suspicion in the minds of importers that decisions of officers are influenced by a consideration of their obligations to the department. Of course, the board has not given entire satisfaction, and I did not expect that it would. There is a great deal of unrest and dissatisfaction, and an impression is abroad-no t amongst the importers and manufacturers, because they know better-that when anti-dumping duties are applied the wicked board is responsible. The fact is that the responsibility lies with the wicked Minister. The complaints I shall make of ministerial action do uot apply to the present Minister (Mr. Pratten), who is new to office, and whosu only fault is that he is a red-tape man who will not revise some of the decisions of his predecessor. That attitude, however, is by no means new. I have no hesitation in saying that I desire the Tariff Board to be continued, but not-indefinitely, and I am quite prepared to support the intermediate course of extending the appointment for three years, I hope that by the end of that term the board will have made an infinitely better impression upon the public. It should bear in mind that extreme tariffism does notprevail throughout Australia. We cannot build the tariff wall high enough for some people within a dozen miles of the Melbourne Town H all , and, probably, the more the duties are piled on, the more half the people of Sydney will be pleased. But that feeling is by no means general. Clause 3 contains a proposal for extending the work of the board by eliminating the words of section 15 of the principal act which confine the investigations of the board to matters "" in relation to the tariff."" If the amendment were agreed to the board could be called upon to investigate everything and anything under the sun. The honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) expressed a desire that the board should have a wider range of authority so that, for instance, it might inspect country to consider the possibility of the successful cultivation of tobacco. That is a job for an agricultural expert, and not for men whose special duties are to watch the operation of the tariff. The amendment is too indefinite, and there is no vision to restrict the range of the board's operations. Moreover, there is in connection with matters "" in relation to the tariff "" more than enough work to keep the board fully employed, and it would be the height of folly to distract its attention from such duties. Therefore, I shall suggest in committee that clause 3 be omitted, and I hope that the Minister will agree to that course, which, I am sure,, will be in the interests of departmental administration, and, particularly, of the Minister himself. I appreciate the consideration that the board has given to every phase of industry. I have always recognized that a tariff such as we have imposed, if it is to be effective in developing the secondary industries of a young and growing country making ib self-contained, must' weigh heavily upon the primary industries. In that regard, the Tariff Board has been exceedingly considerate. When the members of the board were first prosecuting their inquiries in Adelaide, this matter 'was brought prominently before them by the agricultural committee of the Liberal Union. The board went into the subject very thoroughly, and left a mighty fine impression upon the public. Prior to that time, the agricultural interests in South Australia regarded the board with grave suspicion, but it admitted that certain consideration was' due to th© primary industries, because they did not enjoy the benefits of the tariff to the same extent as did the city and manufacturing interests. The result was that, in certain respects, the primary industries were relieved very considerably",26
96,Mr MAKIN,WAYS AND MEANS,The Liberal Union in South Australia consists of the K i ng William street farmers.,27
97,Mr FOSTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"The honourable member had better confine his remarks to something he understands. Another phase of the bill which I very much appreciate is the proposal to maintain an open door when the board is conducting inquiries. I do not know thab ib has ever sat behind closed doors, but it has made its inquiries practically in the open. The more that policy is adopted the better it will be for all concerned. I do not think that a great departure from previous procedure will be involved in announcing that futur e investigations will be conducted with open doors, and that the dates of meetings to be held away from Melbourne pro- will be given due publicity in advance. I should like to know how many recommendations of the Tariff Board are accepted 'by 'tihe Minister and bow many - are .'rejected, what'number are varied and in - what direction. .Parliament should have a report showing what proportion of the tariff operations is attributable to the Minister and what proportion to the Tariff Board. Customs administration is becoming more complex. Great latiyears. tude is now given to the Minister in the operation of the tariff, and I ami not sure that his responsibility today is not as great as that which Parliament previously carried.",27
98,Mr COOK,WAYS AND MEANS,A great deal more.,28
99,Mr FOSTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"I am taking a moderate view. I believe that under the present Minister the tariff administration will 'be run on business lines, but if not, 'then God help - this country, because a sound tariff ;pdlicy is very badly needed. To promote efficiency, the M i nister has power to give - relief -""from duties in certain instances, so long as it does not interfere with the protective incidence of the tariff. There have been a lot of complaints in this connection. Relief may be given under tariff items 174 and 40.4. Certain classes of machinery are on the free list. 'The Minister, on the recommendation of the board, can give relief when new machinery that cannot be made in Australia is introduced for encouraging, veloping, and making more efficient the industries of this country. This is a wise provision. I have been successful in getting admitted .free from duty machinery for mining .purposes that has .simply revolutionized, for the time being, the - working of a mine that was .almost useless without the installation of labour-saving devices. I was also successful in .getting .admitted free new machinery for electrical purposes, engines that gave an immense efficiency.",28
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS,"- I ask the honourable member to confine .his remarks to the bill before the House. Mr FOSTEB, - I am dealing with the Tariff Board, which makes .recommendations to the Minister. . It may .be that the members of the board are not - bo blame, and that the sinner is the Minister. I obtained a concession for a - semi-public body to import engines that .could not be made here. Later on, an-lOther .semi-public body wanted the same type of engines. That body had in view a scheme of electrification which would vhave'been the'best of its size in Australia. MT . JDEPU.TY SPEAKER - Does the honourable .member propose to connect - his remarks - with the iTarlff Board ? Mr TOSTE'R - I - do. That - Boheme depended upon the efficiency'of these ""machines, and a 'sinking ' f u n d was to be established - to - wipe out the debt in 'fifteen The 'then Minister 'refused to admit these engines free. No blame'-was attachable to the Tariff !Board in this in stance. On the - recommendation of 'the Tariff Board, - relief was given in respect of imported wire 'netting jaad several other articles, for which I - am exceedingly grateful. An - enormous quantity of wire netting will be required in Australia for the next twenty years in order to provide vermin-proof'fences for ' the protection of our flocks 'from the 'ravages - of ""the - wild dogs. ' Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - There is no - reference in the bill to wild dogs.",28
101,Mr FOSTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"I am still dealing with the Tariff .Board. This ""House agreed to give relief on wire netting because it - was good business. In the interests of the country any other - action would have-been insane. In spite of that, a little'.laterI 'suppose on the recommendation of the board-the then Minister 'for Trade and Customs placed a dumping duty on wire netting. Two years ago the same M in de- ister introduced a .bill providing 'for an advance of £250,000, without interest, to settlers to enable them to obtain supplies of wire netting, and . it took him nearly two years to get them to accept the - advance, and later <a 'dumping duty was placedon the wire netting. 'Was that a consistent attitude'? The following letter'was written by an importer : Following our conversation coneer-ning the clumping of imported 'British goods, which are for the exclusive use of the - farmers, I am appending a few details which I thiiik will prove conclusively .the .unjust nnethad of applying the Industries .Preservation Act'to British wvre netting without due notification.

106,Mr WEST,WAYS AND MEANS,"East Sydney) [5.19] This is a most important bill. The present Australian tariff is a mongrel tariff. It is neither flesh, fowl, nor good red herring. It pleases nobody, and gets us nowhere. The Tariff Board is obliged to listen, on the one hand, to the representations of those who are opposed to any tariff, and, on the other, to those who are concerned only about protection for their own industries. Neither party gives any consideration to the welfare of the country. In these circumstances it is not strange that the board has a very difficult row to hoe. I object to the tariff, because it swells the revenue too greatly, and does not benefit those for whom it was intended. It is not a scientific tariff. The DEPUTY SPEAKER,-We are not now dealing with the fiscal policy of Australia.",30
107,Mr WEST,WAYS AND MEANS,"I dissent from that view. The board was appointed to deal with tariff matters. How could the Minister apply the anti-dumping provisions of the act without the assistance of the board ? Every act of the board relates to the tariff. One of the most dangerous powers is that which enables the board to do and undo things. I am somewhat in accord with the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) and the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), who have stated that the board is able to alter the duties that have been fixed by Parliament. It is not desirable that the board should have that power. It should merely make recommendations to the Minister when it finds that the duties fixed do not carry out the will and the intention of Parliament. A conference of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia was recently held in Adelaide. Among the motions moved at that conference were the following : (n) That in view of the embarrassment of trade resulting from its operations, in the opinion of the Associated Chambers of Commerce the life of the Tariff Board should not be extended beyond the time fixed by the sent act. (d) This conference views with concern the growing increaso in the Customs duty placed on imported goods whichcannot at present be manufactured in Australia to meet the demand, . and invites the conference to give serious consideration to this question for the purpose of obtaining relief. There is not a protectionist in this House who would object to the second of those motions. The practice has been to impose duties even on goods that cannot be manufactured in Australia, merely for the purpose of raising revenue. That does not meet the wishes of protectionists. If the duty on auy article is not sufficient to protect the local industry the board can refer the matter to the Minister. The Minister has certain discretionary power, and he can also ask Parliament to so increase the duties that they will effectively protect the local industry. This conference of the Associated Chambers of Commerce appears to have been seized of the real intent-ion of Parliament when the act was introduced. A paragraph of the report statesThe real objects of this legislation were(1) to protect local industries against depreciated currency; (2) against cbeaj) coloured labour; (3) against subsidized shipping to give exporters an unreasonably low freight; and (4) against the dumping of surplus stock for sale at any price. These are nil easy matters of cnlculation and could be detected and adjusted by the Customs authorities. Those who are acquainted with the conditions that existed when the anti-dumping legislation was introduced are aware that the invoice price of certain goods that were imported was not sufficient to pay for the labour necessary for their production. The matter was brought to my notice at the time, and I went through the invoices. The Australian manufacturers of similar articles could not compete with the importers. Their introduction - into Australia at the invoiced price was possible only because a change in the seasons in London and Paris had thrown them back into the hands of the manufacturers.",30
108,Mr GABB,WAYS AND MEANS,"I call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum, formed.']",30
109,Mr WEST,WAYS AND MEANS,"The Tariff Board can confer a great benefit upon the people. Some honourable members are anxious that its inquiries should be held in pubpre- lic. So far, I have not heard any valid objection raised, to that course. It is not proposed that the board should be deprived of .the right to take evidence in camera in certain cases. There are persons who believe that i ' , should conduct judicial inquiries. I cannot see that any advantage would be derived if that were done. The members of the board possess a knowledge of commercial life, and they should also know something about the industrial conditions in Australia. agree with those honourable members who object to inquiries by the Tariff Board being held in private - No valid reason has been given for secrecy. I asked the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) what views he held on the tariff, and he said that he would abolish it. A Tariff Board is evidently not of much good to him. He mentioned the firm of Hoskins,"" which is spending a large sum of money on a building in the City of Sydney, but what connection has that with the subject under discussion? The board could have made an inquiry into the effect of the tariff on Mr Hoskins' business. Why should any one object if . it did? I ascertained that Mr Hoskins had benefited by the tariff, and he has circulated a large amount of money that has benefited the people of this country. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) say that the Country party was in favour of continuing the board. I had an idea that the Country party would be the last party in the world to support such a board. Mr B. G-REEN - The honourable memunravel ber heard speeches from only two memthe bers of the Country party, both of whom were Western Australians.",30
110,Mr WEST,WAYS AND MEANS,"Eve n if there were only country? two of them, they made it quite plain that change they would abolish both the tariff and the board.",31
111,Mr THOMPSON,WAYS AND MEANS,Who said that?,31
112,Mr WEST,WAYS AND MEANS,"The honourable member for Perth (Mr.'Mann), and others. The honourable member for New England is the first member of his party who has spoken in favour of the tariff. I do not know whether I should commend him for his courage, for he may have realized that it is time to do something to save himself at the next elections. The Tariff Board is not an Australian idea. The Labour Council in Canada has made the following strong recommendation in favour of the appointment of a board:-We recommend the formation of a Tariff Board on which organized labour shall have representation, created with full powers to deal with this subject in a similar manner to the powers exercised by the Railway Commission in railroad matters. I There is a board in India whose duty it is "" to watch generally the effects of the tariff policy upon the cost of living,"" and '-'to study the tariff system of other countries."" It would appear that the Australian board is a little more practical than the Indian board, which is clothed with powerTo investigate the claims of particular industries to protection, and if satisfied that protection is required, to recommend the rate of protective duty, or any alternative measures of assistance, such as the grant of bounties. I am not aware that our board has anything to do with bounties.",31
113,Mr FENTON,WAYS AND MEANS,It has.,31
114,Mr WEST,WAYS AND MEANS,"The Tariff Board is a very important piece of administrative machinery, and could be made a valuable instrument under a policy either of free trade or protection. I raised no objection to its appointment, and I shall not object to its continuance. I am satisfied that when the Labour party gets into power the board's usefulness will be extended to embrace consumers as well as producers, and primary as well as secondary industries. I have exercised my mind for some time in an effort to the problem of exchange, and on 29th August I asked the Treasurer1. Is it a fact that the (United States of America tariff compels the British Government to use gold to meet the war obligations of that 2. If so, in order to relieve the excessive exin Great Britain, will he frame a tariff, us in America, so that the obligations from that country be paid in gold? The replies I received were1. To some extent probably. 2. .This would be ineffective, because gold payments are suspended in Australia. The debts owing by Great Britain to America are being met by shipments of gold, and I wanted to know whether gold could not be sent from Great Britain to Australia to ease the exchange difficulty. The answer given to me showed that no serious consideration was given to the question. Protective duties are put on, and we have to "" shut oiir eyes, open out - mouths, aE'd-eee-wia-t^oine 'oaewa'll send ms."" l-he problem ris m o r e serious t h a n lhouorable members appear .to think, for lust month our Customs revenue exceeded - Ehat ;'for the corresponding month of last year.",31
115,Mr SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS," The honourable member's remarks are a i it t l e 'outside the scope 'of .the bill . Mr WEST*-'Some honourable mem-bers, especially those with f reetrade leanings, - seem to think that the price of everything in Australia is too high. 'Surely no one imagines that 'we can go back to pre-war prices. To 'do so would - lower the standard of living, would cause a slump in the prices of wheat, butter, and other p r i m a r y ^produce, and would produce (almost fa .revolution. Prices now r u l in g .ar,e i u .conformity with the standard of .living, of Abe people. !The honourable member .for Gwydir (Mr - stimulus Cunningham), . in a powerful ispeech last .night, said that if the T a r if f '.Board made inquiries it would .soon come to the conclusion .that lowering the .standard of livin g would seriously .affect the interests of ,primary producers. .My policy would '.be to encourage the consumption of local products, and so 'bring about of imports. For instance, Australia imports about £189,000 dried fruits each year, - yet the Tariff Board is being asked to report as to the best means of disposing of Australia's - surplus of dried fruits. Surely the board would be better - employed in devising means for preventing the importation of this commodity from .abroad. However, T do n ot - think that we shall overcome our tariff problems, and the adverse exchange, u n t i l we discontinue borrowing outside Australia. Canada has not borrowed any money outside 'the dominion since 1913. Its banks are compelled by law to keep certain assets at the disposal of the Government, - which is thereby made more or - less independent of the foreign money - lender. adopts the sensible policy of confining its borrowings to the Australian market we shall get r i d of a lot of the troubles that arise out of excessive importation. These .honourable members who are trying to undermine the policy of protection in this country are wasting their time. duty is to improve the tariff so that it will give greater help to local industries.

Mr R. GEREEN (Richmond) [5.59] A discussion of the Tariff Board almost inevitably involves a consideration of tariff matters, and I shall ask your consideration, Mr Speaker, if in the course of my remarks I transgress beyond the If Australia actual scope of the bill. I listened attentively to the speech delivered last night by the honourable member for Perth (Mr . M a n n ) . He is a pronounced free trader, and many of his arguments were convincing to anybody who was already convinced. But the honourable member did Our not succeed in converting me from the protectionist f a it h . My travels abroad when a'young man, andlater, during the war, (convinced ime that protection is the only - possible policy for - a young and undeveloped country; and I still ;adhere to that belief, notwithstanding the free trade - arguments that have been advanced during this debate. But protectionist principles can be carried too far. There is in .the tariff a number of .high duties which, instead of - protecting, are really hindering the community. For instance, there are duties which .are imposed for the (benefit of exotic industries which are of no real - value.",32
116,Mr FORDE,WAYS AND MEANS,"-Will the honourable member name-some of them'? Mr R. GREEK-The honourable-member for Swan (Mr Gregory) mentioned one last night. He 'reminded us that, although many thousands of - shovels are used in Australiaeach year, only fifteen men are employed in the local manufacture of after .many years of protection. It is obvious that, if that industry were - worth .while protecting, it would have extended more rapidly. While excessive protection .is undesirable, absolute free trade is the opposite extreme. Since I 'entered this House I have inspected many factories throughout Australia. I have ib;ad ,a lifelong acquaintance with the primary industries, ;but the field of manu- this House. facturing was to me a term incognita, <&nd I was desirous of learning something of the conditions under which the factories were conducted and the treatment meted out to the employees. My inquiries have left upon my mind certain impressions, which I shall place before this House when the tariff is under discussion. Some of the things I have seen in the secondary industries have confirmed my faith that moderate protection is the best policy for Australia. It has 'been stated in this House, ,and press seems to havte taken the same view, that the Country party stands for outand-out free trade; but such is not the case. There are certainly some free traders among us, but 'that applies also to the other two parties in this House. MT. FORDE - Not to the Xabour party. Mr R GREEN"" - I must contradict the honourable member. There are free traders among the representatives of the three parties in this House. The old controversy of protection versus free trade, which was supposed to have died many years ago, seems to be reviving. Honourable members adopt this attitude- ""Let : us forget it and please do not raise it, because we do not want to - make it a party question."" Mr SPEAKER,-It should not be raised by the honourable member when speaking on 'this bill. Mr R tGREEN - It is difficult to draw a line of demarcation in tariff matters. I merely wish to dispel the impression that the Country party, as a whole, supports the policy of free trade. Mr ""MANN - No one could possibly have that impression.",33
117,Mr R GREEN,WAYS AND MEANS,"I am glad that the honourable member thinks so. Although I am a representative of a rural constituency, I do not believe that country interests should benefit at the expense of city interests. Every section of the comthem munity should be treated fairly and squarely. I favour the continuation of not only the duties on certain primary products, such as butter and bananas, but also the dumping duty on maize and the embargo on foreign sugar. I was a member of the deputation that was responsible for the dumping duty being placed on maize. My views respecting the embargo on sugar have been clearly expressed in Although it is necessary that we should protect our secondary industries, yet some measure of protection should also be given to our primary industries. Out of the administration of the Industries Preservation Act has .grown, the Tariff Board, whose operations chiefly affect secondary industries. This afternoon the honourable - member for New England (Mr Thompson) dealt with the tobacco industry, and the operations of the combine known as the British Australasian Tobacco Company. He and I were among the representatives of the the growers that approached the Tariff Board in the interests of the tobacco industry. The Tariff Board has interfered very little with primary industries, but its action regarding the tobacco and maize industries alone has benefited thousands of primary producers.",33

121,Mr R GREEN,WAYS AND MEANS,"I prefer to look after the interests of our own people, despite the animosity of South Africa . I have no objection to the Tariff Board, since it was a natural corollary to the Industries Preservation Ac t that some such body should bo established to deal with matters arising out of that legislation. The administration of the board, I am sorry to say, leaves much, to be desired. I was a delegate at the conference of l?ie associated chambers of commerce held in Adelaide in May of this year. Mr Raws, a Melbourne delegate, when addressing the conference, spoke of the administration of the Tariff Board. He saidThe Commonwealth Qazette of 7th February, J 924.. published a by-law lifting the wood working machinery. The by-law operated from the 25th July, to 2Gth July, Mr GREGORY.""-That is evidently misprint. I b should be 1923, and 1921. At that time the Industries servation Act was not in existence.",34
122,Mr R GREEN,WAYS AND MEANS,"He continuedOn 28th June, 1923, there were gazetted numerous by-laws operating for one day only - whic h dates were long before the date gazettal. In one case the by-law published on the 28th June, 1923, operated from the 28th June, 1920-the e years previously-anc l ceased to operate on the 20th June, 1921. From that statement it appears that what - Mr R GREEN the honourable member for Swan referred to is not a misprint. He gave further examples as follow:A notice in the Commonwealth Government Gazette of 17th April, 1924, regarding wegian cement, operated from the 26th September, 1922'. A notice regarding induction motors from the United Kingdom, on the 3rd April. 1924. operated from the 10th August, 1923. Shoes from Czechoslovakia, gazetted 23rd August, 1923, operated from 9th August, 1922. These are bad cases of maladministration that to me are inexplicable. Mr Raws also statedOn the 23rd November, 1922, the Commonquickly. wealth Government Gazette imposed a dumpber ing duty on United Kingdom Portland cement, retrospective to the 3rd August. Tho circumshow stances attending this may be known to you. in the working of the board. The Commonwealth Government Line of steamers reduced the rate of freight on by Gd. a cask. The Customs Department retaliated by placing u dumping duty. The manufacturers thereupon increased their by Gd. a cask, thereby taking as exlra tralia. profit to themselves the rebate in freight stoid of passing it on to the consumers. position was so ludicrous that in less than a month the notice was revoked. That subject was also mentioned by Mr . J. Maitland Paxton, a well-known business man in Sydney. He stated: In January or February, 1923, a Commonwealth Government instrumentality, in thb form of the Commonwealth Government Line of steamers, reduced freights to Australia That was all very good and in favour of importers and users. Among other things, the Commonwealth Line reduced the freight rate on cement from, I think, 5s. to 4s. Gd. a cask. The other lines, in due time, followed suit. Then some manufacturers - got busy and stated that cement was being imported into Australia at an unduly low rate of freight. The result was that comparatively recently another clumping duty was placed on cement, because of the fact that the freight had been reduced by Gd. a cask.",34

No doubt he acted on the recommendagazetted tions of the board.",34
126,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,Onl y Parliament should have authority to alter the tariff.,34
127,Mr R GREEN,WAYS AND MEANS,"I agree with the honourable member, with the reservation that I think some machinery should be available to make alterations in cases of emergency when action must be taken I have given a sufficient numof instances of maladministration to the necessity for some tightening up If still another is required, I call attention io cement the action that was taken in connection with cream separators, which are not, and price never have been, manufactured in AusEighty per cent, of our imports hicome from Sweden, and only 4 i per cent, The from Great Britain, so that the dumping duty that was imposed was purely and simply a protection for the Swedish manufacturers, whose real competitors are the Germans. It is not only ridiculous, but also unfortunate that a high tariff should be imposed on cream separators, for every dairy farmer must have a separator of some kind. In spite of all I have said, however, I must admit that a Tariff Board of some kind is necessary. The suggestion of the honourable member for Swan, that the chairman of the board should be a judge or a gentleman of legal training, is a good one, and I think it ought to be possible to find business men who could sit with him and fairly represent the manufacturing and importing interests. There is a distinct clash of the interests of importers and manufacturers, but if necessity arose for deciding which should be given the greater measure of protection, I should most certainly decide in favour of the manufacturers, for they, at least, spend their money in Australia and provide employment for our people, while the importers send their money abroad to obtain goods of foreign manufacture. Possibly, the most effective Tariff Board would be one which had a judge or magistrate as chairman; a representative of the importers, who would watch the proceedings from the free trade point of view, because it would bo in his interests to keep the duties down; and a representative of the manufacturers, who, of course, would try to make the duties as high as possible in the interests of local industries; and, in addition, a representative of the primary industries.",34
128,Unknown,WAYS AND MEANS,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to S p.m. Mr R GREEN"" - I was distinctly impressed with the arguments of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) with regard to the proposal in clause 3 to omit the words ""in relation to the tariff."" I think the amendment that has been foreshadowed, by the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) will meet the position. The hoard must be given power to investigate the operations of combines that are acting detrimentally to trade. Had the Tariff Board not been iii existence, the tobacco-growers of tralia would have been in a very parlous state. With the backing of the board, the representatives of the growers were able to bring that monopoly to its senses. I hope that honourable members will have the opportunity to review the actions of the board from time to time. I look forward to the time when Australian industries will, without the protection afforded by the Industries Preservation Act, be able to pay the wages fixed, and provide the necessary comforts for the workers, and at the same time compete with similar industries in overseas markets. I intend to support the second reading of the bill, in the hope that it will be improved in committee by the acceptance of many of the excellent amendments that have been foreshadowed.",35
129,Mr FENTON,WAYS AND MEANS,"Maribyrnong) [8.5] In common with quite a number of other persons who believe in protecting Australian industries, I feel that we are not"" receiving the full benefit thatshould accrue from the Tariff Act. At the time of its introduction, that, measure was characterized by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), who was then the honourable member for Dampier, as a ""prohibition measure."" The fact, that such, a large amount of revenue is being received by the Customs Department is a proof that the act has not proved effective in protecting Australian industries. Millions of pounds' worth of goods that ought to be manufactured in Australia are being imported. The Tariff Board has made certain investigations with a view to protecting Australian industries, and, in some instances, I believe, conserving the interests of the consumers. It has had little to do'with the workers, because there are other means for fixing the wages and determining the conditions of the workers in the various factories. An immense amount is circulated in wages every year by our manufacturers. I believe that even the most ardent free trader will admit that if that wage fund were wiped out, it would be a very bad thing for Australia, especially as 60 per cent, of it is devoted to the purchase of food and clothing. The primary producers, therefore, receive a very big proportion of the £71,000,000 spent on wages, and I frequently marvel at the fact that certain Aus- lionorable members should misrepresent the primary producers by endeavouring to make our tariff ineffective. If their efforts were successful, the closing down of a. number of industries would inevitably follow. When the Tariff Board was brought into existence, I had the idea that it would perform many acts that would be of advantage to the protectionist policy of Australia. Unfortunately, it has not done all that it could have done. Many honourable members ask uswhy we advocate the protection of the manufacturer, the worker, and theconsumer. Some go so far as to say Ave have not the power to do that. I believe that our Constitution confers on us the necessary power. I understand that quite a number of amendments are to be submitted, and if rumour spealcs correctly, they would, if accepted, entirely change the complexion of the bill. I impress upon those who advocate absolute free trade that that policy would be ruinous for Australia. Mr JAGKSON.,-It is apolicy that would lead to depopulation. Mr FEiYTOK-It would be a crime to put it into force. I do not 'intend to discuss the tariff question. merely want to warn those honourable members who profess to represent certain interests in this House that if absolute free trade wereintroduced tomorrow, the people of Australia would be placed in subjection to monopolistic importers. If I had the choice, I should prefer a manufacturing monopoly in Australia to an importing monopoly, over which we should have no control - I want to give two illustrations to show the position in which the primary producers would be placed if the state of affairs which the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) and the honourable member for Perth. (Mr Mann.) clamour were brought about. At one time free trade condition.3 existed in regard to reapers and binders, and reaper and binder twine. In Victoria an industry was established for rope-making, twine-making, and reaper and binder twine-making. As soon as the Australian manufacturer commenced operations^ down, came the price of reaper and bindertwine. Until three or four years ago, the reaper and. binder was admitted to Australia free of duty. What benefit accrued to the primary producers of Australia from.that?' Little or none. Although I objected last night, Mr Speaker, to the limitation which £ considered' you were placing upon the' debate,, in the main.you were quite right. The phraseology of the bill; and the act' 1 which it proposesto amend', are such that I thought we' could discuss almost anything on the present motion; but fur* ther consideration hasconvinced me that, if the desires' of honourable memberswere allowed full sway, the debate would be interminable. I believe that in the present Minister for Trade and Customs  Protectionists that has ever had charge of the Customs Department. In my opinion, he will protect Australian industries against foreign competition. I am prepared to leave in abeyance for the present a general discussion of this bill,, in the hope that those who are charged with its administration, including the Tariff Board, will protect the industries of Australia. I move That all the words after the word "" now "" be left out with a. view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-"" withdrawn and redrafted to provide adequate guarantees that the primary producers andconsumers' may be able to obtain locally-manufactured articlesor I goods at reasonable prices."" Honourable members smile, and I am sur- 1 prised at it. If honourable members* in cluding the Minister, are true-blue Protectionists, they will accept the amendment as a means of defence against theonslaughts of honourable members like the honourable member, for Swan and the honourable member-for. Perth; If we could' insert in. this bill a provision giving power to the board todowhat the amendment seeks to have' done; all the argaments of the honourable member for Swan, for the honourable member for Perth, and those who think with, them,, would go by the board. I suppose that in my constituency, and. in the constituency of the lionorable member for Corio- (Mr Lister) there are more manufacturers than are to be found in the rest of Australia. Although in the redistribution of. electorates a. large manufacturing firm was removed from the Maribyrnong, totheCorio electorate, I , still have in, my electorate a. largenumber of agritural implement makers and engineering shops. Under the amendment it , will be the right of a person who thinks he has been charged too much for an agricultural implement' to report' the circumstances to the Tariff' Board: My object is to prevent the owners of"" factories that enjoy the protection of import duties from charging: exorbitant prices.",35
130,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,Under that amendment the members of the Tariff Board would hardly have enough work' to fill in their time!,37
131,Mr FENTON,WAYS AND MEANS,"The honourable member for Corio and others have shown that locally-manufactured agricultural implementsare sold much more cheaply than similar articles made in America and imrported into New Zealand duty free. The passing of the amendment would prevent the allegation being made that the tariff, in protecting manufacturers, enables them to exploit the public, and it would remove one of the most insistent, complaints of the free trader. I am an old-time protectionist, and I shall fight strenuously for the continuance of the old protection until I can get the new protection. Protection is essential to the advancement of a young country like Australia. When the stabilization of. the butter industry vvas being discussed a member of the ; Opposition happened to say, above a whisper, "" Y o u are going ""to* indulge in price fixing' at last,"" and! the Government then decided to change its policy. It is absolutely necessary to prevent the exploiter from dipping too deeply into the pockets of the people of this country. After protecting the manufacturer, we should protect the workman and the consumer.",37
132,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"The honourable member, naturally, puts the consumer last. Mr Fenton"" - I am, only putting things in their natural order. Articles cannot be manufactured successfully in Australia, unless we protect themanufacturer at the: ports, and the best articles cannot be manufactured unless the work people enjoy good conditions and receive high wages. As an article cannot be sold until it has been manufactured; the consumer comes third, in his natural order.",37
133,Mr JACKSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"Bass) [8.88] - Before the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Pratten) commences to slaughter those who have dared to oppose this bill, I should like to assure him of. my support. The debate has been more or less a f u l ldress tariff debate, but I do not intend to do as other honourable members have done. Ir shall certainly not copy the honourable member - for Swan (Mr: Gregory), who advocated the abolition of the Tariff Board and the Industries: 1 Preservation Act. Although he' did not' say so, he would' also abolish the tariff! The Minister's powers in regard to the tariff are no more and no less than those that were given to him by this House in. 1907. Until 1921 Ministers controlling' that department 'were entirely dependent upon officers of the department for advice, but in that year. Senator Greene, who was then Minister, conceived the idea of a Tariff Board. The board has greatly assisted and strengthened the Minister in his decisions. On every hand we hear that the Tariff Board has done this or that, but honourable membersknow that it has power only to recommend to the Minister There is no justification, therefore, for the allegations that have been made against the board. From what opponents of the board say, one would conclude that Australia is the only country that has atariff board, whereas there are many tariff boards in the world.",37
134,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,They are not like' our board.,37
135,Mr JACKSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"It may be that ours istheonly one of its kind, but I contend that it isa better board than any other. The honourable member for Swan showed me a sheaf of papers containing about 250 recommendations of the Tariff Board to remit duties for one day only. But for the Tariff Board, most of those duties would not have been removed by the Minister, and therefore; I suggest that my free trade friends are' indebted to the board for those remissions of duties. In this connection, I ' should like to mention a. filtration plant that was imported by a Sydney firm, for whose benefit the duty was remitted for one day. When the Launceston municipal council imported a filtration plant, however, it was mulct in over £1,000 duty. It may be possible for the Minister and the Tariff Board to assure the Launceston council that the plant it imported is not in the same category as that obtained by the Sydney company, and if they can' do that the grievance may be met, but I cannot agree to a firm in one city getting a rebate while a municipal authority in another city does not. The plant in Launceston was required for the purification of water forwoollen mills, while that in Sydney wasfor the purificationof water for a. gelatinefactory. Upon the Minister rest?the responsibility of accepting or rejecting the Tariff Board's recommendations. Tbat is as it should be, because the Minister is responsible to this House. uever do anything to take out of the hands of honourable members the right to say what shall or shall not be done with the tariff. I am strongly in favour of the board being appointed permanently. Long before I took any active part in politics I was of opinion that, there should be a board similar to the Tariff Board to advise the Minister, who controls a large business department. As lionorable members know, Ministers come and go, perhaps too often, with the result that there is a congestion of work in the department. The only remedy is an advisory body like the Tariff Board. support the bill , and hope that it will be passed quickly. . Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [8.30] - The Tariff Board has done good work, and its continuance is absolutely necessary. A f t e r the American Civil War the manufacturers of Europe tried to flood America with their products, just as they are now trying to flood Australia to the detriment of local industries. When Europe gets settled down and Germany regains its normal standard of production, it will be looking for markets overseas, and our industries will be in a perilous position if we have not a Tariff Board to watch carefully trade developments. At no time have a board and a Minister sympathetic to the secondary in dustries been more necessary than at the present time. All the countries of Europe, after having been out of production for years, are now looking for new markets. Even in Great Britain there 1,500,000 men out of employment, and its manufacturers are looking for overseas markets for their products. Under these conditions it is certain that if thetariff administration is relaxed unemployment in Axistralia will increase enormously. It is our duty to protect the. workers of this country, and to see that the industries thatemploy them are not destroyed. I Congratulate the present Minister for Trade and Customs on his earnest desire to give the secondary industries a fai r chance. Those who have visited the big factories and seen the marvellous organization that has been brought about for the production, of local requirements must admire the captains of those industries. They have risked their money in new avenues, and today there are more manufactures in the Commonwealth than ever before. But while they are in I shall their infancy, and have nob obtained a safe footing in the local market, they are in the greatest danger. Therefore, a Tariff Board is necessary to prevent the dumping of goods to the disadvantage of local manufacturers and their employees. Cheap foreign pianos and harvesters may be very desirable in some ways, but they can be had only at the expense of the Australian workers. Those who believe in free trade can go to countries in which their principles are in operation. There they will find plenty of cheap goods",37
136,Mr JACKSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"And no money with I which to buy them. Mr E . RILEY - E x a c t l y . Honourable members talk about the high cost of commodities, but the Tariff Board is rightly endeavouring to prevent cheapness, which brings in its train low wages and poverty. If honourable members desire to lower the existing standard of living, and have men working long hours for small wages, they will do well to follow the advice of the honourable member for Lang. (Sir Elliot Johnson), to abolish the tariff. If on the recommendation of the Tariff Board all duties were removed and a laissez-faire system of trading were substituted, thousands of our workers would be thrown out of employment.",38
137,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,The high tariff is creating unemployment. Mr E . RILEY - That is the honourable member's view. He says that he is not a free trader.,38
138,Mr SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS,"I hope the honorare able member will not allow the interjection to draw him away from the question before the Chair. Mr E . RILEY - That was what the honourable member for Swan was endeavouring to do, and I am glad that, you, sir, have rebuked-him. It is the duty, of the Tariff Board to advise the Minister who, in turn, is responsible to Parliament. An y recommendation by the board is subject to the arbitrament of the Minister, and if he does anything' wrong this House should have the courage to deal with him. So far I have no faul t to find with the present Minister for Trade and Customs. In fact, I am very proud of him on account of the courageous manner in which he has stood up to those who have attacked the board and the officers of his department. He has told those critics plainly that he, and not the board, is responsible for the administration of the tariff and the - imposition of dumping duties. I know of local industries that were on the verge of extinction before the tariff was brought to their assistance. During the war a new industry, the Davis gelatine works, was started at Botany. Davis Brothers spent a great deal of capital in establishing those works, and while Mr Tudor was Minister for Trade and Customs the industry was nearly crushed out of existence by the importation from Japan of gelatine made from seaweed. The imported article had no dietetic vahie, but the gelatine produced at Botany is a pure food. Mr . came to the assistance of the local in dustry, which now employs about 200 people, and is a * credit to the Commonwealth.",38
139,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"The competition with which it was faced was from Canada. Mr E . RILEY - And from Japan. B ut even if it was from Canada, should we allow an industry which was the result of the courage, organizing ability, and capital of two enterprising men, to be extinguished ?",39
140,Mr GREGOKY,WAYS AND MEANS,"The Australian farmer has to compete with the Canadian farmer in the production of wheat. Why should not Australian gelatine compete with Canadian gelatine 1 Mr E . RILEY - The Canadian tine was being dumped. The Minister showed great discretion in the operation of the tariff, and when a new machine was required that could nob be produced locally he allowed one to be imported free of duty. I hope that the same broad view will always be taken. On many occasions the present Minister has done the right thing. ' The operations of the Tariff Board should be extended, and, if the Labour party is returned to power at the next general election, they will be extended. We should instruct the board to investigate the conditions under which an industry is being conducted, and to ascertain whether acompany's capital is genuine or watered. Any industry that is conducted on honest and straightforward lines, gives employment, and sells to the consumers at reasonable prices, is entitled to consideration.",39
141,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"The honourable member would not argue in favour of a factory that was operating with an obsolete plant ? Mr E . RILEY - No . Most of the in dustries which are now struggling for existence are of comparatively recent growth, and their equipment'is quite up to date. A f t e r the American Civil War Congress had to go to the assistance of the local industries because of the deliberate attempt by oversea competitors to destroy them.",39
142,Mr CUNNINGHAM,WAYS AND MEANS,"Americ a built up its industries by the imposition of a prohibitive tariff. Mr E . RILEY - That is so. I do not believe in a revenue tariff. If an article can be made in Australia it is better to cut out all competition from abroad Tudor and allow local competition to regulate the price. I hold no brief for MCKa y and other manufacturers of machinery. They have done very well as a result of the protective policy. I remember that when the tariff was under consideration, Mr Hoskins sat in the gallery here continuously. One would have thought he was living on his last pound. He is always clamouring for higher duties to protect his industry, but when the workers in New South Wales were awarded a 44-hour week, he said he would have to go out of business. If a man cannot pay decent wages and work his employees for reasonable hours he is better out of business. Mr Hoskins has prospered with the aid of the tariff, but with men who are opposed 'to giving fair conditions to their gela- employees, honourable members on this side have no sympathy. It will be the duty of the Tariff Board to report to the Minister regarding the encouragement that should be given to legitimate in dustries. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton) will produce an improved bill, and I hope that the Minister will accept it.  Mr E . RILEY - Yes , and bring in a new one. I am strongly in favour of the continuance of the Tariff Board, one of whose duties will be to assist the M in ister to frame a new tariff in due course.",39
143,Mr WHITSITT,WAYS AND MEANS,"Darwin) [8.43] - At no time in the history of Australia was a Tariff Board more essential than at the present time. When Europe becomes thoroughly organized again, and its industries are re-established, steel rails will be sent from Germany and elsewhere almost as ballast, in order to crush out the Australian industry. I heard one honourable member remark, relative to the iron industry, that it is not - necessary to 'have - a board to prevent 'dumping, but .1 mind him .that Australian .industries quire 'special protection *at - the present juncture, and 'they can get it 'only if there is - a Tariff - Board - which will "" the boot in "" >as soon 'as tfhere - is slightest semblance - of dumping.

To make AusAustralia tralia a great nation, we must protect ourselves against the operations of 'those people, both inside .and outside of tralia, who malse huge profits from the sale of foreign goods dumped into this certain country.

Mr OKEEFE (Denison) [«.«] - Dur ing this debate some very fine free trade and protection speeches have been made by honourable members, who have-managed, not without 'difficulty, .to connect remarks with the bill before the House. The .subject under discussion is whether the Tariff Board Act shall ,be amended with a view to making the Tariff Board permanent institution. Although I doubt very much whether the board has carried out the duties that it was originally in the tended to perform, yet during the last year or two it has done many things which, although perhaps not .meeting with .general (approval, have benefited certain ireAustralian industries. .During .the last re- .eighteen months I lia-we been <a member of various deputations - that have waited upon ithe Tariff .Board in the interests ,of put - certain industries. The ex-Minister for the Tiiade and Customs (Sir .Austin ChapinJTian.) required a, very strong case to be put ,to him .before he would .depart from recommendations of the Tariff .Board, to but any action .that he took was mainly for the protection .of our industries. The The subject .of cement .has been mentioned ""Simiduring this .debate.

At that island of are all the natural resources necessary for the manufacture of ""the very best to cement. The company has spent consideranly over £300,000 in the purchase of the our necessary plant.

AusAlthough representations were made to the Tariff Board, it Tefused to remit duties upon the imported A long argument ensued, the and the eompany was certainly not satisfied with the action of the board. From - what I know of the iacts, I ''believe tfhat the board acted wrongly, because the the machinery 'that they 'had imported - could not be manufactured in Australia. Although the - company's request ""was not - granted, T am satisfied that the board did what it believed to be right in the their interests of the Customs Department.  honourable member holds that opinion, a because that matter has again been reviewed and the request again refused.",39
144,Mr OKEEFE,WAYS AND MEANS,"It would hare cleared air considerably if the evidence of the Australian manufacturers who protested against the remission of duties on the imported machinery had been given before tihe board in public, and .1 strongly port the clause in .the bill providing that, except .in certain cases, all evidence fore the board shall be heard in [public. .The carbide industry in Tasmania is small in its way, .but .still a distinctly Australian industry, because all the raw year. materials used in the .manufacture of this article are produced there. .A factory was established for the manufacture of carbide. On one occasion the company was forced - to close down bebill. cause of the dumping into Australia of carbide frorni overseas. The Australian users of carbide preferred to purchase the imported article because of its ness. 'Several deputations waited on tihe Tariff Board, and this industry was on itiie iveisge of collapse when an embargo was placed on its importation; but .the board did not act until it was fully .^satisfied .that, in tihe interests of Australia, this duty was necessary. The ininquiries dustry in Tasmania was - thus given an opportunity to .recover.

The Ausbyrnong, tralian brewers took - advantage of AmeriI can prohibition, and imported large quantities of hops into Australia. Through the instrumentality of the .Tariff Board, the agreement was arrived at between the growers of Hops and brewers that 15 per cent, of the tralian hop requirements should ported, and 85 per cent, purchased from Australian growers. The Tariff Board agreed to police the agreement, but cause of its slack method of policing, hops than were provided for were ported into Australia. As-a consequence, I believe that a number of hopi-growers have determined not to grow hops for year or two. From-my experience of the board., I am satisfied that, although has made .mistakes, it has acted scientiously, and has done what it beIs. lieved - to be right in the interests .of tralian industries. One cannot discuss bill before the House without referring, bushel for wheat. incidentally, to the subject of protection. We have been informed during the last few days that instead 'of the Customs excise receipts falling off, as predicted in tie harvest. by the Treasurer in his budget speech, they increased in July and August ssupthis year by s£5:83,000 over the receipts for the corresponding months of last year. beTwelve months ago the Treasurer estimated that the Customs and excise receipts would decrease, and they increased, and the same thing has happened this",40

146,Mr OKEEFE,WAYS AND MEANS,"I suggest, sir, that if the Tariff Board watches the importations very closely it may 'be able to precheapvent such large - quantities of foreign goods ifrom entering Australia.

His speech last sight, and - every .interjection ,he has made toa day, indicate his burning desire for a return to the days of .long ago, when «veryi t thing was icheap.

But do the honourable members who bend their knees to .the god of of cheapness realise that under .thoso conditions many hundreds of workers lived on the verge of starvation? Although flour was only about one-third of today's price, the workers could not afford to purchase all that they really needed. Have the honourable member for Perth and the honourable member for Swan followed to its logical conclusion their policy of cheapness ? They certainly have been forceful in advocating it, and I have no doubt that if the honourable  here he also would be voicing free trade views as long as you, Mr Speaker, allowed him to do so.",41
147,Mr SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS,I was just thinking of not allowing the honourable member to proceed any further with his fiscal arguments.,42
148,Mr OKEEFE,WAYS AND MEANS,"I find it very difficult, sir, to discuss this bill without pressing my views on our fiscal policy. Honourable' members who spoke on the measure last night were allowed considerable latitude. I trust that the Minister for Trade and Customs, who, so far, has shown by his administration that he is a strong protectionist, will use the Tariff Board as much as possible to. preserve, the interests of our manufacturing industries. I shall vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Maribyrnong for the reason that, if effect is given to it, theinterests, not only of our producers and manufacturers, but also of our consumers, will be protected.",42
149,Mr COOK,WAYS AND MEANS,"Indi) [9.10] - I support the bill. Practically every honourable member of the House believes that a Tariff Board of some kind is necessary. If we abolished the board it would be quite impossible for the Minister for Trade and Customs to deal with the multiplicity of matters with which the board concerns itself without largely increasing the staff of his department. It seems to me that it would be better for us to retain the board than to pass its work over to the Trade and Customs Department. The board has made comprehensive investigations into practically all the primary industries of Australia, and has clone excellent work for many of them. It has been specially helpful to the tobacco industry, and in consequence of the agreement which it was instrumental in making between the BritishAustralasian Tobacco Company and the tobacco-growers, the growers have been saved hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds.",42
150,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,And yet a smaller proportion of Australian tobacco is used here today than in 1911.,42
151,Mr COOK,WAYS AND MEANS,"That is not the fault of the Tariff Board. The board has also been making investigations into the broom-millet industry, which is in a parlous condition. Broom millet costs over £30 a ton to produce, and the price now paid by manufacturers is not anything like that. I understand that it was found to be impracticable to place an embargo on the importation of Italian broom millet, but the Australian industry certainly needs some protection, for the. Italian exchange rate is four ex- to one against us. The recommendation of the Tariff Board in respect to the industry should be submitted to the Minister shortly, if it is not already before him; and I trust that he will do everything in his power to remedy the lamentable position of the growers. The efficacy of the dumping duty on maize from South Africa is open"" to question, but it certainly has conferred a very great benefit upon the Australian maize-growers. The report of the board in the case of the woollen industry ""statesOne of the most important secondary - industries of the Commonwealth is the spinning, weaving, and knitting of wool. This industry has been very materially enlarged since the outbreak of war in 1914. During the war period, and for a year or two afterwards, the Australian woollen and knittoing mills were able to sell their output at prices which returned a good profit, but during the past two years the competition from overseas has been keenly felt. To a certain extent this competition ""has, no doubt, been due to the recent slump in the woollen trade in Great Britain , which forced manufacturers to sell at low prices in order to reduce stocks; but even when this position rights itself there will still remain the great difference in the manufacturing costs in Great Britain and the Commonwealth- a difference occasioned by the heavy overhead charges of the Australian factories owing to the high initial costs elsewhere referred to, and the higher wages consequent upon our higher standard of living. The high cost of manufacturing woollen goods in Australia is,, no doubt, causing the development of this industry to be slower than would otherwise be the case, and the knittin g industry has been particularly subjected to competition from overseas, but in spite of the difficulties in the way, there is every reason to believe that there is a great future for the woollen industry in Australia. protection is necessary for some lines, in order to enable the Australian manufacturers to secure a fair share of the trade. This is, perhaps, the most important item to be considered in the next revision of the tariff. The Federal Parliament has been largely instrumental in starting quite a number of small factories throughout Australia, but the severity of the competition from overseas, coupled with the heavy initial cost, renders imperative the giving of material assistance at a very early date to prevent the wiping out of n number of the mills.",42
152,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,The honourable member realizes that that means that we shall never get away from war prices.,43
153,Mr COOK,WAYS AND MEANS,"That will not necessarily be the result. These industries are costly for some time after their establishment. Arbitration Court awards and other factors have considerably increased the costs in primary industries. I ask for, and I trust that I shall receive, consideration for the broom-growers, who are supplying their product at considerably under cost. The dairying, and many other primary industries, are in the same category. Quite recently we passed a short bill giving a bounty of 4s. a gallon on the export of wine containing 34 per cent, proof spirit. Whilst I am. not opposed to the manufacturers receiving assistance, I conlend that the House should unanimously figrcc to grant a substantial bounty on the export of primary products that arc not profitable at the present time. If sonieing is not done soon, our capital cities will contain three-quarters, instead of one-half, the population of Australia. The Tariff produces a revenue of £55,000,000, but it affects the community, directly and indirectly, to the extent of, at least, £100,000,000 a year in administration and increased and in other ways. Thus it has increased costs to the producers, and as the primary industries arc responsible for 7G per cent, of Australia's wealth production, wo can realise mi important task confronts not only the Tariff Board, but Parliament as well, in placing those industries on a profitable footing. If the tariff were abolished, if arbitration courts were scrapped, and if other costs were reduced, the primary industries would not be found knocking at the door of Parliament for Additional assistance. As the tariff and the Arbitration Court are sanctioned by law, we must continue the practice of giving assistance to primary industries to a greater extent in the future than has been the case in the past.",43
154,Mr A GREEN,WAYS AND MEANS,"Kalgoorlie) [9.22] I support the amendment of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton). I want to put myself right at once by saying that I am a protectionist, even though I differ from some of my colleagues from the State of Western Australia. I recognize, however, that protection has been responsible for many difficulties and problems. The result has been that the people resident in states that have not directly beuefited from the establishment of industries suffer from 'the anomalies that have followed the operation of the tariff. It has been stated that the price of the Sunshine harvester has increased by 100 per cent, compared with the pre-war price. We shall be working along sound lines if we formulate a tariff that will protect us against the cheap labour of other countries. But I must recognize that the workmen who are engaged in the manufacture of harvesters in America are paid as high a rate of wage as is paid to the workmen in Australia who are engaged in similar work.",43
155,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,In'-Canad a the .rate is higher than that in Australia.,43
156,Mr MATHEWS,WAYS AND MEANS,"In Canada the workmen are employed for ten hours a day. Mr A GREEN"" - I do not think that the statement of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) is correct. Whatever argument we may use against the manufacturers in cheaplabour countries, at least we cannot say costs, that the workmen in Canada or the United States of America are receiving a lower rate of wage than is being paid to the workmen in Australia. Yet Canadian imports, are loaded with a duty what that amounts to more than 50 per cent. The Canadian binder in Canada costs £47, but by the time it is landed in Australia it costs £92. Such a tariff should not be necessary for the manufacturers in Australia.",43
157,Mr MATHEWS,WAYS AND MEANS,"What is paid for that binder in New Zealand? Mr A . GREEN i - I i r New Zealand it costs £70. Because Ave as a party believe in the policy of new protection, do not let us shut our eyes to the fact that the manufacturers in the. United States of America, Avho are alwaysopposed to democratic legislation, have made immense fortunes out of theindustry. I can see vested interests being created in Australia. When a. manufacturing, industry is established, in certain electorates, it is not wise for us to say, because it employs a. large number of Australian workmen, that, willy-nilly, we Avill protect it Will - a high which will enable it to raise the price of its machines to a point just beloAv the top of the Avail, and thus bleed the primary producers of Australia. I am a f r a i d that that is the position at-the present time;",43
158,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,"Undoubtedl y it is. Mr A . GREEN - The honourable member for Maribyrnong agrees Will me. The object of his amendment is to see that the consumers do not pay too much to the manufacturers, It is not to view our tariff with smug complacency. We must be A'igilanf. I believe that the amendment will SIIOAV that Ave are keeping an eye on the big manufacturers, Avho are obtaining a. strong hold of' different industries. In effect, we are saying to them, "" Y o u shall not be permitted to rake off big fortunes at the expense of the primary producersand consumers."" The price at which the binder to which I have referred is sold shows that there is room for an investigation of the manufacture of agricultural implements.",44
159,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,It is only fair to saythat the Australian binder can be bought for £15 less than the price of the Massey-Harris binder:,44
160,Mr A GREEN,WAYS AND MEANS,"The price of the Australian binder is- £77. But that does not dispose of the fact that the prices of the harvester and binder have increased, by, roughly, 100 per cent, above the pre-war prices. Although the protectionist vieAV. preponderates in this House, honourable members should. their eyes to the necessity closely scrutinizing the profits that are being ' made by manufacturers. What is the position m regard to the MCKay Harvester Company ? Years ago it was a strugglingcompany in. Ballarat, but since that time a. big business,, of which. Ave may be justly, proud', has grown up. A heavydutyhas been imposed o-n imported machines, and the cost of the local machines-has', in consequence-,, increased, enormously.",44
161,Mr LISTER,WAYS AND MEANS,"The wages, have also in creased, considerably. Mr A . GREEN - That istrue, but they have' not increased in proportion to the cost of the - machines -. The Prime Minister, Avhen.in Sydney some time ago, said that bounties to the primary protariff. Avail ducers, ahd protection to the manufacturers of Australia would not be given without examination. He said that the primary producers must co-operate, and that only the best quality goods were to be exported. Efficiency was to be the keynote. He said that before the m a n u facturers Would receive assistance they must install the latest' machinery in their Avorks, and run them on the mo3t scientific lines. Yet the representations of manufacturers to the T a r if f ' Board,, who apparently put up a for us' plausible case; are listened to, with the result thatfrom time to timethe tariff is raised. That is not the right way to do things. A friendof mine during' the so-called "" rush "" season about this- time last year, obtained employment with the SunshineHarvester Works. He foundi things fair l y slack. On one occasion he was, Avalking. about, looking, for something to do, when he Avas met by the foreman, who said, "" Eor God's sake, keep walking. If you. don't see anything to do, keep on Avalking."" If . that organization had to contend, against competition, such a-condition of things, would, not be possible,, and. .the supervisor Would endeavour to see that, each man. rendered efficient service. That, Would result in the farmers of Australia, being, able, to obtain their agricultural implements at loAver prices - The Prime Minister should see that the factories of this , country are conducted on proper lines-, and that big profits are notmade by a few at the expense of the country. Because of' the imposition' of high duties there is considerable waste in some-direo not shut tions. The f o u r members of"" the Tariff for Board are estimable gentlemen-for their 1 work fou r better men could not' be Australian obtained-bu t it is human nature for a. man, when placed'' in a position of re- f sponsibility and' authority; to make his position as important as possible. I said that if .a policeman desires to being, considered efficient, he must make freing quent arrests. In the same way, diers feel that they must engage in from time to time to test the Jmowledge they have gained by rstudy. (Similarly, the Tariff Board may be disposed to raise the tariff. If it were proved to be uneconomical to import goods into Australia, because everything we required could the produced as cheaply here, I should be strongly in favour of having them made locally, but if our manufacbhe turing establishments are not kept under strict surveillance, and a .high tariff wall dustries. is placed around them, prices will i crease. .M.v. JAOKSON - The [number of binders imported increased by 200 'per cent. Mr A . GREEN - Binder s can still enter Australia from other countries .and shoe compete with the Australian-made article, Western but they would not be able to do so our works were more efficiently managed, or if .the price of the locally-made chine was not 'raised to approximately that df the imported article. The mining industry has gained nothing from States of America. the treoent great war. 'On the contrary, it has lost enormously-£4,000,00 0 i Western Australia .alone. The people terested in that industry are naturally anxious to obtain their as cheaply as possible, .but, though I . represent the only extensive Britain, - a duty was imposed gold-mining district in Australia., not prepared to say that the Australian manufacturer should not have .an opporcause tunity to manufacture the things which those engaged in that industry require. But the tariff imposes more than that let mo give one or two instances to .that not only is .a .duty imposed on imported from other countries when .simicloses lar goods are manufactured in Australia, but it is imposed on .articles which .are pany not made here. Let us take the case of cerned, the Australian Explosi ves Company, whose Later, for reasons which I works are situated in the .district reprenot sented in this House by the .honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister). tralian milling companies are anxious to use Australian explosives, and, consemanage quently, made an arrangement with the Australian Explosives Company to use products. The company desired the raw materials required for the manufacture of explosives should be t is admitted .duty free, and were willi n that case, that the mincompanies should obtain their solexplosives at a cheaper rate. The manuwar facturers and the consumers-the Australian Explosives Company and the mining companies in Western Australia respectively-ha d interests in common in regard io .this matter. If the raw materials referred to were admitted duty free, the quantity of explosives used would be increased. It is, therefore, evident that in this case the Tariff Board is defeating very object for which it was established, namely, to assist Australian in In modern mining practice n - bromo mining salts are used extensively. For same time past these salts have been obtainable only ironi the United States of America. It appears, however, that a ..firm in Great Britain manufactured bromo salts, but when the Golden Horse.Estates -.Company Limited of Australia endeavoured to if obtain supplies from that .firm, it found that the salts of the British macompany contained .only .20 per cent, bromate, as against 40 per cent, in goldthe salts manufactured in the United The bromo salts manufactured in Great 'Britain were used n entirely for photographic purposes, but inbecause of pressure which was brought to bear on the Tariff Board in the direction products of trying to force the mining companies alto obtain their supplies from Great en I am an article 'from America which is not manufactured in Australia at all . Beof that, the gold-mining industry has been penalized. One of the mines on the 'Golden Mile, in Western Australia, ; was shut down for some time aud the show work confined to tributers. Honourable goods members may know that >when a company its mine, and obtains its profits solely fnom tributers, so far .as a comworked proposition is conthe mine does not pay. need now recount, the company decided to 're-open the mine. It obtained Ausan - up-to-date mining man from abroad, in the person of Mr ""Ernest Williams, to its .affairs. He, naturally, desired to have the same system of ventilaits tion as that to which he had been accusthat tomed previously. To that end he endeavoured to obtain some Ventwall tubing- a patent article manufactured in Great Britain . It is made of canvas, so constructed that no acid can possibly eat into, the cauvas. This tubing can be placed in the drives, and ventilation obtained immediately. The system is less costly than the iron pipes ordinarily used. A consignment of it was obtained. The total invoice price was £32 18s. 6d., including London charges. There was 200 feet of it , 8 inches in diameter, at Is. 5£d. per foot, and 200 feet, 10 inches in diameter, at. Is. 8Ad. per foot. The net '£31 13s. 4d., and charges were £ 1 53. 2d., making a total of £ 3 2 18s. 6d. The Customs authorities-whethe r the Tariff Board or not, I do not know-impose d a duty of £ 1 0 3s. Id. That article is not made in Australia, and never can be made here, because ib is covered by a patent. Owing to the action of the Customs authorities, it is impossible to introduce into the Golden Mile mine this new and very necessary improvement in mining practice. tariff in this respect does not study the interests of primary production.",44
162,Mr OKEEFE,WAYS AND MEANS,"Has that matter been before the Tariff Board? Mr A . GREEN - I do not know, but I think it has. The case of the bromo mining salts has at least been before the board, which has given no relief. The ventilating tubing was imported on the l l t h March of this year.",46
163,Mr SPEAKER,WAYS AND MEANS,"It ' is very doubtful whether the honourable member's remarks have any relation to the bill . Mr A . GREEN - The Tariff Board is ineffective, and I am endeavouring to show why I shall vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton). I want to explain to what extent the operations of the board have been ineffective, and why I cannot support the bill as submitted. Rails used in mines furnish another instance of duties that injure the mining industry. On mining rails weighing less than 50 lb. per yard, there is a duty per ton of 45s. British preferential, 70s. intermediate, and 85s. general. L i g h t mining rails, from 12 lb. to 14 l b ., are not made in Australia, so that the duty is . an appreciable tax on mining development. I am a protectionist, but if I were asked to levy a duty of from 45s. to 35s. per ton on mining rails, and to place a burden on the mining industry without helping any other industry in this country, I should not consent to do it . The applicant would have to show me how it would benefit Australia, and would have to disprove my statement that it was a direct impost on the mining industry.",46
164,Mr FENTON,WAYS AND MEANS,"If those rails are not produced in Australia, we will go as a deputation of protectionists to demand the removal of the duty. price was Mr A . GREEN - The same trouble is the London experienced with iron and steel tubes, including boiler tubes, on which the rates of duty are 27^ per cent. British, 35 per cent., intermediate, and 40 per cent, general. The mining industry uses considerable quantities of welded wrought tubes for air-steam solution, and tubes for water-tube boilers, for which local cast-iron and cement pipes are not suitable. All wrought, welded, and soliddrawn tubes of 6 inches or less internal The diameter should be admitted duty free. They aro not manufactured in Australia.",46
165,Mr JACKSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"The honourable member should blame the House, not the Tariff Board. Mr A . GREEN - I am here to blame any one who is responsible.",46
166,Mr JACKSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"This is not a tariff debate. Mr A . GREEN - The honourable member evidently does not want anything to be said in this House that does not accord with his own views. He is, I assume, a protectionist, although I am not quite sure of that. I point out to him that if we have anomalies such as I have 'Mentioned, and no inquiry is made into them, and if we permit unintelligentprotection of this kind, the tariff will become unpopular with the people in the western state, and probably also in Tasmania. In. my state, it is difficult to get people to endorse protection while we ask them to pay duties on goods that are not, ancl are never likely to be, made in Australia. Soft B ritish iron is required for a number of purposes where it is subject to vibration; and Newcastle mild steel is unsuitable. Miners' dril l steel, of hollow section, is now free; but, althpugh the solid-section Newcastle d r ill steel is practically unheard of in Western Australia, even at this date the bulk of mining steel used there pays 44s. per ton duty. The same argument applies to steel shafting, which is all imported, and pays 27£ per cent. duty. I have much more data of a similar kind, but I have quoted sufficient to make my case clear to the House. It is no wonder that in Western Australia and other states where the benefit of the tariff is not secured as it in Victoria and New South Wales-, such loud protests are heard against high duties and unintelligent protection.  Trade aud Customs) [ 9 . 5 4 ] , - I have listened during the last two days to a very long, informative, and comprehensive debate. One honourable member said it wandered from Dan to Beersheba. shall endeavour to sift out from it and reply to edme of the remarks that, have been made. The arguments can be confined practically to two main issues. The one is: Shall we or shall we not support the principle of the Tariff Board; and if not, shall we go back to the old method of having the work done by departmental officers? Honourable members on both sides have, on the whole, approved of the work of the board. There has certainly been some criticism of its methods, and of the principle of having such a board, but none of its personnel. Not one honourable member who has criti cized the principle of having a T a r i ff Board has made any constructive suggestion for putting something into its place.",46
167,Mr OKEEFE,WAYS AND MEANS,"Excep t to go back to the old system.  old method that existed before the Tariff Board was constituted, when departmental officers did exactly what the Tariff Board does today. In view of the complexity of present-day tariff legislation, and that the only alternative is to go back to the method that existed when tariff administration was comparatively simple, it should be generally acknowledged that the principle of having a. Tariff Board is sound, that' the board should be continued,- and made an integral part of our tariff administration. Again, in spite of the very clear, aud definite statements I madestatements that were in conformity with legislation on the statute-book-it has been alleged that the board has power to impose aud remove duties. I must repeat that it has no other powers than to investigate, report, and advise the Minister and the House. It ' is charged with i m portant duties. It may take evidence in support of new duties, which, however, cannot operate until they are imposed by Parliament. When the is new tariff is discussed by this House, I , or my successor in charge of it , will come to the House armed with reports by the board, and those reports will state why, in the opinion of that independent board, certain duties should be decreased or increased as proposed. The board is also charged with the duty of reporting ou proposals for bounties. W it h that part of its work the House is already familiar. II t also has to report on proposals for reciprocal trade between Australia and other countries, and it has done that. But I think the greatest controversy rages round the reports of the board and the decisions of the Minister in regard to two thingsthe classification of items in the tariff, and complaints of dumping and the working of the Industries Preservation Act. Reference has been made to apparently in consistent decisions of the Minister, given presumably on the advice of the board. The long and historic document issued by the Chamber of Commerce in Adelaide, and the report of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, have been mentioned; bub I think the otherwise well-versed commercial gentlemen who were present at those gatherings could not see that if the classification clauses are worked fairly, a machine admitted free in the year 1921-2, because of a kind not made in Australia, may properly, owing to the development of Australian industries, not be admitted free in 1923-4. Complaints have also' been made because the Minister has dared to admit certain machines free for one day, and much misunderstanding has arisen owing to the action thus taken. I have permitted such concessions during the short period that I have been administering this great department. Firms desiring to import a pattern machine, or one of a kind that is not made in Australia, have applied for the classification of that machine under concessional item No. 174 in the tariff, and a remission of duty has been conceded in such cases, conditional upon the importer allowing local engineers to inspect the machine so that if further machines of the type are required they, can be made in Australia by ouarown workmen. I was sorry to items hear, during the course of the debate, even suggestions: of bribery and; corruptralia. tion in connection with the. duties of the Tariff Board. The proper perspective in which, to view the Tariff Board is, that being an independent body, it is not an excrescence on. the body politic, but additional safeguard to. ensure that law is carried out,, and fair play given to very one. For the information of objection, has the House, I may state that during: last month no fewer than 26 deputations has"" have been received, by the board - tha in connection with applications for advised ditional duties and' the classification various articles for redueed duties when, the tariff isunder consideration. reports and recommendations made ingthe month total 188; the applications' classify'the goods they import under-the forremissionof duty on machines-, concessional machinetools, orappliances under item'. 174 numbered F58', theapplf-r cations for admission of minor articles' or material' for useim the manuI shall give-a/ few instances' of tihe appila factureofgoods within' the Gom> cations monwealthunder item 404 totalledthe 40:; amd theapplications' fox classification of goods under item 219, relating'to tools of trade, have n-umbered 23.

During thedebate I' have 1 heard honourable members-, with: a super? ficial knowledge of what is being:' done 1 the Customs Department, even got to the extent o£ saying that every application' received by the Tariff Board should brought before the House for considerathiswas-tion; but when we remember that. 18& reports and recommendations-' been made during one month, it is easyto' imaginewhat would happen abstracting should that; course be taken;, if the on this bill, is an indicationof the interest taken-in tariff matters'generally: to state, most deliberately and emphatia-.number."" cally, that the Minister cannot imposeor reduce duties, apart from the board, and-, upon reportby the board, only with the in the powersgiven by Parliament, and under regulations-. Most of the industry. trouble which arises in 1 with classification' is owing' to the de<partment refusingto classify goodsor  material, under the threeconcessional! of the tariff,, because the goods can be cojnmercially manufactured inAusI am sure honourable members will, agreethat the spirit as well as the., letter, of the law must begiven effect, in relation to articles coming under the concessional items-,- particulaiEly. where' an Australian industries! are in operation the andclaim, thebenefits of the duties' imposed.

In another instance, application was made for the admission duty free of a transformer, but the appli- incation was' refused, because transformers are mamrfactured in' Australia. A third application was' for a remission of duty be upon steel tubular' tramway poles, and refused, asthese articleswere exported in 1896, 1901, 1914, ami 1916. have Another application was toremit a portionof the duty on a plant used for gas' from brown coal, but' the debate request' wasrefused and theordinary duty paid, because such a plant can be I wish manufactured' in Australia. I ' could quote of other instances in which apr plications have been* refused on similar grounds; but Ii am sure it is the-opinion of House that no concessions should be 1 given to the detriment of an Auatsalian: The principle which must connection guide-a: consistent' application of . the regit lastioHs and'.ai proper: interpretation of the 1 tariff, must be based on whether or not the goods concerned can be or are being commercially manufactured in the Commonwealth. In connection with, the administration of the classification clause of the tariff: which has to' be reported, uponby the' board and decided' by the Minister; I desire to say that the. principle, actuating me is that no concessions will be allowed if there is an Australian industry to protect. On the other hand,, if. machines are being imr ported either for primary or secondaryindustries which are. not. manufactured in Australia, and such machines will improve our primary orsecondary production,, it is the policy to. admit them under the. concessional items of the tariff, in. orderto encourage the importation o£ special machinery to assist production. Complaints, have also been made< in con? nexion with the: administration, of the In dustries Preservation) Act,, Although, there, may have, been manyapparent, inconsisr tencies,, I realized,, after, consultation with the officers' of the department, that the applications were still heaping up, and, willithe approval of Cabinet, announced that some simplification of the. difficulty of administering the act was necessary. That pronouncement was,. I think, applauded by the Chambers of Commerce, throughout Australia-,, and the procedureoutlined, was acknowledged, to be a. means o£ greatly simplifying, the. administration of the act and of disposing o£ many of the complaints made during the course of the debate on. behalf of the Chambers' of Commerce: It was-the intention of Parliament when this seat was placed upon the statute-book that no detriment should* be caused to Australian industry by dumping or unfair competition from abroad, and, instead of so strenuously criticizing-the administration of theact, honourable members would do well to realise that my duty is to carry out the will of Parliament as expressed in the statute, the repeal of which alone will rid them of their grievances. ""While the act remains on the statute-book, I shall, in the administration, of it, observe both the spirit and the* letter, of the law, and ensure that no detriment, results to Australian industry if it can. be avoided. In the discharge of my complicated dutiesj. I do not aspect to please everybody, but I do not desire to impose any pinpricks or undue restrictions upon the commercial comr munity. I realise as well as anybody that small irritations may possibly bring the great policy of protection into derision. But the responsibility of ad ministering a department that collects' many millions of pounds worth, of.' duties each year ""can be best shared by a Tariff Board, such as is at present constituted, of independent men, working; in co-operation with the Minister and officers of the department. I fully appreciate the importance of the trust of administering the laws enacted by Parliament for the preservation of our secondary industries,, because in the year 1913, the year, before the outbreak of : the war, the total output of Australian factories was £161,500,000!, and during, the ten years, ended 1922-23, the yearly total increased to the enormoussum of £326,500,000. In other words-,, the output doubled in a decade. I am grateful' for the general support that has been given' during this debate to. the principle! of: a>. tariff board, and I think that when that principle is: adopted permanently, the. difficult administration of the Customs department will be safeguarded so far as is humanly possible. All proposal's for the application of the powers conferred upon me by Parliament, and all suggested .revisions o£ the tariff, must' first be investigated, and reported upon by the board. Itsrecommendations ' will have to pass through the independent hands' of an experienced comptroller-general. Then they will come to meas. theresponsible Minister for decision as. to the action, to be taken. Por the decisions arrived at I shall be answerable to Parliament, which., haa the power to affirm or negative what I have done-. I hope that after the exhaustive' discussion that has taken place, the bill will' have a short and speedy passage through its remaining stages.

AYESMr GREGORY (Swan) [10.30] - I move-That after paragraph (6) the following paragraph be inserted:(c) all matters arising under paragraph (h) of sub-section (1.) of section fifteen of the principal Act, and of any request for the gazettal of importations into Australia for the purpose of bringing such importations within Tellers: the provisions of the Austraian Inustries Preservation Act.

In the past such inquiries have been held in secret and no evidence has been given on oath. Persons should not be able to come before the board and simply make statements, probably to the detriment of some firm or manufacturer. There is no reason why evidence in connection with all such matters should not be made in public and statements taken on oath. I have had the privilege of going through the file in connection with wire netting, and I have read there some extraordinary statements-statement s which the board itself declared to be incredible.. The report of the Tariff Board also contained the statement that British manufacturers were purchasing iron and steel from foreign countries so as to be able to compete more successfully against Australian manufacturers. If any person comes before the board with a statement of that sort it certainly ought to be made on oath. Later I intend to ask the committee to amend sub-clause 5 in the direction of providing that before taking evidence in private the board must be satisfied that it would not be in the public terest to take suchevidence in public. At present it is sufficient if a witness objects on the ground that the evidence is of a confidential nature. The acceptance of statements made by interested persons not on oath is wrong. I have made complaints in connection with the manufacture of wire netting, and I have produced letters from Queensland merchants stating definitely that there is a combine, not only in the manufacture of wire netting, but also in the manufacture of wire and nails. That statement may not be correct. It would be wrong for the Tariff Board to accept any statement like that without an inquiry at which the evidence was given in public and on oath. The public are entitled to know the nature of any complaint, and if the Tariff Board is carrying out its work properly. It looks as if the bill was designed to throw dustin the eyes of the public, and of this Parliament also. The Minister may be satisfied. I am riot. I do not wish to see the continuation of what has happened in the past; with which I shall deal later when we come to consider the constitution of the board. Things have been done in regard to the sulphur duties which will not bear examination. If honourable members could see the list of applications for remissions of duties for one day only they would realise that some people have been able to get concessions, whilst others, not so alert, have been placed at a disadvantage. I wish it to be clearly understood that I am not imputing wrong motives to the Tariff Board.  is getting pretty close to imputing wrong motives.",47
168,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"Thos e who understand the provisions of the act know that certain duties can be removed, and they make representations to the department and have them removed, while others, who do not understand the act, pay duty on goods when the Customs Department informs them that the goods are dutiable.  member insinuating ?",51
169,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"I am not insinuating anything, but making absolute statements.  member to make them plainly.",51
170,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"If the Minister in - vvants plain statements, I shall deal with the sulphur duty. When the tariff was under consideration a deferred duty was imposed on sulphur, on a specific promise made by certain Broken Hill companies. In March of the following year, 1922, the then Minister for Trade and Customs announced that that duty was to be made operative. A committee was appointed, and a minority report of that committee showed that the duty on sulphur would mean an increase in the price of superphosphates to the Australian farmers of 6s. to 7s. a ton.",51
171,Mr FENTON,WAYS AND MEANS,I rise to a point of order. I wish to know whether sulphur duty and superphosphates are relevant to the clause under discussion.,51
172,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"The Minister suggested that I was imputing motives, and asked me to justify the statement that I was making. I wish to explain what really occurred, as a special reason why my amendment should be carried. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr Cook) - I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the clause.",51
173,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,Does the Temporary Chairman rule that my remarks are outside of the subject-matter of the clause?,51
174,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WAYS AND MEANS, They are very close to being so.,51
175,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"If the Temporary Chairman rules that I am out of order. I shall not continue my remarks respecting the subject of sulphur duty, but the M i nister has asked me to - elaborate my case, and I am doing so. The clause provides that all inquiries conducted by the board relating to any revision of the tariff or to any proposal for a bounty shall be held in public. Will-any honourable'member contend that all inquiries respecting the restraint of trade should be held privately, as under the old system, in preference to following the procedure adopted by a proper tribunal?",52
176,Mr FOSTEB,WAYS AND MEANS,Would not matters concerning the restraint of trade be covered by the bill?,52
177,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"No , .only a revision of the tariff or any proposed bounty.",52
178,Mr THOMPSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"I rise to a point of order. I ask your ruling, Mr Temporary Chairman, on the relevancy'of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), which readsPage 1, clause .2, after paragraph b insert the following :(c) All matters .arising under paragraphs d, e, (j, and h' Of sub-section 1 of section 15 of - the - principal act, and of paragraphs a, b, c and d of sub'Seation .2 of section 15 of the prin- grave objections to it . cipal act, and of any request for the gazebtal of importations into Australia for the purpose of bringing such importations within .the provisions of .the Australian Industries Preservation Act. I draw attention :to section 15 of the principal .act, and also toclause .2 of the amending bill , proposed new sub-section 4 of which readsInquiries conducted by the board relating to(a) any - revision of the tariff; or (A) any proposal for .a bounty. Sub-section 1 of section 15 of the p r in cipal act reads(<I) The necessity for new, increased, or - reduced duties, .aud .the deferment of existing or proposed deferred .duties; .(e) the necessity for granting bounties for the encouragement of any - primary or secondary - industry in Australia; (/) the effect of existing bounties or of bounties subsequently granted; (</) any proposal for the application of the British preferential tariff or the intermediate tariff to any part of the British dominions or any foreign country, together with any requests received from Australian producers or exporters in relation to the export of their .goods to any such part or country. I maintain that - paragraphs from d to g are full y covered 'by proposed new subsection 4 of the amending bill, and therefore the amendment of the honourable member for Swan is not in.order. Paragraph h of sub-section 1 of section 15 of the principal act is the only one that is not clearly defined by the honourable member's amendment. Paragraphs a, b, c, and d, sub-6ection 2 ef - section 15 of the principal act, - are covered by proposed new sub-section 4 of clause 2 in the bill-an y revision of the tariff, or any proposal for a bounty. Therefore, with the exception of paragraph 'h of sub-section 1 of section 15, the honourable member's amendment is : already covered by the act, and there is no necessity for it .",52
179,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WAYS AND MEANS," I rule .that the amendment is in order. Mr GREGORY,-If the honourable .member for New - England (Mr Thompson) had read section 11 of the principal act, I do not think that he would 'have risen on a point of order - The impression is given by the bill that grave objections have been taken to the T a r i ff Board, and we must admit that in the past there have been I do not know why the report of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce has not been made public, but I believe that it is drastic. Recently we heard what the Associated Chambers of Commerce had to say at their annual conference in Adelaide, and we have seen complaints in the press in all parts of Australia about the methods .adopted by the T a r i ff Board. The Minister now tells us that the board is to hold public inquiries in relation to iany revision - of the :tariff or proposal for a bounty, and that the evidence given in such inquiries m a y be taken in public. But that is not all we require. We appreciate the fact that in future applications for - revision of the tariff will be in vestigated in public, but ""will the Minister tell me that if complaints are made that a manufacturer is 'taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him by the tariff by charging - unnecessarily high prices for ""his goods, or acting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public, or acting in a manner which results in unnecessarily high prices being charged to the consumer for his goods, the investigation of the complaints will be held in public and the evidence given on oath? The bill does not provide for this,"" whereas my amendment provides that in regard to those important matters in which the public are concerned the board must take evidence in public and that evidence must be given on oath. We have had enough of indoor secret working in the Customs Department. Let the T a r if f - Board come out into the open so that the public may know the grounds upon which the Minister for Trade and Customs has based his decisions. We have not had this in the past. Let us have it in the future.  Trade and Customs) [10.52] - To a great extent the honourable member's amendment is merely a repetition of what the bill provides, as has already been pointed out by the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) in raising his point of order. The honourable member for Swan would have the T a r if f Board hold public inquiries into matters covered by paragraphs d, e, f, aud g of sub-section 1 of section 15; Paragraph d reads as follows: The necessity for new, increased, or reduced duties, and the deferment of existing or proposed deferred duties. As a matter of fact, the bill, provides that inquiries conducted by the board into matters relating to any revision of the tariff are to be held in public. What is, therefore, the difference between the amendment and the proposal in the bill? Paragraph e reads aa follows- The necessity for granting bounties for the encouragement of any primary or secondary industry in Australia. Paragraph / readsThe effect of existing bounties or of bounties subsequently granted. ' The honourable member would have in quiries by the Tarif f Board into these matters held in public, whereas the bil l provides that the investigation of a proposal for a bounty is to be held in public. Where is the difference between the honourable member's proposal and that contained in the bill ? The Government certainly could not accept the honourable member's proposal to have covered by paragraph g investigated in pttblic. Paragraph g reads as follows:Any proposal for the application of the British preferential tariff or the intermediate tariff to any part of the British Dominions or [159] any foreign country, together with, any requests received from Australian producers or exporters in relation to the export of their goods to any such part or country. Reciprocal arrangements with other countries are the responsibility of the Government, and not of the Tariff Board. They are matters of policy, and under no circumstances should preferential trade negotiations be made public u n t i l they f r u c t if y . In the circumstances, I ask the honourable member to withdraw his amendment. He will see that, the proposal of the Government practically covers all the points included in his amendment.",52
180,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,Perth) [10.55] - I sup- ' port the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Gregory).,53
181,Mr BRENNAN,WAYS AND MEANS,Notwithstandin g what has just been said ?,53
182,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,"Undoubtedly . From, the very first I have said that the provision in the bill in regard to inquiries by the Tariff Board is inadequate and needs enlarging. I am sorry to disagree^ with  that the clause covers practically all that is covered by the amendment. As ?. matter of fact, it does not embrace three or four important matters. According to the Minister, it covers paragraph d of sub-section 1 of section 15, which is as follows: The necessity for new, increased, or reduced duties, and the deferment of existing or proposed deferred duties. I contend that matters relating to the '"" deferment of existing or proposed deferred duties "" do not come under the heading of "" revision of the t a r if f . "" The Minister also says that paragraph / , which is as follows : The effect of existing bounties or of bounties subsequently grantedis covered by the words, "" any proposal for a bounty."" It is not. The board may be asked to inquire into the effect of a bounty already in existence and see whether it would be right to continue it , which is quite a different proposition from a proposal for a bounty. I am merely taking the most important matters covered by the amendment. Paragraph h of sub-section 1 of section 15 is as matters follows: Any complaint that a'manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him by the tariff, and in particular in regard to his(i) Charging unnecessarily high prices for . his . goods; or (ii) acting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public; or (iii) acting in a manner which results in unnecessarily high prices being charged to the consumer for his goods. Under which heading in the bill could inquiries by the Tariff Board into such matters come % 'Certainly not under the heading of "" Revision of the Tariff.""",53
183,Mr FOSTEB,WAYS AND MEANS,"Yes , it could, if the investigation resulted in an alteration of the tariff. Mr ' MANN - But the matter for in -"" vestigation by the board is simply to what extent, if anv. a manufacturer has been taking undue advantage of the tariff. There are some, honourable members who' opposed the amendment to the second reading of the bill who must support this amendment, because it touches upon the .very point raised by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton)-that the bill is faulty because the Tariff Board will not afford sufficient protection to the consumer. The amendment would provide opportunity for open inquiry into that aspect of the question. Honourable members have decided that the Tariff Board is to be continued, but surely the most rabid protectionist, if he is sincere and honest, is willing to have the board's investigations as fair and open as possible, and to see that they are not smothered up. Honourable members claim again and again that they want to let the light into everything, that they wish to avoid secrecy,. and that they are quite confident that the Tariff Board will do its work well, with"" beneficial results to the community generally. If they are not afraid of the board doing any harm, why are they afraid to let the daylight into its investigations so that every one may know what is being done, particularly in regard to applications for bounties, subsidies, or higher duties? No one should be permitted to make a demand on the Treasury unless he is prepared to put publicly before the board very sound reasons for his application. On the second reading I explained the admirable plan adopted in India in matters of this kind. The boards operating there resist invasions of the Treasury. People who are asking favours are compelled to establish their claims as clearly 08 possible, and every opportunity is given for cross-examination. Here, however, such an important matter as a charge against a manufacturer of exploiting the public, or restraining trade, or charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods, is apparently to be investigated in private,, without taking evidence on oath, or without the protection afforded by submitting the witnesses to cross-examination. It will be a grave mistake to reject the amendment. If we are to have a board we should endeavour to make it as per-, feet as possible, and to place it above reproach. That can be done in no better, way than by making its business public.  Trade and Customs) [11.1] - The Government desires to do everything possible to make the board a workable machine, but it cannot possibly accept the amendment of the honourable member for Swan in so far as it refers to the - administration of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. It would be inrproper to compel the Tariff Board to hold such inquiries in public, for the reason that the evidence consists .almost altogether of the invoices.and private documents of the firms concerned. The committee must accept the assurance of the responsible Minister that the administration of the board i u that respect will be fair. I have already announced that in future investigations by the board both sides will be given an opportunity to submit their views before a dumping duty is imposed. I am willing to accept the amendment only in so far as ib relates to paragraph h of sub-section 1 of section 15.",54
184,Mr THOMPSON,WAYS AND MEANS,"New England) [11.3] - In view of that statement, it appears to me that the best course for the honourable member for Swan to pursue would be to withdraw his amendment and accept one which I propose to move. If he does so a good deal of time will be saved. My proposed amendment reads as follows: After the word "" bounty "" insert(c) Any proposal for improving the condition of any primary or secondary industry; or (d) Any complaints made under paragraph h of sub-section 1 of section 15. If that were adopted it would strengthen the bill, and make the board much more effective.",54
185,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"Swan) [ 1 1 . 4 ] - I am quite prepared to withdraw my amendment in so far as it relates to paragraphs d, e, f , and g of sub-section 1 of section 15, but I cannot see my way clear to withdraw that part of it which deals with the administration of the anti-dumping sections of the Australian Industries Preservation Act . My experience of the administration of those sections proves conclusively to me that it will be in the best interests of the public if all such inquiries by the board are made with open doors, and I must certainly insist that the evidence shall be given on oath. I do not desire to repeat the details of the board's investigations into the importation of wire netting, but from information which has recently been obtained through the. High Commissioner's Office, there is no doubt whatever that the board acted on representations made by Mr MCDougall to the effect that all the manufacturers of wire netting, except Rylands Limited, purchased their iron and steel rods at very low. prices from Germany. I do not know what justification there was for that statement, but I know that although the board acted upon it , it reported, in connection with an earlier inquiry, that it could not accept Mr MCDougall's statements for they appeared to be in credible. Such a position could not have arisen if the board-had had sworn evidence instead of unsubstantiated statements to act upon. Firms which desire the i m position of a dumping duty should be .compelled to state their reasons in public and on oath. It would then be found that the work of the board would - be much more highly appreciated than it is now. At present the whole commercial - world of Australia is in high dudgeon about the manner in. which the Australian In dustries Preservation Act is being administered. Surely it is only reasonable to compel the board to inform an importer what goods he may import and what duties he nrnst pay upon his importations.  Trade and Customs) [11.8] - The Governi ment does not propose to accept any part public. of the amendment by the honourable member for Swan, but is willing to accept the proposed amendment of the honourable member for New England.",54
186,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,"Perth) [11.9] - Al - dentially. . though I suppose the amendment of the honourable member for Swan will be defeated, I must make still another test against'the manner in which the « dumping sections of the Australian In dustries' Preservation Act are being ministered. I know of cases in which satisfied. . officers of the Customs Department have been sent to rival firms to get in formation, as a result, of which anti-dumping duties have been imposed. That is not right. Some of the methods employed in the past have been extraordinary. Probably some officer who has not acted on instructions, but whose zeal has outrun his discretion and his judgment, has been responsible. A man who brings goods into Australia should not be condemned on evidence tendered privately by his competitor in the business. The whole matter should be decided in the open, and those concerned should have a chance to rebut the evidence that has been given against them. I know that such cases have occurred. If they are repeated there will be a continuance of the discontent that has been caused by the operation of the act. It is a common thing for a particular article to be gazetted on facts allegedly disclosed by the invoice, and the gazettal notice includes goods of that description ahd quality which may come in at any future time. One set of goods may have a particular feature that does not apply to subsequent importations. We know that there have been instances in which goods in one shipment have been landed in different states, and the anti-dumping duty, has been imposed on them in some states and not in others. Such things could not happen if the in quiries were held in public. It would be a very grave mistake to try to burke the issue. Even though the Minister and the board are sincere in their belief that this procedure is necessary, there is uo need to display frantic haste. The board sometimes takes three or four months to . arrive at a decision, and the goods are sold before it is given. It would redound to the credit of the board, and strengthen the reputation of the M in s t e r , if the investigations were held in",55

Mr 'PBATTEN (Martin-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.28]-The Government proposes to retain the original words of the act .in confining the operations of the Tariff Board to' "" matters relating to the tariff.""

In that case there is no necessity for the paragraph to which I have drawn attention. Mr R. GEEEN (Richmond) [11.30] The honourable member for Perth (Mr. Mann) either did not hear, or he failed to take note of, the remarks made in this chamber during the Second reading debate in reference to the Tariff Board looking into something altogether outside the tariff. Had the board not been able to do that, itcould not have made that inquiry into the tobacco industry which brought about good results to the ' tobacco growers. The honourable member's objection toi the amendment is that the board will not have power to inquire into matters such as I have mentioned; bub if the amendment submitted by the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) is agreed to, the board will have power to inquire into the operations of combines acting detrimentally to trade.

My object is to prevent any possibility of requests being made to the board in a secretive way, and of such requests being approved by the board. As we have gone to the length of appointing a permanent tribunal to investigate matters of the greatest importance to the community, the interests of every one-should be full y safeguarded. If the board is to decide that inquiries are to be held in camera, the public should know why inquiries are to be so held, and the persons making applications should go before the board and publicly state their reasons. If that is done, inquiries will be conducted on a proper basis, and a good deal of the suspicion which at present exists, particularly in relation to manufacturers' requests, will be removed.  Trade and Customs) [11.38] - I trust the honourable member will not press the amendment, as a slight amendment has already been made in proposed new section 5 of - clause 2.

The board as at present constituted may do all that is desired, but we do not know what .is likely to happen in the future, and there may be a tendency to a relaxation of effort. I think the amendment is necessary, and I intend to press it. Amendment negatived.",57
197,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,"Perth) [11.40] - I move That the following new sub-section be added:- "" (6)The board'shall by public advertisement^give notice of its intention to hold any inquiry under 'this section and of the subject of such inquiry and the'time and 'place at which it shall be held.; and shall give reasonable opportunity to any party interested to be present, to produce evidence and to be heard Proin connection with the subject of the inquiry."" I .do not think it necessary to discuss at length the advantages to be - derived from the adoption of the amendment. It is useless to hold inquiries unless the time and place at which they are to be held' are publicly advertised. I trust the M in ister will see his way clear to accept this, amendment, to which, objection cannot reasonably, be ""taken. My amendment is copied fro m an American statute.  Trade and Customs) [11.41] - The drafting of .this amendment is somewhat in definite, but the Government .is prepared to accept it in substance.

198,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,"Perth) [11.42] - As the  is one which meets with my approval, I move That the following new sub-section be added :- "" (6) The board shall, by advertisement published in two newspapers circulating in the state in which the inquiry -'s to be held, give reasonable notice of its intention to hold any inquiry under this section, the subject of the inquiry and the 'time and place at which the inquiry is to be held.""

200,Mr A GREEN,WAYS AND MEANS,"Kalgoorlie) [11.45]. - I move That the following' words be added to the clause :- "" And (b) by adding at the end of sub-section 3 thereof the following proviso :' Provided -'that where the board finds that the incidence of any particular duty results in excessive prices to the consumer, havingregard to the cost of production, including wages, they shall immediately report accordingly to the Minister'."" It is a simple amendment, .and is framed with the object of giving effect to a suggestion made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton). It may be said that paragraph h of section 15 of the principal act covers the point; but, in my opinion, it - does not. Under the principal act the Minister shall refer to the board-for inquiry and report certain matters, including questions relating to goods which are sold at unnecessarily high prices. It is imperative that the board should immediately report such cases to the Ministerj but that is unnecessary under the paragraph of the principal act which I have mentioned, otherwise many of the complaints made by Western Australian representatives would without foundation. It is true that the board is necessarily an active body, but the onus of reporting such matters should rest with the board. It should be its duty to see that any particular duty does not result in excessively high prices being charged, and should report to the Minister, whereas under the existing law the Minister has t'o not if y the board. To provide for the correct lettering of the proposed new paragraph it will be necessary to insert the letter a after "" amended"" in the first line of the clause, and I move accordingly.",58

202,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,"Perth) [12.16 a.m.] - I move That the word "" repealed "" be left out, a view - to insert in lieu thereof the words "" amended by omiying the word ' two,' and inserting in lieu thereof the word ' six ' . "" If the amendment is passed, the act will remain in force for another three years. The clause states that section 37 of the principal act is repealed, and this means that the act is to be made perpetual, and any limitation upon its duration is to be removed. Tho board is-to be appointed in perpetuity. I think that is wrong. The object of the amendment is that the board shall exist for three years from March next. The period of the act was originally two years, and last year it was extended for one year. The amendment proposes to give the board another three years of life. It is a great mistake for the board to be appointed a permanent institution, which cannot be changed except by an amending act. amendment is passed the board will come up for review in three and a half years' time, and Parliament will - then be able to judge the working of the amendments that have been"" agreed to to-night.  Trade and Customs) [12.18 a.m.] - The Government cannot accept the amendment. I believe that a majority of the members of the committee are agreed that the Tariff Board shall be an integral part of the administration of the Trade and Customs Department. To a certain extent the object of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) will be met by a new clause which I propose to insert in the bill, limiting the appointment of the members of the board to three years T ask the committee to reject the amendment.  a.m.] - Notwithstandin g the explanation given by the Minister, I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth, not because I believe that the usefulness of this board will be ended in three years' time, as very likely it will continue for a much longer period, but because it is desirable that the constitution of the board shall be reviewed at the end of three years. If an indefinite period of tenure is fixed the operations of the board may not be reis repealed. viewed by this Parliament.",59
203,Mr R GREEN,WAYS AND MEANS,"Richmond) [12.20 a.m.] - I support the amendment, be with cause, if passed, it will give the committee an opportunity to further discuss the operations of the board at the end of. three years. Under the new clause proposed to be inserted by ihe Minister, at the end of three years the appointment of the members of the board will be reviewed by the Governor in Council, in other words, by Cabinet, and Parliament will not hav,e a further opportunity of discussing the administration of the Tariff Board. It is very desirable that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth should be agreed to.",59
204,Mr DUNCAN,WAYS AND MEANS,"HUGHES (Boothby) [12.21 a.m.] - I also support the amendment' moved by the honourable memSer for Perth. When the original Tariff Board Bill was before this Parliament, If the the intention was that the act should continue in force for a period of two years, "" and no longer."" That provision was not' in the original bill, but was an amendment sent back by the Senate and accepted. As the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) has pointed out, the period provided for in the original bill has already been extended for a third year. The argument that capable men would not be available for appointment if the period was limited to two years only was thrashed out at that time, and the fact that men who are not personally criticized were available makes it obvious that they will still be available. But the alteration effected by clause 2 in regard to public investigations makes a considerable difference to the original act. It is an attempt, to meet one of the chief objections urged against the board-that it operates secretly, and, therefore, is unlikely to get both sides of any question put before it . I suggest that before the act is permanently extended, the effect of this alteration should be reviewed, particularly because as every one knows, there has been, rightly or wrongly, a good deal of criticism of the board, not only by the representatives of the Associated Chambers of Commercej but also by many other people. Furthermore, as greater, stability is brought about in international trading relations, and there is a gradualre-adjustment of international, exchanges, the work of the board will grow less. fully agree with the honourable member for Perth that it would be well to extend the act for three years only, and thus afford - Parliament an opportunity to see whether the amended provisions will make it more workable than it is at present. Mr Bruce. (Flinders-Prime Minis-. ter).[12.22 a.m.] - There seems to be some misunderstanding as to the real effect of the present proposal. During the three years the Tariff Board has been in operation, we have had an opportunity to see how it functions as an integral part of the fiscal system of the Commonwealth. Surely by now Parliament is in a position to make up its mind one way or another, as to whether it should make the Tariff Board as a permanent part of the Commonwealth's fiscal system, or discontinue it . There seems to be an impression that. Parliament's position will be safeguarded by l i m it i ng the life of the board to a further three years, but I suggest that it will make no difference to Parliament whether the board is made a permanent institution, or limited to a period of three years, unless it is contended that Parliament is not competent to do what is necessary in framing amending legislation. If in every measure passed we provide for an experimental period because we have not sufficient f a it h in our ability to take steps to amend it or annul it if necessary, we shall not get very far with our legislation. The mere fact that at the end of three years the Tariff Board must again come up for discussion would not be any safeguard to Parliament, nor should it be regarded as a factor to be taken into consideration. Surely the honourable member knows very well that so long as he is in this House lie need not wait for the expiration of three years to call attention to any action taken by the Tariff Board which does not meet with his approval. On the Estimates and on other occasions he can do so. It is always. open to honourable members to draw attention to what has been done by the T a r i ff Board, and if Parliament has made, a mistake,, it can be rectified. The honourable member for Perth is adopting a course which is not flattering to Parliament if he holds the view that after three years' experience of the operations of the Tariff Board we are not capable of stating definitely whether the board should become a perI manent part of our fiscal system, or be supplanted by something else.",59
205,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,"Perth) [12.27 a.m.] Had the Tariff Board, when established, been given the perpetual character which it is now proposed to give to it , what chance would there have been to introducethe amendments, contained in the bill now under discussion.? The very discussionthat has taken place during the last two> days shows that the position, is very, different when a. bill comes up for review. It is true that honourable members can c r it i cize the actions of the board from time to time, but that criticism may be disregarded by the Government. ""When a-bill has come up for reviewthe criticism levelled against it very often results in the passing of important amendments.",60
206,Mr BRUCE,WAYS AND MEANS,"If the majorit y of the House wants anything; done, of course,, the Government must do it .",60
207,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,"As tariff questions are regarded as non-party matters, it is not easy to ascertain whether there is a majority in the House, including honourable members on both sides, favourable to an amendment of an act. That fact can only be disclosed when a. vote is taken, as votes have been taken to-night on the bill. The Prime Minister says that surely we have had time to try the board, and express our satisfaction or dissatisfaction with it . As a matter of-fact, we have tried it , and have determined that certain important amendments of the system are necessary. There has been a great deal of. criticism of the board outside this House. The M i n ten) says that he will endeavour. to see that the board works better in future, and I ' have no doubt he will do his .best to remove the causes of complaint, but the fact that grave complaints have been made cannot be overlooked. I understand that the Minister has had a special report from the Melboiirne Chamber of Commerce objecting to the board and its operations. We know nothing of that report. ",60
208,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,"I understood that the Minister said, earlier in the evening, in reply to the honourable member for Swan, that he had received such a report.",60
209,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,That is what I understood.,61
210,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,"The Minister says that he will try to remove the causes of complaint. Let him prove that he can do so. I believe that he will try , but if in face of the complaints made, and before he has proved conclusively to the commercial community that he can remove the objections they have raised, he proposes to keep the board in perpetuity, he will be flouting criticism.",61
211,Mr BRUCE,WAYS AND MEANS,Surely a period of three years is too long.,61
212,Mr MANN,WAYS AND MEANS,"I should not mind making the period two years, but that would bring the review of the act into the first year of a new Parliament, before normal conditions prevail in that Parliament. It might be said that it is not fair to submitsuch an important question to a number of new members of Parliament, lacking experience in the working of the board. In view of all that has occurred, there is ample justification for my proposal. We should limit the period of life of the board, if only for the purpose of providing an opportunity to discuss the way in which it will exercise the new powers which are being conferred upon it .",61
213,Mr WHITSITT,WAYS AND MEANS,"Darwin) [12.31 a.m.]. Gregory, - The honourable member for Perth (Mr . Mann) is opposed to the Tariff Board lock, stock, and barrel, and has moved Atkinson, L. his amendment simply to harass and Bruce, S. M. worry it . We should have a Tariff Board Cameron, D. working in conjunction with our Customs Cameron, M. Department. If it does not do as it Forde, F. M. should, we shall have periodical opporFoster. R. W. tunities of altering its personnel. The Francis, F. honourable member for Perth can at any Francis, J. time bring in a private bill to abolish the Oardner, S. L. board, and I have.no doubt that, if he Green, thought he could get a majority of members to support it , he would not hesitate to do so. He does not desire any one with the Australian spirit to inquire into the - conditions under which foreignmanufactured goods are admitted to Australia. That such goods are produced by I movepoorly-fed and thinly-clad people with a' low standard of living is nothing to him ; but we want men of integrity and true Australian sentiment to see that our fiscal policy is made effective. I shall not swallow the arguments of the honourable member for Perth, and I shall vote against his amendment. [160] Mr It . GREEN (Richmond) [12.34 a.m.] - Accordin g to the honourable member for Darwin, the only objection to the amendment is that it has been moved by a free trader, but that is not a valid objection. I am not a free trader, but I support the amendment. It is all very well to discuss the rights which the honourable member for Perth has as a private member, but the honourable member for Darwin knows that, if a private bill to abolish the Tariff Board were introduced, it would be treated by the Government with the same lack of consideration that was accorded earlier in this sitting to private members' business that is on the business, paper. Although I consider that a tariff board is necessary, I believe that provision should be made for a proper review of its operations without fear of the application of the guillotine.

Mr J. FRANCIS - Is this a motion of - want of confidence in the board?",61
215,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"Absolutely . Apar t from the question of economy, three members are quite sufficient to carry on the work of the board. When the act was introduced, and it was known what the functions of the board would be, three members were appointed. Political pressure, however, led to a fourth appointment. I do not think that four members are necessary. I am seeking to have the board made entirely independent of the department. Whilst sending its reports to, and being subject to the control of, the Minister, it should be responsible to this Parliament, and give advice to Parliament from time to time in regard to the incidence of the Tariff Act. It should also be entirely representative of the various industries of Australia. If we had a chairman with judicial experience, many of the troubles that we have experienced in the past would be obviated.",62
216,Mr FORDE,WAYS AND MEANS,Does the honourable member propose to cut out the representative of the primary industries ?,62
217,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,I want to have only three members. Mr J. FRANCIS - The honourable member is a free trade diehard.,62
218,Mr GREGORY,WAYS AND MEANS,"I should like to deal with many matters, but as the hour is so late I shall not do so. It is a scandal that we should be asked to deal with an important measure like this at such an hour, particularly as we have .to be here again at 11 o'clock this morning. I do nob think that any honourable member can claim that we have unduly delayed the passage of the measure. I leave it to the committee to say whether it is satisfied with the board as at present constituted., or whether it is prepared to give us a board that will be more representative of the various industries of Australia.",62
219,Mr MAKIN,WAYS AND MEANS,"Hindmarsh) [12.45 a.m.]. - The attitude of honourable members in the corner opposite is indeed surprising. Last session they desired the appointment of a fourth member to the board, their long suit on that being the interests of the primary It is quite evident from his remarks that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) would sacrifice the representative of the primary producers on the board. I draw attention to the fact that not a single member of the Country party rose to his feet to protect the interests of the primary producers. I purposely waited for some honourable member opposite to rise, but I could not allow the matter to go to a vote when they declined to avail themselves of the opportunity to do so. Their action proves that they have no desire to conserve the interests of the primary producer. They profess an interest i u his welfare merely with the idea of tickling the ears of the man on the land. It has been left to the members of the Labour party to come to the assistance of the primary producers.",62
220,Mr R GREEN,WAYS AND MEANS,"The honourable member should have waited u n t i l a vote had been taken on the amendment.  Trade and Customs) [12.50 a.m.] - It is perfectly obvious to every member of the committee that the amendment was deliberately framed to keep. the - primary producer off the T a r i ff Board. As Minister in charge of the bill, I let the matter pass, and had it not been for the intervention of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr M a k in ) the amendment would have been rejected, only the mover voting in its favour. On behalf of the Government, I say that the amendment strikes at the fundamentals of the bill, and cannot therefore, in any circumstances, be accepted.",62
