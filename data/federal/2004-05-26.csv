It is a classic example but not walking the walk. I notice the member for Oxley in the Main Queenslander; do something with your Queensland funding-noting the fact that they have $400 put some more money into marketing the tourism is a very good thing for Australia and that the In classic Labor Party style, the Labor Party invite those Labor members that follow me tion and stand up to Sandra Nori in New South tell your state Labor mates to not withdraw government's commitment and, in particular, tourism industry.

The reality is that NA this tourism minister has done a lot to ensure the tourism industry.

They and all members of the Howard government have the contribution that flows to the Australian profitable tourism industry. In particular, I and diligent work of Matt Hingerty, Holly and as Ken Boundy and Olivia Wirth at the ATC. the Gold Coast Tourism Bureau and the new CEO, of the tourism industry to ensure that the fuoff the $600 million that is flowing into the a very rosy future indeed.

I put thought so much of the industry and this Committee to be debated. It could not even get a I think we ought to take some of the member with a grain of salt. ministers who have been in this portfolio over a ought not to throw stones.

The crowning achievement here is the industry. I note the objectives set out for Tourto influence people to travel to Australia, includthat has been a long standing objective of Labor there you go. The second principal obNA jective is to influence people travelling to have been doing that in my community for over Melbourne and down the Great Ocean Road to seat of Corio but also the seat of Corangamite. The third principal objective set out for travel throughout Australia, including for events. to get Australians out of the cities and enjoying platform of successive state and federal governments principal objective set out in the legislation Australia. The industry has been talking about riod of time. The fifth objective is to help tourism. I do not think there would be anybody on jection to any of the objectives that are set member for Moncrieff, the honourable members able to put the whiteboard up and I would say the lid off a bottle of red wine than we would that is not flattering any of us. For the benefit of the House, I have to talk to come to this particular position. The honourable plan for Australian tourism was first mooted ment released The 10 year plan for tourism: dustry that it would publish the green paper 2002, as I understand it. But we got to December all. Thirteen months later, the green paper entitled emerged. That was released in June 2003 and discussion paper, finally the Medium to long was released. I cannot believe the breathtaking incompetence length of time that it took the government through gestation. As I said, here we have legislation members on both sides of the House, over a the time the honourable member for Oxley had some 18 months after the publication of the something about the industry. So when the cuses Labor of not caring about this industry, This is a very important industry to Australia that it generates-in excess of $17 billion are some 550,000 Australians who derive their industry also dovetails quite nicely with many where some towns are playing off their industrial ties and developing tourism assets around those ture, and there have been very strong attempts Australia to also travel throughout Australia. We 20 years, attempting to get the tourists out of take in some of the delights of not only my Tourism Australia is to influence Australians to I thought it was fairly obvious that we ought their own environment. That has been a major of all political persuasions. The fourth is to help foster a sustainable tourism industry in the need for sustainability over a very long peincrease the economic benefits to Australia from this side of the House who would have any obout in this legislation. Indeed, the honourable opposite, my colleague here and I would be that no sooner had the member for Oxley lifted have those five objectives up on the board. And about the time it has taken for the government member for Moncrieff said that this grand in November 2001. In May 2002, the governa discussion paper, with the promise to the inand have the white paper put to bed by December 2002 and we had not got the white paper at A medium to long term strategy for tourism in November 2003, 18 months after the initial term strategy for tourism: a tourism white paper of the government. I cannot believe the to bring this particular white paper and policy with an objective list that the honourable bottle of wine, could have had up on the wall by popped the cork on the red.
