1,Mr SPEAXBB,Unknown,"Eon. W. Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. PETITION. Mr TUDOR presented a petition from persons resident in Australia, protesting against the forcible deportation for military service overseas of Italians resident in the Commonwealth and praying that no such deportation may take place, bnt that these Italians may be allowed to naturalize themselves, if they so desire. Petition received and read. TH E OPENING PRATER. Mr Watt, on hehalf of the Standing Orders Committee, presented the following report, which was ordered to be read by the Clerk:The Standing Committee on Standing Orders has the honour to report to your honourable Honse as follows :I . The Committee reoommends to the House of Representatives that the initial Prayer read at the opening of the .House be amended &o ns to read as follows :Almighty God, we humbly beseeoh Thee to vouchsafe Thy blessing upon this Parliament.' Direct and prosper onr deliberations to the advancement of Thy glory, and the true welfare of 'the people of Australia. II . The Committee further recommends that, during the continuance of the War, the following additional Prayer be read before the Lord's Prayer :Strengthen, O Lord, the sailors and soldiers of our Commonwealth, our Empire, and our Allies; protect them from all clangers; give them speedy victory over their nnd grant that an honourable and a lasting peace may result from their valour and their sacrifices. Motion (by Mr Watt ) agreed toTliat the report be considered forthwith. Motion (by Mr Watt ) proposedTliat the report be adopted.",21
2,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,Batman) [3.5] - I do not approve of this matter being dealt with until honourable members have had an opportunity to consider the report.,22
3,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,The report embodies the unanimous recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee.,22
4,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,That does not sufficiently influence my mind.,22
5,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The honourable member is not on the Committee.,22
6,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I am not on the Committee. There is in the report the suggestion-perhap s I may flatter myself that it is due to an interjection made me-that we shall embody in the opening prayer a petition for peace. I am glad to know that my suggestion, even though made in a disorderly way, has received favourable consideration by the Standing Orders Committee. But I should like to more time for considering the report of the Committee before endorsing the prayer which they recommend. We are to be asked to pyjay that victory may be achieved by the Allied arms.",22
7,Mr BOYD,Unknown,The honourable member surely wants that?,22
8,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Does the honourable traitors; member desire that we shall be defeated,22
9,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I have already, this Chamber, protested against any resoligious lution declaring that the war shall not end in any other way than by a victory the Allied arms. I am favourable to its being ended by the peaceful negotiations of sane and reasonable men; I am not favourable to the continuation of the until such victory has been gained as seems to be contemplated in the proposed prayer. I am profoundly convinced that two great disasters menace the worldone being that Prussian militarism may end the war by force of arms, and the other that militarism other than Prussian may temporarily end the war by force of arms. So far from holding the view enemies; which some have expressed, that peace can be brought into the world by military victory, I think that had honourable members enlightened their minds by even a W. ELLIO T JOHNSON, cursory study of history, they would be Chairman. aware that a lasting peace has never been, and is never likely to be, achieved by foree of arms.",22
10,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,There was peace after the battle of Waterloo.,22
11,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Yes ; for a time. But that battle and preceding battles laid "" the foundation of Prussian militarism. They joined the limbs and wings of the great Prussian military system. At that time, we were sympathetic with, and lent our support to the Prussian arms. Whatever other results may have followed from those battles, it is abundantly clear that they stimulated the growth of Prussian militarism. Many years later came the Franco-Prussian War, out of which grew in France the party of la revanche.^ It is that party of revenge, working in the by midst of a great Democracy, together with the Prussian militarism working on its own, which has been a very potent factor in bringing about the present war. I would welcome an amendment of the Standing Orders which would permit us offer up a prayer for peace, but I would ask that that prayer be offered up in the Christian spirit, and not in any pagan spirit. We are developing a state of mind in regard to this war in which Christianity is going out of fashion. The Minister for Defence is permitted to say, and does say amidst the applause of his followers, that he brackets together pacifists and in other words, that he brackets ? traitors with those who are still proud to in follow without regard for any _ resectionalism or denominationalism, the principles laid down by the founder of of Christianity.. I protest against this pagan opinion that peace is to be brought into the world by the crude and cruel method of force of arms, and I oppose war any amendment to the Standing Orders which will alter the prayer offered up in this House at the commencement of our deliberations in any direction which is not consistent with the faith of the great majority of honourable members of this Chamber, namely, the Christian faith.",22
12,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Capricornia) [3.12]:-I am surprised that the Acting Prime Minister' has departed from 'his very admirable procedure in fully acquainting honourable members as to the business of the House, and at no time, so far as I have observed, since the 'departure of the Prime Minister has he endeavoured to take advantage of hdn>orable 'members by bringing forward such a measure as au important amendment of the Standing Orders without giving due-notice.",23
13,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I am merely the mouthpiece for the time being of the Standing Orders Committee, because the Chairman of that Committee is Mr Speaker, who is. in the chair.",23
14,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"If the Acting Prime Minister had followed his usual practice, and placed this motion on the business paper, I am sure the honourable member for Batman, who has felt it his duty to draw attention to the strange happenings with regard to Christianity, would possibly not have made his speech, o'r might have made it in a somewhat different What must'appeal to'all honourable members is the fact'that the proposed prayer 'contains all 'appear on 'behalf of 'our'sol' 'diers and sailors who '-are 'at the Frontand I 'da're say that its Wording will be 'found in 'almost any Church service 'during 'a - time of - war-that is, a prayer for - victory over 'our enemies. Mr 'JOWETT - Quite right, too!",23
15,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I cannot help drawing the attention of the honourable member to the fact that the same prayer is probably littered throughout the churches of all the belligerent nations'today, and though I - do n'o't-'desire to introduce any humour into ! a debate on what ought really to be a very : serious matter, I cannot help thinking of a most humorous story concerning the Prime Minister's 'reference to the difficulty that must face the Almighty in deciding which prayer he ought to grant. Mr J""OWETT - If our enemies pray for their soldiers, why'should we not do so?",23
16,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I am sure the honourable member for Batman does not take any exceptiou to that suggestion.,23
17,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Non e whatever; I dorse it absolutely. Mr HIGGS . ^ I hope that the speech of the honourable' member for Batman will not be distorted by any one so as to give it an unworthy aspect never intended - by the honourable member. Evidently 'the Ministerial members .who are on 'the Standing Orders Committee at last - realise the position-becaus e now they are 'asking'the Almighty to grant an honourable arid lasting peace as a'result of the valour and sacrifices of our'soldiers and sailors. ' Mr TUDOR (Yarra) [3.16] - As a member of the Standing Orders Committee, I did not dream that there would be any discussion on this .matter. When the existing prayer .was adopted by our first Parliament, there was no discussion upon it.",23
18,Mr WATT,Unknown,"And there was no notice given, either.",23
19,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I certainly thought that the matter would have gone through without discussion. It is not a nice subject to debate; it is not easy for any person to claim to be an authority as to the form in which a prayer should be offered; but : that which has been 'recommended to the House today is a more fitting one than that which has been in use hitherto, even way - apart from the second portion, in which there is an appeal that an honourable and lasting peace may soon be obtained.",23
20,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,And the honourable inem-ber also hopes for victory.,23
21,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do; but I have no desire to enter into any discussion on 'that matter. I regret exceedingly that there has been any discussion, and I feel that if tliere is any great body of feeling in the House against the proposed alteration, the better course would be to refer the prayer back to the Standing Orders ^Committee.",23
22,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,"On e would suppose' that it was a matter of urgency, seeing the way in which it is sought to rush it through.",23
23,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not think that there is any such desire. I do not think that ""any member of the'Standing Orders Committee realized that the matter Would be discussed.",23
24,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Barrier) [3.1S] The proposed alteration of the prayer should be discussed. If , as most people believe, there is an Omnipotent Power who controls the destinies of mankind, it is inludicrous, absurd, and 'even insulting, to address a prayer to Him asking Him to give victory to one set of combatants as against the other in this war.",23
25,Mr WATT,Unknown,Is not that an argument against prayer as a whole?,24
26,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"To my mind it is not. If there is an Omnipotent Power who. controls the destinies of mankind, then the cataclysm in which all mankind is now engaged has come about with the cognisance, and even at the wish, of Providence. Some schools of thought in Australia and elsewhere tell us that it has. overwhelmed humanity as a - punishment. I do not hazard an opinion as to whether it is a punishment of the people for their particular mode of life, or falling away from the Throne of Grace; but if honourable, members believe that there is a Divine Power which guides the destinies of man, it is a piece of impertinence on the part of any portion of humanity to addressa prayer or petition similar to that pro-: posed, suggesting to the Almighty how Me should conduct His business.",24
27,Mr WATT,Unknown,"You will not find one religion, in the world support that view>",24
28,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Eve n if that be, so, it does not prove that the idea is wrong.",24
29,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Perhaps not, but that is plain.",24
30,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Before my time - and possibly after-people , have had anc}. expressed, or may continue to have and, express, opinions or ideas contrary tc*, the opinions held by the majority of humanity at a given time, so that such criticism is of no avail. If there, is. Omnipotent Being who looks after the destinies of human kind, war or any. other calamity that afflicts mankind will end in a way satisfactory to. that Omnipotent Be^ng, irrespective of the wishes of manr kind'.",24
31,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"If that is the honourable member's view, he does not believe in the efficacy of prayer at all ?",24
32,Mr CONJSIDINE,Unknown,"J think the honourable member believes, in the sentiment expressed by, perhaps, a greater than he a long time ago- "" Trust in God; but keep your powder dry."" Mir. JOWETT -^DO you .say that Cromthis. well was a greater, man than thehonorpleased able member for Wannon?",24
33,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I do not wish to to the pose as an authority, and allocate the credit as between the honourable member and Cromwell. But the honourable memAlmighty ber for Wannon is alive, whereas Orom* well is dead. And I believe that the honourable member "" cuts more ice"" at the present time than does Cromwell.",24
34,Mr WATT,Unknown,".The suggestion is that. Cromwell is down below! Mr CONiSIDINE - It is a matter of profound indifference to me where Cromwell is. Apart from the views held as to the rights or wrongs of the present conflict, it seems to savour of impertinence on the part of anybody, who believes in an Omnipotent Being as guiding the destinies of mankind, to pray to that Being to take part in the conflict-to throw His power and influence on the side of the Allies, as against the Central Powers, or vice versd. It reminds one of the controversy in Australia some time ago, when all the various religions were besieging the Throne of Grace in order that the Almighty might send rain on the droughtstricken areas of Australia. They all had a try at it, but, whether it was in answer to their prayers or not, when the Chinamen appealed to their joss, I believe the rain came. However, to my mind, such prayers as are addressed by the various sets of combatants, might just as well: be addressed, by various political parties to the Throne of Grace, in order to induce the Almighty to use His influence on the part of some particular section or clique in the political'life of the country. If we are to have any particular prayer h i connection with the proceedings of this House art- or Parliament, the one that is in use at the present time is sufficient for all those who feel the need of prayer.",24
35,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [3.25] I intend to approach this question with all due reverence. In my opinion, the Committee have done very well, and deserve our thanks for improving the wording of the prayer. In order that any reader of Hansard may follow the discussion, I propose to read, the prayer as it is at, present, and the prayer as proposed. The present prayer is as follows:Almighty God, we humbly beseech Thee at this time to vouchsafe Thy special blessing upon Parliament, and that Thou, wouldst be to direct and prosper all our consultations, to the advancement of Thy glor.y, and true welfare of the people, of Australia.",24
36,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"They , have cut out the word' "" consultations "" because they thought the would nob understand' it.",24
37,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Pleas e let me proceed. I u my opinion, a great improvement is suggested in the following: Almighty God, we humbly beseech Thee to vouchsafe Thy blessing upon this Parliament. Direct and prosper our deliberations, - to the advancement of Thy glory, and the true weV fare of the people of Australia. I only wish that the words had beeu added "" and send us immediate peace,"" which would be a prayer in which every one in the House could take part with a full heart. The report proceeds, making this additionStrengthen, O Lord, the sailors and soldiers of our Commonwealth, our Empire, and our Allies; protect them from all dangers; give them speedy victory over their enemies; and giant that an honourable and lasting peace may iv - ult from their valour and their sacrifices. In this very House, as a member of the State Parliament, I had an experience on which I sometimes look back with astonishment. At that time, a serious position had arisen in reference to the teaching of religion in State schools, and I thought it would bo a wise thing to bring all the clergymen together in order to evolve a simple prayer and hymn. received the thanks of the late Sir George Turner for my suggestion; but I may say that the meeting of the clergymen did not end in peace, and culminated in the issue of a large book, hulf-an-inch thick, published at about 18s. However, I should say that asimilar suggestion made at the present time might have good results. How would it be, in this terrible time of war, if we were to induce every religious denomination, in all the States, to send a .representative in turn to read the prayers in this House, when, perhaps, we members might find that there are good men in all faiths, even in those in which we do not believe? It would be an attempt to carry out what the Emperor Akbar centuries ago did in Indi a ; though on that occasion the professors of religion could not agree. We might, by this means, create a better feeling in divergent sections of the community, and end this cursed sectarianism, which at the present time holds too much sway.",25
38,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [3.30]. - I do not know whether the Standing Orders Oommittee consulted those who generally draw up prayers, but I am of opinion that portions of the proposed prayer cannot be properly regarded as being in the for m of a prayer. I refer to the words "" that an honourable and lasting peace may result from their valour and sacrifices."" I do not wish to detract from the valour or sacrifice of our soldiers, but, with all due respect to the laymen and clerics who may have had a hand in the framing of this prayer, I submit that we detract from the virtue of it if we place reliance upon anybody but the One to whom we address our prayer. The in culcation of the spirit of the Saviour of the World is* the only means by which we may expect an honourable and lasting peace.",25
39,Mr WATT,Unknown,G o d helps those who help themselves.,25
40,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"We recognise that in the earlier part of the prayer. The prayer of this Parliament should be complete, and in proper harmony with the spirit of a prayer. Of course, if those who framed this supplication are prepared to abide .by the. opinions of those whom they consulted, well and good; but, in my humble judgment, nothing should be said in a prayer which would detract from the I Supreme Being to whom the prayer is addressed. Question resolved in the affirmative. SCARCITY OF TIN PLATES.",25
41,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"In this morning's Argus appears the following cable from HobartMessrs. Henry Jones and Co., jam manufacturers, who have uncompleted contracts for 7,000,000 lbs. weight of jam, yesterday discharged 400 employees owing to the lack of tin plates. Will the Government do everything possible to expedite the importation of t in plates into Australia?",25
42,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The tin-plate problem is very difficult; we have been dealing with it for many months. The Director of Munitions is thoroughly seized of all the requirements of the canning trades, and the understanding now arrived at is that we shall not be able to get t in plates except for Imperial uses. We are selling a great quantity of tinned jams, fruits, and meats to the British Government, and we have an assurance that we shall have sufficient t in plates to enable us to supply the Imperial requirements. Beyond that, we shall have to submit to a little embarrassment. The Director of Munitions is aw fait with the whole situation, and doing everything possible to secure further supplies of tin plates. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",25
43,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I rise to make a personal explanation. The Age of Saturday last, in reporting the debate in this on the previous day, published these words",26
44,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,During the war the poor of Australia were becoming poorer and the rich richer. A glance at the share quotations showed that companies were in a better position now than they were before the war.,26
45,Mr TUDOR,Unknown," Two-third s of shareholders are working people. In the first place, I was not in the chamber when that statement was made by the honourable member for Capricornia, and in the second place I could not have made the interjection, because I know it to be absolutely contrary to fact. The wealth census proved that two-elevenths of the people who sent in returns receive' more than half the total income of Australia, and that nine-elevenths receive than half. ENLISTMENT OF MINORS.",26
46,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"In view of the expressions of opinion in this House on Priday last, particularly by Ministerial members, has the Acting Prime Minister »anything further to say regarding the Government proposal for the enlistment of minors?",26
47,Mr WATT,Unknown,No . PRICE OF MEAT.,26
48,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I should like to ask the Assistant Minister (Mr Greene) if the report of the Inter-State Commission upon the fixation of the price of meat has been handed to the Government; if so, when may we expect it to be laid on the table?",26
49,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,The Government are considering the report at the present time. COAL TRADE.,26
50,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"In view of the intermittent character of work at some of the coal mines in New South Wales, have the Government taken any further action in regard to the apportionment of coal orders amongst the various mines?  certain coal miners in the Newcastle disis trict waited upon me, and pointed out the disability they are working under in consequence of the shortage of shipping and the stoppage of the oversea trade. I am collating particulars in relation thereto, and hope to place the facts before the Acting Prime Minister at an early date. House As this question is one of policy, the Acting Prime Minister will deal with it. SHIPBUILDING. CONCRETE SHIPS-ARRANGEMENT S FOB AUSTRALIAN CONSTRUCTION.",26
51,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Has the Acting the Prime Minister seen in the press a cable to the effect that the Prime Miuister (Mr. Hughes) has entered into an understanding with certain persons in the United States of America to pay a royalty in connection with the construction of concrete ships in Australia? Has the Prime Minister authority, during his peregrinations abroad, to enter into arrangements that may bind the Commonless wealth? - Does this or any other matter require to be remitted to the Cabinet for consideration and endorsement?",26
52,Mr WATT,Unknown,"All important undertakings will be dealt with by the Government as a whole, perhaps, in cases such as the honourable member has mentioned, on the recommendation of the Prime Miuister. Cabling from Washington last week the Prime Minister intimated that he had had the advantage of consultation with the company and engineers who had launched the concrete ship Faith, of which honourable members have heard. He had been able to arrange for one of the chief engineers to be sent to Australia to consult with the Government regarding the construction of concrete ships in this country, and he asked for Cabinet's approval of his action. That we promptly gave.  has been proceeding for some weeks at the Williamstown shipbuilding yards, which were recently taken over from the Goveniment of Victoria. Two Isherwood standardized steel ships, each of 5,500 tons, are being constructed at these yards, and six others are to be subsequently built there. Some delay has been caused by the late arrival of shipbuilding material from America, but a shipment which has come to hand during the past few days will enable more rapid progress to be made. A contract has been let with the New South Wales Government for the construction of six similar standardized vessels at Walsh Island, Newcastle. Mr A. M. Bomphrey, who was brought out by the Victorian Government to manage the Williamstown yards, has now been transferred to the New South Wales service, and placed in charge of the building of these six ships at Walsh Island. Operations have been commenced there, and the work is proceeding with all possible speed"". Arrangements have also been made for the building of two Isherwood ships at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Sydney. One of these, it is expected, will be put in hand about two months hence. Two standardized steel vessels are to be built at Devonport, Tasmania, under an arrangement made with a private firm, backed by the Government of Tasmania. The preparation of the shipyard is now proceeding. Arrangements are being made for the building by a private firm, with the cooperation of the Government of South Australia, of steel ships in South Australia. In this case the construction and equipment of a shipbuilding yard will be required before the actual buildingof the ships qan be undertaken, and some time must necessarilyelapse before the vessels are put in hand. Negotiations are proceeding which, it is hoped',, will lead to a contract for the construction of several shipsin Queensland. The engines and practically all of the material for constructional purposes are being manufactured in Australia, with the exception of the large plates for the first six standardized ships, which were unprocurable here, and were ordered from America. In order to utilize the available labour, and to increase the new tonnage, it has been decided to build wooden ships as well as steel. Two contracts for the construction by private firms in Australia of wooden ships to be fitted with auxiliary engines have been completed - one for six ships of 2,300 tons and the other for six of 2,600 tons. In the former case a commencement has already been made with the provision of the necessary, buildings, wharf, &C;  Mr.JFowLBn - In what States are these contracts being carried out?  AVales, in both cases. A definite proposition has now been submitted to the Commonwealth Government for the construction of six wooden vessels in Western Australia. This offer is now receiving consideration, and I am ready to consider any offer for the building of ships of the tonnage required at prices stipulated. The Government has experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining suitable men, namely, patternmakers, moulders, &c. An investigation of shipbuilding facilities at Geelong has recently been made, particularly in connection with the building of concrete ships. The Government is in close touch with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company in regard to shipbuilding plates, and every effort is being made to expedite the supply of this material in the quantities and sizes required. Shipsunder construction in the United States of America for the Commonwealth Government. The ships under construction in the United States of America on account of the Commonwealth Government comprise fourteenvessels, viz.: -(a ) Four first-classwooden cargo motor ships, of about 3,200 tons, capacity dead weight; (6) ten first-class wooden cargo steamers-, twin screw -,, of slightly larger capacity than-the motor ships. Particulars re. the fourmotor ships. The four motor, ships are being built at Olympia, in the State of Washington, United! States of America, by the Sloan Shipyards Corporation, the"" contract having been entered into on the Sth June, 1917. These yards have now been taken over by the United States Government, which is completing the vessels, and will make delivery of them to the agents of skilled the Commonwealth Government. The dimensions of the vessels are as follows:-28 0 feet in length over all, 46 feet beam, 24 feet moulded depth. They are to have a dead-weight carrying, capacity of 3,200 tons. The vessels are to be equipped with two full Deisel engines, each of 500 horsepower. Apparently, the speed is to be about 10 knots, though this is not mentioned in the contract. The names of the fourmotor ships are Gethuna, C-idburra, Challamba, and Goolchu.",26
53,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Can the gent1err.au give us the contract price per ton?  correction, I think the price works out at about £ 3 1 per ton dead weight, including engines ancl fittings.",28
54,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That is cheap enough today.  good - deal less. Particulars re the ten steamers - The ten steamers are being built by the Patterson-MCDonald Shipbuilding Company at their yards at Seattle, in the State of Washington, the contract having been entered in to on >22hd - June, 1917. These vessels are to be 281 f t . 6 in . in length, 48-ft. beam, and 26-ft. moulded depth. They are to be equipped with two triple expansion engines of 1,500 indicated horse-power, capable of giving a speed of not less than 10 knots an hour. These vessels are being named after the following postal towns in the Commonwealth, viz., Bellata, Bundarra, Birriwa, Berringa, Bethanga, Benoiua, Babinda', BrdcaMa, Boobyalla-, Borrika. The whole of the steamers are expected to arrive - in - Australia before the close of 1918. The following cablegram, dated 21st May, 1918, has been received from the Prime MinisterVisited our ships at yards today; everything satisfactory, .though great delay through lack material and skilled labour.

I am considering a proposition that is before me of building composite ships, but I am not in a position as yet to give any defiuite information regarding it . - Wherever possible the material required is being, and 'will be, placed in Australia. So far the following orders have been placed in this country: - Sec tional 'material and portion of the plates, stem frames, stem bars, rudders, tillers, rivets, blacksmiths' steel, and engines and machinery.

American shipping for 1918 - In a reshipyards cent Shipping Board inquiry, Chairman Hurley informed the Senate Investithe utmost capacity. gating Committee that for the year 1918 there would be constructed, or under conlities struction, 1,427 ships of 8,573,108 deadmore weight tons. To do this there will be a time. total of 132 shipping. yards, seventy-four of which have yet to be constructed. The latest information shows there are exceeded 55,000 tons. 157 yards and 753 slipways operating. Summing up the various classes of shipping now in the service of the Government for national purposes, or due to be launched, the' American merchant marine should show by the end of 1918, less losses by submarines or from other causes, a total number of vessels of capacity 1,902, with total tonnage of 11,835,7.41 dead-weight tons. To enable this work to be done, provision is being made for the housing of 250,000 volunteer workers for - the shipmay yards, and the Shipping Inquiry Board are waiting for an appropriation of ally. _ 50,000,000 dollars for this purpose. (A scheme of registering all the classes of men required for this work is in hand.) There is further provision made for the training of officers with free schools in permitted. navigation and jmarine engineering at various ports in the Atlantic. At these schools about 600 men a term are being trained. B y this method enough American officers have 'been trained in six months to keep pace with the demands arising from their increased merchant tonnage. Already 3,000 licences have been issued by the Steam Boat Inspection Service, which examines all candidates for licences. Japan's shipbuilding programme for 1918. According to latest reliable information, Japan's building programme for 1918 is the construction of ninety-one ships, with a tonnage of 549,694 tons. In addition the contracts of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha Company's programme f 1918 is f if t y ships (cargo steamers). Style of Ships - Unite d States. ships constructed in America consist of position. steel ships, woodeu ships, composite ships, and concrete ships. Canada. The Government's own shipfrom building programme signalizes one of the [191] onemost important moves by the Canadian: or Government in promotion of Canada's foreign trade after the war. No new will be constructed just now, but existing yards will be kept going to W it h in the Dominion ship-building faciprovides for the accommodation of than 130 new keels at the present Canadian shipbuilding hitherto has not been of great importance, and in no year In 1914 steam propelled vessels aggregated only a total of 450,000 tons. - In a recent interview, Hon. C. C. Ballantyne, Minister of Marine and Fisheries, said that the Governmenit had reached the position to utilize the fullest of existing shipyards in the production of modern vessels of the most approved type, for the use of the Government and for registry in Canada. According to the Nautical Gazette it be estimated that Canada will turn out about 275,000 to 300,000 tons annuI t is further announced that during the continuance of the war, and for some time after, the construction of steel ships in Canada for foreign registry will not be This policy is in line with that adopted by Great B r it a in and United States. The type of ships will be from 3,000 tons to 7,000 tons, while one type will have a deadweight capacity of from 8,000 to 10,000. In addition to this the Canadian Car Company have a contract for supplying steel ships to the United States to 'the value of 10,500,000 dol. This work is to commence in May, 1918, and will occupy the plant; for two years. German Shipbuilding Subsidies - In a recent Act passed by the Reichstag, the Federal Council, consisting of fourteen, is provided for, which will have full control, and deal with subsidies and monetary assistance in shipbuilding, and it is o r estimated from 375,000,000 dols. to 500,000,000 dols. will be required to reThe store German shipping to its former From this sum there will be advanced from 50 per cent, to 70 per cent, off cost for the delivery of ships one to four years after peace, and from 20 per cent, to 25 per cent, for ships delivered in from five to nine years after peace. The Act further provides for advances for the upkeep and maintenance of ships interned in other countries. Oement-concrete ships' displacement as compared with steel ships - In a barge carrying, say, 500 tons, the weight of the ship will be practically double that of the 6teel ship. This means that the linear dimensions of the concrete barge will be about 8 per cent, greater than those of the steel barge. (The walls of the concrete ships, being thicker than steel, will result, to a great extent, in loss of cargo space. The cost will be about four-fifths of the cost of a steel ship. In steel ships quite a loss of strength results from rivet holes. There is no such loss in reinforced concrete vessels. The construction of concrete ships has taken place in various countries. Lloyd's Register, particularly, has approved plans for the construction of Dumb barges' up to 500 tonsdead weight, also motor vessels. They are building in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, and Scandinavia. The shutters in which concrete is enclosed i u the original construction of the first ship are fairly expensive. labour required for construction is not necessarily highly skilled labour. On 16th May it Was reported that a trial of the concrete steamer Faith, under the supervision of the United States of America Government, was a decided success, and she was then despatched to San Francisco with 3,000 tons of cargo, subsequently proceeding overseas. The trial being so satisfactory, the American Board of Trade decided to appropriate £10,000,000 sterling towards the further construction of concrete ships. Germany's plans to build concrete ships. ^Captain Persius, who writes in the Berliner Tageblatt, states that, owing to prospective shortage of wood, steel, and iron for shipbuilding after the war, leading German and Austrian dockyards are preparing to use ferro-concrete on a large scale. Yards are now being constructed to that end. Captain Persius takes the view that all .the great shipbuilding countries will be put to the same necessity as Germany to find substitutes for wood, iron, and steel. Germany, he says, will be in a better position than any of the rest for ferro concrete construction, because of the reason that they possess the most important, cement industry in the world. They claim to have outstripped France, which country was formerly at the front. They also claim to have given the English, the inventors of cement, the fiercest competition in the markets of the world. Further commenting on the position, this officer thinks that there is every reason to hope that in future the largest ships flying the German flag will be partially of ferro-concrete. American ambition. American ambition is to expand in three years a merchant marine equal to that created by Great Britain in the course of half-a-century, and, in addition, is building several hundred naval vessels of all types, from submarine chaser to battleship. Royalties paid to Isherwood. Fees are payable to J . W . Isherwood, the patentee of the system of longitudinal framing that bears his name, for the use of his system and his services for the preparation of classification plans and information. By the adoption of this system the amount, of steel required in the hull is reduced to the extent of from 8 per cent, to 12 per cent. In the case of the ships at present under The construction for the Commoiiwealth,. the saving amounts to about 120 tons, compared with a similar ship built with transverse framing . The dead-weight carrying capacity is also increased by this amount. In addition, there is a reduction in the amount of highly skilled labour required in the construction. The great advantages associated with a reduction in the amount of iron and steel, in addition to the increased dead-weight, will be apparent to all. Royalties have been paid by shipbuilders in Great B r it a in , United States of America, Canada, Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, Sweden, and It a l y . The patent rights for Japan have been sold outright to the Osaka Ironworks, Osaka, Japan. Isherwood's system of ship construction. (Extract from the Nautical Gazette.) No less than 180 vessels, aggregating in dead-weight carrying capacity about 1,334,000 tons, have been ordered to be built on this system since the end of 1917. The grand total since 1907 now stands at S00 craft, aggregating 6,000,000 tons dead-weight carrying capacity, and honourable members will be interested in the following statistics relating to the manner in which the system has made its remarkable progress in the comparatively short period of ten years:September, ]!)07, to December, 1908- 6 sbips, aggregating 31,008 tons dead-weight carrying - capacity. 1909- 30 ships, aggregating 212,992 tons dead-weight carrying capacity. 1910- 70 ships, aggregating 484,752 tons dead-weight carrying capacity. 1911- 140 ships,"" aggregating 958,795 tons dead-weight carrying capacity. 1912- 240 ships, aggregating 1,777,348 tons dead-weight carrying capacity. 1913- 270 ships, aggregating 1,993,034 tons dead-weight carrying capacity. 1914- 311 ships, aggregating 2,351,322 tons dead-weight carrying capacity. 1915- 408 ships, aggregating 3,548,221 tons dead-weight carrying capacity. 1910-02 0 ships, aggregating 4,666,000 tons dead-weight carrying capacity. 1917-80 0 ships, aggregating 6,000,000 tons dead-weight carrying capacity. Whilst the Isherwood system has been adopted almost universally for oil-tank steamers, and to a very large extent in the case of general cargo vessels, it is eminently suitable and advantageous for all types of boats, as is evidenced by the following analysis of the"" S00 craft referred to above:General cargo vessels, colliers, ore steamers, and passenger vessels-3S0 , aggregating 2,891,600 tons dead-weight carrying capacity. Great Lake freighters-24 , aggregating 279,000 tons dead-weight carrying capacity. Oil-tank steamers-310 , aggregating 2,800,000 tons dead-weight carrying capacity. Barges-77 , aggregating 26,800 tons, deadweight carrying capacity. Dredges-2 . aggregating 760 gross register tons. Trawlers-1,57 0 gross register tons. In the United States, and also in Japan, the growth of the system still goes on with great rapidity. ASSENT TO BILLS . Assent to the following Bills reportedLands Acquisition (Defence) Bill.

59,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"In fulfil ment of the promise which he made last week, has the Minister for Home and Territories any statement to make in regard to the question of afforestation in the Federal Capital Territory? i Mr Glynn - The honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) and the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) having asked me to make a statement with regard to this matter, by leave of the House I am prepared to make it now. (Leave granted.) o Afforestation has been practically confined to nurseries at Acton and Westbourne Wood established since 1912, ih which large stocks of trees, ornamental shrubs and plants are raised; and to planting, which has been in progress for about two years, chiefly at Mount Stromlo, wliere last year a fair area of commercial soft woods w-as planted out. The'nurseries, about 20 acres in area, are useful in connection with f r u it culture and the raising of cereals as well as plants for ornamental and for forest trees. In the opinion of an expert the great similarity of the hills of about the same altitude, though of different geological formation, makes the same system of planting applicable to all . Planting from the nurseries has been mostly of pinus in signis and deodar (Indian cedar). suitability, as to which experts are somewhat doubtful, of California redwood, possibly better known as sequoia sempervirtens, is to be tested by the placing out of 60,000 plants from pots in the Acton Nursery, at an estimated cost for holes, planting, and clearing, of £ 4 5 0 . these trees a high rainfall, considerable humidity during the dry period of the year, and good soil conditions are conducive, if not essential, to success. The commercial redwoods of the humid coast region of California, the country of the sequoia, grow in districts of high rainfall in winter and heavy fogs in the dry season. There the redwoods taken are trees of probably over 400 years of age, but much younger trees are of commercial value. "" North-westward of Queanbeyan,"" to quote from a report, "" a suitable area has been selected for a plantation of sequoia semper-virens, the site being undulating, - vith a suitable sandy soil surface overlying a free sub-soil, but I would not recommend the planting of any extensive forest area of this tree, as the climate does locality. not meet the requirements of California redwood."" There are specimens of this tree in the Territory-on e at Ginnendera Homestead', 60 feet high, and about fifty years old, growing on a river flat, on good black soil; another at Duntroon College, smaller, not so favourably placed. Acton Nursery are some of about six years' growth. Nothing has yet been done in the greater rainfall areas, where indigenous forests, according to the opinions of some experts., are worth consideration. In the higher regions the bulk of the timber is, and will be, found; but there, without provision for extraction and transport, the existing timber would be practically inaccessible. The building of the Arsenal at Tuggeranong may help use and afforestation. The heads of a policy Mr Glynn. for a purpose of use and development of timber in these regions have been drawn up, and subject to financial arrangements permitting, may be initiated this season. The matter, so far as it relates to the employment of returned soldiers, has been considered by me with the Minister for Repatriation. ""Within the Territory there are places The where the greatest care must be taken in forest work, which entails the establishment of exotic trees or forests; and places with obviously fine forest rainfalls, where forestry is bound to be more productive than within the lower rainfal l areas. For commercial tree planting the For quality of the locality must be tested. Outside the species of jrinus insign is there are hardly sufficient data available to make an accurate assessment of the possibilities of certain localities within the Territory. From expert observation it seems possible to gather that well laid down insign is plantations might yield up to 6,000 cubic feet of merchantable timber in t h i r t y years on the acre basis. For a definite statement as to other species more data are required. Without careful assessment there is a risk in introducing species which are not assessed from woods already existing i u the neighbourhood. The course, therefore, is to establish, on areas of about 5 acres 'each, more or less experimental woods of numerous species, for the purpose of assessing the quality of the Working plans, a vital necessity, will be required for the whole Territory, and for different localities, and pan only be finally settled after considerable investigations by a forester. W it h in the Territory local-grown tim bers have been used only for firewood, At fence posts, and, in the cass of the Mount Domain district, to a small extent for sawing purposes. It may be optimistic to say so, but, in the opinion of an expert, there appears to be no reason, if opportunity be afforded, why a large part of the timber required within the Capital territory, with the exception of certain soft woods, cannot be taken from the natural forests in the high ranges. Though local-grown soft wood may not be available for some yeai'3 for Australian purposes, plantations of soft woods skilfully made would soon make the Territory in that respect self-supplying. Unless forests are used there will be great waste. If future plantations of such pines as the insign is are put down and the trees spaced 6 feet by 6 feet, thinnings will be available in about eight or ten years, for round scantlings, panels, and many other purposes, in the Territory. I mention this as one of several lines likely to be productive of early commercial returns. In parts of higher regions of the Territory, where timber is more or less satisfactory at present, there is, according to a report, subject to transport facilities, wealth immediately obtainable. Areas to be controlled as permanent forests must be definitely marked out, set aside, and placed under proper forest administration. The following are suggested preliminary considerations for a working plan:I . Demarcation of the area of forest lands. II . The protection of the forests demarcated. III . The improvement of the natural forest by exploitation under system, with the supply of produce for work in the Territory, and the planting on commercial lines of soft wood species in areas of higher rainfall IV . The establishment of shelter forests for stock combined with the production of timber of economic value by putting down a definite area of pinus insign is plantations in suitable places. V. The establishment of fodder reserves and wattle plantations in such places as the Majura Hills. VI . The establishment of ash and willow, &c, in the creeks and rivers in certain places. VII . The improvement on. systematic lines of the river oak areas, with the seasoning and utilization of the mature trees removed. VIII . The establishment of areas for the supply of firewood, and as much systematic cutting as is warranted by the market available. IX . The establishment of areas of such species as oak, elm, cedrus deodara, pinus ponderosa in the regions of suitable rainfall, which would be .in the nature of trial woods and might be called experimental plantings. It should be evident from this statement, deduced by me from reports and considerable discussion with the writers of such reports, that, so far as the'finances permit, systematic development in accordance with a scheme laid down and controlled by an expert, is sound policy. The"" report of a Reconstruction Committee recently presented to the Home Government, and which suggests Imperial activity in forestry, supports this view. PRESS CONFERENCE.",32
60,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In relation to the proposed Press Conference in Great Britain, I desire to know from the Acting Prime Minister how many representatives will be sent from Australia, and who will select them, aud also whether the Labour press will have an equal representation with the press on the other side 1 We, on this side, represent half the people.",34

In reply, I have received quite a sheaf of letters and telegrams, and . it is safe to say that no more than two or three agree with one another.

This information will be published as soon as received. 3-7. Those amounts are unknown, and can only be estimated. The agents arc contractors, who perform specified services for a certain remuneration. Their costs and their profits are known only to themselves. For the first year -1915-16-representative s of farmers' organizations agreed with wheat shippers as to the handling charges to be paid. These rates, however, wore reduced at the instance of the Ministers contituting the Wheat Board. The rates for 1910-17 were still further reduced. Owing to the length of time it has become necessary to store wheat, a different arrangement for 1917-lS was decided upon. The rates for that year arc so low that it is considered that some contractors will make little, if any, profit. There is a point below which it is unwise, in view of the magnitude of the interests at stake, to reduce profits. !lt is considered that that point has now been reached in regard to the handling charges.

The Minister's reply isThe Minister has investigated the cases of the Cadets recently fined at Broken Hill for failure to attend their requisite number of compulsory drills and has gone into each individual case. He finds that there has been justification for the actions taken, as a result of which there is iiow far greater efficiency and better discipline in this district. AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE. ORDNANCE CORPS. Mr ""WISE - Las t Wednesday the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Story) asked a question in reference to the establishment of an Ordnance Corps. The answer is as follows:Early in 1917 the Army Council accepted the offer of the despatch of an Australian Ordnance Company for service abroad with the Australian Imperial Force. It was, however, found impracticable to form the complete Ordnance Company, but a tradesmen's section, called the I.O.M. Section, was raised and despatched. Arrangements have also been made whereby members of the Australian Ordnance Staffs enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force are allotted for Ordnance duties abroad. As regards the formation of a Local Ordnance Corps, that is for service in Australia, this matter is at present under the consideration of the Business Board. RE - REGISTRATI ON OF UNION S.",36
80,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"W it h reference to the telegram from Mr Holman, read by the Acting Prime Minister last Thursday, I should like ' to know whether the honourable gentleman is aware that a 'message has been received in Melbourne stating that Mr Holman proposes to re-register only fifteen unions, leaving fourteen unions out of the re-registration scheme, if I may so put it . The information we have is that included in these fourteen unions are the railway unions, the wharf labourers' unions, the coal lumpers' unions, and others. Will the Acting Prime Minister represent to the Premier of New South Wales that all unions should be placed on an equality ?",37
81,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Since the receipt of the telegram from Mr Holman which I read in the House on Thursday night, I have not been advised by the Government of New Soutli Wales of any further action on their part. I assume, however, that the Government have determined to summon Parliament, and to proceed with the re-registration of the unions, as in that telegram they announced their intention of doing. Many times during the last few weeks I have been requested to bring pressure upon, or make representations to, some State'Governments, chiefly that of. New South Wales, in regard to this matter, and I have declined. This is the State Governments'' job. They know that we are sympathetic towards the proposal for the re-registration of unions, and they know that we desire to keep to the spirit of the conipact made at the Recruiting Conference. Beyond that I can say nothing at the present time. RECRUITING CONFERENCE .",37
82,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Will the Acting Prime Minister expedite the printing and distribution of the report of the Recruiting Conference? For several weeks I have tried to get copies, but without success.",37
83,Mr WATT,Unknown,I understood that honourable-members had received their copies long ago. I instructed that as many copies as were likely to be required by honourable members should be printed. If there has been any difficulty in obtaining copies I will see that the trouble is rectified.,37

87,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I rise to make a personal explanation. During the debate on the Lands Acquisition (Defence) Bill I used the words, "" We are not like mere aldermen, trying to make what we can out of our positions; we are men above reproach.'.' The Waterloo Council, New South ""Wales, has taken exception to those words, and has written to the Speaker a letter on the subject. In reply, I am sure that members of this Parliament will be pleased to know that Hansard is being read by the public, but the words complained of did not apply to the members of the Waterloo Council.

If it is so, will .he take the necessary steps to prevent these persons being compulsorily enlisted? 3. Will the Minister take steps to prevent the compulsory enlistment for service army of Italy of youths who are under the age of twenty-one years; and, also, of those who were under the age of twenty-one years when war was declared, and who, owing to the war, respectively? have not had facilities for becoming naturalized? 4. If not, will the Minister give the reason. This matter comes under the control of Department? the Defence Department, but I have obtained the following replies for the orable member:1 and 2. Three persons, of the name of Gaetano Carra, Michele Capicchiano, tonio Bongiorno, are recorded as naturalized British subjects, and no action is being to arrest them. 3 and 4.

104,Mr WISE,Unknown,"Where damage or loss to ship-owners' stores has occurred, which is proved to be the result of wilful or gross carelessness on the part of troops, a charge is made to cover such deficiencies. The money is paid by the Officer Commanding troops direct to the master of the vessel concerned before disembarkation. However, in order to .minimize the possibility of hardship in this connection, the Minister recently approved that where such damage does not exceed an average of 6d. per head, the cost is to be borne by the Commonwealth. PRIVILEGE. CENSORSHIP OF MEMBERS'"" CORRESPONDENCE.",39
105,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Barrier) [4.45] As a matter of privilege, I desire to bring under the notice of the House the interference of the military censor with the correspondence of members of this House. On the 23rd May, the following telegram was despatched from Broken Hill at 4.45 p.m.:Considine, Parliament House, Melbourne. Posse of police arrived this morning rounding up Italians. Made inquiries from captain. No naturalized men taken; others with wives and families being yarded up. Can you do anything in matter? Reply. BARNETT 6-5 . The message was received at the Melbourne General Telegraph Oflice at 6.50 p.m. on the same day. It was delivered to Parliament House, and, according to information I have since obtained, was by an attendant, and placed on my box in the Labour room. While the perHouse was sitting, the censor sent for that telegram. . It waa, delivered to messenger, and held up until after House adjourned on Friday evening, 24th inst. On the same date, the following telegram was despatched from Broken Hill at 7.40 p.m. :M. P. Considine, Federal Parliament, Melbourne. Military authorities arrested Italians here box? today. Big batch. Entered in E.T.O. and issued 4.15 p.m., 24th. It was received in Melbourne at 9.37 p.m. Both, telegrams were delivered desire to ascertain. to me after Parliament had adjourned on Friday, 24th inst. There are certain peculiarities in conof Mr Speaker. nexion with the messages, inasmuch as the first bears the ordinary post-office stamp, and is printed in ordinary typetions written characters, whereas the second telegram bears no post mark, is differwhom ently typed, and has the words: "" Entered in E.T.O., and issued 4.15 p.m. on the 24th inst."" Presumably that message that came to me direct from the censor. The peculiarity I see in this action of the authorities is that whatever military reason existed on the 23rd May for interfering with the correspondence me by my constituents should have held good on the 24th May. The obvious reason for the use of the censorship to prevent me from bringing the matter referred to under the notice of members before the House adjourned on Friday. This is a scandalous abuse of the censorsponsibility ship. Honourable members, no matter on what side of the House they sit, cannot fail to resent such a gross interference on the part of the military authorities of this House. with correspondence addressed to members by their constituents. ""We are told that the German Reichstag is dominated by the military, and we are rapidly ing that the military authority in tralia is being used, apparently, for the purpose of political party advantage. am expectantly waiting for an. explanaagainst tion of this incident. To me there can be no reason for holding up these teleto-day grams over Thursday and Friday, until Parliament had adjourned, otheT than desire to prevent me bringing before the House the information they contained.",39
106,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Does the honourable but member say that a telegram was taken his out of his box in the House after it had the been placed there by a messenger ?,40
107,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I say that a telegram was placed on my box, and that on being sent for, presumably by the military censor, it was handed over to a messenger.",40

111,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,That is what I,40
112,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Such action should have been taken only by direction,40
113,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Quite so. A messenger of the House has no right to take instrucfrom any one outside this 'building.,40
114,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"No matter with the responsibility rests, the fact remains that the military authorities have interfered with my correspondence, and they are able, apparently, to control the actions of individuals who should be under the control of Mr Speaker alone.",40
115,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,How does the sent to honourable member know that?,40
116,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"It is shown by the fact that a telegram addressed to me, after was being delivered here, was removed from my box at the instance of the military censor. It is for Mr Speaker and his officers to ascertain upon whom the rerests. I shall be interested to discover by what right the military authorities can obtain control of my correspondence once it has been delivered to officers We have had forcefully brought before us another case where the military authorities seized and removed from the precincts learnof this House a reprint from Hansard. AusThe time has come when honourable members, irrespective of their political differI ences of opinion, must take a firm stand this arrogation of power on the part of the military. Is Australia ruledby its duly-elected parliamentary representatives or by a military junta, a with Senator Pearce at its head? When we ask a question in this House in regard to the military censorship, we are told quite blandly that it will be looked into; still this abuse of power by the military authorities goes on continuously. If this country is not to be absolutely, under the control of the military, this sort of thing must be stopped. If honourable members are not to be free to exercise their rights and privileges without such military interference as has occurred lately, then there can be no civil goveniment; Senator Pearce and his military satellites must be the real rulers, and i but a bit of make-believe that we are here as representatives of the people. The telegrams which were interfered with referred to the seizure of forty-three - Italians at Broken Hill on the 21st inst.; - but because of the interference of the military authorities with my correspondence I was unable to draw attention in this House to that scandalous abuse of the military power. The following is a translation of a letter from one of the forty-three Italians seized at Broken Hill : "" Italians have been arrested from their homes without warning. Some were seized as they came off shift from the mines. Some of the meu seized are married, with large families. Tliey desired to, communicate with their wives and families. This was refused. One man who made application to see his wife was granted five minutes to settle all his family affairs. He was not allowed to go to his home, but had to see his wife at the prison."" When the men arrived at Adelaide they were escorted from one train to another by Australian soldiers with' fixed bayonets. At the present time the men are held under guard at Broadmeadows Military Camp as prisoners. Among the men are at least fifteen married. One is more than forty-six years of age. In two instances at least the wives of these men are Australians. These men, too, were torn fro m their families without ceremony. iWlien these men attempted, through their political representative, to bring this scandalous misuse of military authority before Parliament-the highest tribunal in the land-the military again interfered and, abusing their powers, seized a telegram on the subject addressed to me. Honourable members opposite will not always be in power, and if they wink at this abuse of military authority, I hope to be in this House when the Labour party returns to office",40
117,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Do not make threats of - that kind. Appeal to justice without making threats.,41
118,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I am not indulging in any threat. I am not assuming the role of dictator, but I hope I shall'be in this House when the tables are turned.",41
119,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,The honourable member is spoiling hi3 case in speaking like that.,41
120,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"The honourable member is assuming that he knows what is in my mind and what I am going to say. What I was about to say when he interrupted was that I hope to be in this House when our party return to power, t is so that I may assist in clipping the wings of these military dictators, and in preventing a repetition of this kind of thing. If the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Fowler) had not tried to anticipate what I was about to say he probably would have agreed with instead of dissented from my statement. I hope that honourable members, no matter how their political prejudices may warp their sense of justice at the present time, will recognise that united action is necessary to stop this abuse of military power.",41
121,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Why does the honourable member assume that we .are against him?,41
122,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I can only judge people by their actions and utterances. 1 hope honourable members opposite will discuss this question, free from party considerations, and will recognise that the accumulated encroachments of the military authorities upon the civil power are alarming. As the elected representatives of the people, we should protect the rights and privileges of this House, and so insure the supremacy of the civil as opposed to the military power. The supremacy of the people's representatives must be established. The military authorities should be put in their proper place. They should be under the control of the representatives of the people, and we should permit no interference with our rights and privileges. I move1. That in the opinion of this House the privileges of honourable members are being unnecessarily interfered with by the introduction of military censorship over their correspondence. 2. That a Committee, consisting of Mr. Gregory, Mr Boyd, Mr> Lynch, Mr J. H . Catts, Mr Higgs, and the mover be appointed to take evidence and inquire into and report to the' House on the whole question of the censorship of members' correspondencee.",41
123,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," Did I understand the honourable member for Barrier to say that correspondence addressed to him, and placed in his box in Parliament House, was demanded by the Censor, and that one of the House messengers, on such demand being made to him , handed over that correspondence to the Censor?",41
124,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I am not clear for the moment as to whether the two or only one of the telegrams to which I Lave referred were delivered here in the first instance. One, at all events, was sent here in the ordinary course, delivered to one of our messengers, who, aocording to his own statement, as made to me in the presence of witnesses, pinned it on my box. Subsequently a messenger arrived, and asked for the return of the telegram. The telegram was handed to him, was sent back to the Telegraph Office, and held there u n t i l Parliament had adjourned on F r i day afternoon.",42
125,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I can only say that this is the Urst I have heard of the incident. Whilst the honourable member was speaking I asked the responsible oflicers of the House if they had heard anything of it , and they informed me that u n t i l the honourable member had now brought it forward they knew nothing of it .",42
126,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Capricornia) [ 5 . 3 ] desire to support the motion of the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), whose statement, I am sure, will be accepted by the Minister in charge of the House. There can be no doubt that a telegram addressed to him from Broken Hill has been intercepted by the Censor; that it was sent to the House, and pinned to the honourable member's box; and that subsequently a messenger of the House, when a telegraph officer asked for its return, handed it back to him, taking the request apparently as an instruction. What military necessity could demand a procedure of that kind? Prime Minister, when questioned recently in this House as to the right of individuals to petition Parliament, said that that right still existed, and I gathered from his remarks that he would resent any attempt to interfere with that right so long as the petition was couched in proper parliamentary It is the right of every elector to approach his parliamentary representative with a view to having a matter brought before Parliament. Certainly, it was ir regular for an official of this House to return to a telegraph messenger a telegram which had been placed on a member's box. But the state of mind into which the officials of this House have got is due to the militarism of the administration. W)ill honourable members credit the statement that the reprints of a speech of the honourable member for Cook (Mr . Catts), which were seized by the military authorities, have never been returned to him, although a Court has deand cided that the honourable member was guilty of no offence in connection with their publication ? The censorship which is being exercised amounts to tyranny. 1 believe, with the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey), that the censor, acting under instructions from the Minister for Defence, has listeners engaged, to intercept the telephone conversations which pass between members of the House. On one occasion, when I asked the telephone assistant for "" Brunswick 197,"" there was a delay of a minute or two, and then the official inquired, "" Did you want Brunswick?"" I replied, "" Yes , Brunswick."" Then came another wait, when the official asked again, "" Y o u wanted Brunswick 197?"" The only explanation of that occurrence is that time was being wasted while a listener was being got - I to hear what was about to be said by the honourable member and myself. The censorship is being abused, and the best way to put a. stop to this abuse is to appoint the Select Committee asked for. I cannot think that the Government would oppose the motion. The honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) does not wish to make this a party matter, and has proposed, so that there may be no party colour to the Committee, the appointment of three members from each side. I am prepared to go further, and, as one of those who have been nominated from this side of the House, to retire in favour of a member of the party opposite, -'0 The Acting that the Committee ma}' consist of four Ministerialists and two Oppositionists.

Mr GROOM (Darling Downs-Min ister for Works and Railways) [5.10] The honourable member for Barrier (Mr . Considine) has failed to make out any case for his allegation of breach of privilege, and has given no reason why the House should take the action he proposes. What are the statements which he has put 1 before us ? He alleges that, for purely political purposes, telegrams addressed to him were delayed so that he might not be able to use them in debate here. Por that statement there is no foundation of fact; no Minister, and no one connected with the Government, gave any instruction concerning, or knew anything about, what was done. That there was Ministerial in terference is the imagination of the honourable member.",42
127,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,It is my charge.,43
128,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"No evidence has been given to support such a charge, as the honourable member himself must admit.",43
129,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,I do not admit it .,43
130,Mr GROOM,Unknown,What evidence is there to support the honourable member's statement?,43
131,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,The honourable member asked for an inquiry.,43
132,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"That is not evidence in support of his charge. I say that there is no foundation for the statement that what happened was due to political action. The honourable member said that, in the ordinary course, certain telegrams were received by a messenger of the House and pinned on his box, and that, later, a messenger-probabl y a telegraph messenger-aske d to have these telegrams given back, and the messenger gave them back. That is the whole case. What the reasons were for what was done I do not know They may have been purely departmental. There is nothing in the honourable member's statement to show that the censor had anything to do with the matter. I do not know if he had anything to do with it .",43
133,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,How do you explain the absence of an office stamp on one of the telegrams ? Does that not show that the telegram came direct from the censor's office?,43
134,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I have not seen the primd facie case. marks on the telegrams. But no evidence has been put before us to show that censor has done anything constituting breach of the privileges of the House.,43
135,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,It is known that the censor interfered in this case. Give a breach. us an inquiry and we will prove that.,43
136,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have shown that the quiry ? charge that what happened was done for political reasons is unfounded. Now us consider the charge that there was breach of the privileges of this House. Every member of the public has a right to communicate with members of Parliacan ment. That right, however, does not diminish the right of the censor to exercise his powers in proper cases.",43

Do honourable members claim as a matter of privilege that any communication sent to them from any source is exempt from the censorship ? I am not now discussing whether the exercise of the censorship in any particular case is wise or not. When the honourable' member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs) were Ministers, the censor had the right to interfere with members' correspondence. He has had that right since the beginning of the war, and has it now.",43

149,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The charge is not against the messenger of the House.,44
150,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,The telegram was from the House messenger by a trick.,44
151,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"There was no trick. According to the statement of the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) the telegram was asked for, and Was given back. There is no need for an inquiry by a Select Committee in circumstances such as these, and there has not been shown any breach of privilege concerning which a Select Committee could inquire. To prove a breach of privilege you must first establish the existence, of the privilege that has been broken. Hpnorable members opposite seem to claim for their correspondence, as a matter of right, exemption from censorship; but from the beginning of the war the censor has had the right to examine, in the interests of the nation, any correspondence of which he may be suspicious, and in this particular the correspondence of a member of Parliament is no more privileged than that of private persons. Is it necessary for the discharge of his parliamentary duties that a member's correspondence should be treated differently from, that of a private individual?",44
152,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,But surely Parliament House is not in the same position as an ordinary building.,44
153,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"My point is that, so far as their correspondence is concerned, members aTe in the same position as ordinary citizens. There was no breaking open of the doors 'of this building, no raiding of the place, to get this telegram; according to the statement of the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), it was asked for and given back in the ordinary course.",44

165,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The censor was entitled to see that telegram. He is entitled to see all telegrams that are passing through.

173,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member knows that it is not a misrepresentation. It is to the credit of every Government that has held office that it has properly exercised the censorship.,45
174,Mr JH CATTSI,Unknown,The honourable member is trying to represent that matters of this sort were agreed to by all parties. That statement is not true.,45
175,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am trying to represent nothing^ of the sort.

Any person can make out a case against the censorship as it is being administered at the present time. regret the absence of the Postmaster-General. He might explain why one of his officers, at the dictation of the censor, come to this House and received a telegram back. If there was anything wrong in the telegram, why was it not prevented from being delivered ? Honourable members know what happens when a telegram is delivered during a member's absence. If the House messenger has reason to believe that the member is likely to return soon, he does not telephone the message to his private house, but puts a pin through it and places it outside his correspondence box, so that it may not be covered up by any other documents, and so that it will be seen at once on the member's return to the House. That practice has been followed by messengers of the House for the last seventeen years, and, so far as I know, all the messengers in the employ of Parliament are absolutely impartial, and their dealings with honourable members have been absolutely free of party considerations. Had that telegram been delivered at the private home of the honourable member for Barrier",46
179,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Hi s wife would have opened it, would she not?",46
180,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do not know.,46
181,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! It is impossible for me to follow honourable members speaking when honourable members generally continue to make audible comments. Sometimes the honourable member speaking is unable to get out a single sentence without a series of audible comments from one side or the. other being made. I hope that this practice w l l cease. ;,46
182,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Before leaving the House I have often asked messengers to open any telegranSs that might come addressed to me, and repeat them over the telephone to me, so that I could be in a position to deal with them at once. Probably other honourable members have adopted the some practice. The telegram to the honourable member for Barrier could have been repeated over the telephone to his home.",46
183,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,I was in the chamber at the time.,46
184,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am rather surprised that the telegram was not sent into him in the chamber. Probably the messengers thought that the honourable member I was out of the building, and they placed the message in his box, believing that he has would soon return and get it. The Miuister claims that the Committee, as proposed, does not represent the proportion of parties in the House. I think I can say, on behalf of the honourable member for Barrier, that the Government can appoint their own Committee. So long as they appoint the honourable member affected on the ""Committee they can appoint all the other members of it from their own side.",46
185,Mr GLTNN,Unknown,"The Government might be able to ascertain the facts without the appointment of a Committee. As a matter of fact, the honourable member for Barrier might first have asked a question in regard to the matter.",46
186,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Whil e a Minister was reading a statement this afternoon I saw the honourable member for Barrier in consultation with the Acting Prime Minister. They were sitting together for at least ten minutes, aud I understand that the honourable member supplied the Acting Prime Minister with a statement of the case. I do not know what the Acting Prime Minister said in reply.",46
187,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,He could not give an answer straight away.,46
188,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am aware of that, but I do not think that the Government would do themselves any injury if they acceded to the request which has been made. The Minister for Works and Eailways has said that it is purely a departmental matter-that if the postal authorities thought they had wrongly delivered the telegram, they should have power to recall it. But if the telegram had been wrongly delivered, why should it be redelivered to the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) next day ? I myself have a telegram which came from Sydney yesterday, mutilated in transmission, and bearing an ordinary rubber stamp of the words "" Correctiou to follow."" However, there is no doubt that this telegram was withheld for some reason, and if it was a military reason, why sliould not the honourable member for Barrier be informed what it is?",46
189,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,I do not desire a private explanation.,47
190,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No ; I can quite understand that the honourable member desire3 to have a statement made on the floor of the House. If the military authorities will not allow any telegrams referring to - I do not want to say the "" rounding up "" of Italians ;",47

192,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not .want to use that word either; but if the Department will not permit any telegrams referring to this seizure of Italians, with a view to sending them overseas, let the fact be stated. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) says practically that the censor is right in doing all tliing3 of this kind.",47
193,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I do not say that.,47
194,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"At any rate, the Government are backing up the censor in what he is doing, although the other day the Acting Prime Minister admitted across the table that the way in which the censorship is being administered is absolutely foolish.",47
195,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I pointed out very distinctly that I was discussing the legal questiou as to right; but not the question of the exercise of discretion.,47
196,Mr BOYD,Unknown,Some common sense is wanted in the censor's office.,47
197,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It is badly wanted, for it is one of the worse-administered sections of the Defence Department; and that is saying a great deal. A conference of editors was called by the Government, and it was decided that the only pews prohibited should be military news which might prove advantageous to the enemy or hurtful to our Allies; but immediately after that conference I showed in this House that the censorship was being used for personal military reasons-military friendship reasons, as they might be called. The statement. I made was censored; but when I handed it to the Acting Prime Minister, he said there was absolutely nothing in it that was not innocuous. At the Conference at Government House, when the question of the censorship was under discussion, and several cases were cited, the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) said he did not stand there as a protagonist for the censor, and that if he had been in my position he would have said much stronger things than I had done. On that occasion the Premier of New South Wale3 instanced a case where the censorship had been used for political reasons, and a further instance was provided later by the Prime Minister himself, who had caused a statement made in the Senate by. Senator Millen to be censored because he, the Prime Minister, wished to deliver it himself subsequently in the House of Representatives. At the Conference Mr Holman asked the Prime Minister whether it was true that he had used the censorship for such a purpose, and the Prime-Minister admitted that he had. It is safe to say that there was not one man at that Conference who could defend the action of the censors. If there is a vote taken on this motion, I hope it will not be on party lines; but that honourable members will act in accordance with what they consider to be right. As to the case cited particularly by the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), the censor could easily have obtained a copy of the telegram from the postal authorities.",47
198,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Was the telegram subsequently delivered ?,47
199,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Yes .,47
200,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,What is the explanation ?,47
201,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"There is no explanation; and now the Government refuses an inquiry,",47
202,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"How many days .afterwards was the telegram, delivered?",47
203,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Not until after the House adjourned on the Friday.,47
204,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"And it was received on the Thursday night. For the benefit of honourable members, who were not present when the honourable member for Barrier made his statement, I may say that the telegram, consisting of thirtyseven words, was despatched from Broken Hill on the Thursday at 4.45 p.m., and was received here at 6»50 p.m. That was in the dinner-hour, when, I believe, the telegraph office in the building is open. At any rate, even if the telegram had to come from the General Post Office, it ought to have been here before 8 o'clock; but, as we know, the honourable member did not receive it until the following day. The telegram was taken by a messenger here in the ordinary course of his work, and pinned on to the door of the honourable member's locker. If the censor .did think it necessary to keep a copy of the telegram, surely the member for the distinct had the right to know what was going on, so that he might make inquiries from the Acting Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence? In these matters, we sliould do everything to avoid creating cases of hardship, and causing dissension in the community. Here, however, these .miners, in their working clothes, were seized, and, without being given an opportunity to go to their homes, sent away by train on to Melbourne, and, I presume, on to Sydney. Surely all the circumstances show good - reason for in quiry. - Sir ROBERT BEST - Was it the who did all this ?",47
205,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"There was no one else who could have done it . We all know that not a word that is said here or elsewhere in reference to the seizures of Italians is allowed to appear in any newspaper in Australia. The reporters upstairs, and in the Inter-State press galleries, will not report one line of this debate; and that is according to the in structions that have gone forth . All the same, the whole* of the debate will appear in the 7,500 copies of Hansard that are circulated. It would appear really that all this is done by direction of the M in ister for Defence, because it is a military matter; but in the case of a member's telegram, it is surely not for the Minister to act in the way he has. The Government really make a confession of weakness when they refuse an in quiry, because this shows that they feel there may be something to hide: The Minister for Works and Railways ' takes the attitude that there is no need for an inquiry, and speaks of the composition of the suggested Committee; but if the honourable gentleman likes, let him stipulate for five members of the Committee from the Government side, always provided the honourable member for Barrier is appointed with them. What has occurred in the case of the honourable member for Barrier today may occur to any honourable member tomorrow; and I ask the House to approve of a Select Committee, so that we may have an inquiry, and, perhaps, some common sense instilled into the censor's department.",48
206,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Perth) [ 5 . 4 9 ] - If the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) has made no mistake about the information he has placed before the House, I have no hesitation in saying that there has been a breach of the privileges of members. I cannot understand how a telegram delivered to a member's private box can be withdrawn by any authority outside Parliament. I understand that not even the Postmaster-General or any of his officials can demand back a letter or telegram that has been handed to the pemson to whom it was addressed. Therefore, if any House attendant gave out a telegram to anybody he committed an error of judgment. B ut the ugliest feature of censor the case is that the telegram could have no military significance whatever, and if the censor has prevented the telegram from being delivered to the honourable member it would appear that either he has been acting outside his definite in structions, or for some reason or other those instructions have, in this case at any rate, exceeded what are usually regarded as the directions to be followed by the censors throughout Australia. To my mind, it is a very serious matter in deed that a telegram sent by electors in any part of Australia should be withheld from their member in the manner in which this telegram is reported .to have been withheld. Therefore, I feel that some inquiry into this matter is highly necessary. I do not wish to discuss the censorship at large. Undoubtedly it has not been too well managed in the past, and blunders and excesses have been committed which in ordinary circumstances would not be tolerated for a moment. Many instances of the ineptitude of the censorship have been brought under my notice, but I have refrained from dealing with them, except to make a protest privately in regard to some incidents. But the matter before the House is one which we cannot afford to ignore altogether. I do not agree, however, that an inquiry such as has been suggested is the proper course to adopt. You , Mr . Speaker, are the custodian of the rights and privileges of Parliament, and I feelsure that if the matter is left in your hands you will inquire into it and report upon the facts as you find them. If you report that an outrage such as the honourable member for Barrier has complained of has been committed, I shall be prepared to take sucb action as is necessary, and I presume that the maj o r it y of members will be prepared to assert the privileges of Parliament, even against the Government, if necessary, though I do not think that the Government has anything to do with this matter. The incident which was related to us today is but another illustration of the ofnciousness and in eptitude of this wretched branch of the Defence Department, which apparently is allowed an almost unlimited length of rope* I shall not vote for the motion for the reasons I have stated, but shall await with interest the report of Mr Speaker, and if he advises to the effect I have indicated I shall be prepared to take any steps that may be necessary to vindicate Parliament against outrages of this kind.",48
207,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [5.55] I should have thought that if there is any matter at all that might be discussed apart from the limitation of party bias, is the question of the privileges of honourable members, not because of the special claims which honourable members make for themselves, but because of their representative character, and because-and this is a reason which should appeal to the Government-the preservation of parliamentary privileges is one of the oldest and most highly respected traditions of British parliamentary government. If the facts stated by the honourable member for Barrier are correct, does the action of the censor constitute a breach of parliamentary privilege ? I cannot but believe that the Minister addressed himself to this question as though he sat at the table with a brief handsomely marked to expound the views of the party which had retained him rather than as one in whom was reposed the trust of putting the question fairly before honourable members. It is alleged that a telegram addressed to an honourable member was conveyed by the ordinary and proper methods to this House, and placed on the private box of that honourable member by a House messenger. For all practical purposes the telegram was delivered to the honourable member in the House for parliamentary use. Subsequently that telegram was taken from off the honourable member's box, and we are told that that action was not a breach of privilege. I do not believe that the Minister would stake his legal reputation on the contention that the removal of that telegram does not constitute a breach of one of the recognised privileges of Parliament. One of the basic privileges of honourable members is that nothing must be done within the precincts of Parliament to interfere with the deliberations of honourable members. To-day we have an allegation that a document which might have been, and probably was, of the first importance to the deliberations of honourable members was impounded by » some exterior body, purloined, and taken away. It is quite clear to me that if correspondence may be taken from the box of an honourable member, members themselves may be intercepted on their 1 way to the debating chamber, and documents which they hold for reproduction in the House may be impounded, their remarks made sterile and useless, and members themselves rendered in that way incapable of stating the views of themselves and their constituents. Nothing, can be clearer than that the action of the it censor was a direct interference with the fundamental right .of honourable members to address themselves to any question in this House. It is said that we have not proved that the telegram was removed other than perhaps in thp ordinary way by a representative of the Postmaster General's Department. All that the honourable member for Barrier has to do is to make out a good primd facie case in order to establish his r i g h t ' to an inquiry of some sort.",49
208,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Who restored the telegram ?,49
209,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,I do not know; it was in my box.,49
210,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"H as the honourable member a good primd facie case ? A telegram came to the House relating to a matter which the censor says may not be referred to outside of the House, namely, the forcible deportation of Italians. We have protested against the refusal of the authorities to allow the matter to be discussed outside of Parliament; we have said that it ought to be so discussed. But the censor, in the exercise of his autocratic powters, and utilizing a subservient Minister for his own purpose, has decided that the matter must neither be discussed outside nor referred to in' any publication other than Hansard. That was the subject-matter of the telegram which was addressed to the honourable member for Barrier. That is the first suspicious fact in establishing the honourable - primd facie case. The second fact is that, with but one precedent in this House, a document belonging to an honourable member was seized and taken away, and this constitutes the thir d ground of the honourable member's case, and it is, that the only similar abuse that has been perpetrated was when officers of the censorship removed from this building the papers belonging to the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts).",49
211,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,We do not have a war like this every year.,50
212,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"We do not. And , as another honourable member interjects, "" T h a n k the Lord for that "" - for many reasons, and, amongst others, for the fact that this war has been made by members of the present Government the excuse for the exercise of party politics through the censorship in a peculiarly ignoble way. The three points I have mentioned are the basis of the honourable member's prima facie case. The mere fact that a document belonging to an honourable member has been taken away is in itself ground for inquiry. The matter referred to in the telegram is one which the censorship had prevented from being mentioned outside of Parliament; that is another ground for inquiry. And the delivery of the telegram was delayed until after the House rose on Friday last, and until the wtork in connection with tha arrest of Italians had been accomplished. I should like very much to have the hist o r y of those telegrams placed before the House. Migh t we not well know who came to the House and took away a document belonging to the honourable member for - Barrier ? Migh t we not well know where one of these telegrams was typewritten, and where the mysterious words, ""Entered E.T.O. and issued 4.15 p . m . "" were written upon it? I think it is clear enough that one of these telegrams was issued from the censor's office. What we have to submit to at the hands of the censor in connection with non-parliamentary publications is bad enough, but it is useless for us to blame the censorship staff. I do not blame them. I know that some honourable members have applied to the censor for permission to prin t certain things. I shall never demean myself by approaching the censor for permission to print anything. I hold the Government entirely responsible for all that the censor has done, and for having for the first member'3 time in British history played the party game by the exencise of the military machine. And the most potent arm of that machine is that by which they have hidden away the opinions of men who differ from them. The Minister has said that the honourable member for Barrier has not technically made out a case of breach of privilege, and that he could quote page, section, and verse from May to show that the honourable member has not proceeded in the proper way to establish the charge which he has brought forward. Whether that be so or not, is it not worthwhile to get at the history of a matter that threatens the basis of parliamentary government and the rights of the people outside? A f t e r all, we are only the spokesmen of the people: We do not ask for privileges for ourselves, but we do ask for them as representatives of the people, and for that reason I hope that the Government will drop their severely technical attitude on this matter and endeavour to arrive at the t r u th of a scandal that threatens the. well-being cf our parliamentary institutions.",50
213,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Kooyong) [6.3]. - The honourable member who has just resumed his seat went far beyond the question which is directly involved in the case mentioned by the honourable member for Barrier; indeed, the motion itself exceeds the particular allegation of breach of privilege which the House has been asked to consider. The honourable member for Barrier has assumed two things: firstly, that the action complained of was taken by the censor; whether that is so or not I cannot say, and he cannot give us any information on the subject. His second assumption is that there was bad faith on the part of the Government.",50
214,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,I say that they are responsible for the action of the censor.,50
215,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"The honourable member seemed to go further, and to directly charge the Government with bad faith in the'matter. He seemed to charge them with having, for their own purposes, deliberately delayed the delivery of. this telegram. To that extent he has largely spoilt his case. In the discussion of this matter we are very much in the dark. It seems extraordinary that such an incident should have occurred; and I quite agree that it should form the subject of ' inquiry, so that we may ascertain what the facts are. I understand that Mr . Speaker is prepared to make an inquiry, and after we have received his report on the facts, we 'should be able to decide whether a breach of privilege has been committed.",50
216,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,But Mr Speaker's jurisdiction does not extend far enough.,51
217,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Hi s jurisdiction would enable him to ascertain the facts with regard to this telegram, and it is the facts that we desire to elicit.",51
218,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Bu the cannot inquire into the actions of the censor.,51
219,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"He could ascertain the time at which the telegram was delivered, the reason why it was taken away, by whose instructions it was removed, and whether or not there was direct intervention on the part of the censor. .These are all matters upon which we need to have some information before arriving at a determination. The orable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) desires, however, to go far beyond the facts relating to his own particular case. His motion is a distinct reflection upon the Government, and one that they could not in any circumstances accept. It proposes, not a direct inquiry as to whether a breach of privilege has taken place in his own case, but an inquiry into the whole question of the censorship, for which the Government are directly responsible.",51
220,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,And I also want to know why my letters from Broken Hill are not delivered in the morning instead of in the afternoon.,51
221,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"We are entitled to know whether any breach of privilege has been committed. If there has been a breach of privilege, then the honourable member has, of course, a right to complain. His motion, however, is in direct contravention of the decision of the House upon a motion submitted a little while ago, in which a similar inquiry was demanded. If my honourable friend desires an inquiry into his case, which seems extraordinary and anomalous, he has a right to have it . Mr Speaker has undertaken to make an inquiry, since the matter comes directly within his jurisdiction.",51
222,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Hi s inquiry will only substantiate my statements with regard to the action of officers of this House.,51
223,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"But the honourable member has gone further, and has charged the censor with having removed his private correspondence from this House. We have a right to learn whether the seizure was by direction of the censor or not. On the face of it , the telegram seems to be quite innocuous; but before we can arrive at a determination, the facts must be ascertained. I would therefore urge the honourable member to withdraw his motion, and to leave the making of the inquiry to Mr Speaker.",51
224,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,What inquiry could - he make into the censor's actions ?,51
225,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,He could report whether or not the telegram was handed back by direction of the censor.,51
226,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"And if it were found that such was the case, would honourable members opposite support the request for a Committee of Inquiry ?",51
227,Mr BOYD,Unknown,I would.,51
228,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"In that event there would be cast upon the Government hon- .the responsibility of giving the matter very full consideration. I understand .that the Acting Prime Minister has already made such a promise in regard to the censorship. T can only say, in conclusion, that this House has a right to be placed in possession of the facts before it is asked to determine whether or not any breach of privilege has been committed.",51
229,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," Apar t from the matter. of complaint which is the basis of the motion now before the House, I have no hesitation in saying that once a letter or telegram has been placed in any honourable member's correspondence-box in this House, no one is entitled to interfere with it without the consent of the Speaker or of the honourable member to whom it is addressed. Whether there has been such interference in this case, I am unable at present to say; but, quite apart from any decision' which the House may arrive at concerning this motion, I shall deem it my duty, in the light of the honourable member's statement, to have an independent inquiry into the whole of the circumstances, so far as the officers of the House are concerned. Beyond that, of course, I cannot go. „",51
230,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [6.15] It cannot be denied that once a telegram has been delivered, and has so passed out of the custody of the telegraph office, it is the property of the individual to whom it is addressed. In this case the telegram was delivered to a messenger in this House. Subsequently a telegraph messenger, I understand, was sent along by some one to ask for the return of the telegram, and by this trick it was secured. If it bad been delivered to the honourable member's private resideuce, it would, no doubt, have been opened.immediately, and action could have been taken upon it. When honourable members are away from home they usually arrange for some one to open any telegrams addressed to them. The return of this message was secured by a trick worthy of the vile system of censorship in operation here. I do not blame the omcers. They have to carry out their instructions; it is the vile system of censorship of which I complain. We all know how strict is the control exercised by the Post and Telegraph Department over a letter or any postal matter intrusted to it for delivery. On two occasions I have had to take action to secure the return of a letter after it had been posted. In one case it was most important that the letter should not be delivered. I secured its return to the person who had posted it, but only with the greatest difficulty. The sender had to make a sworn declaration before he could have it handed over to him, and, having made the desired alterations in it, he once more posted it. If the Postmaster-General's Department exercises such strict control over a letter once it is placed in - a pillar box, is it not reasonable to expect equal care in the delivery of a telegram? In this case the telegram had been delivered. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) indulged in a legal quibble",51
231,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I suppose the honourable member is aware that the law holds that the posting of a letter is proof of its delivery to the person to whom it is addressed?,52
232,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I thank my honourable friend, whom I regard as a jurist, for his interjection. The safe custody of letters intrusted to it for delivery is regarded by the Postal Department as a sacred duty. When two Italians lost their lives owing to interference with letters in the British Post Office, the Mr Gladstone, in a most eloquent - declared that he would take steps to see that the proper care of a letter, once was posted, should be regarded as a duty of the Department. I do not know of what the Government are afraid in - case. Are they seeking to hide something of which they are ashamed? Honourable members will admit that the censorship is at times not ouly cruel but absolutely idiotic. The censor in Sydney will allow newspapers to publish matter which the censor in Melbourne will not permit to be published here, and vice versa. Sometimes the great daily newspapers publish a paragraph in defiance of the censor, and not much notice is taken of their action; but if some little newspaper, struggling for existence, dares to do anything of the kind, its publisher is fined. The managers of the Sydney Bulletin recently said to the censor, "" If you will not allow this matter to be published, our paper will not go out."" The result was that the censor did not dare to carry out his threat. I recognise that in time of war a censorship may be of great use; but it ought to be administered in a sensible way. The Minister for Works and Bailways cannot,by mere sophistry or legal quibbles, get away from the facts. There can be no doubt that two mistakes have been made in this case. Every honourable member will agree that censorship of any postal matter should take place before delivery of that matter. If the censor found he had made a mistake, and did not want the honourable membeT for Barrier to have . this information, there was a certain course open to him. These Italians have beeu treated in an infamous way. It is an infamy that they should have been removed from Broken Hill without preparation, herded in second class carriages without any attention being paid to their food requirements, and not allowing their wives, possibly Australian-born girls, to have five minutes in which to say good-bye to them. This is what has happened in a country which on two occasions has declared against conscription, and will, when it has the opportunity, replace members opposite by others of a different opinion. The Government has allowed itseK to be made the tool of the Italian Government.",52
233,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I ask the honourable member speech, not to go into that question.",52
234,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"The importance of it the telegram is known to every member sacred who heard it read. Could any more generous offer be made than that of the this Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), who said, -''Let the Government appoint a Committee of six members, choosing if it likes five of its own supporters, the sixth to be the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine)."" Sooner or later the party of the minority becomes the party of the majority, and what members opposite do now may recoil on them in the future. A Government supported by a large majority does not always hold the balance level, and of late this Government has not been doing so. I remember the days when Liberalism was honoured in the Parliament of Victoria, and every member of that body would have supported the Speaker in such noble and splendid action as yours, Mr Speaker, in connection with the recent case of privilege; but the majority differed from me on the occasion to which I refer. I do not know what will happen in this instance ; but members will regret any whittling away of the privileges of Parliament. I do not look at this matter from a party point' of view. At a time like this, much should be excused, but that should make the Government the more careful to do justice to all. If it were widely known that telegrams and letters are not safe from interference after delivery to the addressee, the public would complain bitterly. Even, the press has spoken definitely, though guardedly, of the infamyof the censorship, although the large newspapers have beeu given privileges which, have been denied to the small newspapers. Members generally will admit that all newspapers should be treated alike; but the small newspapers have been rigorously kept down. I know from actual knowledge that the officers of the Censor's Department in Victoria and in New South ""Wales regret some of the orders which' they have to obey, and would not act as they do except under compulsion. But they have to carry out their duties. I have never received anything but the utmost courtesy from these omcers, who have not personally resented criticism in most severe terms. They have told me that the orders which they receive are sometimes such as they think should not be given. I was* glad to hear you say, Mr Speaker, that you will have an inquiry made. I corrected the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), because I knew that he was speaking in error. I shall vote for the inquiry, as I shall always vote for an inquiry where Dr Maloney. a wrong is alleged to have been committed. Every member, without regard to political opinions, should support the proposal of the honourable member for Barrier. To-morrow it may be a member opposite who may have cause for complaint. Should the motion not be' carried, a majority of the House may, after your inquiry, Mr Speaker, feel that a further inquiry should be made to ascertain who used a telegraph messenger to regain by a trick a telegram which had been delivered at this building.",52
235,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.2S to l.lfi p.m.,53
236,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [7.45]. - I was very pleased to hear Mr Speaker define his duties in respect to guarding zealously the privileges of honourable members of this House, and his statement concerning the limitations of his power to deal with the matter raised by the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine). It makes the case of the honourable member all the stronger, and shows that the honourable member's motion should command the sympathetic support of honourable members opposite. The suggested personnel of the Committee indicates that tliere is no intention of making this matter a party question; and as the expressions of honourable members con-' cerning the censorship show that there is general dissatisfaction in regard to it, it would be a wise step on the part of the House to have an inquiry into it based upou the grievance set out by the honourable member for Barrier. ' The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) seemed to be under the impression that Mr Speaker had adopted a certain attitude which really was not the attitude assumed by him. Mr Speaker has intimated that he merely intends to make inquiries regarding the fact that an officer of the House may have had something to do with the removal of a telegram from the box of the honourable member for Barrier, and find out who is to blame in that regard. But there, so far as he is concerned, the matter must stop. We want it to go further. Our complaint is not against a messenger of the House, who may have done something on the spur of the moment.",53
237,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Mr Speaker's investigation would indicate who directed the messenger to take away the telegram again.,53
238,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The suggestion of the honourable member seems to be a method of side-tracking the real issue. It also it means delay, one of those delays which are dangerous. Even the honourable memfrom ber will admit that he is not satisfied placed by the censor. We never know with the manner in which the censorship is being conducted. I know that he will not commit himself to an affirmative reply to my suggestion, but I can take it that his silence and his smile mean his consent.",54
239,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,I doubt very much that the censor did anything such as the honourable member for Barrier claims has done.,54
240,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I have not much up doubt about it. At any rate, the truth could very easily be elicited by the prodition, posed committee, and whatever may be done will be done not only in the inin terests of honourable members of this of every community. House, but also in the interests of the public g3nerally. Every reputable jourfashion nal in Australia has complained from time to time of the peculiar methods adopted by the censor, and yet the Goairy vernment allow him to continue in his and Railways received the motion. course of action, not only robbing honortried able members of privileges, but also fobbing the public and the press of privicept leges which they have enjoyed from time immemorial. Of course, every one admotion mits that there are things which should not be published from the house-tops, and that the publication of things ""which would help the enemy or forward injure us in the conduct of the have war should not be allowed, but it seems to mauy of us that the censor is employ Mr. ing certain methods as if he were using a political arm. It is strange that all the complaints come from this side of the House; it is strange that if any docuso, ments are scrutinized or detained the sufferers are always members on side of the House. Outside it is just the same - All the prosecutions are against the facts. men on our side of politics. Everything is done to deprive us of privileges which tion of tbem. we have enjoyed. If honourable members opposite were on this side of the chamber they would be much more vociferous in raising complaints than we are against the treatment which is being meted out to us. The honourable member for Barrier has brought forward a substantial grievance. More than that, it is a substantial wrong against an honourable member on this side of the House, and is the duty of every honourable member to come to his assistance and release him the position in which he has been 7 when the censor may make a slip. I could understand the honourable member: for Kooyong making things very lively if a letter of his were detained. Things are done in Australia which are not tolerated or done in Great Britain. The freest discussion is permitted in New Zealand, not only inside the Dominion Parliament, he but also among the public outside. Advice was recently given and published at Christchunch to men' who had been called in batches which, if it had been given in Australia, would have been called' seand would have led to arrests all round. The freest discussion is permitted New Zealand. It JS the safety valve It is time we inquired into the peculiar in which the oensor has dealt with many of the matters that have come before him. I complain of the light and way in which the Minister for Works He to side-track it. He tried a form of special pleading. He tried everything exarguments dealing with the special point at issue. When such an' important was submitted to the House, if the Miuister in charge for the time being was not prepared on behalf of the Government to consent to the request put in that motion, surely he could suggested some other method of inquiry but that of referring the matter to Speaker, whose powers in that direction are so limited. We believe that the Speaker will zealously guard the privileges of the House so far as he is able to do but his arm is not long enough nor is it strong enough to go outside the House this and bring the censor to book.",54
241,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,He can inquire into,54
242,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Onl y into a small por,54
243,Mr CORSER,Unknown,The officer of the House can say where he got his instructions.,54
244,Mr FENTON,Unknown,But we must go further than that. The honourable member in making his suggestion admits that there is something in this matter beyond the mere action on the part of a messenger the House.,54
245,Mr CORSER,Unknown,The honourable member could have obtained that information by applying for it at the Postal Department.,55
246,Mr FENTON,Unknown,It is not the post office that is concerned. We believe that the Defence authorities had something to with the matter. The censor* is under control of the Minister for Defence.,55
247,Mr CORSES,Unknown,There is no evidence that the censor did - it.,55
248,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"If the honourable member will do us the justice of voting for an inquiry he will very soon ascertain who was responsible, and when he does I betion. lieve that he will be one of the first to say that the main who would do such thing should be displaced from his position.",55
249,Mr CORSER,Unknown,Mr Speaker will find i out just as quickly.,55
250,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I have endeavoured to point out that Mr Speaker by his clear and concise statement has shown was prepared to inquire fully into the inatter, because a complaint had been made in regard to an officer of but that all he could do was to report that an officer had done something at request of some other person'.",55
251,Mr CORSER,Unknown,That is what the honorof able member wishes to ascertain.,55
252,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"We wish to ascertain who that other person is. If it came to the point that some person-the cenour correspondence. sor, to wit-wa s responsible - for a certain official, either of the Defence ment or of the Postal Department, making a request of a messenger of the House, method. would the honourable member be prepared to vote for another Committee to take further action ?",55
253,Mr CORSER,Unknown,I think it is very probable that further 'action' would be taken. afterwards.,55
254,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"There should be no indefiniteness about the nature of the action to be taken. We are in possession of certain knowledge which shows that there is need for further inquiry than that which Mr Speaker ;can make, and that the House should consent to the proposal put forward by the honourable member Barrier, or amend it so that the information we desire to obtain may A very magnanimous and generous offer has been made by the Leader of the position. We are so far removed from making this a party question, and so of sirous of having a proper inquiry made in regard to this very unjustifiable interference with a member's correspondence, that he has told the Government that if they make the committee a committee of six they can have five members on it , or that they can have six members if there do are seven members on the committee. If the honourable members are desirous of putting a stop to interference with members' correspondence, - they should certainly assent to this proposal. Nobody i can make a party question out of it .",55
255,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,It is not a members' question so much as it is a people's ques,55
256,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"That is true. We are a here as representatives of the people; .we are their mouthpieces. If we are denied the right to receive information sent t to us for the purpose of ventilating certain grievances and hardships inflicted on any section of the community, surely it is a serious interference with the deliberathat he tions of this House.",55
257,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"The honourable member is premature. The case has not been the House, proved against the censor.",55
258,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Is the honourable the member prepared to consent to such a condition of affairs? Surely the morale our Parliament has descended to a low ebb when we are ready to allow an outside man, under the control of the military authorities, to do what he likes with",55
259,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Let us first have Depart Mr Speaker's report.,55
260,Mr CORSER,Unknown,That is the proper,55
261,Mr FENTON,Unknown,It is not the proper method. Mr Speaker has already pointed out how far he can go.,55
262,Mr CORSER,Unknown,Then we can go further,55
263,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Will we? The honourable member thinks that if he can put this off a day or two that the honourable member for Barrier may forget to bring it up again, and as the time is so short before the end of the present sittings of - the for House, he may let it go altogether.",55
264,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"He may be censored be elicited. himself by that time. M f . FENTON - There is no telling. OpA n honourable member who may be coming into the chamber witha letter or a depiece of information in his hand, which has just reached him in the previous postal delivery from his constituency, may be accosted in the ""corridor, and told t h at he has a letter in his hand from suchand-such a person, and must deliver it up. He may be compelled to do so by moral suasion, or by force, or perhaps a military contingent may demand its surrender. We are\ frittering away our privileges, and we are very foolish if we permit it . From every section of the community there is a cry for delivery from til© iron heel of the censor. The censorship was one of the matters dealt with at the recent Conference at Government House, and a promise was made that the community would be delivered from its undue rigour; but, so far from there being any relief, it is found that members' telegrams and letters are not safe, although these may be necessary in the performance of their parliamentary duties. We are com>ing to a sorry pass when this kind of thin g is tolerated. The Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn), who is at present in charge of the House, is admittedly prepared to deal out even-handed justice; and I appeal to him, as a member of the "" Cabinet of all the talents,"" to see that the promise made at that Conference is kept. It is about time that the M in istry set out to honour some of their promises, and this promise in particular. We on this side seem to be the chief sufferers, since the great volume of critiaism and corn-plaint comes from the Labour side. I do not know whether we are made the special subjects of the censor's efforts, but it would appear that the honourable member for Barrier, who has often complained, is beiug made to "" sit up . "" Personally, I cannot account for the \vay in which that honourable member has been treated.",55
265,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"They have made me < c stand up.""",56
266,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"And the honourable member has stood up, not only for his own rights, but for the rights of every member of the House. I hope that the Ministry will not treat the matter lightlv, and that honourable members on both sides will, in fairness to the House and the public, make an effort to mitigate the unjust methods of the censor by sanctioning a thorough inquiry.",56
267,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon) [ 8 . 3 ] - I am glad to hear the announcement of Mr . Speaker that, now the matter has been brought under his notice, he will have it sifted, so far as his powers go, and make a report to the House. Undoubtedly, the facts as disclosed by the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) involve a breach of privilege; and as to the justification or otherwise of that breach, it is for the Government to explain. The Ministry, or some one on their behalf, should have immediately shown a disposition to guard the interests of members, and show how far we are protected by our privileges. A telegram attached to the private locker of a member must be said to be in lids possession, and, if it is removed, it is taken from his possession. Two courses were open to the honourable member for Barrier: one to get in touch with Mr Speaker and the Leader of the Government, or with the Deputy Postmaster-General, whose contract it was to deliver the telegram, and ascertain why the delivery had been cancelled. I do not say what course the honourable member should have taken, but these were the two open to him.",56
268,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,I did the same as did the authorities- I took direct action.,56
269,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"That I can quite understand, seeiing that the honourable member is an apostle of "" direct action "" ; at any rate, he should have taken steps to vindicate the rights of honourable members. This is not a party question, for what is the case of the honourable member for Barrier today may be the case of any other honourable member tomorrow. I do not know the circumstances under which the telegram wa3 withdrawn.",56
270,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Neithe r do .we.,56
271,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"That is all the more reason why we are all interested in seeing that, if the privileges of members are transgressed, there should be good reason given. If the subject-matter of the telegram was in any way suspect, it is for the censor, through the Government, to say so here. There is no honourable member worth his ' s a l t ' ' who wpuld allow a 1 telegram to be taken from his private box without ""raising Cain,"" for if such action is not a breach of privilege, I do not know what is. However, Mr . Speaker, I accept your assurance that you will have the matter full y investigated, and report to the House.

Question so resolved in the negative. WARLOANBILL (No. 3). In Committee (Consideration resumed from 24th May, vide page 5139) : Clause 2Tlie Treasurer ma}' from time to time, under the provisions of the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911-1915, or under the provisions of any Act authorizing the issue of Treasury bills, borrow moneys not exceeding in the whole the sum of £80,000,000.",56
272,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [8.15] I move as an amendment That the following words be added to the clause :- "" Provided that no further flotation shall take place until it has been ascertained, by proclamation or other effective means, what amount of money is obtainable ior war purposes free of interest."" We have not been given any information by the Government as to the conditions upon which this money, is to be raised, except that the interest earned by the . . 13 subscribers to the loan will be subject . . 28 to income tax. No information has been given as to the rate of interest. Mr.'CORSER - Can the honourable memATES. ber say what will be the state of the money market at any particular time ?",57
273,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"No ; but the honourable member and others have voted for a fixed rate of interest from time to time. For all loans but the last, the rate of interest was fixed at 4£ per cent, free NOES. of income tax, and the last was floated on the alternative conditions of 4£ per cent, free of income tax, or 5 per cent, subject to taxation. Honourable members know if we had had to go upon the Loudon market at any time during the last twelve months we should have been obliged to pay more than 4J per cent., and I contend that the Government should intimate to the House what rate of interest they propose to allow, and not wait for the interest to be fixed by the fluctuations of the market. If honourable members will peruse some of the recent legisPAIKS. lation in New Zealand, they will see that the Dominion Government propose much more rigorous conditions in connection withfinance than have been attempted in Australia. In the course of his 1917 Budget, Sir Joseph Ward, the Treasurer of the Dominion, said that if rich people did not contribute according to their means compulsory conditions would be in troduced. Evidently he has not been satisfied that many rich people have contributed as generously as they should have done, for in his latest Finance Bill he has included a provision which will make it compulsory for persons receiving more than a stated income to contribute, and such compulsory contributors, in stead of receiving 4^ per cent, interest, will be allowed only 3 per cent., and will be charged double income tax and land tax as a penalty. We do not hear of any such legislation being proposed in this Parliament, but a fear has been expressed that the withdrawal of immunity from taxation will make this loan less attractive, and that it may not be full y subscribed. We can relieve ourselves of all trouble and anxiety on that score by adopting the method proposed in New Zealand, and if rich people will not come forward with their money we can compel them to do so.  supported previous loans to which was attached 4£ per cent, free of income tax.",57
274,Mr FENTON,Unknown,There is no reason why a man who finds that he has made a mistake should not retrace his steps.  would the honourable member fix ?,58
275,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"My amendment will give the rich people of the country an opportunity to show their patriotism by lending money to the Commonwealth free of interest. To-day Australia is in serious financial straits, but much blacker times are ahead of us, and we have a right to ask some of those who can best afford to do so to come to the assistance of the Government, in this time of storm and stress, by subscribins; generously out of the abundance of their riches, without asking for an interest return. If they will not do that, their professions of patriotism must be regarded as only so much froth . I know that I shall be reminded of the total sum contributed voluntarily to the patriotic funds. But the time has come for us to put a straight-out proposition to the people: ""Others are going to the Front, and endangering their lives. Some have already made the extreme sacrifice. What are you prepared to do?"" The amendment will afford an opportunity for the Treasurer to say that he will endeavour to raise the next loan free of interest.  orable member prepared to subscribe free of interest ?",58
276,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"As much as any other member of the community, according to my means.",58
277,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,"I believe that every member on this side of the House would, contribute to a loan on those terms.",58
278,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I do not believe in people boasting of their patriotism in subscribing to war loans when they are earning 4 \ per cent, free of income tax. Australia could have no better advertisement than that millions of pounds had flowed into a war loan upon which no interest was to be paid. Mr Rodgers. - The honourable member has even now an opportunity of surrendering his interest.",58
279,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Yes ; but I am afraid that, unless some pressure is brought to bear, the people will not respond. In New Zealand, no man receiving less than £300 a year is called upon to pay income tax, and no man with land of an unimproved value of less than £500 is required to pay land tax. Sir Joseph Ward said, when speaking on his Finance Bill , that no man receiving less than £700 per annum would be brought under the compulsory clause, but a ll i u receipt of incomes above that amount, if they did not contribute a fair, quota to the loans, would be called upon to do so compulsorily. And, as far as I am able to judge, the financial position of New Zealand is muchBetter than that of Australia. Dark times are ahead of us, and now is the time for us to commence to make sacrifices. I submit ir..y amendment to the Committee with confidence. I hope it will be carried unanimously, and that we shall all go out recruiting for money, as well as for men to go to the Front.",58
280,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Y a r r a ) [ 8 . 2 8 ] - I agree with the mover of the amendment that we ought to have a statement from the Treasurer as to what rate of interest the Government propose to allow in connection with this loaji. When considering previous Loan Bills, honourable members had the advantage of having the prospectus before them. During the discussion on the last Loan Bill , the advisability of making the income from in terest free of taxation was questioned, and probably as a result of the views then expressed the Treasurer announced that the most recent flotation was the last to which that inducement would attacli. Later, he repeated in this House that the Government did not propose to float further loans the interest upon which should be free of income tax. I think that something might be done in the direction suggested by the amendment. During the debate on the second reading, the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) referred to the dividends paid by certain companies, and the number of shareholders who participated. It is well known that one of the companies to which he referred, namely, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, has a provident fund to which every permanent employee has to contribute on a percentage basis, and the bulk of the f u n d is invested in shares in the company. The chances are that few, if any, of the employees would hold one full share, yet every employee who is a registered member of the provident fund would probably be accounted a shareholder. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) and others interested in the sugar industry know that what I say is correct.",58
281,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Eac h employee is a shareholder, but holds an interest in the company. He gets no dividends.",59
282,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Quite so. The dividends payable in respect of their shares go into the provident fund. It will probably be found, however, that in the ret u r n read by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) all the registered members of the provident fund appear as shareholders.",59
283,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Has the honourable member any information to that effect, or is it a mere suspicion that he is voicing ?",59
284,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am basing my statement on information obtained by the Sugar Commission. There has never been such a complete return of the income and assets of the community as that made in connection with the war census in 1915, when it was said that something might be done in the direction of a levy on the wealth of the community. At page 107 of Mr Knibbs' Pocket Compendium of Australian Statistics for 1918 it is stated that 2,191,945 residents of Australia made returns of wealth and income under the War Census Act. If I 'remember rightly every person over eighteen years of age was required to furnish a return, and opAy those under eighteen who were in possession of either income or of a certain amount of assets were compelled to do so. Of this total of 2,191,945 persons only 381,558, or a little less than, one-fifth, vvere in receipt of £156 per year aiid upwards; more than four-fifths were receiving less than £ 3 per week. I find, on analyzing the figures given by Mr . Knibbs, that of this total 840,400 males malting returns were receiving over £ 1 0 0 a year, and 539,808 were receiving under £100 pef annum, and only 92,563 females' were receiving over £ 1 0 0 a year, while 719,174 were receiving less than £10 0 a year. At page 108 Mr Knibbs gives the aggregate income of these '2,191,945 persons at £240,163,204. Of amount £124,567,113 was enjoyed by persons who were in receipt of over £156 per year, or, in other words, twoelevenths of the persons making returns got more tlian one-half of the inconie of this country, and nine-elevenths - the great, bulk of the people-ha d less than one-half of it . At page 113 of the Compendium the total assets of the community, as shown by the war census returns, are given. The return sets out the not aggregate net assets of persons resident in Australia, exclusive of the value of in terests in trust estates, insurance and annuity policies, and prospective benefits from friendly societies and trade unions, which are included under another heading. Mr Knibbs shows that the aggregate net assets of the community at the time the census was taken were of the value of £1,216,231,662. Of that amount £1,062,648,708, or more than five-sixths of the total, was held by persons possessing assets of the value of £500 aud upwards. In short, less than one-sixth of the total number of persons making returns held more than' five-sixths of the assets. The bulk of the people of Australia, however, did not make returns. When you want to find large families you do not go to Toorak or Malvern, Hawthorn or Kew, but to the industrial suburbs,of Footscray, Collingwood, Fitzroy, and Brunswick. These figures constitute one reason why I urge the Treasurer to do something more than is being done by this Bill to finance our vast undertakings. When the right honourable member for Swan (Lord Forrest) was Treasurer last year I asked him in this House, "" Why do you not in crease the income tax?"" His reply was, "" We have plenty of money,"" but at the same time he introduced a Loan Bill for £40,000,000.' If there is plenty of money in the community, let us take a reasonable proportion of it by way of taxation from the people who have it . Do not let us go on piling up a vast indebtedness for posterity to pay. The Treasurer has told us that we shall be owing presently £309,000,000, and no provision is being made for its repayment. The income tax has not been increased for two years. Some two years ago it was increased by 25 per cent.; but if our in come tax rates be compared with tliose of other countries, it will be seen that the that wealthy people of Australia are escaping practically scot-free from direct taxation. We have had bountiful harvests, and the prices of wool, wheat, and other primary products are phenomenally high.",59
285,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,Does the honourable member object to that ?,59
286,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not object to the producers receiving high prices, but I blame the Government for not increasing its taxation i u proportion to the increase in the wealth of the community. I am satisfied that if another War Census were taken tomorrow, the margin as between the rich and the poor would be found to be wider than ever. It would probably be found that less than one-eighth of the community owned seven-eighths of its assets. It might also be found that a slightly larger proportion of' wage-earners than was the case in 1915 were in receipt of £156 per annum and upwards; but every one knows that the purchasing power of the sovereign has substantially decreased since the war began. fore, while it might appear that more people had come within the scope of our income tax laws, they have been wrongf u l ly brought within it . nominally, receiving slightly better wages : but in reality, having regard to the reduced purchasing power of the sovereign, they are not. I presume that the honourable member for Maribyrnong is not wedded to the strict form of his amendment; and honourable members opposite will be lacking in their duty if they do not compel the Government to deal with this question of increasing the taxation of those who ought to pay more than they are now called upon to do.",59
287,Mr RODGEKS,Unknown,The honourable member is not alone in the opinion that more of our current obligations should be met out of revenue.,60
288,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am sure of that,",60
289,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,But we cannot deal with that matter under this Bill .,60
290,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am confident that unless the supporters of the Government voice the opinion that taxation should be increased, no attempt will be made in that direction, notwithstanding that wealthy people of this community, owing to increased prices, are making huge fortunes.",60
291,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,I expect a btg increase of taxation.,60
292,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,A big increase should have been made last year.,60
293,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,Why not talk about increased production instead of increased taxation ? How can there be more taxation without more production ?,60
294,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The production of the last few years has been absolutely phenomenal. The wool clip for the calendar year 1912 was worth about £22,500,000, whereas last year's clip was worth about £50,000,000, and this notwithstanding that the number of our sheep had been reduced by 20,000,000. The pastoralists had fewer sheep to shear, yet tl}ey received £50,000,000 for their clip, as against £22,500,000 in 1912.",60
295,Mr WALLACE,Unknown,The production was less and the value greater.,60
296,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Quite so.,60
297,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"It was about £45,000,000, not £50,000,000.",60
298,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Includin g the returns for sheepskins, it was probably more than £50,000,000. Taking the honourable member's own figures, the value of the wool There- clip last year was double that of 1912, yet the Government have done practically nothing to secure, by way of taxation, any proportion of these increased profits. The They may be, honourable member for Barker (Mr . Livingston) has asked why I speak of in creased taxation. I have no hesitation in doing so when we have men risking their lives while others are not asked to contribute anything like their fair proportion to the cost of government. Before introducing this Bill , the Government should have told us definitely what they propose to do in the way of increased taxation. Having regard to the phenomenally bountiful seasons we have enjoyed, we have a right to pay a little more of our current expenditure out of revenue, and not to go on piling up a huge debt for posterity to bear. I was led to analyze the War Census figures as the result of an interjection wrongly credited to me by the newspapers last week, and I was surprised to find that one-sixth of the community in 1915 held more than one-half of the country's assets, while the remaining five-sixths were simply struggling along. The five-sixths really represent a larger proportion of the the community, because there are very many people.who do not send in income tax returns. I hope that the Government will make a definite statement of their proposals in regard to interest, and in regard to future taxation.",60
299,Mr RODGEKS,Unknown,"The honourable member does not think that we could raise money free of interest, and still carry on our industries!",60
300,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) has set a good example which those who can afford to do so might well copy, by lending money to the Government free of interest. Long before the banks determined to encourage investment in war loans by offering overdrafts to those who would invest, private persons were borrowing from the banks by way of overdraft to lend to the Government.",60
301,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"If many persons had not done that, they could not have taken up war stock.",61
302,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We are told that these sittings will close next week, and that fore then we shall have a Supply Bill for three months. I have not the slightest doubt that that Bill, like others that have preceded it, will pass without a word of objection from members opposite, whose desire is, apparently, that there shall be no criticism of Government policy or administration.",61
303,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [S.48] - It is impossible to accept the amendment; I do not know whether the honourable member who moved it is serious in regard to it. There are many objections which could be urged against what he proposes, but it is hardly necessary to mention them. The Bill is like .the other Bills of the same kind that have preceded it.",61
304,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,Hav e the speeches been the same? ',61
305,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"No . When the early War Loan Bills were introduced members opposite were on this side of the chamber, and supporting the measures.",61
306,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,The war has been going on for nearly four years. Must ve take the same views now as we did at the beginning?,61
307,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I merely point out that the suggestions which to-night have been made by honourable members opposite were not considered necessary on previous occasions of this kind, and they are not necessary now. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor). asks for a statement regarding proposed taxation, but he knows that the usual practice is to make announcements concerning taxation in connection with a general review of the financial position.",61
308,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,The Treasurer said that that is the course which he will adopt.,61
309,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Yes .,61
310,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [8.51] - I shall not add much to what I have already said on the subject of finance. Members now, as on former occasions, seem to regard the proposed loan as a matter of little interest, although £80,000,000 is to be borrowed. Many persons think that there is money stored up in large tanks, which can be drawn on by way of loan just as goods might be taken out of a store; but this is not so. The workers, however, naturally ask, when they find a Government loan over-subscribed, why beare not those who possess so much wealth subjected to proper taxation. The wealthy have proclaimed their anxiety to assist in winning the war, and why are they not taxed to that end? Within the last few days the Broken Hill Proprietary Company has proposed to increase its capital of 1,500,000 shares paid up to Ss., to the same number of shares paid up to £1, taking the necessary 12s. per share from their reserve. They propose, also, to give every holder of ten 8s. shares fourteen £1 shares. That is the position of one of our companies. When the sons of the industrialist section of the community are away at the Pront, why should not the wealthy, if they cannot send their sons, make some monetary sacrifice? There should be equality of sacrifice. This is the only portion of the Empire which is not imposing taxation to meet the expenses of the war. That is what New Zealand and Great Britain have done. According to a balance-sheet issued on the 16th March, the Britisli Government paid £1,714,233,808 from revenue to meet the expenses of the war, and raised by taxation during the week between the 9th and 16th March £22,438,895. We are not imposing taxation in the same way, although the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and every bauk in Australia have increased tlieir reserves. Why should not those who are benefiting by the expenditure caused by the war contribute towards its cost? Their position would be different if the Government were not borrowing and spending so much. Those who benefit by the war are the people who should pay taxes. If peace were declared at the end of this year, many thousands of men in Australia who are now employed on war industries would be thrown out of work, and would be unable to contribute to the revenue. When there is general unemployment, it is impossible to increase taxation. New South Wales was saved on one occasion when there was much unemployment by the action of the late Mr E. W. O'Sullivan, in spending about £8,000,000 of borrowed money on public works. If we neglect to raise revenue by taxation while we are able to do so, we shall be unable to do'it later. Had the Labour party come into power after the last election, one of its first duties would have been to see that as much revenue as possible was raised dur-ing the Avar, Avhen there was so much money in circulation. That would have been the common-sense arrangement. The financial editors of our journals knoAv that what I am saying is gospel truth, but as their newspapers support the Government, they are cloaking the real issue. Those who knoAv what is sound and just and right know that the way to finance this Avar is to do Avhat I suggest; but my Avords are so much Avind to honourable members opposite, Avho will not face the inevitable position, although the Treasurer has told us plainly how much money has been borroAved for Avar purposes by CommonAvealth and State Governments. The position is a very serious one in the eyes of all who desire the prosperity of this country. Honourable members opposite must either admit their inability to grasp the situation, their fear of taxing those who have the money to pay taxation. There might be reason for ridiculing what I say if the history of the past did not furnish facts which bear out my statements. But honourable members cannot ridicule the position, and the longer the matter is delayed the Avorse the damage that Avill result. There is no attempt to rise to the occasion. I have not that implicit faith in the Government that will lead me to believe that they Avill be driven into giving a higher rate of terest than that which it is the opinion of this House should be paid. Are Ave dumb dogs? Are Ave afraid to approach tliose Avho are in power, and ask them to give us such information as that Avhen we leave this Chamber after they have got three months' Supply, and can tell us to go to a Avarm place, we will know Avhat rate of interest is to he paid? We knoAv that as long as Ministers get suflicient Supply to enable them to carry on they Avili not Avorry about the vieAvs of honourable members. I am not one of [192] those Avho believe that almost eA'erything in the form of war liability should be handed down to posterity. I am of opinion that we should so act as to prevent those who come after us from condemning us. As a young nation we should be laying doAvn those high and noble principles which are the essentials of good government, and nothing is more essential in that respect than good finance. But Ave are making no attempt at good finance. Unfortunately the pres3 of Australia is behind the Government. There has been a Conference of editors, and now twelve representatives of the press of Australia are to go Home and intervieAV the representatives of the press in England. Heaven only knows Avhat will happen wheu they come back!",61
311,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,Who is to pay for the trip? .,62
312,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I do not worry about that, but I hope that they Avill have a good voyage and come back safely, and that on their return we will have in Australia a press fearless'in their advocacy of the interests of Australia. If that end be achieved, it Avill have been a cheap trip, whatever the expenditure - This continual raising of loans is doing no good to the or industrial section of the community. The class Will Avhom I have been identified all my life knoAv the position. The belief that there are people in Australia AA'ho are increasing their Avealth beyond all reason cannot be reniOA'ed from their minds. And Avhy should it be when some sections of the community are reaping such large benefits in the war ? Try to realise the position Avhen one is addressing a meeting of thousands of people, and the interjection comes, ""Where are they gonot ing to get this loan money from? "" What in- can one say, except that the wealthy people are shelling out their Avealth at 4-J per cent, and 5 per cent.? NOAV AVC have nothing authentic to SIIOAV that the Government Avill not give more than 5 per cent. It is the people AA'ho have to pay the interest, and the representatives of the people ought to be in a position to know Avhat rate of interest is to be paid. A dumb Parliament, in a democratic community, is a inatter for ridicule.  does the honourable member suggest?",62
313,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"None , at all!",62
314,Mr WEST,Unknown,"No one has ever heard me say such a thing. I have endeavoured to be practical. I base my statements on my long knowledge of Australian affairs, commercial, industrial, and otherwise; and I am endeavouring to get honourable members into a sane frame of mind. Every one knows that when the Pisher Government issued a loan at 4£ per cent., free of taxation, an endeavour was made to instill into the .minds of the people the idea that Australia was a nation which should be self-contained, aud that nothing would be more pertinent towards achieving that end than that those of her citizens who held - wealth should contribute to the loans raised by the National Government, on which the National Government should pay interest. But I am sure that no one thought then that we would ask for £43,000,000 within three months. I do not know what the press would have said if I had made a statement to that effect. I see that there are no pressmen in the gallery now. It shows what interest they - take in these matters. There are two --sides to every question, and whether my side is right or wrong the people who support me are entitled to know what my views are. However, the Government have taken a certain course, and the people who have put them in power mnst accept the responsibility. I hold that Australia made a mistake on 5 th May, 1917, but the supporters of the Government include many gentlemen who have large vested interests, and, when they ousted the Labour Government,' they naturally expected that their interests would be better protected. I have always maintained that when the industrial section of the community is prosperous, when the landlords can collect their rents, and when the workers have , sufficient to pay their butchers' and grocers' bills, and to clothe themselves and their families decently, those gentlemen who have vested interests are more likely to be more prosperous - than when the opposite conditions prevail. I have already said that this Parliament has not risen to the occasion, or to the expectations of the people, irrespective of .those whom we may offend or please, in the matter of raising money for the purpose of carrying on the war in a practical .and statesman-like manner.",63
315,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [9.14] The note struck by the honourable member is the necessity for taxation, and particularly the necessity for increasing taxation on those who are making huge profits, and who, being fortunately placed in Australia, so many miles away from the terrible turmoil of war and bloodshed existing in Europe today, are able to make such large profits that one is staggered to think that members of Parliament will not continue to sit till they place on the statute book an effective war-time profits tax. In this very year, with very few exceptions, numbering about four, I think, according to the Bulletin, huge profits have been made. The history of the Broken Hill Proprietary is almost like the story of - the wonderful cave of Aladdin in the Arabian Nights. Up to the present time the Proprietary has paid £10,400,000 in dividends. The contributing shares are paid up to 8s., and the price quoted has been £3 10s. 3d., though later it was 74s. If we divide the 74s. by 8, it shows over 900 per cent, as the selling value of the shares. The wealth of the Proprietary has increased in a way that the mind fails to grasp. I always thank Mr. W. L . Baillieu, who is reputed to be a millionaire making a second million, for being man enough to declare that the war-time profits tax does not touch men like himself. When men of wealth speak in that way to the people of Australia, the Government would do well to continue this Parliament in session until reasonable measures of taxation have been passed. We here are paid a very good minimum wage for our attendance, and members must be getting tired of being ruled by War Precautions Act Regulations. While, however, the newspapers may be muzzled, we are free to speak what we think within these walls. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) told us that the wealth census returns, so far as incomes are concerned, showed that two-elevenths, or two out of every eleven, who send in returns, receive more than half of the income of all Australia, leaving nine out of every eleven with less than half the income. This leaves out of account all those unfortunate enough not to have sufficient income to require the sending in of returns.",63
316,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Do not forget that in cluded are all the big companies and banks, such as the Australian Mutual Provident, with a revenue of millions.",64
317,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"The honourable member is quite right, but the income of mutual companies is always added to the insurance on the lives of the various policy holders.",64
318,Mr BOYD,Unknown,Quite so; and the honourable member must be a sharer in that income.,64
319,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I am glad to say I am, and I wish everybody else was. Some time ago a return was issued at the instance of Sir Alexander 'Peacock, which I regard as one of the most important ever issued from any Parliament in the world. To keep within the income tax law, which prevents the divulging of names, Sir Alexander Peacock had the various incomes simply numbered, and the highest income dealt with was £300,000, so that the big companies referred to by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) could not have been included - ",64
320,Mr BOYD,Unknown,That is so.,64
321,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"In the same wealth various companies. census returns, dealing with, assets, it was shown that one out of every six .persons who sent in returns owned five-sixths of the assets of . Australia, while five-sixths of those who sent in returns only one-sixth of the assets. L et us see was done in the matter of taxation in equal to 7 per cent., England in the time of the continental wars,' at the close of the eighteenth tury. The facts may stagger honourable before, members, but my authority is one that will bear reference to, namely, The Dictionary of Political, Economy, edited by Palgrave. On page 582 of that work dealing with the year 1798, .we find the following:- ° Pitt now divided the assessed taxpayers two new classes-thos e who were assessed to the duties on houses, windows, dogs, or clocks, or watches, and persons who were assessed the duties on male servants, carriages, or sure horses. Persons of the first of these classes, assessed through the same experience again. to an amount less than f 1, were to he exempt from any additional duty; but if to that or greater amount, they were to pay as follows:Tf the existing amount wasUncier £2, one-quarter part thereof tional. If :£2 and under f 3, one-half part additional. [192]- 2 If £3 and under £5, three-quarter part thereof additional. If to and under £7 10s., the amount additional. If £7 10s. and under £10, one and a half times additional. If £10 ancl under £12 10s., twice additional. If £12 10s. and under £15, two and a half times additional. If £15 and under £20, three times additional. If £20 and under £30, three and a half times additional. If £30 and uncier £40, four and a half times additional. If £40 and under £50, four and a half times additional. If £50 and upwards, five times additional. That was 500. per cent., and it will be seen that if , under the taxation law of the period, a man paid £1,00 0 in the taxes, he was immediately taxed £5,000in addition. A very large proportion of our loans could be obtained in Australia today if we went as far as they did in England during the war times of the century before last. However, let us get down to the present day; and, in this connection, I have again to thank that wonderful paper, the Bulletin, for its publication of the balance-sheets of the The name of the National Bank of Australia brings tomind Sir John Grice, the chairman of directors of that institution, who, at the last half-yearly meeting, was frank, owned enough to say that a man of wealth what who invests i u our war loan receives while the man who invests his small savings recenceives only 4J per cent. I have said"" but it"" will bear repeating, that Sir John Grice did not make thab statement to give Labour members a peg on; which to hang arguments, but because hefears the ddbdcle that will follow the end of the war. While the war continues we must go ahead full belt u n t i l we break the Prussian military autocracy, into an end we all hope may be accomplished so that peace may quickly come. L i ke to Sir John Grice, I fear the dibacle t h at pleawill follow, for I was seared in the crash of the boom, and do uot wish to go I a have no desire-to see it necessary, as then, to have organized effort at the Trades Hall to provide over 300,000 meals and addifrom 30,000 to 40,000 beds for those who were rendered destitute, and when it was thereof necessary to prevent auctioneers sellingfurniture under distress for rent. is why I have such a dread of unemployment; and this calls to mind the fact that the Melbourne Municipal Council, , although there are epidemic fevers about, has sacked f if t y men, who, with their families, represent some 250 human beings, now within a week or two of dire want. In the meantime, this, my native city, is lef t to become, not only one of the dustiest, but one of the dirtiest of cities, although the salaries of the higher-paid officials of the municipality have been 1 increased during the last twelve months.",64
322,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,The . sanitary service has been reduced.,65
323,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"That is so, and it is a sin and a shame. Nothing destroys credit so quickly as unemployment. The small landlords and shopkeepers first feel the effects, and as soon as there is any disturbance of credit, the banks, as now, hold aloof from making advances. They fear the withdrawal of so much money into loans, the interest of which is free from taxation, and which, therefore, offer a better investment for the moneyspinners of the community, ""for which I . for one, do not blame them. In 1913, the National Bank paid a dividend of 7 per cent, on both ordinary and preference shares, and its reserves were £451,208. In 1918, while still paying the same dividend, the reserves £718,303. That represents a profit of over a quarter of a million pounds made in war-time. Students of finance know that the financial condition of a country may be judged by the bank balances. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is another institution the riches of which can be accounted for only by the use of Aladdin's lamp. In September, 1913, when the company had capitalized £250,000 of its reserves, the remaining reserve was £52,019, and the dividend was 1 2 i per cent. In 1915 the company wrote up its assets to £3,250,000, and that meant that it required almost the same amount to pay a f H per cent, dividend as it required previously to pay 12£ per cent. In other words, £203,000 was required to pay the dividend of 1 2 i per cent., and in 1916, after the assets had been written up to £3,250,000, a dividend of Gi per cent, absorbed £211,250. In March, 191S, when the company was still paying the same dividend-nominall y less but actually the same as in 1913That the reserves had increased to £430,879. The F i j i branch of the company reveals similar profits. In three years the disclosed profit of the two companies has been: Colonial Sugar Refining Company, £829,155; do. (F i j i and New Zealand), £1,007,178; total, £1,836,333. The Bank of Australasia in A p r i l , 1913, paid a dividend of 17 per cent., and had a reserve of £2,089,000. In A p r i l , 1917, the reserve totalled £2,997,000, and in October of the same year £3,028,000, and the bank was still paying a dividend of 17 per cent. There we have an increase of nearly a million pounds during wartime. The ""Western Australian Bank, which is perhaps unique inasmuch as its reserve f u n d is nearly four times as much as its paid-up capital, has been paying a dividend of 20 per cent, for many years; in other words, for every £5 invested the shareholder receives £ 1 per annum.",65
324,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"There are not many of the original shareholders left. The honourable member must consider what the 20 per cent, dividend represents on the present-day value of the shares.",65
325,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"In September, 1913, the Western Australian Bank's reserve f u n d was £684,000, and in 1918 £719,000. And so the list of companies and profits continues. were In regard to the fixation of prices, we have been told that the Emperor Justinian tried the system, and it proved a failure. Times have changed since the days of Justinian. The printing j>ress has done more to educate the people than has any other movement; it was unknown in those days. If one is to be guided by the experience of Justinian in the matter of price' fixing, we might just as well follow him in the use of chariots instead of trains for travelling. I thank the Age for dealing ""with that argument in its issue of the 13th MayYet if Mr Lloyd George, Mr Wilson, and M. Clemenceau and the other law givers had not quite forgotten their schoolboy history, they would not have attempted to limit the profit, : even if the consumer, like Job's behemoth, ate grass ""as an ox."" . . . . It is as absurd to quote the individualistic fallacies of other days as it is to seek examples in the age of Justinian for a world whose modes of life, thought, and action have since undergone a series of revolutions. Prices are being fixed successfully, and, therefore, they can be fixed. In Australia the fixing thus far has been for the benefit of the wholesale traders. In justice to the retailer and the consumer the Government must see that it is just. Is it just? Prices have been rising continuously. I ask the Government if any merchant or property holder in those districts which the German brutes have torn from Prance, Belgium, Serbia, Albania, and Russia, would not thank Creator morning, noon, and night if he could return to the position he was in before the war, having lost nothing but the profits that he might have made in time of peace. I have previously urged that we should not allow any profits to be made * in excess of those that were made before the outbreak of war. An y man who raises rents during war timeand there have been instances of terrible usury-ar e enemies in our midst. I have appealed to the Prime Minister from time to time to issue a War Precautions! Regulation to prevent such exploitation. He would not do that, but he was mean enough to pass a moratorium regulation for his own personal benefit.",65
326,Mr GROOM,Unknown,That is not fair. Prime Minister is not present.,66

329,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I was about to say that if the Prime Minister had made a regulation to prevent the raising of rents in war time he would have enabled those who benefited by it to lend their small savings to the community. In regard to wheat, honourable members well know that mice and weevils are permitted to eat the good food which God has sent us in one of the most bountiful harvests on record rather than that grain should be sold. Anybodv who consult The Trusts of Australia, written by Wilkinson, a bright student, whose genius illumined the Melbourne U n i versity, will see that when there was scarcitv of wheat, bread was being in Melbourne at a lower price than that obtaining today. Do the people know how much is being paid to the Wheat Pool ?

331,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [9.44] - I have not yet heard where the money to pay the interest on this his loan is to be obtained. I suppose I ought to accept the statement that it will be met, as all past loan obligations have been, from taxation. But I believe that we shall not be able to do that, because the sum required will be too great. I shall be told, of course, that the usual methods will be resorted to, but, knowing that the working section of the community have always paid it while the wealthy section have taken the profits, I had hoped for a change. I can see, however, that no attempt is to be made by this Government to force the wealthy to pay their fair share bf taxation. Let us see where we stand with regard to our war loans. The Treasurer has told us that already about £145,000,000 has been raised by way of The loan in Australia, and over £4,000,000 by means of war savings certificates, while in Great Britain we have ..raised £47,000,000, making a total of £196,000,000. In addition to that we owe the British Government £30,000,000 for the maintenance of our troops at the Front. The people are not aware that, so far as Australian troops are concerned, the war is being conducted on a different basis from that adopted with regard to the troops from other Dominions.

The Government and their supporters outside are taking good care, as I have said, that the workers shall not be able to pay any portion of the interest on these war loans and at the same time live in reasonable comfort. There is apparently a desire to lower wages as a means of paying interest on these loans. In proof of that statement. I point out that the "" s c a b "" unions outside are trying to beat the legitimate unions.  get better wages if we get loans without interest!",67
344,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I wish the honourable member would not .interrupt me. We have in our midst what are known as "" scab "" unions, which are fostered by the present Commonwealth Government and the State Government of Victoria, notwithstanding the recent promise that there should be no more victimization. The present conditions of labour in Australia honourable were built up by unionism. Trade organizations, built up by the Workers themselves, succeeded - in wresting from the employers better conditions. Last year, however, we had a strike, fostered and engineered by the Employers Eederation, and our legitimate unions "" fell in . "" Mr CoNSiDnsrE - Who are financing the "" scab "" unions ? ",67
345,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The Employers Federation. As the result of the strike we have the unfortunate spectacle of one section of the workers, ""scabbing'' against the other. We have today two "" scab "" unions, one known as the Wheat and Flour Union and the other as the Australian Ship and Wharf Lumpers Association, which have been created to break up the genuine unions. We are. propose told by the Government that there will be no more victimization, yet no genuine trade unionist can obtain work on the wharfs or at any of the wheat stacks unless he joins a "" s c a b "" union. In the end, no doubt, when the. "" scab "" unions have wiped the genuine trade unions out of existence, wages will come down. The Government will expect the workers to pay their share of interest on our war loans, and yet they are engineering and encouraging a system which will reduce wages and make it impossible for the workers to do anything of the sort. I ask the Government to honour their promise to the unions of Australia that victimization' would be abolished, and that every man would get his share of work. It is not palatable to have to state these facts, but it is necessary that they should be given. Having regard to the high cost of living, is it possible for the workers to pay anything like the taxation which will be necessary to meet interest and sinking fund charges in connection with these loans and at the same time to live under anything like reasonable conditions? What will happen when wages come down as the result of the "" s c a b "" unions, fostered by the Government side of the House? If the Government will show any genuine desire to make the wealthy pay a reasonable share of taxation I shall be satisfied, but the position' is that they have not attempted to extract from those who have made huge war-time profits anything like a fair share of those profits. It is estimated that a paltry £500,000 will be collected annually by way of war-time profits taxation, and the war profiteers do not even want to pay that amount. They are engineering to induce the Government to reduce the amount by one-half. How can we go on borrowing money with these facts staring us in the face? Taxation will be necessary to provide - money to pay interest on the loans, and if the workers are to contribute their fair share, they must have employment. That being so, why does not this Government endeavour to force the Government of Victoria to keep the promises that were made on its behalf at the recent Conference summoned by the Governor General? The Conference was called because of the difficulties of the present position, and because of the industrial turmoil that has taken place of late. It was an attempt to ease .the position created by the war and to help the finances of the country, the two things being so wrapped up together that they cannot be separated. ""We w<ere given to understand that certain things were to be done. 2Tbw, however, we find that unionists are not being allowed to work on the wharfs and on the wheat stacks in Victoria unless they, join the "" scab "" unions. Does not the Government intend to make the Victorian Government, which is responsible for this, keep its promise that this would not be allowed to continue? I understand that the Premiers of the other States are keeping their promises. About a fortnight ago the Age said that the Premier of Victoria was going to confer with the Minister of Agriculture regarding my complaint that men seeking employment on the wheat stacks were being compelled to join the "" non-union union,"" and that he had stated that his Government was anxious in all matters to work in accordance with the promises given at the recent Conference. Yet nothing has been done. Ou the Yarra bank those who select the men employed by the Y a r ra Stevedoring Company are penalizing the real unionists. If that is to continue, how will these men be able to contribute their share fo the revenue? If Ministers are wise, they will see that the "" scab "" unions are not allowed to carry on in this way. The unionists were asked to drop their attacks on the employers, and they wish for the present to abide in peace and get on with their work. We have been told that it is always the f a u l t of the unionists when trouble occurs, and now we have the spectacle of unionists being willin g to work and being denied employment. The unionists can still put up a fight if they wish to do so, and can make it unpleasant for the Government. . Threats of what may be done under the War Precautions Act would not have much effect on them. It is for the Government, therefore, to see that the Government of Victoria endeavours to keep its promise. I wish to know if anything can be done to make the Government of Victoria insist that the unionists of Australia shall get their fair share of work. If that is not done, the sooner those who are recruiting come off, and we get back to the position in which we were before, the better. The Government will then see that they cannot do without those on this side as easily as they think they can. I am not making a threat; I am merely warning the Government that there are difficulties ahead. If they want to present a united front to the enemy, they must give consideration to this inatter. If they do not, they are foolish, and later will suffer for their folly. I am not much concerned about their sufferings, but I am concerned about the sufferings of the wives and families of those who were asked to sink their difficulties on the promise that there should be no victimization, and yet are now penalized by the action of the "" scab "" unions,"" which are supported by the Government of Yiatoria. I ask the Commonwealth Government to see that the State Government puts an end to victimization. If it does not, I shall expect the Leader of the Labour party in this House, and other Labour men who are now assisting recruiting, to come off, and to tell them again what Ave have told them before Avhen the Government Avere supporting the "" scab "" unions and dov/ning the real unions.",67
346,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [10.7] The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) is to be complimented upon an amendment which is really a challenge to the Government and their supporters. One must be struck with the startling difference between the attitude of members opposite tOAvards the question under discussion, the conscription of wealth, and their attitude towards the conscription of men for active service at the Front. H a d I been more sanguine concerning their patriotism, I should have expected - from them a glowing enthusiasm for the proposal to obtain money free of interest for war purposes. We have our recruiting committees, some of which are active, and some less active. I have received a letter from a committee in my electorate, insisting, for the second time, that I shall take my place on the platform, in order that my enthusiasm may inspire others with a desire to lay down their lives on the other side of the world. For one quite sufficient reason I have not taken any part in recruiting for men's lives, that reason being that I could not conceive any ground for others going to fight which would not apply to my own case, and as I was not prepared to go, I was not justified in urging others to do so. The reasons why I would not go are personal and private, but I should be willing, if it were relevant to the motion, and any one desired to hear them, to state them at length. E u t while I have not taken an active part in the recruiting of men, I suggest to those who have entered into that work with unbounded enthusiasm that it would not be unbecoming for them to join a movement for the recruiting of the means necessary to carry on this war, as those zealous patriots conceive that it should be carried on. It has been said that it is practically and economically impossible raise money without interest. not know that an amount for the carrying on of the war could be raised in that way, but it is for us to ascertain, by proclamation, or other effective means, what is the measure of sacrifice of mere material things that men of substance are prepared to make to back up their enthusiastic interest in the war. It is useless to say that money cannot be obtained without interest. In this Comnconwealth there are some rich men, and many of moderate means, and there is hardly one who could not lay something aside, and say, "" That money may be used in this war for a period of two or three years, and then be returned me."" The war loan advertisements the people that they are not asked to give their money; that they are asked merely to invest in a gilt-edged security. one advertisement says, ""'You are asked to exchange one kind of Government Mr Brennan. rr.oney for another kind of Government money."" You are invited by these advertisements to take the view that, while some men are doing their duty by surrendering their lives on the other side of the world, you may do your duty by in vesting your money at attractive rates of interest. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) has pointed out that for the first six months the interest is at the rate of a littl e less than 11 per cent, per annum, and as the interest is exempt from income taxation, very rich men get the equivalent of a perpetual return of 6, and even 7, per cent, from their investments in the war loan. There are many men in the community who have money lying idle. I know prosperous business men who have considerable sums to their credit in current accounts. Then there are banking, institutions, insurance companies, including the mutual'companies, financial institutions of various kinds, and many private individuals, who could lay their hands on a sub0 stantial sum of money, and put it aside for two or three years, without reducing one of their activities, without dismissing one of their employees, or without reducing in any particular the production of the community as a whole. To do this would be a genuine sacrifice. It would not be a sacrifice comparable with that made by those who are asked to go across the seas and fight and die in this great war, but at least it would be to some sacrifice, and we would not have I do this ghastly mockery of men declaring sufficient that duty may be done by an investment in the war loan. It is said that Australia has not found her soul in this great war. I do not quite know what that expression means, but I venture, to suggest that Australia will have found her soul to some extent when in the time of struggle, stress, and sacrifice, such as this is, she is prepared to cease the worship of Mammon, and embrace the duty of sacrifice, not a vicarious sacrifice, a sacrifice on the part of others, but a sacrifice on to the part of those who have material tell things to give. I commend the honourable member As for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton). I am glad that he has proposed this amendment, and I . am surprised beyond expression to find that, though member after member on this side of the chamber rises to speak to this amendment, it does not evoke a single word of serious comment, or comment of any kind, from members on the other side of the House. What can they expect when the next war loan is floated? They will be told, and rightly told, that they were not prepared even to make an in quiry-becaus e that is what this amendment asks for-as to what funds are available, as to the extent of idle wealth, as to the extent to which we may relieve the burden posterity will have to bear in connection with this huge war debt. They will not even take an amendment of this kind seriously. They sit apathetic, uninterested, and forgetful of the fact that the proposal now before them is' an integral part of our whole war policy. It is a question of how to pay, how to keep the fight going, if they want to keep it going, or how to keep this country solvent in the future, if it is to be kept solvent. they have not a word to say upon it . They can parade up and down the country almost frothin g at the mouth when it is a question of seizing the bodies of their fellow men, and say, You must go; you must fight; you must die; the whole country is in danger. The' honour of our womenkind is in danger. The land is threatened with devastation."" find 4£ per cent, the minimum, and that 11 per cent, is to be paid for the first half-year, and 6 per cent, for the balance to the very wealth secured by means of these investments. It is a hollow mockery, and I can assure honourable members that they may prate about enlistments and recruiting as much as they like, but if they ask me the real reason why there is less enthusiasm today about recruiting than there was when the war broke out, my answer is that it arises mainly, though not solely,, from the fact that those who are, as they say, ineligible for enlistment have failed to respond to a request for sacrifice anything like parallel to the sacrifice made by those whom they are seekiug to force to fight in this war.",68
347,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [10.18]. - When my time expired previously, I had not concluded the remarks I intended to make. I was speaking about the price of wheat, and showing how unjust the Government were in not treating the farmers fair l y . In Canada, America, and Argentine the price of wheat is much higher than the price paid here, and the farmers believe that they are not being treated fairly . I have ascertained from an honourable member sitting on the other side of the House whose opinion on this question I prefer to that of any other honourable member, that a price of 4s. per bushel delivered at the railway station would pay the farmer well, but that the State railway systems charge freight according to the mileage. My suggestion is that the Acting Prime Minister should recommend the States to adopt the zone system, so that the freight charged on wheat should be the same, no matter how far removed from the seaport the farmer may be situated. The zone system is in use in other parts of the world. In H o l land, one can buy a railway ticket from frontier to frontier. I thank the honourable member for Maribyrnong for moving his amendment. But I shall vote for it because I am certain that if the Treasurer would make it widely known throughout Australia that the nation is asking her children, in her hour of need, to give their money free of interest, the wealthy men and women would gladly respond to the call. But they have to be asked. When that great general, Belisarius, was begging at the Yet we gates of Constantinople for daily food, one of his former officers stopped, and said to him, "" Why do you not ask."" Throwing aside his rags, he said, "" A m I not asking with a thousand tongues from every rag that is hanging from me."" People have to be asked. All the Red Cross and other button days recognise this fact. If our Government would only ask the patriotic people of Australia to lend their money free of interest, I feel sure that a large sum would be received. Certainly only £1,120 has been lent on those terms. Two unions have lent £100 each, six or seven citizens have lent £10 each, and the largest sum lent in this way has been £ 4 0 0 ; but something like £60,000 has been handed to the nation as a g if t . Every honour should be paid to tliose who have made this g if t , if we could only know who they are. The amendment will allow those who love their country, who have the wherewithal and cannot possibly go away to fight on account of age, or for religious reasons, to give their money to help the Government. I have always advocated that principle, in season and out of season, and, therefore, I shall have pleasure in voting for the amendment.",70
348,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,The honourable member has set an example in this matter.,71
349,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"My contribution is so small that I am ashamed of it . However, I hope that it will be more at the end of the year. We are not asking the Government to make any new departure or inaugurate a new Department. We are simply asking them to send out a request. We have had the example of the splendid g if t of the late Mr Knox, by which the name of every person who voted for the Federation of Australia was in scribed, and every - person who so voted could apply to the Government and be f u r nished with a splendid certificate bearing on it the portraits of the Premiers of the various States at the time of the inauguration of Federation. In the same way, a certificate could be furnished to those people who lend their money to the nation free of interest. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has said that men have offered their lives. Upwards of 800,000 Australians have offered their services for fighting, and over 400,000 have been accepted. Over 50 per cent, of the men in Australia of the fighting age have offered their services. Will any one say that 50 per cent, of the rich men of Australia have offered all their money ? The suggestion made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong should receive attention. If the Government cannot accept the amendment, they can at least consider the suggestion, and, possibly, the Treasurer may be induced to issue an invitation to the patriotic people of Australia to lend their money free of interest.",71
350,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Cook) [10.29] The honourable member for Maribyrnong intends that an effort should be made to ascertain to what extent the financial men of Australia are willing to volunteer financial means for the carrying on of the war, and that only after there is failure on their part to provide the necessary wherewithal shall there be an attempt to raise further large sums with interest charges. This is a legitimate proposal to place before the wealthy who constantly assert that they are ready to make great sacrifices in th© Empire's cause. Undoubtedly the people of. this country are running heavily into debt at a rapid rate. The present position is approximately as follows: AUSTRALIAN LOANS.

We are not yet at the end of our loanraising and commitments in interest. I was interested in learning how much coin of all descriptions there is in Australia at the present time, and I find the position to be as follows: Coin and bullion in all banks, 30th September, .1917Coin .. . . £21,S29,467 Bullion .. .. 1,206,789 Gold in Treasury, 31st December, 1917 .. 17,628,270 £40,664,426 Commonwealth notes held by banks, 30th September, 1917 30,451,381 £71,115,807 The coin and notes amount to only £71,000,000 odd; and yet we . are told that we have to expend £80,000,000 of loan money this year for direct war purposes, besides having agreed to provide.£76,000,000 for the purpose of paying for our primary products. W it h only £70,000,000 odd i u circulation, we have undertaken to spend £156,000,000. 1 made an effort to find out where this money was to come from, and to that end last week I asked a series of questions of the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer in relation to the payment of certain instalments on account of the Wheat Pools. The Government had just decided to pay £4,750,000 in instalments, and we were informed that this was hy arrangement with the banks. what banks had agreed to provide the money, what was the nature of the correspondence and negotiations, and what was the agreement. How did the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer answer, or, I should say, side-step the questions I asked? He said on the 23rd M ay this yearMuch of the information sought would take a considerable time to compile, and would have little bearing on the problem of wheat finance. Tho provision of the sum named was arranged by my predecessor as a part of the agreement made between the Commonwealth Treasury and the banks of Australia in relation to the financing of the primary products for the current year, estimated to total £76,000,000. There is not much illumination to be got from that reply. We are told that our Treasurers are great financial men, but I have been in this Parliament about thirteen years, and in that timethere has never been a financial speech by any one of the Treasurers. I believe that the men who pose as great financial authorities and Treasurers are vastly ignorant on the question of finance. There has never been any justification for their system of finance, and they have never dealt with its principles. No member in the House can point to one speech made here by a Treasurer which dealt with the principles of finance, and justified his operation of the finances of the country. At one time, when I heard these men spoken of as possessed of great qualifications, as having examined all the financial systems inexistence, and as knowing everything to be known on the matter, I used to believe what I was told ; but I h ave been here long enough to be convinced that those men know little about it , and are afraid to open their mouths because the moment they do they show how destitute they are of knowledge.",71
351,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,How can you criticise if you do not know?,72
352,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"All I am saying is that never since I came into this Parliament, thirteen years ago, has any of the various Treasurers shown any evidence of hia knowledge, and I invite the honourable member, who also has been here a long time, to refer me to any speech which shows to the contrary. He is silent now. For he cannot answer my challenge. The Treasurer usually comes down to I asked Parliament with a typewritten statement prejjared for him by an official. To show how much Treasurers usually bother themselves about understanding what is in the prepared statements, I may point to the present Treasurer, who read to us a typewritten document, which, on being examined by the newspapers outside, was found to show a discrepancy of £19,000,000. We were told by the Treasurer that this was due to a mistake on the part of the typist,- but if the Treasurer - had known what he was reading he would have corrected that mistake before presenting the document to the House. I sometimes think that the officials put in these little errors merely to find out whether there is really anything in the Minister, who merely acts as a rubber stamp when he reads the prepared document.",72

Tliat argument shows, as a matter of fact, that if these war loans were handled in a proper and intelligent way by the authorities who operate the public credit, the Commonwealth Bank could be placed in a position to provide the whole of the loans or credits on behalf of the Government without paying any interest to private individuals.

The banks and financiers do not advance a single penny of money. They advance credits only. We are now told that these credits cannot be advanced except by persons who have tangible securities beW. A. WATT, hind them. As a matter of fact, Treasurer.' every form of security in this country is really owned by the Commonwealth itself. No man owns an acre of land, a bushel of wheat, or a bag of flour that does not belong in the last resort to the Commonwealth as a whole. Every bit of wealth is subject to any for m of taxation. If the Commonwealth wished to go to that extent-I . do not say it ever would - it could confiscate every for m of wealth from one end of the country to the otber.",73
376,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"If that statement is true, the Commonwealth could take the suit of clothes from the honourable member's back.",74
377,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Eve n that farfetched illustration is perfectly true. But, because the credit of the Commonwealth is divided up among a number of private, individuals by the present system of operating these credits, the great bulk of the people are being fleeced the whole time.  gument, nobody has any money at all. over Mr JH CATTS - The honourable member knows a little better than his in This could terjection indicates. He was pledged to inaugurate a Commonwealth Bank of issue, deposit, exchange, and reserve, and he knows that if the Labour party's scheme for a Commonwealth Bank had been carried out the whole of these credits could have been provided without interest cost to the great mass of the people, and could have been liquidated from direct taxation. Tliere is no justification for building up a huge war debt when there is no tangible asset behind it . Senator Millen is reported in the Age .of the 29th January last to have saidRegarding the question of public credit and of capital, we had in Australia raised £200,000,000 from Australian people, the interest to be paid by Australia. If in pre-war days he had hinted that we could, with safety, have raised half that sum, to stimulate and - develop the latent resources of our country, Jhe would have been regarded as a most reckless promoter of wild-cat schemes. When, in - connection with the Eiver Murray, a financial scheme amounted to £4,000,000 there were those who wondered whether, in a few years, that Amount of money could be raised-a n amount which we were now spending every few weeks an - the maintenance of our Army. We hoped, in the future, there would be an entirely new and less Conservative view takeu in connection, - with the public credit. Senator Millen admits that the force of Blakeley, A. circumstances brought about by this war Considine, M. P. has compelled him to review the opinions Fenton, j .

It has compelled the banks to lodge some £10,000,000 or more of gold with the Commonwealth Treasury, and, as against' that gold, it has issued about four times the amount in paper money.  you that if we utilized the whole of the ptublic credit what a sorry position we would be in?",74
378,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"-If we utilized the whole of the public credit, there would %>e no public credit of any description left . There is only oue f u n d of credit in - this country. There is a totality of - credit. Whatever it is, it is an ascertainable amount, if the matter be thoroughly investigated, aud whether it is utilized, as under the present system, by a number of people becoming guarantors, or whether issued by the Commonwealth itself, as required, it will not be used up with any greater rapidity. As a matter of fact, there is absolutely no sense in the honourable member's interjection. My time has expired. I protest against a perpetuation of the present method of providing the necessary credits for carrying on the war. Question-That the words proposed to be added be added (Mr Fenton'S amendment)-put .

379,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [11.3] In this clause there is a f r u it f u l source of discussion which might well engage our attention for some little time, although the hour is late. It opens up the question. "" What are the purposes for which this war is being waged, and for which it is proposed that we should raise the large sum mentioned in the previous clause?"" I propose, by way of dealing with one of the purposes of this war, to move an amendment and call attention to one of the war purposes which has been indicated by those gentlemen tourists, the clared Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy"" (Mr Cook), who, affecting to represent, but really misreprein senting, Australia, recently set out on Conference. their way to London for the purpose, amongst other things, of declaring that bhink of it? Australia had made up her mind that she would hold until the last gasp the German colonies in the Pacific, which have been acquired by Australian deavour. As this represents a very striking departure from what was originally stated to be the war aims of the Allies-as it represents a departure tirely inconsistent witli the aims for tiou of time. which, I think, a just war may be waged, and is inconsistent also with the best i terests of the Commonwealth- I am matter whole-heartedly opposed to what is stated peace. to be one 'of Australia's war purposes, and I think the present a convenient time for registering my opposition. fore move That the following words be 'added to clause:-""Provide d that ' w a r purposes' shall not include the acquisition or retention by Commonwealth of additional territory."" The principal of the islands in the pended Pacific which it is now declared we must retain, and the retention of which, parently, is to be a condition of peace, a very extensive territory, and almost already has. only a few degrees sub-tropical. portion of New Guinea which, until recently, was possessed by the Germans, is merely equivalent in area to Victoria, the garden State of the Commonwealth, in which our Parliament meets. acquired by Germany in 1884, so that it Germany has been in possession of it thirty-four years. ""With German New of Avhite men. Guinea, of course, we have the Caroline Islands, Samoa, and some less important territories taken from the enemy, and is said that we must retain these territralia tories until "" the last gasp."" How curious it is that the Government should-an apparently those two tourists, the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy, speak for the Government-hav e come to the conclusion that Australia should be the only one of the independent self-governing Dominions, and the only country amongst the Allies, to make declaration that annexation of territory must be a condition of peace. President sary to my case. Wilson has declared for "" No annexaagainst tions; no indemnities."" Russia has against indemnities. Lloyd George has declared that the question of the retention of the late German islands the Pacific is a matter for the Peacee",75
380,Mr BOYD,Unknown,What does Timbuctoo,76
381,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,I should have thought that the opinion of the PrimaMinister of Great Britain would have apenpealed more to the honourable member.,76
382,Mr BOYD,Unknown,Not after 11 p.m.,76
383,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"This question is en- - far more important than any oonsideraI n any event the Government might well have seen fit to adjourn,, n - and to devote tomorrow to'this important of land-grabbing as a condition of I am totally opposed to theseterritories being saddled on Australia. Quite apart from the possibility that theI thereclaim for their retention might prolong this war, they would mean additional expense and danger for the Commonwealth, the which is already unable to cope with the the vast spaces which it is supposed to govern. If the safety of the Commonwealth deupon the defence of its shore l in e by arms or by a fleet it is quite obvious apthat we should be unable to defend theis tremendous coast line which Australia, It has been said by an That honourable member of another place that, in order to preserve the principle of .a White Australia, we must not renounce our right to these islands in the Pacific. When we come to examine the population; It was of German New Guinea we find that consists of 500,000 blacks, and? for some inconsiderable number of hundreds It is by saddling ourselves Will this vast new territory, so a speaker in another place has said, it that we are to safeguard our White Auspolicy. This is Avhat I have described on a previous occasion as the new d Imperialism. We are to be the first protagonists .of new and extended territories.. We are the first, and, indeed, the only, country amongst the Allies to claim our pound of flesh as the result of this war. I do not declare by any means that it would be necessarily desirable that the German a people should retain possession of these islands in the Pacific. That is not necesWhat I do protest is that while this war is being dewaged at its very height, while the issue is still unhappily only too uncertain, while thousands of lives are being lost in the fearfu l contest, and while the genius of wise men is likely to be strained in determining the conditions under which the war may be brought to an end'. Australia alone, and in advance, stipulates that she must have additional territory to that which she is unable to adequately occupy, use, or securely defend. An honourable senator has remarked that a resolution of the kind that he proposed in another place would have the effect of ""putting starch into the collar"" of the I m perial Government, since it would be a, declaration that we must not,, under any conditions, surrender these And it is because a declaration on the part of the Minister for the Navy (Mr . Cook) and the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) at the heart of the Empire is likely to have some effect, is likely to be listened to, and to be believed in , and that it will be believed that they do represent the people of Australia - whil e in truth and in fact there is no warranty for that assumption-it is be- cause they may be believed, that their wanton declaration i u that regard is peculiarly mischievous and should be heartily condemned.",76
384,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"The v represent Australia, all right.",77
385,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"They may represent those interests in Australia in. which the honourable member is pecuniarily in terested . But they do not represent Australia in regard to Australian Imperial policy-if there is such a thing-and they certainly do not represent Australia, so far as her war policy is concerned. That was decided in an efficient manner in December last, and in October of the previous year. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), speaking at a suburban gathering somewhere or other recently, said that Germany - Germany alone - had - been preparing for this war for for t y years. Germany, as a great military Power, had been preparing, no doubt, for war. Prussian militarism had been developing both in and out of Prussia during that time. But it is a very curious thing that if Germany has been preparing for this war for for t y years she should have ' safeguarded her interests in the Pacific in such a manner that, although she has been in possession of certain of the Pacific Islands for thirty-four years she had only entrenched herself there to such an extent that when the war broke out we were able to send a single battleship and take possession almost without striking a blow. There was some little skirmishing, but it was hardly worth mentioning. Practically, there was no resistance at all, notwithstanding that it is alleged that Germany had been preparing for the war for for t y years, and has even been accused of "" nesting"" her whole fleet in one of the rivers of German New Guinea.

447,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"My point of order is that there is no precedent .for declaring that the mere fact of no tellers being appointed from this side entitles the Speaker to say that the question is carried in the affirmative. Nor, Mr Speaker, have you attempted to j u s t if y your position. The reason for that is probably that the proceedings were interrupted by the unseemly conduct of the Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom), who has been disorderly throughout the evening. I submit and if you disagree with me, I shall move that your ruling be disagreed with that you are not justified in contending that the absence of tellers from this side justifies you in declaring the question resolved in the affirmative.",81
448,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am acting i u accordance with the precedent of the House of Commons, the practice of which governs be any our procedure when we have no special standing order dealing with the matter before us. If there are no tellers willing to act on one side, there can be no division. I quote from May, 11th Edition, page 361, or page 341 of the 10th EditionThe Speaker directs the "" Ayes "" to go into right lobby, and the "" Noes '* into the left and then appoints two tellers for each party; of whom one for the "" Aves "" and an""Noes"" other for the "" Noes "" are associated, to check each other in the telling. If two tellers cannot found for one of the parties, the divisioncannot take place: and the Speaker forthwith to announces the decision of the House.

450,Mr WBBSTEK,Unknown,What if the Prime Minister died f,82
451,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"If the Prime M in ister died, somebody 'else would have to give notice of the motion.

452,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In the case of a particular Minister's name being mentioned in this connection, I point out that whoever, is Minister in charge of the business of the House acts on behalf of the M in ister in whose name the motion stands.
