Mr D . CAMERON - In view of the reported statement of Dr Smalpage that there will be available tomorrow a sufficient quantity of his serum to treat 2,000 cases, I ask the Minister for Health whether individual applications for treatment by Dr Smalpage's method have been or will be received, and also whether the names of the medical practitioners in each State who will be in a position to administer the serum are available?",14
1,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,Unknown,"It is i m possible at present to make a definite statement about the time when the serum will be available, or to in for m the House whether the specialists who have been selected to use it will accopt the responsibility. I hope that at the end of next week I shall be in a position to give the honourable member the information he desires. NA",14
2,Mr BOWDEN,KYOGLE TO SOUTHBRISBANE,I ask the Prime Minister whether any finality has yet heen reached in the negotiations with the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland for the carrying ont of the agreement for the construction of the railway from Kyogle to South Brisbane?,14
3,Mr BRUCE,KYOGLE TO SOUTHBRISBANE,"A conference was held in Melbourne some ten days ago,- and the Ministers who represented New South Wales and Queensland at that conference have now returned to their respective States and made their reports to their Cabinets. I believe that a quite satisfactory settlement will be arrived at. I think there is a meeting today of the railway council which, under the three acta governing the construction of the line, has control of the work, and I am very hopeful that after' the council has met the whole matter will be adjusted. CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS. TRUSTS AND COMBINES. 1926. Mr Fenton - I have a question to ask which is, perhaps, a legal one, but I address it to the Prime Minister, because I consider that it involves a matter of policy. Will the right honourable gentleman consult with the Attorney-General with a view to exploring all avenues of information in order that we may be placed in a position in this Parliament to enact a law which will deal with corporations, such as the O i l Corporation and others, that are carrying on business in Australia? Section 51 of the Constitution provides thatThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, havn power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to(i) Trade and commerce witli other countries and aunong the States. (xx) Foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. In view of . the recent decisions of the High Court with regard to the Constitution and its operation, and the definite legal opinions expressed in this House and out of it, that if we were to pass a bill dealing with specific subjects it would be constitutional, will the Prime Minister investigate the whole matter in conjunction with the Attorney-General with a view to the introduction and passing of legislation to deal with corporations and RAILWAY. companies 1",14
4,Mr BRUCE,KYOGLE TO SOUTHBRISBANE,"It is certainly one of the functions of the Commonwealth Government to take all steps necessary to safeguard the people, and to exercise all powers we haye for that purpose under the Constitution, and I should naturally consult the Attorney General should any necessity of the character which he suggests arise. W it h regard to the legal opinions as to our powers to which the honourable member has referred, may I.suggest that it is he who should make available to us those opinions for our assistance in dealing with what is an extraordinarily difficult and complicated question. MAINTENANCE OF TELEPHONES.",14
5,Mr MANNING,KYOGLE TO SOUTHBRISBANE,"I ask the Postmaster-General whether he will see that holders of private telephone lines erected before the present conditions were approved, and who were, therefore, at much greater expense than holders of lines under existing conditions, shall be placed in the same position as regards maintenance and cost as those who are being connected with the telephone system at the present, time under more advantageous conditions ?",14
6,Mr GIBSON,KYOGLE TO SOUTHBRISBANE,There is no difference between the conditions applying to those who are now being connected with the telephone system and those who were previously connected with it ; the same conditions apply to both. MIGRATION AGREEMENT.,15

9,Mr MARRS,AUSTRALIAN NAVA L,"Has the Prime Minisone ter's attention been drawn to the report in last night's Herald and this morning's Sun regarding a statement by Admiral Viscount Jellicoe pointing out the speech serious need of the Empire's cruiser strength to protect our trade routes, and the impossibility of the Motherland continuing to carry practically the whole burden of Naval defence. The per capita contribution to that defence is: Motherland, 24s.; South Africa, Is. 9d.; Commonwealth aud New Zealand, from I Ss. to 9s.; and Canada, 3^d. Nottravelling withstanding our fine effort, I ask the Prime Minister to consider the matter, in view of Admiral Jellicoe's strong appeal to the Dominions, to see whether we might not go further than we have gone. In view of the statewas ment of the ex-Minister for Defence (Mr. Bowden), that a third cruiser would laid down, perhaps in three years' time, ask whether that work could not be expedited to meet the appeal of Admiral Jellicoe.",15

January, the honourable member for D a r l in g (Mr B l a k e l e y ) asked the following questions:1. Will he supply information as to the quantities of cotton tweed imported. into Australia in 1925, during the months of September, October, November, aud December. Loan. 2. Under what tariff conditions were such ' cotton tweeds imported? By By ComGrand I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following informament. ment;. tion :September £21,497 '1 £ £ £ £ £ October 17,653 473,078 November 28.777 December 65,295 440,099 £133.222 2. During the months mentioned duties applied as under:Cotton tweeds, under the 1921 tariff, were free if of TJnited Kingdom origin, and dutiable at 15 per cent, if from other countries. From 3rd September, 1925, the tariff proposals imposed duty as follows:-Cotto n tweeds, the invoice selling price of which does not exceed 5s. per lineal yard, British preferen- practicable in It a l y . tial tariff, per square yard, Is.; ad valorem. 3D per cent.; general tariff, per square yard, 2s.; ad valorem, 45 per cent. "" Other"" cotton tweeds than the. above remained as before, viz., United Kingdom, free; other, 15 per cent. From the same date a Customs by-law was made admitting under tariff item 4.04 ' (United Kingdom, free; other, 10 per cent.), cotton tweeds for which a firm order was actually placed with the overseas suppliers on or before 2nd September, 1925, and which were entered for home consumption in Australia on or before 31st December, 1925. The goods entered up to 31st December would have, been admitted under item 404. In regard to the figures for November and December, it is pointed out that, on the 14th November last, a number of lines which had hitlierto been classified as cotton piece goods, n.e.i., were reclassified - as cotton tweeds, and this would account for a large proportion of the increase. The fallowing paper was presented: Photographs of Canberra, to accompany Quarterly Report of the Federal Capital Commission to 31st December, 1925, laid upon the table of the House on the 22nd ultimo. BEOOM MILLET .",18
38,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The question of again permitting the importation of broom millet in to Australia has recently received attention. Both employers and employees in the broom-making industry represented that a sufficient supply of locally-grown long-hurl millet was not available in Australia, and that the long hurl was absolutely essential to the manufacture of brooms for the purposes of providing covers. We were told that, owing to the prohibition of imports of this variety of millet from It a l y , the employment of a considerable number of men would be jeopardized. In order that the question might be carefully in vestigated upon every side, inquiries were made f rom the Italian Government as to the possibility of a method of disinfection prior to shipment from It a l y [29] which would make safe the importation of millet from that country. . A report has been received through the courtesy of the It a l i a n Consul-General that the only method of disinfection which is considered safe by the department is not Accordingly, tl.""i Government decided that no steps shall be taken to disturb the present proclamation which prohibits the importation of broom millet. MARRIED WOMEN'S NATIONALITY.",19
39,Mr DUNCAN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"HUGHES (Boothby) [2.58] - I m o v e That, in the opinion of this House, a British woman should not lose, or be deemed to lose, her nationality by the mere act of marriage with an alien, hut that it should be open to her.to make a declaration of alienage. I assure the House that the motion has no party significance. I'be organization which first .asked me to move in this matter is non-partisan, and I believe that there are members on both sides of PAPER. the House who took an interest in it long before I did, and who will endorse the opinions which 1 - shajl express this afternoon. The motion is strongly supported by women throughout the Commonwealth. Eor instance, I received last night the following telegram from the president and secretary of the Women's Christian Temperance Union in Sydney:Women's Christian Temperance Union, representing 2,000 members, supports nationality resolution. At the ninth congress of the International Women's Alliance, held in Rome in 1923, 43 nations were represented, and the following motion was agreed to:That this congress declares that a married woman should be given the same right as a man to retain or to change her nationality. I shall not deal with the history of this matter, except incidentally as I proceed. Eor my immediate purposes it is sufficient to remind honourable members that the Commonwealth' law relating to women who marry aliens, is identical with that of Great Britain . Section 18 of the Nationality Act 1920, provides, in brief, that the wife of a British subject shall be deemed to be a British subject, and that the wife of an alien shall be deemed to be an alien. But there are certain exceptions for' which the section makes provision. Where a man during the continuance of his marriage ceases to be a British subject it is competent for his wife to declare that she for her part desires to remain a British subject. Where an alien is a subject of a State at war with Great Britain it is competent for his wife, if she was a British subject at birth, to make a declaration that she desires to resume her British nationality, and thereupon she may be granted a certificate of naturalization. I am not aware how far this provision has operated in war time, but I should think that it is more a pious aspiration than one which is likely to be freely utilized. In any case a woman who is allowed to resume her original nationality in these circumstances is obviously in - an inferior position to one who has never been deprived of it . It is provided also in our Nationality Act that when a certificate of naturalization is revoked, the wife and minor children remain Britisli subjects, unless their names are expressly included in the revocation order or unless the wife within six months from the date of the order makes a declaration of alienage. Provision is also made whereby a woman may on the death of her alien husband or on the dissolution of her marriage with him obtain a certificate of naturalization. These exceptions indicate that the main principle of the act has already been found to require considerable modification. My motion is in identical terms with a resolution which was carried in the House of Commons in February of last year. I have used the words of the British resolution so that there will be no lack of uniformity. I was doubtful as to whether or not I should substitute "" Australian "" for "" British, "" but I came to the conclusion that it was unnecessary to do so, because the people of the Commonwealth, as well as those of any other dominion, are entitled to express an opinion on matters affecting the whole Empire.",19
40,Mr WEST,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,If British women married men of their own race there would be no trouble.,20
41,Mr DUNCAN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"HUGHES - The honourable member is perhaps an idealist, but vye have to face the facts as they are. I am endeavouring to deal with a difficulty that is constantly arising and has been the cause of considerable distress and hardship to many people. In the House of Commons the motion was moved by M a j or Harvey and seconded by Lady Astor. There was a lengthy debate upon it , i u which. Miss Wilkinson, a Labour member, took part. A reference then made by M a j or Harvey, which, I think, I ought to repeat here, is as follows:At the present moment there are some 70 societies representing women and men in all of the Dominions, and a great many of the Crown Colonies, and practically all of those associations have written to me saying that they would do what they could to support this motion. I may say that they represent no particular creed and no particular party, but are of all creeds, all classes, and all political parties. I have here a letter from the president of the Australian Federation of Women's Societies for Equal Citizenship, and she assures me' that for some considerable time they have been trying to get some measures passed in this direction. I have here a list of an enormous number of societies in the TJnited Kingdom, as well as a list of societies throughout the whole of the Dominions and Crown Colonies, representing the women of all those places, who are strongly in support of an alteration of the law in this direction. At this stage, I may mention that I endeavoured , to have this motion discussed in this chamber last year, but, owing to the pressure of Government business, the opportunities for dealing with private members' business were so curtailed that I was not successful. In the House of Commons this amendment was moved by Sir Henry Slesser, who. was Solicitor General in the late Labour Government :That in the opinion of this House, whilst a British woman, on marrying an alien, normally acquires his nationality, it should be open to her to make an effective declaration that she wishes to retain her British nationality. That amendment, which was duly seconded, really provided for "" contracting in"" instead of "" contracting out."" The difference was generally agreed to be one of detail and method', rather than of principle, but I am doubtful on that point, because, to my mind, the difference is really whether nationality or family is to be the guiding principle. What, apparently, weighed greatly with the House of Commons in the end was the feeling that if the amendment were agreed to a great many people, especially poor people, would not ""contract in , "" because, in the first place, they would not know anything about the law, or, in - the second place, they would not be in a financial position to seek legal advice on the subject. The feeling of the House was that a British woman who married an alien should remain what she had been from her birth, and should not be divested of her nationality unless she so desired. As the amendment was withdrawn, and thei motion was carried without a division, one can say that it was carried with the full concurrence of the House of Commons. There was only one exception to the general unanimity displayed during the debate. That exception was the Minister who replied, Mr . Locker-Lampson, Under-Secretary State for the Home Department, and it appears to me that his attitude towards the motion was intended to throw as much cold water on it as was consistent with the Government's decision not to oppose the general will of the House. I will give the House a few' extracts, from the proceedings while Mr LockerLampson was speaking. I shall not repeat all the excuses which he gave for not bringing this alteration into effect, but he brought forward our old friends, "" I think we are all agreed'that something ought to be done,"" and "" We ought to go into this very carefully."" The matter has been "" gone, in to "" with much care by a great many people for some years, and they, I am sure, feel that they have "" gone into "" it as carefully as there is any need to, and that one should now stress the first dictum, that "" something ought to be done."" Mr LockerLampson referred to several alternative suggestions that had been made, and particularly to the recommendation of the sub-committee of the ImDerial Conference of 1893. As I wish to give his point of view as well as my own, I shall quote the words which he quoted in the House of Commons. The committee came to this decision: The committee are of opinion that the principal of the existing law, that the nationality of a married woman depends upon that of her husband should be maintained. They, nevertheless, recommend that powers should be taken to re-admit a woman to' British nationality in cases where the married state, though subsisting in law, has for all practical purposes come to an end. - that is, for instance, in such a case as desertion. The point I wish to emphasize is that, in spite of this recommendation of the sub-committee of the Imperial Conference, and in spite of the fact that the Imperial Conference approved that recommendation, the House of Commons, without a division, decided that the principle of the existing law that the nationality of a married woman depends upon that of her husband should not be maintained. Mr Locker-Lampson gave a number, of reasons against the change, but I do not think they were effective. It is very noticeable, - and I think very regrettable, that he never faced the real merits of the case. He did not advance any arguments against the real, solid arguments adof duced in favour of the change. He eventually ended up with this bomb-shell: I should like to remind honourable members that all changes in the nationality law require . the consent of the self-governing dominions. I think that that has been lost sight of in this debate. . . . Certainly, the Government do not want to resist this motion, and if the House desires that it should be carried, let it be carried. I should like to say it is quite impossible, until we have the assent of the self-governing dominions to engage in legislation. . Directly we get their replies, if they are practically unanimous, we can pass legislation on this subject. He appeared to be under the impression that the amendment of Sir Henry Slesser, which he evidently preferred, would be carried, and later in the proceedings he interjected, "" If this House passes a resolution in the terms of the amendment of the honourable and learned member opposite (Sir Henry Slesser), we shall , transmit that resolution to the self-governing dominions, and do our best to put it through."" Lady Astor inquired, "" If we pass the resolution in the original form, will you transmit that also?"" Mr . Locker-Lampson replied, "" I understood that my honourable and gallant friend who moved the original motion was going to withdraw it , "" and Lady Astor said "" No . "" Lady Astor was not successful in obtaining from the Under-Secretary to the Home Department a statement as to whether, if the original motion were carried, the Government would transmit it to the dominions. I should like the right honourable the Prime Minister, when he deals with this subject, to be good enough to say whether .the original motion, which was carried by the House of Commons without a division, - was transmitted by the Home Government to the Australian Government. If that w,as done, I should' like to know when it was received, and what answer this Government sent. The motion which I move does not seek to make a woman's nationality compulsory; the object of it is to give her the right of choice. has been suggested, and I think it is very likely, that a woman remaining in the land of her birth after she has married an alien would be wise to remain British, but one who goes to live abroad should change her nationality; but that is purely a matter for the individual to consider. I wish to draw attention to the fact that my motion does not say when the declaration of alienage should be made. That point was raised in the House of Commons, and Sir Henry Slesser saidOne point which is important is that of the time when this declaration is' to be made,, and that difficulty applies equally motion and the amendment. . . . It is a matter which cannot be decided on this resolution, but would have to be decided if a bill were brought before the House. . . I think the resolution is consistent with the choice being exercised subsequently. I am certainly inclined to think so, too. If a bill were brought in , provision would no doubt be made for the time within which the declaration must be made, but it is right that I should point out to the House that as the motion stands it contains no provision as to the time within which the declaration shall be made.",20
42,Mr MANN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"If a woman did not make the declaration at the time of her marriage, would the existing law remain operative?",22
43,Mr DUNCAN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"HUGHE S - Some latitude ought to be extended to her in regard to the time allowed to her to make a decision. That would be possible under my motion, and the details as to the length of time would be a proper subject for discussion, when a bill was brought forward. What does a woman lose under the present system ? I do not propose to deal with this matter exhaustively, because a few words should be sufficient to indicate the very great loss which a woman suffers under the present law when she marries an alien. In the first place, she loses nationality. Women are not less suscepDr tible to sentiment than men, and to nationality is as great a loss to a woman, as to a man. No woman, wherever born, desires to lose her nationality; and it is dence difficult to justify robbing her of her nationality because of her marriage with an alien.. That difficulty has been emphasized by our experiences during and It since the recent war. In . the second place, she loses the franchise. That, at any time, is a considerable loss, but the loss is greater in Australia than it is in Great Britain . In Great Britain , a woman must be at least 30 years of age before she can exercise the franchise, and, even then, she cannot do so unless she is a university voter or has a property qualification. In Australia, every woman who has attained the age of 21 years, and is a natural-born or naturalized British subject with the necessary residential qualifications, is entitled to vote. In the third place, the question of her property arises. I do not intend to give instances to the showing the harsh operation of the existing law, as it must be within the knowledge of honourable members that a great many women, both Australian and British, lost their property during the war because of their marriage with aliens. In those instances in which they were permitted to retain their property, the permission to do so was an act of grape. The loss of her nationality, of the franchise, and, in certain' circumstances, of her property, is a severe penalty for marrying an alien. What are the objections to the change which I propose? It would be idle to pretend that there are no objections, but the - reasons in favour of a change seem to me to far outweigh those for the retention of the present system. I shall enumerate some of the outstanding objections to any change from the existing law. These I have extracted from a. memorandum compiled by the Home and Territories Department. The first objection is that the present principle is regarded as the sounder one. Even if we admit that that is so, the existing principle is far from being sound.",22
44,Mr MAXWELL,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Were those objections urgedby the department against any change of the present system ?,22
45,Mr DUNCAN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"HUGHES - Yes . . An y one who has studied international law realizes that the subject of - nationality her bristles with difficulties. I quote from Lawrence's Principles of Internalose tional Law, page 213, where he saysStates are free by virtue of their indepento adopt in these matterB what principles they please, and they embody in their Laws a great variety of rules. The result is that conflicting claims and difficulties of all sorts arise on the subject of nationality and citizenship. That is the present position. I do not suggest that, if an alteration is made, these difficulties will disappear. On the contrary, other difficulties may be encountered. I wish, however, toemphasize that whether the present law is thought to embody the sounder principle or not, it certainly is neither sound nor clear. The second objection to the change is that, in the interest of family life, it is important that identity of nationality between husband and wife shall be maintained. But husband and wife frequently differ on many subjects, and still manage to live together in comparative amity. Instances in which husband and wife hold different political or religious views, and yet live together in harmony, are not uncommon, and I am not prepared to admit that the difficulties connected with their nationality, in the event of the change which I advocate being effected, will be insuperable. Those who suggest that they are insurmountable grasp the form and lose sight of the spirit. Is a woman's attitude necessarily changed by her marriage with an alien, and by her being forced to go through the form of becoming a member of another race ? And if it is not changed, of what value is the form? The third objection is that the present principle is that of, practically, all countries. That is not so. Particularly is it not so in the TJnited States of America, the country with which we are chiefly concerned in this respect. 1922, the Congress of the United States of America passed what is known as the Cable law, under which no alien woman who marries an American man can become an American citizen u n t i l she has resided for one year in the United States of America. If a British woman marries an American man she loses her nationality for at least twelve months; and unless she resides in the United States of America for .a year,- she loses it for ever. It may happen that an Australian woman marries an American man who is resident in Australia, and ' does not intend to return to the United States of America for many years. Until he returns, she is without nationality. The American law applies conversely also, showing, that that countryi n dealing with this question, does so solely from its own point of view. It s law provides that no American' woman who marries an alien is divested of her American citizenship unless she renounces it in a court. As America has passed legislation of that kind, surely it is time that we reconsidered our position in our own in terests. America is not the only country that has such legislation. During the last few years it has been open to a Belgian woman who marries a foreigner to decide within six months whether she shall lose her Belgian nationality. In Sweden, in 1924, the right was given to women subjects who married aliens to retain their nationality if they did not go to their husband's country. I am informed that similar provisions are in force in Switzerland and Norway; and in five South American States - women do not automatically lose their nationality by marriage with an alien. All this legislation is evidence of the march of time and of the trend away from the system under which our nationality law was formed. I =uay be allowed to remind honourable members that nationality is a very con.plicated subject, and has always been considered very differently in the two great branches of the European race. 1 may put it shortly in this quotation from Professor WestlakeIt often happens that two States claim the other same person as their national or subject. This conflict arises not only from naturalization having been granted without the corresponding expatriation having been permitted, but also from the fact that birth on the soil was the leading determinant of nationality by feudal In law, and still is so by the laws of England and the United States of America, while the nationality of the father is its leading determinant in those countries which have accepted Roman principles of jurisprudence. The English law, which started with the law of the soil, has been considerably extended until it now includes the principle of the law of blood as well. Our Nationality Act provides thatThe following persons shall be deemed to be natural-born British subjects, namely :(o) any person born within His Majesty's dominions and allegiance. - ther e we have the law of the soil-and (b) any person born out of His Majesty's dominions whose father was a British subject at the time of that person's birth. There we have the law of bljod incorporated in our act as well. A furthe r argument that is put forward by the department is that if this change were made some women would have no nationality, and others would have a double nationality. That objection has equal force under existing conditions. Under the Cable Act, which I have just quoted, it will be obvious that an American woman who marries a B r it is h man remains for American purposes an American, and becomes for British purposes a Briton. On the other hand, a B r i tish woman who marries an American man ceases to have any nationality, because by British law she is regarded as an American, and by American law she is not regarded ^as American u n t i l she has resided in the United States of America for twelve months. born in England of French parents is a British subject according to British law, and a French subject according to the law of France. I am endeavouring to show that this objection, raised by the department to the proposed change in our nationality law, is applicable to the law that is in existence now. rence, at page 214, saysIn such cases there is evident danger of serious complications if each State acts upon its extremest rights. But difficulties are generally avoided by the tacit consent of each' to attempt no exercise of authority over such a citizen as long as he remains outside its borders, and to make no objection to the exercise of authority over hini by the other while he resides within its limits. That is the spirit of forbearance, no doubt will continue to exist in the future. I have admitted that if the change is made it will probably give rise to difficulties, but at the same time. I have tried to deal with some of the difficulties which have been raised in advance by the Home - and Territories To my mind, the question whether one system will give rise to more difficulties than the other. question depends upon, and should be decided by, the altered position women in our society during the last 50 years. We have got away pletely from the eastern idea of the subjection of women, so far indeed as it ever prevailed in British countries. remember when I studied used to amuse us to read that one time in the history of law there were three classes of people who, in the matter of dealing with their Mr Duncan-Hughes. property, were under disabilities: infants-peopl e under 21 years of agelunatics, and married women. That classification is to a certain extent expressive of the old attitude towards women, which has been completely changed within the last few years. I can remember when the suffragette movement-to take one branch of women's activities was active. I once saw a suffragette r i o t ; a more undignified and lamentable performance it has rarely been my misfortune to witness. It was at that time, I think, that when a suffragette lady had been imprisoned, her husband, in his zeal to further the cause, promised to pay a certain sum per day for every day during which she remained in A child prison. I consider that the suffragette movement was an unfortunate phase of the women's movement, though by some it has been regarded as justified. It was a very short phase, and women have since adopted the plan of obtaining what they desired, so far as they could obtain it , by legitimate constitutional methods. That is the way in which they hope to Dr Law- gain this nationality reform. In considering the matter at this time, we should not forget the tremendous services which in munitions and other factories, hospitals, and many other places, women rendered during the war. It appears tq me that they have a claim, which is one .of ordinary justice, and especially in a country like this, where they possess the full franchise. I say that it, is a terrible situation in which which to put a woman who desires to marry a man who was not born under the English flag, to say to her that she must forfeit her nationality in order to do so, that she must forfeit all her civic rights, and possibly her right to property. I go a step further. I do not Department. think it is desirable, from our point of is not view, that we should force our women against their will out of our community The whole or nation. Why should we do so unless they desire to go? The people of a country who have loyal and cordial feelings of towards it should be regarded as a national asset. It should not be for the com- country to say, "" If you choose to marry a foreigner, you can leave us."" 'The view that I suggest is not, of course, I new. For instance, the Russian people law it - and I speak now of the time before the at war-hel d the old doctrine of inalienable British allegiance, expressed in the motto, Nemo potest exuere patriam- "" No one can throw off his country."" They held that principle in its full severity. I do not suggest that we should go so far as to say that no one can leave his country. But I do say that, in the interests of the British race and the Australian people, it - is not wise to force our women out of the nation and to compel them to forfeit their rights because they happen to marry foreigners. There are one or two subsidiary points upon which I would like to touch briefly. There is the converse question of whether an alien woman should by marriage with a British subject become British. I think that there, too, it should be a question of choice. It may be desirable that a foreign woman who desires to become British should take the oath of allegiance when she does so. I am not dealing with British women as British, but with the whole female sex. As we think that our people should have the choice to take up their residence and throw in their lot with another race, should they so desire, so we should be prepared to allow women of other races to come into our race.",22
46,Mr WEST,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Will the honourable mem- necessary ber tell us what they do in China?,25
47,Mr DUNCAN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"HUGHES - I afraid that I shall have to leave that to the honourable member. I have never been in China, nor have I made any special study of the question as it affects Chinese women. Unless the honourable member can submit facts to show me that his interjection bears upon the subject, I cannot regard it as strictly relevant, and if I dealt with it I might be called to order. The second question I wish to refer to is the position of children. There is, in the opinion of some people a fear that if this reform is made, it will lead to a claim that the children, or some of them at least, instead of following their father's nationality should follow that of their mother. That is not, in any case, an issue now, and the principle of following the blood is very much modified, so far as British people are concerned, by the law of the soil to which I have referred. In any case, we ought to do justice in this matter, and leave the question of the children until it comes up for discussion. So far as the present law is not limited by the law of the soil, I am in favour of children following the nationality of the father and not of the mother. I do not think that the women who are asking for this amendment are using it as a lever to press for a further alteration later. A good many years ago - in 1907, I think - I had the privilege of hearing the late Mr Deakin speak in London at a meeting relating to compulsory service. Lord Roberts, I remember, was in the chair, and Mr Deakin, in parenthesis, said to the chairman, after he had just made a reference to women, "" In Australia we have not yet decided which is the greater-the man, or the woman who bore him . "" I hope that, in dealing with this motion, the House will be actuated by the spirit of the late M.r. Deakin, who was one of the greatest ornaments that this House ever had.",25
48,Mr MANN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Perth)' [ 3 . 4 7 ] - I second the motion which has been proposed by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr. Duncan-Hughes), and I compliment him on the exhaustive, moderate, and convincing manner in which he has put his case before the House. I am unable to put the case so' ably, because I lack that legal knowledge and training for the consideration of matters of this kind. I , therefore, do not am propose to traverse a great deal of the ground that the honourable member for Boothby has covered. There are probably lawyers in this House who will give us the benefit of their opinions. I should, however, like to emphasize one or two points in support of the motion. In considering an alteration of legislation, we must get down to the bedrock reason for it . Why are limitations to nationality prescribed? What is the main motive and object in view? The motive must be either the protection of the individual in her f a m i l y relations, or the protection of the nation itself. We need not concern ourselves with the latter. The law cannot, of course, be intended to increase the numerical strength of the nation, because it deprives some of our citizens of their nationality; but it may be intended to protect the interests of the nation, in its relations with other countries. In England; this alteration might be of great importance in its relation to Continental countries; in fact, I cannot resist the feeling that some of the present nationality provisions are being tacitly maintained by the Home Government-as shown by .the honourable member for Boothby when quoting Mr Locker-Lampson-with certain possible dangers in time of war, such as espionage, and communication of information through private .and secret channels. I do not know that this is a matter to which we need give so much consideration as the British has given to it, but if it be of importance to us, then it must be of far greater importance to England, and the House of Commons surely is well aware of that. We can conclude that it was considered sufficiently unimportant to be brushed aside in favour of the proposed ment, and, therefore, from a national standpoint, we need not materially cern ourselves with it. But with regard to the individualistic or the family and the effect upon the individual in her family relationships we are on different ground altogether. This matter must be considered from the point of view of the individuals themselves. It has been said that something ought to be done, but I am very much afraid that we shall be met with possibly another of those time-worn arguments that "" the time is not ripe,"" that "" the present is not a suitable occasion,"" or some other for postponing this subject, has already been discussed bated and considered with the greatest care. If the question of the individual relationships of the family is involved, surely the women who ask for this right ought to decide for themselves they want. The honourable member for Boothby has shown that the excuse is constantly used that the would not be in the interests family, and that this or that set of circumstances might arise and cause' difficulty. The interests of the family are just as much considered by the women as by the men, and the fact that there are no women in this House to speak for their sex on this subject any way diminish the weight of the claim that they are making today. stand equally with men in the civic and public affairs of this country, and they are as much as men entitled to say what they want. It may be said that women are asking for something really not benefit them. stantly come to this House asking for things which they say they want, and which they think will be of benefit them. There may be a difference of opinion on the matter, but, after Mr Mann. a view to the question is usually decided on the assumption that the applicants know best what they require. That principle should apply in this case. We cannot possibly ignore the weight which is behind this motion. It is supported Government by such Australian bodies as the National Councils of Women, the Australian Federation of Women's Societies for Equal Citizenship, and the Women's Christian Temperance Union. Their views are also shared by wider organizations within the Empire and amend- other parts of the world. Both the In ternational Women's Suffrage Alliance, con- comprising women of over 40 couutries, and the International Council of aspect, Women, with branches in those countries have, at their conferences by resolution confirmed this principle. The organized representatives of thinking women in ' Australia today are demanding this concession. They are entitled to have their views respected, and they cannot be thrown aside. Women today can be said to occupy a greatly improved position in the community.",25
49,Mr MAXWELL,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The women who do excuse not want the privilege need not exercise which it. and de- * Mr MANN - That is so. Women have a right to be heard. They cannot be silenced, and honourable members must listen to their demands. We are willing enough to refer to the beneficial work what of our women. During the recent elections the influence of Australian women upon the composition of this House was alteration very material. When those women come of the to honourable members and ask for a concession founded upon reason and sentiment as high as any that honourable members in this House can lay claim to, we cannot push their request aside carelessly and thoughtlessly. We are proud on occasions of laying stress on the imdoes not in portance of the position which the dominions have occupied in recent years Women in the councils of the Empire. We sometimes are inclined to attach greater weight to our opinions than they deserve, but when we get an opportunity to put forward our opinions on a matter which .which will can seriously affect social condiPeople con- tions within the Empire and neglect to do so, then, I say, we are showing a tendency to disregard the reto sponsibilities of that greater prominence which we claim today. Here is a case all, in point. The House of Commons has passed a resolution and the British Goto vernment has. said that it cannot carry it into effect without consulting the dominions. If the dominions pass similar resolution-in spite of the argui ments of Mr Locker-Lampson- I have no doubt that the British Governmentthe will feel obliged to give effect to it passing of this motion will haye a terial effect in bringing about uniformity of action at the Imperial Conference and in the Imperial Parliament, and also greatly influence the other dominions when considering a similar motion I believe that a law of this character was ment. actually passed in the Canadian Parliament some years ago, but, being in conjourned.. flict with some Imperial agreement, could not be operated'. We may assume, therefore, that Canada is willing to follow our example, and if , through our failure to I move-^set an example, we delay the advent of this reform, we shall be guilty of a derement liction of duty. . The motion has been 1 made in a dignified and proper manner, and is well worthy of the consideration of the House . There may be objections lands 1 to this reform, as there are to any amendresolution ment of the law. Generally, as? soon as a law is passed, amending legislation to overcome objections to it becomes necesexpense sary; but the women, of. Australia, after thorough investigation, declare that the objections to the change are not so many as are the objections to the continuance of the present inequality. The honourable member for Boothby referred to the effect which the amendment of the law would have upon the nationality of the children. The nationality of the women, and the nationality of the children, are two entirely different questions,, and must not be considered together. The children's nationality will not be affected in the slightest degree; their outlook and national aspirations will be governed in future, as in the past, by the character of their parents.",26
50,Mr FENTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,And environment.,27
51,Mr MANN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Yes , but the influence of the parents will very often triumph over environment. At any rate, those whom this reform will apply are women of strong character, who will appreciate at its full worth the privilege which suggested amendment will bestow upon them. I am certainthat the attention all Australian women is concentrated upon this House and the debate thisafternoon. Honourable members have an opportunity live up to the professions they so f r e quently made when courting, the suffrages of women voters:,, by showing that they a recognize the equality of men and women n the matter of nationality. I hope that the Government will place no obstacle in way of an early decision upon the . The motion. Certainly,, the Government, canmanot be embarrassed by referring the pro*posal to the Imperial Conference,, thus recognizing Australia's responsibility in Empire affairs in . accordance with, the decision in the House of Commons, and the undertaking by the Imperial GovernDebate (on motion by Mr MARR ) , adRAILWAY CONSTRUCTION.",27
52,Mr MANNING,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Macquarie) [4.5]- - That it isessential for the proper developof Northern Australia that a railway be constructed from Bourke, New South Wales, through Central Queensland towards Clooeurry, and thence across the Barkly' Tableto a point om the north-south railway in the Northern Territory.. The carrying of this to be taken as an instruction from this House to the Government to approach the State Governments of New South; Wales: and Queensland with a view of apportioning, the of constructing this line between the Commonwealth and the States mentioned'. I regard this proposel as of immense importance to the development of Australia, and I was disappointed that it was not referred to in the Governor General's Speech. A f t e r his tour through Central Queensland last year, the Prime Minister delivered, in Sydney, an address on "" Australia, past, present, and f u t u r e , "" and his remarks on that occasion indicated that he was full y seized of the necessity for constructing this line. The very great burden of debt now borne by the Australian people is a matter of grave concern to everybody who takes an interest in public affairs. The Commonwealth debt amounts to about £456,000,000^ of which approximately 20 per cent, should be recouped to the Federal exchequer by the States. In addition, the to public debts of the Statestotal a huge sum. Having regard to the small number of people who carry that burden, we may thecongratulate ourselves upon the fact that Australia's national credit is so good in of the world's financial markets. The fi.ut is evidence that the people who control the purse-strings of the world realise that Australians are absolutely honourable in their dealings, and control a very fine asset. However, our duty to ourselves and posterity requires that we shall take every opportunity to lighten our burden of debt. The railway I am advocating would serve a great extent of excellent country. Unfortunately, in the past it has been considered as a rival project to the north-south railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, but the vote of this House last week was ""a recognition that the two projects are in no way competitive. The declaration that one route was better than another had only the effect of inflaming interstate jealousies and creating distrust of both proposals. The sectional committee of the Public Works Committee, which toured the Northern Territory for the purpose of gaining first-hand information regarding the prospects of development by railway construction, came south on the return journey to Marree in South Australia, and did not visit Bourke; but every witness whose evidence was worthy of attention stated that the line from Bourke. through north-western New South Wales and Queensland is essential to Australian development. The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner advocated the route from Boulia to Marree, rather than to Bourke, merely that the Commonwealth might honor its agreement with South Australia - that the north-south line should cross the northern boundary of that State. His evidence showed clearly that he had a very high opinion of the route from Bourke. In the north of Australia is a vast extent of country that should be a great asset, but may very easily become a heavy liability. It is essential that it be brought to a high state of production without unnecessary delay. It is destined by nature to be the cattle nursery of Australia, but much of it is unstocked, and the other portions are not stocked to their full capacity. Mr M . CAMEKOX- - Is all that country safe for cattle?",27
53,Mr MANNING,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Almos t the whole of it. Of course, it must be improved, but not to the extent that, would be necessary for sheep-grazing. Before that country can carry sheep it must be fenced as a protection against rabbits and wild dogs, and the cost of fencing ""under present conditions of transport is prohibitive. Throughout the history of Australian development the country has been pioneered by the cattle raiser, and the sheep grazier has followed. That experience will be repeated in the development of the north. All the cattle raised there are brought on the hoof to the southern markets. Nowadays the greatest demand is for young beasts, and the earlier cattle are placed on the market the more profitable are they to the grower. Yet, before cattle can be travelled from the north to the southern markets they must be depastured for at least twelve months longer than would be necessary if they could be transported by railway truck. Immature beasts cannot be sent on a journey that occupies from seven to nine months, and even mature animals take months to recover from the trip and fatten. I am safe in saying that the marketing of cattle from the north is delayed two years longer than would be necessary if they could be trucked down and put into soft pastures without their muscles having been made lean and tough by a long journey on the hoof. It is economically unsound to keep those cattle so long and then sell them for a smaller price than could have been obtained had they been marketed when two years younger. In Queensland, a great many leases will mature within about a year, and the land thus released will afford an. almost, unique - opportunity for closer settlement. It ' is regrettable that those areas have not been already surveyed in preparation for subdivision, but when I was in Sydney over the last weekend I ascertained that the Queensland. Government is prepared to expedite the survey of such leases us are close to existing railways. This will mean that a very large number of men will take up comparatively small holdings in an area which admittedly contains some of the finest grazing land in Australia. We all know the reputation of that Central Queensland country, but if these men have not a north-south line they will not be as successful as they would be if such a. line were . built.  line first, and then talk of this line .afterwards.",28
54,Mr MANNING,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"I am not referring to the north-south line through South Australia, which would be of no benefit to small settlers in Central Queensland. This morning I had the advantage of seeing a map on which is shown the route of a railway which has been sanctioned by the Queensland Parliament. This line runs south from Camooweal, through Boulia, Springvale, Windorah, and Eromanga to Thargominda. That route is not exactly what I have in mind for a north-south railway, but I take it that experts would mark out the best route and submit their report to the Public Works Committee. I am not advocating any particular route. I am merely pointing out that whether the line ultimately adopted be that which has already been sanctioned by the Queensland Parliament, or one running further to the east, it is essential to build a railway running north and south connecting with the three Queensland lines running down to the east coast. The most northerly of tbese runs from Townsville to Winton, and is now being extended to Elderslie. The central line runs out from Rockhampton to Longreach and Yaraka. The southern line is built as far out as Quilpie and Cunnamulla. A north-south line would not be complete unless it linked up with all three of these. Mr Lis TEE - Shoul d not the work be undertaken by the State?",28
55,Mr MANNING,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The line I am proposing will develop not only Queensland, but also the Northern Territory and the western part of New South Wales. In any case, it is too much to ask a single State to carry out a work like this. My motion suggests that the Commonwealth Government should get into touch with the Governments of Queensland and New South Wales, and endeavour to allocate the proportion of expenditure to be borne by each Government. The line I am proposing would be a great insurance against loss of stock through droughts. Never in the history of Australia has the whole of the country that would be served by this line suffered from drought at any one time. On the contrary, there have been instances in which stock have been lost in one portion of the country which would be served by this line, although there was ample fodder to be had in another portion of the country likely to be served by it. In 1914,.when the southern States experienced one of their worse droughts, Central Queensland was like a waving field of corn. During that drought Australia lost something like 10,000,000 sheep, which loss would have been considerably minimized if a railway such ag I propose had been available. .At the present moment, while there is abundance of fodder around Charleville, in Queensland, the position of the pastoralists is far from satisfactory in the neighbourhood of Longreach. If Australia has another year or two similar to the last few productive years, the number of sheep will be near the dangerpoint, and if a severe drought then occurs we shall possibly crash again, as we did at the time of the last great drought, unless provision is made for the easy transpoi't of stock from one part of the country to another. In the past, stock have been travelled overland for considerable distances - About 30 years ago a mob of 10,000 bullocks was driven overland from Wave Hill, in the Northern Territory, to Killarney, near Narrabri, in New South Wales. When the drought of 1902 broke, the late Mr W. F. Buchanan, who was the owner of Killarney, bought 20,000 wethers in North Queensland, and travelled them down to Killarney. If the line I am proposing had been built years ago, it would have been of the greatest value to Australia, because the lives of numbers of stock would have been saved by its use. Furthermore, this line would ensure a more even supply of fat stock to the southern markets, irrespective of the seasonable conditions in the south. In 1923, when stock were bringing exceptionally high prices in the Melbourne market, fat cattle were imported from New Zealand, despite the fact that, at that time, the Commonwealth Government was paying a bounty to the Queensland pastoralists to make it worth their while to export cattle. Can we imagine anything more absurd than that there should be such high prices in the southern markets that stock had to be imported from outside Australia, while at the same time, in another portion of the Commonwealth, cattle were hardly worth driving into the meat works to be killed. But such a condition of affairs may arise again if steps are not taken to guard against it . We must also guard against the payment of extreme prices for foodstuffs in Australia. Xn a country where primary duction plays a very important our national life, if the primary ducers receive high prices for their produce, it makes the whole country perous; but the extremely paid for primary produce are not paid to the primary producers. They are occasioned solely hy economically marketing conditions, which are a sprag on the wheel of the country's progress. We are all anxious to maintain the high standard of living we have in Australia, but it is not in the interests of. any one to make that standard artificially higher by unnecessarily adding to the cost of living. In opposition to the project I am putting before the House, it has been stated that interests in the large seaports of Queensland will suffer. It is difficult to understand any one taking such a narrow parochial view. The development part of Australia must benefit part of it. It is beyond belief to think that the prosperity of any part of a State should be regarded as likely prove detrimental to another part. ever, people are sometimes so blinded by local prejudice that they cannot see that the development of central will also develop the ports of the State. Those far-seeing men, Sir Mcllwraith, Mr Kidston, aud others, who laid down the Queensland railway which is an excellent example of developmental construction, always that it would not be complete unless the terminals of the different lines were connected by a - north-south line.

56,Mr WEST,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"East Sydney) [4.30] pros- I regret that it should be necessary to high prices move this motion. The firm of H . Dean and Sons has not received from the Government the courtesy to which it is enunsound titled. I am quite satisfied that if the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) was aware of the maladministration of the War Service Homes Department, he would not have taken the action he took against this firm. The Public Accounts Committee has full y investigated the drafts of the agreements virtually entered . into by the commission. When the commission undertook the erection of houses it had to encounter a large amount of opposition from combines dealing in tiles, bricks, lime, timber, cement and other building maof any terials. Whether the combines took every action because the commission did not enter into negotiations, because they were aware of the unfortunate position of the to Chief Commissioner, or because they knew How- that the Government intended to build cottages, I do not know. Those charged with the administration of the war service Queensland homes found themselves in a quandary when those who dealt in building materials Thomas ignored them. The ordinary channels of business were denied to them, and sources system, of supply outside the ordinary market had to be found. The commission got into understood touch with various firms, including H . Dean and Sons. Every one was anxious cross-country that the wives and children of. the returned soldiers should be provided with habitations as soon as possible. The d r a f t order agreements between these firms and the War Service Homes Commission were drawn up with the knowledge that the Government was a party to .them. As a rule, the people of this country have great confidence in the Government, and do not expect it to be guilty of such tricks as have been played on this firm. A con. tract for timber ,w,as given to a man named Driver, and was carried out in a to very loose way. I have been a contractor, and .have worked on draf t agreements. In fact, I have practically finished final agreements regard to it have been drawn the up. It w,as lucky for Driver that to he lived in Victoria. He was under the and wing of Parliament House, and he get the ear of Victorian members, with the result that he received better treatment than the other contractors. Driver's timber contract was brought under the notice of the Public Accounts Committee. stated that he should .receive current prices. As a member of the committee, I brought my business capacity to bear on that agreement, although I had no personal interest in the matter. I drew the Chairman's attention to the provision about current prices. Departmental officers did not know whether current prices meant delivered at the m ill , or delivered in Melbourne. The timber was sold by the thousand feet, and the difference between the pripe delivered at the m ill and the price delivered in Melbourne would be very considerable. The Chairman suggested that he be empowered to see the Minister. He went to see the Minister, but in the face of that disclosure, the department proceeded with another contract. It was not very creditable of the department to discontinue operations, and leave the contracts suspended. Driver, with the local influence he possessed, was able-to go to court, and obtained some hundreds of thousands of pounds from the Government for violation of his contract. The firm of Dean and Sons have been endeavouring to comply with the terms of a d r a f t agreement. The d r a f t agreement with Green, who supplied joinery, was the most peculiar thing I have ever seen. No provision was made in it for brokerage, so that Green-anothe r fortunate person Who lived in VictoriaWas able to get the brokerage for himself. The Attorney-General has not "" played the game "" in this matter. Dean and Sons took action in the court. The case was tried before a judge and jury , and the jury gave a decision in favour of the firm, but did not fix damages. I have had some experience of civil and criminal juries, and it is clear to me that the jur y was under the impression that the Government would adjust the claim That view of the jury was more in the interests of the Government than of Dean and Sons. The Government made no attempt to adjust the matter, and the Law Department treated the firm very unjustly. A f t e r spending money in appealing to the Supreme Court' and the High Court, the firm was defeated. did not expect any other decision, because neither the Supreme Court nor the High Court could interfere with the jury's decision. The Government made an arrangement with some persons in Tasmania who had a patent idea for erecting concrete houses, although practical men never exIt pected that scheme to succeed. Several concrete houses were erected, and then the department closed down. The result was that the Tasmanian firm got into financial difficulties and the bank issued a writ. As the firm was notfar from Melbourne, members of it importuned members of Parliament, and because of the pressure which they were able to bring to bear oh the Government, their case was further investigated. The result was the withdrawal of the w r it issued by the Government, thus giving the firm an opportunity to deal with its assets. While the writ remained, the creditors could do nothing. Although the firm suffered loss, it was enabled to continue in business. Messrs. Dean and Sons are not dishonest men, out to rob their fellows, but a reputable firm which has been doing business in New South Wales for many years. When I was in business I placed some orders with this firm, and obtained every satisfaction. Tliere is no reason why undue advantage should be taken of them.",30
57,Mr WATKINS,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,The department drove them to law.,31
58,Mr WEST,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"I cannot understand why the verdict of the jury was not accepted. The procedure usually adopted in these matters is for the papers to be sent to the law officers of the Crown. Those officers deal with them in a purely legal manner. The motion before the Chair is a reasonable one, especially when we consider that Messrs. Dean and Sons became almost insolvent because of their attempt to defend their' honour. They were willing to supply bricks to the Commission' and to fulfil the terms of the d r a f t 1 agreement. Honourable members may not be aware that, in most cases, d r a f t agreements only were in existence. Largely because honourable members on this side urged the Government, of that time to do so, it decided to erect a number of homes for returned soldiers. A f t e r that decision was made and published, the policy was reversed. Troubles then arose. Had a Labour government been in power, and these mistakes occurred, there would have been a great outcry by I the press of Australia, urging that, because of its mismanagement, the Government was unfit to remain in office. It would appear that, to save its face, the Government wishes to penalize Messrs. Dean and Sons. Such actions are unworthyof any Government, which should conduct its affairs in a manner worthy of the emulation of business firms. I regret that the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) is not present, as I believe that I could persuade him that he has made an error in this instance. I desire to emphasize that Messrs. Dean and Sons were anxious to do something for the returned soldiers. Because their original plant was not sufficiently large to make the bricks necessary to erect homes for returned soldiers, they were prepared to erect new kilns. Moreover, the price at which they offered to supply the bricks required was a reasonable one. I have often paid from 20s. to 25s. more a 1,000 for bricks than the price at which this firm was prepared to supply the commission. have seen some of their bricks, and know them to be of good quality, and worth the price asked. I have spoken on this subject previously, and have again spoken this afternoon in the hope that the Government will yet be persuaded to refer it to a committee. This case is not different from the others that I have mentioned, in which, because of their closer proximity to Melbourne, the people concerned received better treatment. There is no doubt that Messrs. Dean and Sons have been unfairly treated by the Government, and for that reason action to bring their case before Parliament is justified. I hope that, as' a result of the debate this afternoon, the motion will be agreed to, and justice done to this firm. Debate (on motion by Mr MARR ) adjourned.

59,Mr FENTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Maribyrnong) [5.2] I am somewhat loath to enter upon the discussion of a .matter upon which I asked a question today. I asked whether steps would be taken by the Government to avoid pending trouble in the engineering shops in association with what may be cailled our arsenal and munition factories. The Minister for Defence (Sir Neville Howse) asked me to put my question on the notice-paper, but I informed the honourable gentleman by interjection that matters had - almost reached the boiling-point, and possibly the industrial pot would boil over tonight. The Minister said he had been in negotiation with the men, and I have no wish to say anything that might obstruct or delay in any way the amicable I settlement of the trouble. The men concerned received an engineers' .award under the Federal Arbitratio n Court for a minimum wage of £ 4 7s. 6d. per week. Since then a regulation has been framed, and I presume has received the sanction of the Cabinet and become an executive order, providing that the wages of these men shall be reduced to £ 4 2s. 6d. I have yet to learn that it is competent for a government department to vary a legitimate award of the Arbitration Court."" I am aware that industrialists are often required to spend months of patient waiting before their cases are heard by the Arbitration Court. A f t e r the consideration of a claim has been commenced there may be weeks and months of argument by legal gentlemen and union representatives before an award is made. The result is that by the time those an award obtain it they are mulct in very heavy expenditure indeed. of It will be agreed that the procedure of the Arbitration Court should be as simple and expeditious as possible. In stead of lengthy arguments by represento tatives of the parties, there should be some more expeditious means of arriving at decisions which. would lead to the saving of time and money. I do not - know .whether the Minister for Defence has any experience of the difficulties in obtaining awards of the court and the The Public Service records will show that the obtaining of awards from the Public Service A r b i trator has involved considerable expenWhen Mr Skewes, who is now one of the Board of Commissioners of the Public Service, was acting on behalf of the Public Service Commissioner, his time was often occupied for days together in fighting claims submitted to the Public Service Arbitrator by variousbranches of the Service. I understand that the attitude adopted by the Government in connection with the matter now under consideration is that there should not be one section of public servants working under an award of the Public Service Arbitrator, and another section working under a different award of the Arbitration Court. I am a. believer in arbitration and industrial peace, and I hold that whether an award of the Arbitration Court covers sections of employees of the Government or persons engaged in private industry, it should' not be varied without very good reason. To proceed, to vary an award of the Arbitration Court as affecting workers in the service of the Defence Department by a regulation reducing their wages is, in my opinion, to treat those people unfairly . The men engaged in the engineering shops at aud Maribyrnong perform some of the most important work nected' with the manufacture munitions. Some of them are in charge of explosives in various stages of manufacture, and, if impelled by a sense of duty to their engineering comrades, they should leave their work, the position will be not without possible danger and considerable loss to the Government. men would not occupy the positions they do unless they were possessed of considerable intelligence. They have acquired by reading, training and experience the technical knowledge essential to the efficient performance of their delicate and difficult duties. I understand that they have seen both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence.",32
60,Mr MAKIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,They have endeavoured to secure consideration of their claims.,33
61,Mr FENTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"In view of the seriousness of the position and the importance of the work in which these men are ordinarily engaged, there would be no loss of dignity by the Government if it stayed its hand for the time being. What does it matter if the settlement of the dispute is postponed for two or three months ?",33
62,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"We agreed to that already, and so has Prime Minister.",33
63,Mr FENTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Yes , under certain conditions, which are laid down by the Government.",33
64,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"No , at their own request.",33
65,Mr FENTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The men very much fear that if they submit their case to the Public Service Arbitrator an award may be given which would lead to what is termed the "" d i l u t i o n "" of labour. The Government should not endanger the position of government workshops by imposing an unfai r regulation with which the employees ought not to be asked to comply. Anticipating that the war would continue longer than it did, the British Government placed orders with big engineering firms for the construction of certain machinery. Owing to the sudden cessation of hostilities, for which we were all thankful, large parcels of this machinery were left on the hands of the British Government. In the circumstances, it made a very magnanimous offer to the oversea dominions, including Australia, to purchase the machinery at very reduced rates. Australia was one of the dominions that gladly accepted the offer Footscray of the British authorities. I believe that aeroplanes, motor trucks, and quite a con- number of useful articles of defence' of equipment, were handed over to the dominions, practically as gifts, by the B r i tish Government. There is no doubt that we received large parcels of valuable machinery at very cheap rates. Without saying anything derogatory of persons engaged in the engineering trade outside the These Public Service, it may be said that the engineers employed in these workshops were specially selected to carry out the very important work of assembling machines and putting them into position to start the manufacture of munitions. It would be well worth the while of honourable members to personally inspect the series .of works and - engineering shops comprising the cordite factory and the small arms and munition works at Footscray. They will find that there is in Maribyrnong, the most important constituency in Australia, what might be termed the Australian arsenal. In these big engineering shops, some of which are occupied in the manufacture of cordite and high explosives, the erection of the machinery to which I have referred has been almost completed. I believe that it is the testimony of some of the finest have engineers in Australia, as well as of prothe minent engineers who have visited this country, that, when it is completed, we shall have at Footscray one of the finest engineering shops south of the line. It is in these work.? that trouble has arisen. The men are quite satisfied with the hours and conditions fixed by the award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. So far as I know, cordial relations exist between those in charge of the works and the employees. The work of the factory had been progressing satisfactorily, when suddenly a thunderbolt descended upon the men. The Government has issued a regulation under which their wages are to be reduced from £4 7s. 6d. to £4 2s. 6d. a week. They have been informed that the reduction will not take effect until their appeal has keen heard by the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers is one of the finest unions in the world, and its members are jealous of their privileges. They resent the regulation because it means the dilution of labour. There is at the Maribyrnong workshops another organization known as the Munition Workers Union. At one time there was a certain amount of overlapping between the two bodies, and an arrangement was made fixing the different classes of work to be carried out by their members. Since then the work has progressed satisfactorily. I understand that the object of the regulation is to prevent two sections of Government employees from working under different awards. These men cannot be regarded as permanent public servants. The Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator was appointed to make awards for permanent public servants, and there was no intention on the part of this Parliament to include in those awards engineers working in the Defence Department. ESen though there was a slight anomaly respecting . one section of - the Commonwealth Public' Service, the Minister should not have interfered while work was proceeding satisfactorily iinder an' award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The regulation is bound to cause trouble. I have been informed that the engineers do not intend to resume work ih the morning.",33
66,Mr MAXWELL,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,How many men involved ?,34
67,Mr FENTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Ove r 100. The honourable member knows that if skilled workmen absent themselves from work, other sections of the employees are forced to become idle. The shops will be closed, and the manufacture of e plosives will cease. The loss to the country thus caused will be far greater than the saving made by the Government in the men's wages. There will be serious industrial trouble, spreading, very likely, to the Lithgow works and to engineering establishments in Sydney and Newcastle. A strong government would endeavour to settle the dispute amicably. The engineers at the Maribyrnong workshops will leave work to-night with a bitter feeling in their hearts. I know many of them. I spoke to one of the officers of the union today.",34

73,Mr FENTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"This morning Mr. Roberts, the branch secretary, showed me the regulation. I was surprised to learn that engineers were working for a wage as low as £4 7s. 6d. a week.",34

77,Mr FENTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"No . During the war we were dependent upon the work of engineers, both on land and sea, and we owe a great deal to them."" I cannot understand why the Government now insists on a reduction in the wages of the engineers at the Maribyrnong workshops. The disputes committee of the Trades Hall Council has interviewed the Governare ment respecting the regulation. The Minister has informed me that the trouble may yet be settled, but so far as I know the men do not intend to resume work tomorrow morning. If the trouble is not settled, the country will suffer a heavy loss, and a great hardship will be inflicted upon one of the greatest unions in Australia.",34
78,Mr MAKIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Hindmarsh) [5.28] - I am seriously concerned about the trouble at the Maribyrnong workshops, which has been Drought about by the issue of a regulation affecting both the Amalgamated society of Engineers and the Munition Workers Union. As a member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, I know that it takes strict measuresto enforce obedience lo its rules in order to k».ep the wheels of industry 1 moving. No form of irresponsible action on the part of individual members is permitted. Before any body of men is withdrawnfrom any particular job a secret ballot must be taken among those concerned, and even before that can be taken, the Commonwealth council must approve of it . Knowing the constitution and the procedure ot the society, I view with alarm the. decision of the men not to resume work at the Maribyrnong, workshops tomorrow morning. I cannot congratulate the Government upon the .attitude it has adopted. Parliament has set up an Arbitration Court to determine the wages and conditions of those engaged in industry. Private employers, are compelled to obey theawards of the Court, hut the Government, representing the authority which established that tribunal, is the first to break down its decisions. This has happened on more than one occasion. Towards the end of last session,, I brought under the notice of the House the f aet that certain persons employed in the Public Service were receivinglessthan the basic wage. The only explanation I could obtain from the authorities was that the employees affected were temporary. The permanent officers who were doing the same class of work were receiving the basic wage. Mr MCGRATH.:-The temporary men were more entitled to it.",35
79,Mr MAKIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Yes , because they had no security of tenure. I have no desire to aggravate the ill-feeling camsed by the latest dispute, but I do wish to emphasize the anomaly of the Government's action in setting aside the award of a tribunal that was brought into being by this Parliament. Surely if theprivate employer is expected to observe loyally the decisions of the Court, the least the Government can do is to set an example. I hope that wiser counsels will prevail in regard to both the reduction of wages and the proposed dilution of labour. The de- partmental - officers should realise the danger of the latter proposal, because dilution of labour will lower the standards of efficiency which engineers have acquired after many years of training. In the past employers were conservative in their insistence upon years of apprenticeship and training to assure efficiency in the skilled trades, but the Government is now going to the opposite extreme by introducing, a process of dilution which must lead to diminished efficiency.",35
80,Mr MCGRATH,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,I call attention to the state of the House. {Quorum formed.],35
81,Mr SGTJUIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Yarra) [5.37] - I am surprised that it should be necessary to debate in this House the issue raised by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton). I thought that the dispute would be amicably settled, and that the Government, when it became fully seized of the facts, would adhere to the principle of arbitration which it has emphasized again and again. But I know of no more flagrant breach of that principle than the action of the Defence Department in connection with the factory a.t Maribyrnong. The department issued a regulation, No. 7S, which providesThe minimum rate for employees whose classifications are included in the wages schedule under regulation 78A shall be £4' 2s. 6d'. per week. That minimum is fixed in spite of the fact that the Arbitration Court has awarded a basic wage of SA 7s. 6d. for some of the employees affected, whilst in regard to others there is a. signed agreement for a basic wage of £4 4s. per week. The Arbitration Court allowed a margin of 3s. 6d. a week over the estimated basic wage, in order to provide for the increase in the cost of living. Mr Atlee Hunt does not recognize the court's award in that respect, and has prescribed for the Public Service a basic wage of £4 4s. Setting aside the decisions of both the court and the Public Service Arbitrator, the Department of Defence has, by a regulation, declared that the basic wage from the 1st of March shall be £4 2s. 6d.",35
82,Mr MAXWELL,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Is the basic wage of £4 2s. 6d. to supersede in every instance the amounts fixed by the other authorities ?,35
83,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Presumably. case for the men is very clear: The engineers organization has a plaint before the Arbitration Court, under an award of which many of its members are now working, but the Defence Department has issued a regulation classifying the work in various divisions, and this, the men declare, will mean a considerable reduction in the wages now paid. If the department wishes to classify the various operations of the engineering trade, and thus reduce the wages, the honest method is for it to become a respondent in the Arbitration Court, by the decision of which the union is willing to abide. The department cannot be forced into the Arbitration Court, and the position is complicated by the fact that some of the men are working under Mr Atlee Hunt's award. The men who are particularly affected include a number who are working under the award of the court. By that award they stand. They have a plaint before the court, and all they ask of the Government is that it will not pass judgment upon the merit of their claim, but will appear as respondent in the court, and if the court awards a reduced wage the men will accept it .",36
84,Mr MAXWELL,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Will the departmental regulations mean an increase of wages to any of the men 1,36
85,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"I have perused the schedule and I cannot find any increase. The.wage for turners is £5 l is . 6d., the margin above the basic wage being £ 1 4s. That margin has been considerably reduced by the classification of turners into various divisions. Por instance, in the trade ""turret lathe operators"" are regarded as turners, and as such they receive £ 5 l is . 6d. By the departmental regulations they will receive 9s. above the basic wage of £4 4s., or a total of £4 13s., representing a reduction of 18s. 6d. "" Turret lathe operators on shells "" will by the same process fication suffer a reduction of 17s. 6d. "" Auto screw operators"" are receiving from . £4 19s. 6d. to £5 l is . 6d., but their wage is to be reduced to £ 4 14s. 6d. ""Operators grinding components,"" who now receive £5 l is . 6d., will be asked sacrifice £ 1 Is. 6d - a big reduction. Milling machine operators, including thread milling, will suffer a reduction of £ 1 Is. 6d. a week. The operation of shell turning comes under the heading of turning, for which the The arbitration award is £5 l is . 6d. Under the proposed regulations the rate will now show a reduction of £ 1 Os. 6d. Other machine operators, including cut-' ters off, will suffer a reduction of 9s. 6d. from £4 19s. 6d., which is the award rate. Cutters and tool grinders will be reduced from £5 l is . 6d. to £4 13s., a reduction of 18s. 6d. Mr E. RILEY - Surely there must be some mistake. The Government would surely not make such reductions.",36
86,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"It is difficult to understand these regulations. During the absence of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) in the country, I introduced a deputation to the Minister for Defence, and the men put up a very well-reasoned and calm statement of their case.",36
87,Mr MAXWELL,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Since the issue of the regulations?,36
88,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"No . The men heard that these regulations were about to be gazetted, and they asked for an interview with the Minister, who was courteous enough to withhold the Gazette notice until he had heard what they had t'o say. He told them that he was pleased at the manner in which their views had been placed before him. They put forward a well argued and reasonable case, and they finalized it by saying:-""Apar t from the merits of our case, to which we strongly adhere, we ask you to appeal"" as respondents, and have the matter threshed out before the Arbitration Court, whose decision we shall accept."" Notwithstanding that request, these regulations have been issued.",36

The men did ask for theregulations to be postto poned, and the Minister in a letter he sent to me said that they would not come into force until the 1st March. Here is the regulation itself as printed- . I , the Governor General in and over the Commonwealth of Australia, acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council, hereby make the following regulations under the Defence Act 1.903-1918. to come into operation as from 1st January, 1926.",36
95,Mr MCGRATH,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"T l i e regulations mentioned the 1st January, 1926.",37
96,Mr SCHLLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Yes , but at the request of the men no alteration in the basic wage was to take effect u n t i l the 1st March. What further postponement has taken place,' I do not know. Briefly, the men recognize that in all industries machinery is largely displacing skilled labour, and that many men who operate machinery become specialists, and sometimes work faster than all-round engineers. They take up a reasonable attitude, which has been upheld by Mr . Justice Higgins in the Arbitratio n Court. They ask, "" If a semi-skilled man can obtain great speed by concentration and specialization, is he to get nothing for that special speed, or for the monotony of the work he performs ?"" The factory is benefiting by the greater output. hardly a private engineering firm that is not paying more than the arbitration award for engineers because of the out-put it is getting from men who have specialized in their particular work. The engineers claim that if this policy of specialization is to be continued there will be no engineers in the days to come, because men will not go through long years of training to qualify as engineers only to find, after they have qualified, that they can be replaced by semi-skilled men manipulating machines and receiving lower wages than is paid to craftsmen. They do not deny the right of the Government to employ men to work these machines, although they desire to see members of their own organization who are available employed on them; but they claim that if a man who is not a qualified engineer can,. by specializing on a certain class of work, give the same output as a qualified engineer, he should be paid the wage provided for in the award given by the Arbitration Court. That is the case the men put up. Honourable members are not qualified to judge the merits of it . they be expected to do so. But,- on the other hand, if the'House is not qualified to do so, neither is the Defence Department. The Arbitration Court has been set up to deal with such matters. The Minister will admit that these men have - always loyally abided by its decisions. The request they now put up is simply that before they are called upon to submit to a reduction of wages, they should have, their case heard before the A r b i tration Court, and that the award given by that court should apply to the Government of the day.",37
97,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [5.53] - I regret that I was not in the chamber when the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) raised this matter. I think there, is some misunderstanding in regard to it . The case put up by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), to whom I listened very carefully, was that the Government is arbitrarily determining the wages of certain men, bringing about a substantial reduction, not only of the basic wage, but also of the margin applying to skilled labour, and that it is doing so in defiance of the principle which we all accept, There is that these are matters to be settled by tribunals appointed specially to consider them. The honourable member misinterpreted what the Government is doing. The first point with which I shall deal is the assertion that the new scale of pay is to take effect on the 1st March. I think that the original date fixed was the 1st January; but the operation of the regulation was deferred to the 1st March, in anticipation of the hearing of the men's case by the Public Service A r bitrator during the present week. The Minister for Defence told the men that the operation of the regulation would be postponed to the 1st March, and that no action would be taken by him under it until a decision had been given by the Public Service Arbitrator. But since then, as the men's case cannot be heard this week, the Minister has given them an undertaking that u n t i l it has been heard and a definite decision given, there will be no alteration of their wages.",37
98,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,That was not the reply I received from the Minister.,37
99,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The reply the honorNor should able member received from the Minister was that the matter was still pending, and that the 1st March was the date upon which the new scale would operate.",37
100,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,But regulations have now been issued.,37
101,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"That is so; but there have been further negotiations, and the Minister has given an assurance, which is perfectly well known to the men, that the new scale will not be brought into operation until a plaint has been heard by the Public Service Arbitrator. It has been suggested that the department has fixed the basic wage, not at £4 7s. 6d. a week, which is the rate determined by the Arbitration Court, but at £4. 2s. 6d. a week, as determined by the Public Service Arbitrator; but again I say that it was never intended to alter the wages of these men until their case had been heard and decided by the Public Service Arbitrator.",37
102,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Then what is the meaning of these regulations which have been gazetted to come into force on the 1st March?,38
103,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"I have already explained that those regulations are not to come into force until the men's case has been heard by the Public Service Arbitrator. It is, I imagine, the desire of honourable members that nothing should be said now which might cause trouble, as negotiations are in progress. The new scale will not come into operation until the Public Service Arbitrator has had an opportunity of adjudicating upon it . To suggest that anything else is likely to be done is to mislead the men and might bring about a situation that we might all regret.",38
104,Mr MAXWELL,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Who framed these regulations?,38
105,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,That was done by the munitions branch of the Defence Department. There must be some starting point.,38
106,Mr S CULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Thes e regulations ! not the - starting point; they are the last word.,38
107,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"No , they are not. According to the honourable member there is a simple way out of all this difficulty, by making the Government a respondent to a plaint in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. But I would remind honourable members that the operations of the munitions branch, of the Defence Department are not confined to Maribyrnong. There is also a factory under its control at Lithgow, in New South Wales, and the employees in that factory are working under an award of the Public Service Arbitrator, and it is now proposed that the employees in the factory at Maribyrnong, where large extensions are likely to take place, shall also come under the Public Service Arbitrator. That is merely the application to the munitions branch of the Defence Department of the policy now in force throughout the Commonwealth Public Service generally. Public Service plaints are heard by the Public Service Arbitrator, and not by the Commonwealth Arbitration. Court. All persons in the permanent or semipermanent employment of the Commonwealth, except the men to whom we axe referring, have their wages and conditions fixed by the Public Service Arbitrator. There is good reason for that. The conditions operating in the Public Service are different from those operating outside it . Tha men employed in the munitions branch, to all intents and purposes, have permanent employment, and we could not give to them different treatment from that which we give to, say, hundreds of. similar employees in the Postal Department. Men who have not previously been working under the awards of the Public Service Arbitrator may'say that they do not wish to have their case submitted to him. Their objection is a. natural one, because they do not know what award he will make.",38
108,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Thei r case is not being submitted to the Public Service Arbitrator.,38
109,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,It will be considered by him. He has notified the parties that he will hear the case tMs week.,38
110,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Does the Prime Minister suggest that it is a proper procedure to issue a statutory rule for submission to the Arbitrator?,38
111,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Yes. That is what is done throughout the service. If men are are not satisfied with the Government's action, they go to the Public Service Arbitrator to have their case reviewed. The point I wish to stress is that the Public Service Arbitrator determines the wages and conditions not only of the men at Lithgow, but also of all the men in permanent and semi-permanent employment throughout the Commonwealth Service, and in view of that, I certainly say that the men in the munitions branch are not entitled to different treatment from that given to other members of the Service.",38
112,Mr MCGRATH,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,This is another attempt by the Government to reduce waees.,38
113,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"I remind honourable members that this procedure has heen followed for a very long time. Now that, the Government is endeavouring to apply to these men the conditions alreadyapplied to other men, it is asserted that the Government is attempting to reduce wages. I repudiate that suggestion, and say that it is lamentable that any one should be guilty of making it at this time. It can only have the effect of inflaming the men, and will probably lead to more serious consequences than would otherwise ensue. I am quite certain that the difference now existing between the Government and the men is capable of adjustment if honourable members opposite will refrain from inflaming the men. On the information given to me, the men are not on strike at the present moment, and I appeal to honourable members not to take action that will unquestionably make the situation more difficult to handle, and may quite likely provoke a strike. I give honourable members my assurance that the new rate of wages will not come into operation until such time as the Public Service Arbitrator has had an opportunity to decide the matter. It is a very grave mistake, when trouble of this kind arises, for honourable members to fan the flames of discontent. I leave this case with the reiterated appeal that at least anopportunity should be given for the case to be handled in a constitutional way.",38
114,Mr FENTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Did not the question of the dilution of labour arise at the' interview with the Minister?,39
115,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Most certainly. I was not present, but I know of what book place.",39
116,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Has the Government received a deputation since that received by the Minister for Defence, at which I was present?",39
117,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,No .,39
118,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,But a request was made for a deputation.,39
119,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Yes , last night. Certain negotiations had taken place, and the men knew what the position was. In view of that, I said that I could not see that any good purpose would be served by my receiving a second deputation.",39
120,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,And that precipitated the action taken today.,39
121,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Whateve r may be the merits of the men's contention that their case should be tried before the Arbitration Court instead of the Public Service Arbitrator, it is quite obvious that the Government cannot differentiate between different members of the Service.",39
122,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) and I had a conference with these men. The request they niade was that the Prime Minister should see them, and the request they intended to make to him was that they should continue to remain under the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court. It was not a case of asking for something they had not previously, but of their right to retain something they already liad. The Prime Minister made a great blunder in refusing to receive them.",39
123,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"I do not think the honourable member is stating the matter fairly. I said that other men in the Public Service doing similar work, and permanently or seini-permanently employed, were under the Public Service Arbitrator, and that, therefore, these men should also be under the Public Service Arbitrator.",39
124,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"They are already working under a Commonwealth Arbitration Court award, and the Government seeks to take away from them the benefits of that award. On that subject they want to make representations.",39
125,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"I shall be only too pleased to see them if any useful purpose will be served thereby. If ' they are labouring under a misapprehension as to the - action of the Government, I am willing to see them now-to-nigh t if necessary-and to explain to them the Government's point of view. I saw some one yesterday, and explained .the position to him. I said that the Minister for Defence had received a deputation, and that I had pointed out why I concurred in his view. I assumed that my statement was conveyed to the men. If they.desire to come to me, and to state their case personally, I shall be pleased to see them. I can assure honourable members that it is not the Government's desire to reduce wages; its object is simply to ensure that all the persons in its employment receive identical treatment. To allow the Public Service Arbitrator to determine this case before any alteration is made, is certainly to subscribe to the view we have always held that disputes should be settled peaceably, and .thai wages should be determined by tribunals established under the law.",39
126,Mr MAKIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"If the Government does not intend to reduce wages, why were not the present instead of the new rates of wages submitted to the Public Service Arbitrator ?",40
127,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"As the honourable member knows, such rates of wages as are considered to be fair and equitable are decided upon. In this case the rates are based upon those ruling at Lithgow.. These men are not merely in the same service, but are part of the same branch of the service as the men at Lithgow, and it is now proposed that they shall have their claims adjudicated upon by the same tribunal. I say that that is quite fair and equitable. The Government has no alternative but to treat all its employees alike. It is most undesirable that action which is liable to inflame the men should be taken in this House.",40
128,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Hunter) [6.18] - I am somewhat surprised that action has been taken by the Department in the. way indicated in the regulation. The Prime Minister has now stated that he is willing to see the men concerned, and to discuss the matter with them, and that the regulation will not be put into operation until a settlement has been arrived at - is",40
129,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"That was not a new statement by me. The Minister for Defence said that long ago, and every one knew it to be'a fact.",40
130,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"It is very evident to me that the Defence Department intended that the alteration should take effect before being submitted to the arbitrator. It laid down a scale of wages lower than those awarded by the Arbitration Court. That being so, I submit that the Government is entirely in the wrong, and is setting a bad example to every employer in Australia. It has been contended that there should be no reduction in wages without an appeal to an established tribunal. In this case, there is a tribunal of the Commonwealth-the Arbitration Courts-and it has made an award under which the men are working. The Government says that it will alter that and bring the men under Mr Hunt, the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator. It , therefore, publishes the scale of wages to be paid to them, those wages representing a reduction of from 5s. to £ 1 Is. 6d. a week on the present rates. That action is prejudicing the men's cause before it comes before Mr Hunt. The men are now working under an award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. If they are to be transferred to other control they should be transferred without any reduction of their wages or alteration of their conditions. The Government has no right to issue a regulation altering the wages payable under an award. Employees who have a dispute with a private employer may file a log with the Arbitration Court, and the court decides on the justice or otherwise of their claim. But the Government does not do that. It proposes bo transfer the men from the control of %he Commonwealth Arbitration Court to bhat of Mr Hunt, and at the same time to reduce their wages. It is the intention of the Government that the new rates shall apply from a certain date. That much is clear. Can we wonder at these men being concerned ? Do honourable members consider that the Government is setting a good example to private employers? Will this action tend towards industrial peace? We should be very careful in these matters, as frequently they lead to trouble. Notwithstanding the Prime Minister's denial, it clear that the Government is seeking to reduce these men's wages. Honourable members should consider this matter from the point of view of the men affected. They have expended their own money and obtained an award from the court, and have worked loyally under that award, making no complaints. Suddenly, they are confronted with a regulation under which their wages are to be reduced. They are justified, in resenting such action. The Prime Minister says that the Government desires to place alt these men under one control. That sounds well; but, when we consider that a reduction of wages is involved, it is .evident that it is only a subterfuge. We have here an example of the Government showing the way in which a lock-out can be avoided. It says to the men that, if they are not prepared to accept the reduced wages, their only remedy is to fight the matter in the court. That is not right. If the men had not complained, this new rule would have been put into operation from the date mentioned therein. When the Public Service Board was constituted, honourable members generally thought that it would deal chiefly with clerical workers, and that its operations would not extend to industrialists in the Government employ who already had the right to go to the Arbitration Court. In fact, they did approach that court, and they obtained an award. Until recently no attempt has been made to break that award, but now an attempt to do so is being made. The Government is not acting fair l y towards these employees, and its action shows that not sufficient attention is given to industrial matters. It is clear that member of the Cabinet understands the law. industrial matters; otherwise this thing would not have happened. The sooner the Government appoints a qualified person to advise it on industrial matters, the better it will be for country. I do not want to trouble arise from this incident; but it is possible that it will lead to trouble. A match is being lighted which, if not trial peace. at once put out, may kindle a serious conflagration. Should trouble occur, the ponsibility will rest on the Government. men's conditions. Trouble can be avoided if the Government is prepared to act justly. honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr have been generous to the dairymen. Fenton), who is the representative in this House of the men directly affected, is to be commended for bringing this presented a large number of them. matter forward. I have today been in consultation with some of the industrial leaders of this State. They view this matter seriously, and fear that it may lead to trouble. They were not speaking as supporters of any political party, but as men who want to avoid trouble and to keep the men at work. I do not know whether the award under which the men in the Lithgow factory are working was the result of negotiations, or of the sion of Mr H u n t .",40
131,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,I think it was an award granted by the Public Service Arbitrator.  forms of arbitration?,41
132,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"A mistake, was made when the new form of arbitration was introduced. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court, which was constituted by legislation passed by this Parliament bo deal with industrial matters, with a view to avoiding strikes and lock-puts, has granted these men an award, and there is no justification for depriving them of their right to appear before the court.",41
133,Mr MAKIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,The Government's action is most unfair.,41
134,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"If the Government thought that a change was necessary, why did it not, like any other employer, state a case before the Arbitration Court, and. let the court decide the matter ? No, - the Government does not do that ; instead, it presents a pistol at these men's heads. It says that, notwithstanding the award granted under the laws of the country, other conditions shall apply to their employment, that they must come under Mr . H u n t , that their wages shall be reduced. no In its own eyes the Government is above In the case of turret lathe operators, the reduction in wages under the Government's proposal is 18s. 6d. per week; the wages of men working on shells are to be reduced by 17s. Od. a week; in the other cases the reduction is as much as see £ 1 Is. 6d. per week.",41
135,Mr SCULLIN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,The Government is going a strange way to bring about indus,41
136,Mr GREGORY,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Honourable members resopposite say nothing about the dairyThe Mr Charlton - We , on this side, I know a good deal of the conditions of a dairyman's life, as for many years I reI know their trials and their troubles. Recently,' they have taken certain action regarding the price of butter; but that action has not been challenged by honourable members opposite. Honourable members on this side could, had they desired, have made a stir about the matter, but we realise that we are here to represent every section of the community and to act justly to all, and, therefore, we decidid not raise our voices in protest. Now, however, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) is not willing to grant justice to industrial workers. I ask him whether he approves of reduced wages have two being paid to these men ? ",41
137,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,The Government's action will not give uniformity. Honourable members should endeavour to consider this matter from the point of view of the men affected.,41

That is all that one could ask at the present juncture.. [ have no wish that there should be a protracted debate on the matter to-night,, but as it is of great importance to the meft concerned, I should like an assurance from the Prime Minister that he will meet a deputation from them in order that they may place their views before him and discuss the position with him.",41
140,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The Prime Minister gave that assurance, and said that he would meet them to-night.",42

143,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Yes-today,42
144,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"That adds to the seriousness of the position. If the Prime Minister will give an assurance that he will see a deputation from the men tomorrow to discuss the matter, we shall endeavour to bring about ah arrangement to that end. We have been unable to get into touch with the men to-night, because they have ceased work and gone to their homes.

146,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,I am quite satisfied with that assurance.,42
147,Mr COLEMAN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Reid) [8.3] - In 1924 the Government introduced an amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act, and after protracted discussion yielded to a demand for the appointment of an appeal board for the bank's clerks. A special provision was incorporated in the amending bill giving an officer of the bank affected in his employment by the action of any authority of the bank ""other than the board"" the right within a prescribed time to submit in writing an application for an appeal to the appeal board. Under recent action taken by the Commonwealth Bank Board the right bas been practically abrogated and the intention of Parliament in 1924 in giving the bank's clerks the right t< appeal against any action ous the part of the Governor of the bank, who at the time had control of promotioinis and preferments, has been defeated. On the 7th May, 1925, regulations were issued confirming the right given to the clerks to appeal against any action on. thu part of the Governor, provided that the appeal was lodged with the secretary to the board within 30 days "" of the officer's cognizance of such action."" I have received :i protest from the Unitedl Bank Officers Association on this matter. They point out that the whole intention of Parliament has been defeated by the issue recently by the board of amended regulations which were gazetted as "" Statutory Rules, 6th January, 1926', No. 4."" Not only has the right of the CommonAvealth Bank's clerks to appeal been taken away by the action of the board , but the 1 . method of election of the bank officers' representative on the appeal board has been materially altered witnout the employees of the bank being consulted. Under the regulations issued in 1924 the right of appeal was given to any clerk affected by the action of any authority of the bank other than the bank board, which meant the Governor of the bank. Under the regulations issued on the 6th January last, in clause 5, the word "" Board "" has been substituted for the word "" Governor."" The effect of this alteration is that the Commonwealth Bank Board now controls all classifications, and also the remuneration of bank officers. "" In this way the provision in the amending act, giving the employees the right of appeal, has been rendered null and void. The new regulations have altered materially the conditions under which appeals could previously be lodged. The original regulations provided for the lodging of an appeal to the board against the action of the .Governor in. regard to promotion "" within thirty days of the officer's cognizance of such action."" The new regulation provides that an appeal shall be lodged within 30 days of the officer being notified of action which adversely affects him. The action of the board in assuming control of transfers and promotion and remuneration defeats the intention of Parliament in passing the amending act. In the new regulations the word "" cognizance "" is deleted and provision is made for the lodging of an appeal "" - within 30 days of the notification by the board of such action."" Under the amended regulations it is for the Commonwealth Bank Board to determine whether an officer is affected by some action it has taken. If adversely affected, he had, under the old regulations, a right of appeal to an appeal board, but he has no such right under the amended regulations, unless the Commonwealth Bank Board notifies him that his position is affected by its action.",42
148,Dr EARL EPAGE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Is that what notification means in that connection 1 Is it not a general notification ?,43
149,Mr COLEMAN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The construction placed on the words by the union is that what is implied is an official notification to the individual affected by the action of the Commonwealth Bank Board. The regulation of 7th May, 1925, readAn officer affected in his employment by the action of any authority of the bank other than the board may lodge an appeal to the board; sueh appeal to be lodged with the secretary of the board within 30 days of the officer's cognizance of any such action. That is amended under the regulations of the 6th January, 1926, signed by the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) to readAn officer affected in his employment by the action of any authority of the bank other than the board may lodge an appeal to the board; such an appeal to be lodged with the Governor within 30 days of the notification to the officer of such action. It is clear that under this regulation an officer has no righ t of appeal unless he is notified that his position has been affected. That is getting Tight away from the intention of Parliament, which was to make the right of appeal as broad as possible. The transfer of one officer of the bank might injuriously affect a number of officers of the same grade, and vet they are to be denied the right to appeal against such action by the board. In the - Commonwealth Public Service an officer has the right of appeal if his position is affected by any action of the Board of Commissioners. Why should not a similar right be given to employees of the Commonwealth Bank? Clause 5 of the new regulations provides thatThe board shall classify officers and servants pf the bank, and shall fix their remuneration from time to time. Under this regulation the Commonwealth Bank Board has assumed powers which were formerly exercised by the Governor of the bank. If the board is to exercise these powers, how are the officers to secure their righ t of appeal when under the regulations they can appeal only against the action of any authority of the bank "" other than the board? "".""The new regulation represents a serious breach of f a it h on the part of the Commonwealth Bank Board, and a defiance of the intention of Parliament in passing the amending act. The Commonwealth Bank Board has further interfered with the method of election of the employees' representatives on the appeal board. The view of the union, as expressed to me, is as f o l lows:The whole thing would develop into a solemn farce unless these regulations were altered. It would keep the word of promise to our ears, but would break it to our hope. The wish is expressed that the Treasurer will take steps to repeal the newly issued regulations or modify their incidence upon those affected by them. I have said that the board has interfered with the manner of election of the employees' representative. Under the original regulations of the 7th May of last year, the employees had the right to be represented by scrutineers at the counting of the ballots, and every employee, male and female, of all ages, had the right to vote for the election of the employees' representative. That is in accordance with democratic principle, seeing that every officer of the bank, irrespective of age or sex, might be affected by appeals. The original regulations further provided for preferential voting. All these provisions have been arbitrarily abolished by the Commonwealth Bank Board, without consulting the wishes of the employees, although it is their representative who will be affected by its action. The amendments made by the board abolish preferential voting, l i m it the right of voting to salaried officers of the age of 21 years and over, eliminate scrutineers from the ballot,-and also provide for the principle of recall. I do not think that the Bank Board would be prepared to apply such a principle to itself. The regulation provides that if at any time the majority of the staff signs a petition for the removal of their representative his position shall be declared vacant, and a - new representative elected in his place, to hold office until the next annual election. I submit that interference with the right of the employees to make a free and untrammelled selection is a breach of f a i on the part of the Bank Board. It is tyrannical and unjust and calls for some reply on the part of the Treasurer. The employees, I am advised, have little f a it h in the appeal board now that the constitution has been altered, and the right of appeal annulled by an amendment of the regulations. should like the Treasurer to explain where an appeal now lies. The Bank Board now controls remuneration, promotions and everything else relating to the Commonwealth Bank. The 1924 Act provided for the appointment of a Board of Appeal, to deal with those matters which are now vested in the board.

151,Mr FORDE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Capricornia) [ 8 . 2 0 ] wish to reply to a certain statement made the rates ofby the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr G. Francis), when speaking on the Precious Metals Prospecting Bill on the 20th January last. Referring to the det h pression in the mining industry, he saidOne thing which is detrimentally affecting mining in Queensland-and I speak particularly for Charters Towers, Cloncurry, the Etheridge, Croydon, and the Chillagoe field until it became a government concern-is the high cost of workers' compensation insurance. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr . I Scullin) interjected, "" Does not the State insurance office assume increased liabilities?"" The honourable member for Kennedy replied, "" No ; it assumes practically no increased liability. "" At the time. I thought that the honourable member had received wrong information, but I did not rise to speak, because before doing so I wished to obtain definite facts from the State Insurance Commissioner in Queensland. I have since consulted him and received certain information, which will show that the honourable member's remarks were not quite fair. I know that he did not intend to misrepresent the State Insurance Department of Queenslandj respecting its rates of premiums and benefits to the workers. The StateInsurance Commissioner, Mr J . Watson, in commenting on the honourable member's The honourable member is indisputably wrong in his statement that the State Government Insurance Office, Queensland, "" assumes practically no increased liability"" in regard to mining risks in Queensland due to what he designates "" the high cost of worker's compenPrior to the establishment of that office under the Workers' Compensation Act of is 1916, compensation was not payable under to the Workers' Compensation Act of 1905 the following diseases of mining emSilicosis of the lungs; miners' phthisis; pneuAnkylostomiasis. Nystagmus. cellulitis of the hand (beat Subcutaneous cellulitis over the repatella (miners' beat knee). Acute bursitis over the elbow (miners' beat elbow). Inflammation of the synovial lining of the wrist ask joint and tendon sheaths. Miners' itch. Copper itch. Dermatitis caused by working mineralized or acid - water. Caisson disease. For these extra risks incorporated in the acts by. section 3 of the amending act of 1916, the State Government Insurance - I Office charged from the 1st July, 1917, 1. On the wages, &e., of workers esmployed underground in mining, other than coal mining-40s . per cent. 2. On the - wages, &c., of workers employed underground in coal mining or in quarrying-20s . per cent.. 3. On the wages, &c, of workers employed above ground at any mine or quarry-20s . per cent. At the 30th June, 1923, the Charters Towers field had contributed 211 claims out of 536, involving a compensation payment of £33,886 out of a total of £82,357, and the Cloncurry and Croydon fields, which the honourable member mentioned, had contributed, respectively, 95 claims, the compensation paid being £14,681, and 25 claims, the compensation paid - being £3,808. Owing to the ravages of diseases, particularly miners? phthisis, and to the fact that the Queensland Government also determined that even sufferers who had ceased work prior to the 1st January, 1916-the Workers' Compensation Actcame into force on the 1st July, 1916should receive at least one-half the monetary benefits given to workers incapacitated after the coming into force of the act, the rates had later-o n the 15th December, 1923-to be increased to1. On the wages, &c., of workers employed underground in mining, other than coal mining-80s . per cent. 2. On the wages, &c., of workers employed above ground or underground in coal mining-20s . per cent. 3. On the wages, &c, of workers employed above ground at any mine or quarry other than coal-40s . per cent. Even the increased rates have not met' the burden'which has not been placed on the mining industry, though there is power to do so under the industrial and mining diseases compensation regulations of 1917. The miners' phthisis account at the 30th June, 1925, was £20,030 to the bad, despite contributions from the ordinary profits of £83,698, and by the Government of £6,905. Notwithstanding this, under the Workers' Compensation Act of 1925, which came into force on the 5th November last, the Queensland Government determined that sufferers from pulmonary tuberculosis in mining employment should also receive benefits, and that the full benefit of £400 to such sufferers should be increased to £450. This may necessitate further assistance to the account of approximately £47,000, saved-from profits of the Workers' Compensation Department, or from general - reserve, the workers' compensation portion of which has been contributed to by ordinary policy-holders. I think that I have sufficiently shown the poorness and paucity of the honourable member's statement respecting the ""increased l i a b i l it y "" of compensation in Queensland in the mining industry. . I also would in for m him that the Workers' Compensation Acts 1916-25 cover the following industrial diseases:Arsenic,, phosphorus, lead, mercury, copper, zinc, or other mineral poisoning and their sequelae. Anthrax. Asiatic cholera, bubonic plague, diphtheria, measles, mumps, - scarlet fever, small-pox, tetanus, typhoid fever, or other zymotic disease. Carbon bisulphide poisoning. Carbon monoxide poisoning. Chrome ulceration. Poisoning by benzol or its nitro and amido derivates. Dermatitis venenata. Poisoning by nitrous fumes. Poisoning - by cyanogen compounds. Bpitheliomatous cancer or ulceration of skin or of the corneal surface of the eye due to mineral oil, pitch, tar, or tarry compounds. Septic poisoning. The act applies in certain employments, without extra premium to the ordinary accident rate, whereas the Workers' Compensation Act of 1905 did not cover a single industrial disease. I might add that those industrial diseases that I have enumerated practically coincide with those mentioned in the recommendation contained in the report of the representatives of the Commonwealth and the States of Australia, second conference on industrial hygiene, held at Melbourne on the 19th August, 1924. I would further in f o rm the honourable member that under the Workers' Compensation Act of 1905, the following rates for the ordinary accident risks applied:Disaster District. Rate. Limit. Gympie, Mount Morgan Charters Towers fields45s. £1,000 50s. 2,000 55s. 3,000 60s. 4,000 Crovdon and Gulf field65s. £1,000 70s. 2,000 75s. 3,000 80s. 4,000 Other fields55s. £1,000 60s. 2,000 65s. 3,000 70s. 4,000 The rates now charged by the State Government Insurance Office are:-For mines' underground staff, 44s. 6d.; for mines' surface hands, 29s. It also does not impose any disaster limit. In this connection the honourable member may be reminded of the expressions of Chillagoe Limited, which furnished a glowing tribute to the efficiency of State insurance and its satisfying protection because of non-imposition of a disaster limit. That company stated that it was an outstanding and established fact that its policy with the State Government Insurance Office had been the means of saving it is a very big loss in connection with the Mount Mulligan disaster. In that catastrophe about 50 miners were entombed and lost their lives. Under the 1905 act,, the maximum compensation would have been £4,000; but the State Insurance Department paid, without demur, claims amounting to approximately £60,000. Mr G. ERANCIS - It was a enterprise, and badly managed.",44
152,Mr FORDE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"I am not aware of that, but, however, it does not alter the fact that had the State Insurance Department not been established, the maximum disaster limit would have been £4,000, whereas compensation amounting to £60,000 was actually paid. Numerous other mining accidents have occurred in Queensland since the introduction of State insurance, and the relatives of those who lost their lives have benefited by the greater liberality of the terms offered by the department. The honourable member for Kennedy should not blame the State Insurance Department for the depression in the mining industry of Queensland. What about Kalgoorlie and numerous other fields? Mining has slumped in all parts of Australia, and some mines in Queensland continued working long after similar mines in other parts of the Commonwealth had closed down. Honourable members will realise from the facts I have related that the State Insurance Department in Queensland, so far from being a hindrance and a drawback to the mining industry, has treated the companies fairly, and has bestowed great benefits upon the workers engaged in the mines. Those who are employed in a very unhealthy occupation are deserving of liberal compensation if they contract the dread disease of miner's phthisis, and, in the event of death, their dependants are entitled to generous consideration. Mr G. FRANCIS - Quite right.",46
153,Mr FORDE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Prio r to the establishment of the State Insurance Department not a penny of compensation was paid to miners suffering from phthisis; when they were no longer able to work they the were thrown upon the industrial scrapheap, and they and their dependants were helpless. The State Insurance Department, however, makes available relief for the miners and their wives and children. Of course, this liberality cannot be effected by merely waving a magician's wand; certain premiums must be paid; but the rates charged by the department are reasonable. It has not only liberalized the compensation to miners who meet with accidents, but also has increased from £400 to £600 the maximum payable to the dependants of those who lose their lives, and, in cases of total State incapacity, from £400 to £750; whilst the worker who is temporarily incapacitated, instead of receiving only £1 per week, which was the limit when private companies controlled this form of insurance, may be paid up to £3 10s. a week, without the endless litigation charges which formerly seemed unavoidable. The State Insurance Department also reduced the gross rate of fire insurance premiums by 33 J per cent. When private enterprise held sway, the local lawyer was invariably briefed by the company to contest claims for compensation, and his office was littered with musty files relating, to such cases.. That class of litigation has ceased. Notwithstanding the greater benefits it bestows, the State Insurance Department has made an annual profit of about £60,000 for the last six years, and it is estimated that, if a Commonwealth scheme had been operating during that time, the Australian people would have saved about £6,000,000, and the victims of miner's phthisis in any part of Australia would have been receiving compensation. I submit that I have proved that the honourable member for Kennedy was not indulging in fair criticism when he said that the State Insurance Office in Queensland undertook no increased liabilities to counterbalance the small advance in the premium rates. Mr G. FRANCIS (Kennedy) [8.40].. - When T spoke on the bill relating to prospecting for precious metals, I did not criticize the administration of the Queensland State Insurance Office. I was merely illustrating the manner in which mining costs in that State have increased, thus rendering mining operations unprofitable. I instanced the fact that before the State took charge of the insurance business it was possible to insure a miner against all claims that might arise out of accidents in his employment for a premium of, approximately, £ 3 per annum, whilst a miner engaged on a temporary enterprise could be insured by the payment of a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annua] premium equal to about £ 3 per annum, whereas the State Insurance Department now' charges a premium of £12 a year for each man. I was speaking from memory, and had in mind the fact that the Towers T in M in in g Company No Liability, of which I was a director, had to pay a premium of £ 1 2 0 to insure an average of ten miners for a year. since ascertained that the rate was 80s. per cent., which represents an annual charge of a little more than £ 1 0 a man. Although a company might be engaging in an enterprise for a few weeks onlymerely prospecting to ascertain whether a show was worth further developmentit must pay the full year's premium or incur penalties. In reply to the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), I said that the State Insurance Department had not undertaken greatly increased responsibilities. I had in mind particularly the and Industrial Accident Assurance Association, to which I was solicitor. In the whole of its transactions of that class of insurance it never carried any claim into the courts; each case was settled without litigation. The company accepted monthly or quarterly premiums, insured against all claims, and did not question whether a man had dependants or not. When the State department took over the insurance it required to knew how many dependants the worker had, and if he had no direct dependants the maximum compensation payable in the event of death, was £50, and not the large amount mentioned by the honourable member for Capricornia. Through the honourable member's courtesy in letting me know this afternoon that he intended to speak on this matter to-night, I had an opportunity to obtain certain information from the Library. I do not wish to be considered a critic of the administration of the State Insurance Office. As a matter of fact, at a time when mining was almost at a. standstill, and many of the mines in which the workers had contracted disease had closed down, the officials realized that many industrial diseases were not covered by any form of compensation, and, possibly for actuarial reasons, the department' decided to increase the premium from 4.2s. 6 d . ; it was never less for miners working underground. The few mines still remaining were then expected to shoulder the burden of the increased premiums, because so many men had contracted miners' disease in mines that had gone out of existence. That was one factor which contributed to the high cost of mining in Queensland.",46
154,Mr FORDE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The honourable member will admit that the compensation payable has beenappreciably liberalized. I have Mr G. FRANCIS - Yes , but in a large number of the cases so eloquently dealt with by the honourable member for Capricornia-case s where there is need for a judicial interpretation as to whether a disease has been contracted as the result of an accident-compensatio n was payable even before the State Insurance Office was opened in 1916. 'The industrial magistrate, sitting as such, usually accepted the medical evidence placed before him, and rarely did a case reach the any court unless it was backed up by some medical evidence. Of course, medical exMining perts, like legal and other experts, sometimes differ, but in all the cases that came under my notice, even before the Workers' Compensation A ct of 1916 came into force, if a medical man declared that the disease from which the miner was suffering had resulted from an accident, compensation was given. Another factor which has contributed to the increased cost of mining in Queensland is that provision of the act which regards tributors as employees to, be covered by insurance by the mine-owners. Previously, tributors insured themselves, but the Workers Compensation Act of 1916 placed on the mining industry the additional burden of insuring tributors.",47
155,Mr FORDE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Was not that. of advantage to the tributors and their dependants ? Mr G. FRANCIS - No , because it simply drove them out ol 'tie business altogether. It had just the same result as would have followed the fixing of the wages of a miner at £1,000 a year. Personally, I would not take the risk that a miner takes even if I were offered £1,000 a year.",47
156,Mr FORDE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Then the payment of increased compensation to the dependants of miners is justified? Mr G. FRANCIS - The trouble is that when the mining industry was prosperous and dividends were being paid fairly regularly, the responsibility in regard was shirked altogether, and now when the industry is in a precarious position, it is saddled with the responsibility of a burden incurred long before. Mining expenses have also been increased by the additional cost of a number of articles. The cost of carbide has increased by 89.29 per cent, j that of cement by 50 per cent.; that of white lead by 84.19 per cent., and that of oil by 59.52 per cent. Some items show an increase of over 100 per cent. The price of one item. - gelignite-ha s gone up from. £2 10s. to £ 5 per case. I do not d' - ny that the State Insurance Office has paid large amounts of compensation in some instances, but it has sometimes refused to pay any compensation and the claimant has had to figfit, not merely an insurance department, but, actually, the Government, and they have hesitated to do this. Nevertheless, it is true that in some circumstances it accepts a larger liability. It is merely a matter of juggling with figures. It may be that in the Mount Mulligan disaster it paid out. £60,000, but that was not more than should have been paid, and, in any case, that was only in addition to very large sums which the public, including myself, contributed to the sufferers in that appalling calamity.  [8.53] - I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister representing the Minister for Home and Territories the matter of providing extra pay for divisional returning officers, who had greatly increased duties imposed on them at the last election owing to the operation of the compulsory voting provisions of the Electoral Act. In very few cases in previous elections, had the proportion of voters to the number of persons enrolled exceeded 60 per cent., but on this occasion,-in the majority of electorates, there was a poll of over 90 per cent. Thus the work of the returning officers was practically doubled, and as the election was held at a very trying time of the year when the weather was exceedingly warm, several of them collapsed in the performance of their duties. Represen-. tation have been made to the Prime Minister, not only by myself, but also by honourable members on both sides of the House, and, evidently, the matter was referred to the Public Service Board. Honourable members will agree that the reply of the Public Serthis vice Board is a very, lame excuse. I do not think I am exaggerating if I refer to it as a quibble. It says in effect that when these officers were appointed, and when their scale of pay was fixed, they knew that they might have to perform the duties which' were imposed on them at the last election under the compulsory voting system. This contention, in the circumstances surrounding the last election, hardly holds good even in regard to temporary officers, but I think everyone' will admit that the additional duties imposed on divisional returning officers by the operation of the compulsory voting provisions could not possibly have been known to them when they were appointed. The reply furnished by the board is.The fact that division i l officers are required to work overtime in connection with elections and referenda was carefully taken into consideration in determining their scale of pay. On this ground the board cannot agree to any request for increased pay for these officers. We all know that some of these men have grown old in the service. Some of them have held their positions since Federation, and as compulsory voting was not in force until the last election, the Public Service Board has erred in saying that when their rates of pay were being fixed they knew the circumstances that would arise through the adoption of compulsory voting. Surely the board's decision in this respect is not the last word in the matter. In private business, when the duties of employees are nearly doubled as they have been in this case, no employer would refrain from paying some form of bonus or compensation.",48
157,Mr RODGERS,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"An election entails a great deal of work afterwards as well as beforehand.  work was doubled both before and after the election. Postal, absentee, and ordinary votes were alike increased.",48
158,Mr RODGERS,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"If the electoral officers have to enforce the act, that, of course, will place extra work upon them.  so. About 7 per cent, of the electors did not record their votes, and since the elec- tion the Divisional Returning Officers have been seeking explanations from them, and summonses may have to bo issued later. I do not think that any honourable member is prepared to accept the paltry excuse given by the board for refusing to act fairly . This Government would be doing only its plain duty, and nothing magnanimous, if it remunerated these men for the extra work they performed. An y private employer would do so.",49
159,Mr LISTER,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"They are not overpaid in any case.  can say that. they have been overpaid in past elections. They would have had ample justification for claiming extrapayment for the work done at previous elections. Is the Minister prepared to accept the board's excuse? The board's statement that, the officers knew when they were being engaged that they would have to perform duties under a compulsory voting system is, to say the least of it, a most misleading one. The board's excuse is an insult to the intelligence of those who made representations to the Government. I hope the Minister will give the House an assurance that the matter will be reconsidered, so that simple justice may be done to these men, who, having performed their duties f a it h full y and well, are , now asking for no more than equitable payment. The board's reply is childish, and is obviously'not based upon the results of proper inquiry. Is the board to be permitted to place itself above the Minister? It should be compelled to give at least a logical answer.",49
160,Mr MCGRATH,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Ballarat) [ 9 . 5 ] - I support the honourable member for Hume  the Public Service Commissioners, when they penned their explanation, were not aware of the amount of work the Divisional Returning Officers had to do. It was a hurried election. were issued on the 3rd October, and the officers had about a fortnight's notice before the date on which enrolment ceased. The speed at work had to be done was unprecedented in Australian politics. Thousands of electors in every electorate had to be enrolled, and while enrolment cards were being entered up, the nominations were received and thousands of applications for postal votes had to be dealt with. Preparations for the elections had to be made on a very comprehensive scale. In my electorate, which is typical of others, about 97 per cent. *of the electors voted. Both the electors and the candidates were anxious to know the result of the poll as soon as possible, and the carrying out of the necessary work devolved .upon the Divisional Returning Officer and his deputies. For a fortnight before the 3rd October they never worked less than sixteen, hours a day. Probably the Public Service Commissioners had no knowledge of these facts, and gave their answer on the assumption that it was an ordinary election. It was ahurried election, at which 30 per cent, more electors than usual voted. When these men were appointed to their positions they had no idea of the work they would be called upon to perform in 1925. Australia is to. be congratulated upon the character of the individuals who act as Divisional Returning Officers. My experience of them is that they are honest, fair, and impartial, and they conduct the elections in a way that.is a credit to them, and to Australia. We ought to place more value oh the services of such good employees. I trust that the Minister will not be satisfied with the reply of the Public Service Commissioners, but will take further action to ensure that these worthy officers are adequately remunerated. I am loath to criticize the administration of the Old-age Pensions Department. In the past, the law has been more sympathetically administered than by any other department of which I have knowledge. I have had years of experience of it , both in the State and Federal Parliaments. Latterly, however, new practices have been introduced, probably with a view to economizing. In Ballarat, it used to be the custom, when applications for a pension were lodged, for an officer from the department, in - the capacity of a The writs special magistrate, to go to the town. He investigated the applications, and it was eertain that they would be completed in two or three weeks. Special officers are which the not now sent there, but State officials, such as clerks of petty sessions, receive the applications, which are dealt with by a police magistrate. We are for tunate in Ballarat in having a magistrate who is courteous and fair in dealing with applications, but laxity seems to accompany the new method. I have heard of applications that have been lodged for fourteen weeks, and I have been unable to get any* satisfaction regarding them from the department. Previously there was never a complaint. Most of these old people do not apply for a pension until they need it, and some of them are very old and destitute. They do ""not expect to be kept waiting for three months when they apply for a pension. I hope the Minister will ask the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions to revert to the old system. Under the new system the papers relating to a case are sometimes mislaid. Again and again I have received letters from the Deputy Commissioner saying that certain papers could not be traced. To send special magistrates to hear applications costs very little. An applicant for a pension' ought not to be required to attend a police court. Many of them have never been inside a police court, and as they have committed no crime, they should not be compelled to go inside one when they make an application for a pension.",49
161,Mr BELL,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,I have never heard of that in Tasmania.,50
162,Mr MCGRATH,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"I am glad to hear that the same practice is not followed in Tasmania, which must be a favoured State. Applicants for a pension in Victoria have to attend a police court, although a special room could be obtained for a few shillings. The surroundings of a police court are not conducive to die comfort of old and invalid persons. They do uot like to enter such a place, and they also prefer their applications to be regarded as secret. Why should we compel them, in their declining years, to go to a police court? I have rarely had to complain about this department, for its .officials have been most sympathetic. hope that, they will revert to the old system of employing special magistrates, and will have the applications heard in some other place than a police court.  hope the Minister will be able to do something in the direction of compensating returning officers' for the extra work done by them at the election. I should like to give to honourable members a few figures to show the amount of this extra work in the division of Angas, which I have the honour to represent, apparently much to the distress of one of the previous speakers. At the election three years ago, 51 per cent, of the electors voted, and the total number of votes cast was 20,170. In the last election my political opponent polled 20,178 votes, or 8 more than the total number of votes polled in the division three years previously. Yet he was not successful. The percentage of votes, polled increased from 51 to 94.23. In addition to the greater number of ordinary votes, there was a large increase in the number of postal, absentee, and declaration votes. It is in connection with these votes that the hard work of the counting is encountered. The counting of the ordinary votes is a comparatively easy matter, but every postal, absentee, aud declaration vote has to be examined separately and checked with the rolls. It is a big job. In my division this work took four or five days; it was all done under the personal supervision of the divisional returning officer. In view of the efficient and courteous manner in which the elections were conducted- I did not hear one complaint of discourtesy on the part of any official- I think that something should be done to compensate these men. If there exists a hard and fast regulation which prevents payments from being made to them, a honorarium or . bonus could be granted to them. Seeing that at the Christmas season every business which considers itself .to be respectable pays its assistants a bonus, surely in the case of men who have rendered such loyal and valuable service as have these divisional returning officers, the Government can afford to be a little generous.",50

164,Mr MARR,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"This question cannot be settled to-night, nor can I say that a bonus will be paid to these officers. I can only promise that the matter will be brought under the notice of the Minister concerned, and he, no doubt, will bring it before Cabinet. We must not lose sight of the fact that these divisional returning officers, like other officers of Public Service, are under the direct control of the Public Service Board.  dinate positions received additional payments.",51
165,Mr MARR,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"It is generally recognized that the divisional returning officers did their work well. I have not heard the slightest imputation of dishonesty or inability concerning them. It is recognized also that their work in connection with the last election was exceptionally heavy. For the reason that these men, who are mostly heads of departments, were not working under direct supervision, they are not entitled to payment for overtime. I know, however, that many of them worked day after day, and even on Sundays during the counting period after the election, and that prior to polling day they worked long hours when the rolls were being compiled. Their work in connection with the last election was particularly strenuous, as the whole of the rolls had to be recompiled and printed. As late as the 13th November, the day before the election, notifications of deaths were being received from the registrars, and the rolls were amended accordingly. understand that in some instances the divisional returning officers were not even paid tea money when they worked overtime.

Bill received from the Senate, and (on motion by Mr MARR) read a first time. [30] DRIED FRUITS ADVANCES BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 3rd February (vide page 613), on motion by Mr. MARRThat the bill be now read a second time.",51
167,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Hunter) [9.22] the The purpose of this bill is to amend the Dried Fruits Advances Act 1924. Unfortunately, for a considerable time the fruit-growing industry has been in a very unsatisfactory condition. In August last the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) moved the adjournment of the House to draw attention to this matter, and, prior to that, a deputation waited oh the Prime Minister to place the position before him. That deputation asked for a bounty to cover the losses that growers were sustaining in consequence of the low prices then being paid for fruit. I am in sympathy with the men who have taken up orchards, only to find themselves in an awkward position financially. To 4,500 of these growers, many of whom are returned soldiers, the sum of £204,000 has been advanced under the legislation of 1924. The condition of the fruit growing industry is a matter of considerable importance to a large section of the community. When this matter was before us previously, the price of fruit was very low, and, in addition, there was a difference of about £22 per ton between the price received for the frui t in London and the price paid to growers. When I was in London the difference was still greater, I it being at that time nearly £30 per ton. I said last year that I considered that the Government should cause an investigation to be made as to the difference between the price received by the growers and that at which the f r u it was sold in London. Unfortunately, nothing in that direction has been done, and today we find that the industry is in a worse position than before. In his second-reading speech, the Honorary Minister (Mr. Atkinson) said that last year the price received for sultanas was £68 6s. per ton c.i.f. in England, which returned to the growers a price equivalent to £48 per ton in the sweat boxes. He said also that at the same time lexias were sold at £32 17s. a ton, and currants at £32 14s. per ton. He then quoted figures showing that during the week from the 22nd to .the 28th January, 1926, sultanas brought £67 per ton, a reduction of £ 1 6s. per ton on last year's price; currants £26 12s. per ton, or £6 5s. a ton less than last year; and lexias £23 l is . a ton, as against £32 14s. per ton in 1925. Erom those figures it is evident that the industry is in a very unsatisfactory position. One wonders how the men engaged in itmanage. to eke out an existence.",51
168,Mr WATSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Many of them do not do so. Mr. CHARLTON - The returned soldiers and others who were induced to take up land for fruit-growing, believingthat they would find the industry profitable', are entitled to consideration by this Parliament. Their position proves that it is idle for us to talk of land settlement in fruit-growing areas when markets for the produce cannot be found. It is evident that the best market for our fruit is still the home market. I am in sympathy with these men in their presentsituation, and am willing to do everything possible to assist them; but I doubt the wisdom of appointing another board. I am, however, open to conviction in this matter. I do not say that I shall vote against the proposal contained in the bill, but I am of the opinion that already we have far too many boards - If a board is appointed as proposed in this measure, every grower who desires assistance will have to place his case before it, and after taking evidence, the board will have to report to the Minister, who can adopt its recommendation or otherwise, as he thinks fit. It is difficult to say where this thing will end. The number of growers concerned is approximately 4,500, andi t is not improbable that the majority of them will apply to the board for assistance. If the case of each individual is dealt with separately, much time will bo occupied; and as the board is to consist of three members, their salaries and other expenses will probably amount to £15 or £16 per day. The work may go on for two years or more. In any case, a decision will not be reached as quickly as the men .on the land will desire. Is it not possible to deal with this matter more expeditiously so that tbpse men may obtain .relief earlier? They are asking under the bill that, instead of at once paying their instalments with 6 per cent, interest, because last year they were unable to do so, they should be given relief by being allowed to make half their payments at. the end of 1926, and the remaining half at the end of 1927. I am afraid that at the end of 1927 the board would not have dealt with more than half the applications for relief made to it. I do not know what there is to prevent officers of the Markets and Migration Department dealing with the claims of these settlers for relief. There are capable men in that department, and why should they not investigate all claims made, instead of setting up the elaborate machinery of a board, with practically all the paraphernalia of a court, with power to hear evidence, call for the production of books, and ascertain in each case what relief should be given. ,The Markets and Migration Department is in touch with what happens in London, the selling price of our dried fruits there, the cost of freight, and so on, and its officials should be able to investigate claims for relief, and report to the Minister what relief should be granted - This would cut down the cost involved in the appointment of a special board for this purpose by 50 per cent., and perhaps more. We are appointing too many boards. During the last five or six years boards have been appointed to deal with very small matters. Though this is a matter of great importance to individual settlers, it does not, in my opinion, justify the appointment of a permanent board.",52
169,Mr ATKINSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"It is not anticipated that the board will cost very much. Mr Charlton"" - That may be so,-' but we have nothing to show that it will not cost a very great deal. The investigation of individual cases may run into days. A board cannot settle a case in a few hours. I believe that it would be better if an efficient officer of the Markets and Migration Department were told off to investigate these claims for relief. He would be able to obtain all the necessary information much more quickly, and at much less cost, than it could be obtained by a board. One cannot but sympathize'with those.who will be dealt with under this measure. It is hard that a young fellow returning from the war and taking up a block of land with the hope that within two or three years he would be able to support his wife and family, should find, as time goes on, that while his family is increasing, he is not getting a sufficient return from his efforts on the land to provide a decent livelihood. If a man enters into certain obligations, and is not receiving a sufficient return to enable him to meet them, that preys upon his mind. How can we expect the wife of one of these .settlers to enjoy l if e away in the back country when her husband is straggling month after month and year after year without obtaining a sufficient return from his block to enable him to bring up his f a m i l y in decent comfort, but, on the contrary, getting into a worse position ? are all concerned in this matter, and both State and Federal Governments are responsible for many returned soldiers being put on the land, not only to grow dried fruits, but to cultivate other produce also . When we know that these men and their families are suffering, it is for us to see that something is done to relieve them. To that extent my sympathy is entirely with this bill . I do not oppose it , but I do direct attention to the suggestion that an officer of the Markets and Migration Department should be appointed to make inquiries under this measure, and recommendations to the Minister, instead of the Government going to the expense of setting up a permanent board.  represent an electoral division which contains within its boundaries a number of Settlers whom, with the greatest respect, I may term unfortunate people, I feel that it is incumbent upon me to say something on this bill. I wholeheartedly support the measure in so far as it is an attempt to give relief to those who really deserve it . A ny one who visits the soldier settlers, in the irrigation areas particularly, must be impressed with the hardships they have to put up with. of them have gone upon the land from homes in the cities. Their wives have never been used to the conditions of back country life, and yet when one goes amongst them he finds that they are truly Australian in their hospitality; they are not always growsing, but are inclined to make little of their troubles, and are triers all the time. They afford a really wonderful example of the way in which people can put up with hardships and yet carry on. The proposed new sub-section 3 A of section 10 readsWhere, in the opinion of the Minister, it is undesirable or impracticable that the amount of any advance made under this act should be repaid out of the proceeds of the sale of the dried fruits produced in the year 1925 by the grower to whom the advance was made, he may. upon such terms and conditions as he thinks fit, release the proceeds of the sale of those dried fruits from the charge imposed by sub-section 2 of this section, and notify the grower that the repayment of half the amount of the advance shall be a charge upon the proceeds of the sale of the dried fruits produced, by that grower during the year 192C, and the repayment of the remainder of the advance shall be a charge upon the proceeds of the sale of the dried We fruits produced by that grower during the year 1927, and thereupon the repayment of the advance shall to the extent so notified become a charge upon the proceeds of those dried fruits after the costs of production and marketing (not exceeding such amount as the Minister determines) of those dried fruits have beeu provided for. That"" seems to me to cover the needs of the settlers, but later in the bill provision is made in certain cases for even more liberal consideration. The proposed new sub-section 10L readsNotwithstanding anything contained in this act the Minister may, upon receipt of a report from the board appointed under this act, release any grower either wholly or in part from his indebtedness in respect of an advance made to him under this act. When the war was over and large numbers of men were coming back, the question arose: What are we to do with them? Many of them desired to go on the land of the country they had fought for. The people and governments, Federal and State, backed up the men in that desire. There were one or two alternatives. One was to keep the men in idleness in the cities, waiting, like Micawber, for something to turn up. Another was to put them on the land, or put them into other walks of civil life. We all thought that it would be best for the men to put them on the land. They had got Many out of the manner of life they had been living before the war. They lived a very open life while at the Front, and it was felt that to shut them up on their return in offices and factories would not be conducive'to their well-being or their health. So the cry went up, "" Put them on the land."" The men responded to that cry, but unquestionably the land settlement of returned soldiers was overdone I have been informed by some of the older residents of areas in which returned soldiers have been settled that their advent there was a market for the products of those areas, but with increased production and large areas still coming into production, the position will not improve in the immediate future something is done, not only by way of relief of the settlers, but by the opening up of markets for their products. this matter the people of Australia a duty of which they have not been fully seized up to date. I say that the residents of large cities particularly can help these returnedsoldier growers very materially by making more popular the consumption of their products. If parents would encourage their children to eat more dried fruits, instead of some of the messy concoctions which the children do eat-to their utter undoing, so far as their health is concerned-the would be all the better and an immense benefit would be conferred the growers of these fruits. On the question of the appointment of the proposed board, I am in agreement with the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). I do not like the idea of a board. I do not think that, as a rule, boards are sympathetic. going to afford the settlers relief, whoever makes the inquiries into their must be sympathetic. I suppose that the board, if appointed, will visit various districts, and I can imagine that when it arrives, with its secretary and s t a f f , the settlers will have a feeling that is to be put over them, and will-straight way become antagonistic to the board. If the board is to carry out its investigations in the city it will be necessary for the applicants - to be. summoned before it with their witnesses, books, and papers. They will have to waste a great deal of time that they can ill afford to spare, and their cases may not come on for investigation for a week after, their arrival in the city. It would be far better to have a single capable officer visiting the various settlements and inquiring into cases. He would more quickly aud at less expense to the country cover the ground than the board could, and, I believe, would give far more satisfactory I consider that the penalty that is provided in the case of a witness without reasonable excuse to various books and documents is altogether too high. The men on the fruit ments do not always understand the law,  before and if they have a grievance they may be inclined to be stubborn when legal advice cannot be obtained on the spot. I cast no reflection upon them. The penalty of £50 provided in the bill should be reunless duced. I have had a certain amount of experience as a justice of the peace in country courts, and I know that when a In person is convicted of an offence for have which the maximum penalty is £50, even although the magistrate is sympathetic he cannot very well impose a fine of less than £5. A high penalty is an in dication to him of a serious offence, and that the fine must be sufficient to act as a warning to others. I do not think that that is intended by the Minister. We want, not to frighten these men, but to assist them and give them justice. I am pleased indeed that memchildren bers on both sides of the House realise upon what we owe to the fruit-growers. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has said, these settlers have been seriously affected by overproduction. I do hope that the Minister will be able to adopt some of the suggestions that I have made.",52
170,Dr MALONEY,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Melbourne) [9.48] If we are I am full y in accord with the remarks of the honourable member for Angas (Mr . applications Parsons), and I am pleased that the Government has introduced the bill. I have made four separate journeys on the river Murray, and have visited every important settlement on its banks, and, something in consequence, my sympathy goes out to the settlers there. I might state that the f r u it of Tasmania is wholly in the hands of a combine, and two or three individuals there can make or mar the happiness of every f a m i l y on the Tasmanian orchards. A case of apricots sold to Henry"" Jones, Limited, realizes only i d . per lb., the orchardist having to pay for the case and the carriage of the f r u it . Honourable members can, therefore, well understand how little he individual receives in return for his labour. I have grave fear, although I will not say definitely, that the dried f r u i ts trade of Australia is in the hands of a few men, results. and for this reason I consider that the penalty clause in the bill does not go far refusing enough. Proposed new sub-section 1 0 H produce of clause 3 readsIf any person appearing as a witness before settlethe board refuses, to be sworn or to make an affirmation or to answer any question relevant to the investigation or proceeding put to him by any member of the board he shall be guilty - of an offence. Penalty: Fifty pounds.",54
171,Mr ATKINSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,That is the maximum penalty.,55
172,Dr MALONEY,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"I should like to see added to that these words, "" and imprisonment until he answers."" Under the clause as it stands a man who refuses to answer may not have £50, and would therefore be forgiven. If the penalty were a fine and imprisonment, the answer would soon be forthcoming. It has been my experience, while a member of commissions and committees, that most important evidence has been refused by witnesses, who, with the assistance of capable and well-paid barristers, have been able to withhold information which oftentimes would have been of importance to the inquiry. As an instance, I recall the name of Mr. Knox, the managing director of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. If that man had been gaoled until he answered questions, we should have been much wiser. I am not criticizing the bill, because I recognize that the Government desires to assist a section of men that are most deserving of encouragement. I know many returned soldiers who have settled on the river Murray blocks. I have had to assist one of them from time to time, and no man is more pleased than he when he obtains an advance. I do not know of any body of men who are suffering more than those who are dependent upon the dried frui t industry. If it is found that the dried frui t trade is in the hands of a combine, operating to the detriment of the fruit growers, I hope that the Government will bring in a bill to give the growers some measure of protection. Honourable members may have heard of the League of Child Helpers, one of whose objects it is to encourage the consumption of fruit by school children. At one time, it was distributing orange juice to 2,500 children. The Charities Board could not make up its mind whether this body should be registered as a charitable or as a benevolent society. The delay was serious. It was in the middle of the winter, and many of the children in Port Melbourne and South Melbourne were without shoes and stockings, and had only thin cotton shirts to protect their bodies from the cold. The Charities Board finally asked the Crown Solicitor for an opinion. It was suggested to me by a friend that I shoud see the Minister, and obtain an order from the Governor in Council. I appealed to Sir Alexander Peacock, and, in due course, the Government Gazette published the fact that the league was a benevolent society. We should get the people of Australia to eat more fruit. If every Australian family consumed a certain amount of fruit daily it would be of considerable help to the soldier settlers, who are striving to make a living for themselves. The Commonwealth Government, when establishing a school system, should follow the example of European countries by giving the children in the morning and afternoon a certain allowance of fruit juice, dried fruits, or milk. I have tried that, and will still continue to do so in order to help the fruit industry. I wish the Minister success in passing the bill, and I hope that it will redound to his credit.",55
173,Mr STEWART,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Wimmera) [9.59] There seems to be some misconception in the minds of many honourable members regarding the meaning of the measure. Perhaps for the benefit of those who were not in this chamber when legislation affecting this industry was passed last year, it would be worthwhile to briefly review the circumstances under which the advances were made. The history of this - industry can be summarized in a few sentences. It was established after the Victorian Government in pre-federal days had imposed a protective duty on dried fruits of 3d. a lb. That duty still exists; it has neither increased nor decreased. Under the protection of that duty the industry supplied the local requirements of dried fruits. It prospered, and during the war years especially it boomed. The fruit sent overseas then and in the years immediately following realized very high prices, The consequence was that when the soldiers returned to Australia, and the State governments were seeking for a repatriation field, they rushed them into the then booming industry and caused a considerable expansion of it . One drawback of the industry is that the grower cannot, as in other forms of primary production, change suddenly from an unprofitable crop to another. At least three years must elapse before he gets any crop at all. Unfortunately for the returned soldier during the years in which he was bringing his block into bearing, he had to pay very high costs, and when his first returns were about due, the prices of dried fruits fell. That is illustrated by the following table:AVERAGE SWEAT-BOX PRICES. Year. Currants. Sultanas. Per ton. Per ton. 1920 53 74 1921 46 71.1922 44 71 1923 39 40 1924 25 25 The figures for 1924 are because the complete statistics were not available when the return was prepared. For the 1924 crop, a very low price was received, due, first, to the return of Mediterranean fruits to the world's markets, and, secondly, to the low quality of the Australian crop on account of the bad drying season. Furthermore portant change had taken place in the industry, for, whereas hitherto traha had been the main market for our dried, fruits and the overseas quite a subsidiary consideration-in the export quota was about 20 per cent, and the local consumption of the crop-the position was now reversed, and from 75 to 80 per cent, of the production must be sold in the markets of the world in competition the fruits of other countries. fruits industry differs from other primary industries inasmuch as all labour engaged in it is governed by an award of the Arbitration Court. I do not, nor does the. grower, lay undue stress upon the high wages as the cause of his difficulties, but I feel obliged to show the manner in which wages have increased while the prices of dried fruits in the overseas market have receded. when boom prices for fruit were being received, the wages in the averaged £3 12s. a week . In 1921 they rose to £4, and they remained at that figure during the years 1922 and 1923. In 1924 the average wage advanced to £4 6s. 6d, and last year to £4 8s. Although the industry was sagging at the knees, although it was proved sively that many of the growers would down and out if the Government not come to their rescue, the Court awarded higher rates of wages. Mr Stewart. To show how completely the awardcovered every phase of the industry, I quote the following notification to growersfrom The Sunraysia Daily of 30th January(For employees other than those provided for in Table ""B."")

We have the extraordinary anomaly of an Australian primary industry, which is concludependent upon the oversea markets for be from 75 to 80 per cent, of its returns, did being compelled by the tariff to pay AusArbitration tralian rates for implements, hessian, timber, galvanized iron, wire, and other re-quisites of production, and by an Arbitration Court award to pay Australian rates of wages for all labour. Ground between the upper and nether millstones of legal compulsion, the grower has yet to take whatever price be can get in the world's market in competition with the product of the sweated labour - of Greece, Spain, Smyrna, Italy , and - other Mediterranean countries. digger who fought the Turk on the battlefield now finds that his late enemy is one of his greatest competitors in the commercial field. Because of these circumstances the position of the industry became so desperate that, in 1924, the growers asked the Government of the day to grant a bounty. The Government refused to do that, but induced Parliament to make advances upon the f r u it which the had put into the 1924 pack at the rates of 5s - per ton per month for currants, or 30s. per ton for the six months, and 30s. per ton per month for sultanas and lexias, or £ d for the six months, in order to enable the growers to produce a crop in 1925. There is not the slightest doubt that, but for that advance, most of those engaged in the industry would have failed, because the financial institutions on which they usually rely had declined to assist them any further. object of the Government advance was to keep the industry going, and it was understood that the amount would be repaid out of the proceeds of the 1925 crop. The price that the growers, received . for their sultanas was profitable, but the receipts for lexias and currants were not, and, as the Minister very accurately said, when explaining the bill, prices for this f r u it have gone from bad to worse. The growers have . not yetreceived the whole of the proceeds of the 1925 crop, for, whereas the growers of wool and wheat Teceive lump payments for their products, dried fruits are slowly marketed throughout' the year, and progressive payments are made to the producers. The sultanagrower received sufficient to repay the cost of production last year, but not to pay the amount of his indebtedness to the Government.",55
174,Mr WEST,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,He had not been able to work off the dead horse.,57
175,Mr STEWART,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"No . The grower of proceed to ascertainlexias and currants not only cannot work off a dead horse, but is actually heavily in debt for the amount of the advance made to him by the Commonwealth. I had the honour of introducing the deputation referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. It was a deputation of returned soldier growers to the Prime Minister, and its request was that, as Commonwealth legislation had i m posed on the growers burdens in the .The shape of increased wages to employees and increased Customs duties, the Commonwealth Government should accept its responsibility and grant a bounty to the industry, in the shape of the difference between the ascertained cost of production and the price received for the crop in the markets of the world. The Prime Minister stated, in reply, that it was not the policy of the Government to grower grant a bounty, and that, in any case, it would be impossible to ascertain the cost of praducfcion. Therefore nothing came of the deputation but a refusal. In June, 1925, a gathering representing about two-thirds of those engaged in the industry, met in Mildura and adopted the following concise statement of their position : 1. The cost of production exceeds the proceeds received by growers! 2. The result of (1) is that some financial The institutions who formerly financed the industry are now refusing to do so. 3. Without finance the growers are unable to continue production. Some have already abandoned their holdings, and many more will be compelled to do so unless immediate action is taken by the-Government. 4. Every endeavour has been made by the growers to increase yields, and improve the quality of the pack, and also to bring the cost of production to a minimum. 5. The high protective tariff, having as its effect a high cost of living, must result in a high cost of production. fi. The compulsory wages of the Arbitration Oourt applied to fruit exported,-which is now 75 per cent, of the total crop, as well as to that consumed' within the Commonwealth. This is an impost from which the growers cannot escape. 7. Those engaged in the industry request - the ' appointment of an impartial tribunal to fully ' investigate the condition of the industry. . 8. Pending the appointment of such tribunal it is absolutely essential that prompt steps he taken to assist the growers to remain in the industry until stabilization is effected by =ueh means as the Government may find neeessary. It is suggested that the tribunal should (a) Can the cost of production on th» block be reduced? If so, in what way! (b) Can the methods of processing and puuking for market be improved, and eost reduced ? (ft) Oan present transport charges, botli local and overseas, be reduced? (d) Are the present methods of marketing and selling efficient? (e) Is the present system of water supply for irrigation efficient and economical, and can improvements be effected? (f) In what way can the present unsatisfactory system of financing the industry and making advances and payments to growers be improved? (fl) Are there any other directions in which greater efficiency can be secured in the industry, and costs of production decreased? 1 The matter was brought up me in the House last year, but the Government did not seem very anxious to appoint the tribunal for which the growers were asking. However, honourable members sitting in the ministerial corner and honourable members opposite, very generously took up their case, and appealed to the Government to appoint this tribunal, whereupon the Government reluctantly agreed to do so. That was in August last. To-day, the 4th February, 1926, I asked the following questions1. Whethor the tribunal proposed' to be appointed by the Commonwealth' and State Governments to inquire into the dried fruits industry has been appointed? 2. If so, what is trie personnel of such tribunal and the terms of reference? 3. When can its report be expected? The reply I received wasThe proposed tribunal has not yet been appointed, as the concurrence of the Government of South Australia in the matter has not yet been received. The Victorian Government has agreed to the proposal, but has not yet selected its representative. In fact, nothing has been done in connection with the definite promise made in this House that steps would be taken to appoint such a tribunal. ferences have been made during this debate to the generosity of the Commonwealth Government to the grower. would be the last to belittle any effort made by the Government to assist the dried fruits industry, but I am compelled to say that it has not given one penny to those engaged in it in spite of the fact that the industry has been passing through as great a trial as that of any other form of primary industry. vernment has not even given the slightest concession in the matter of freights on the Commonwealth steamers, for which the Mr Stewart. dried fruit-growers have repeatedly asked. . It has given a concession in this regard to the canned f r u it trade, hut has refused to give any to the dried f r u it trade. I have with me a comment upon the shipment of canned f r u it 1 by the Eromanga about which we have recently heard so much. It is as f o l lows :While in Melbourne I ascertained that the new freight arrangement for the canned fruit is as follows:In order to get over the high freights, the Minister for Markets has chartered the s.s. Eromanga to load at four ports-Melbourne , by Hobart, Adelaide, and Fremantle-and she will take practically a full cargo at the rate of 60s. per ton measurement A case of two dozen tins of canned fruit measures l i cubic feet, and the freight is now Is. 10id. per case, against the old rate, 2s. 7*d. per rase, or a reduction of 9d. per case. But additional to this they are to receive a freight bonus of 2s. per case on apricots, and Is. 6d. per case on peaches', which practically means that they will get their fruit home to the TJnited Kingdom freight free. Supposing they were to give dried fruit the benefit of even the 50s. per ton rate, the saving to growers would be a big one. £ 8. d. 40 cases dried fruit equal 1 ton weight measurement, 50 feet at present freight rate, £3 10s. per ton .. . . 4 7 6 At 50s. rate ' . . .. 3 2 6 Saving . . £ 1 5 0 The existing freight is £ 4 7s. 6d. per ton by the Commonwealth and other shipping lines. These vessels will carry wheat at parcel rates for 25s. and 30s. per ton; but the freight on dried f r u it , which I believe takes up even less space than wheat, is £ 4 7s. 6d. per ton. The Victorian Government has given practical assistance in the matter of railway freights. The average rate for dried f r u it from Mildura to Melbourne Many re- was something over £ 2 a ton, but as a result of representations, in regard to the condition of the industry, tine VicI torian Railways Department agreed to insert a new class in the freight-book the effect of which wasto reduce the rate on dried fruit s by £ 1 per ton. Yet, the Commonwealth Government, which has as much responsibility as the States . to see that an industry in which so many returned soldiers are engaged succeeds, The Go- has taken no step whatever to reduce the exorbitant rate of £ 4 7s. 6d. per ton charged on its own line of steamers. I mention this' because a great deal of praise has been given to the Government for what it has done for the dried fruits industry. As a matter of fact, it has done nothing for it other than to make an advance which it insists the growers shall repay. The Leader of the Opposition has objected to the appointment of a board, but I gather, from a perusal of the bill, that the reason for its appointment is that which is given in the proposed new section IOL , which reads as follows: Noth with standing anything contained in act the' Minister may, upon receipt of a report from the board appointed under this aet, release any grower either wholly or in part from his indebtedness in respect of an advance made to hiin under this act. Apparently the Government recognizes that it is necessary to do something which I have just complained has not yet been done, and that when a grower can prove that he is unable to repay the amount advauced to him, he may be released from his indebtedness either wholly or in part. Originally, the growers agreed to repay the advance made to them, out of the proceeds of their 1925 crop, but as they are unable to do this, the Government is now dividing the in debtedness into two repayments, and postponing them u n t i l the 1926 and 1927 crops have been marketed. also inserted in the bill a provision admitting that cases may arise in which it may be necessary and desirable to wipe out the indebtedness of a grower. The Government and its advisers- Mr . Mulvaney and other officers, who have done excellent work in this industryfrankly admit that the growers of currants and lexias lost money not only in 1924, but also in 1925. I suggest to the Government that it should wipe out the advances made on currants and lexias, and not ask every grower to go before, a board and prove that he cannot repay the money. The growers do not want to defraud the Government. They are willing to meet their obligations. In the matter of currants and lexias, the Government should tell them that there is no need for them to go before a board, or to make an oath,' or produce their books; but that, seeing that they have had a disastrous time, the debt will be wiped off. The business of the board could then be confined to dealing with applications for relief by the growers of sultanas. The adoption of my proposal would be just to [31] the grower, and I do not believe that the taxpayers would object if they were acquainted with the circumstances. I urge the Government to give consideration to that suggestion. Even now the growers are finding it extremely difficult to obtain advances, and if the crops of 1926 and 1927 are mortgaged to the extent of the repayments under this bill , their difficulties will be greatly increased. Unfortunately, the producers in this industry are not alone in their difficulties, for this those engaged in nearly every primary in dustry, except the production of wool, are having an exceedingly bad time. Perhaps I may also except the wheat-growers, owing to the lucky circumstance that high prices have been ruling in the markets of the world. Those high prices, however, may fall at any moment. The Government and the people of this country must recognize the fundamental fact that our primary industries cannot continue to prosper with the present high cost of production. High Customs duties are crippling primary industries. We have the curious paradox that protective duties built up this industry, but the volume of production has overtaken the local consumption, and there is a surplus to sell in the markets of the world. The policy that buil t up It has the industry is now ruining it . The producers cannot continue to pay the high cost of production in Australia and compete against the growers of other countries in the markets of the world. They may be compelled to do as the secondary industries do-curtai l production or close down-whic h would be disastrous to this country. The cost of production and the cost of living are too high. The Government and Parliament will continue to wrestle with problems affecting the primary producers. In 1923 the Prime Minister stated that those engaged in the exporting primary industries were entitled to a measure of assistance equivalent to that given to Australian manufacturers. I subscribe to that principle. If we give bounties to secondary industries, we must also apply the bounty system to the primary producer. If the workers of Australia are guaranteed a living wage, and a fair return for their labour, and if the manufacturers are guaranteed a reasonable interest on their capital, surely a corresponding guarantee should be given to the primary producers. I approve of the bill in the main, but I strongly urge the Government to curtail the work of the board by half, and to write off the advances for lexias and ctvrrants, the growing of which, as the Minister stated last night, has been unprofitable.",57
176,Mr ATKINSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS, [10.37] - The honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) seemed to think that the board provided for in the bill will be as costly as some the other boards created by the Commonwealth. The clause providing for the appointment of the board clearly states that it will exist for the special purpose of hearing the claims of growers for relief.,60
177,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"How long will it take the board to hear the evidence and determine 2,000 claims?",60
178,Mr ATKINSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Probably not long. The board will most likely be composed of two officers of the department, with an outside man possessing special knowledge. It will be able to do its work in a few centres, because the growers in this industry are not scattered all over the continent. The estimated cost of the board is £250. The department has given very close attention to this matter, and has done excellent work in connection with it, as the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) admits. The estimate was prepared by those who ought to know. As £204,000 has been advanced to the growers, the cost of the board is more than justified.",60
179,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,The estimate of the cost of the board is ridiculous and misleading.,60
180,Mr ATKINSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The honourable member may say that it is ridiculous, but those who have been controlling this business submit it quite seriously.",60
181,Mr STEWART,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Does the sum represent the cost of travelling expenses?,60
182,Mr ATKINSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Chiefly , of course. The board will have only a little work to do, and it will not be a permanent body. Those honourable members who have criticized the estimate did not make an estimate themselves, and I know no reason why those who have been controlling this business should not be trusted to give a reasonable estimate. I have no doubt that when the business has been completed honourable members will find that the departmental estimate is approximately correct. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Repayment of advances).",60
183,Mr STEWART,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Wimmera) [10.43], - Do I understand that some of the of growers may still have to pay the advances out of the proceeds of the 1925 crop, or has the Government decided not to ask them to pay out of the 1925' crop, but out of the 1926 and 1927 crops? MT. ATKINSON (Wilmot-Honorar y Minister) [10.44] - The clause appears to me to be quite clear. If a grower is not in a position to pay out of the proceeds of the 1925 crop, the Minister will give him permission to pay half the amount out of the proceeds of the 1926 crop, and the balance out of the proceeds of the 1927 crop. If , in the meantime, the board considers that he should be relieved of the whole or any part of his liability, the Minister' has power to relieve him to that extent.",60
184,Mr STEWART,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Is it possible for the board to insist on payment from the proceeds of the 1925 crop?,60
185,Mr ATKTNSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,No . The clause is clear on that point. Olause agreed to. Clause. 3 (Board to deal with applications for release).,60
186,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Hunter) [10.46] - I should not have risen but for the Minister's statement that the board will not cost more than £250. That statement is a reflection on the intelligence of honourable members. The bill provides for a board of three.,60
187,Mr ATKINSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Tw o of them will be departmental officers.,60
188,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The men must be paid. The sum of £250 will not pay the .salaries of men who will be required to deal with probably 4,500 cases.",60
189,Mr FOSTEE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,The board will not deal with each individual case.,60
190,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"It will have to deal with every application that is made. Advances have been made to growers, and each still owes a certain, amount. The procedure set out in the bill is much the same as that for dealing with matters brought before a law court. case, the board will not be able to deal with all these applications in a few months, and I refuse to accept the Minister's statement that it will not cost more than' £ 2 5 0 .",60
191,Mr COOK,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Indi ) [10.48] - Is the Minister willin g that the board should be reduced to one member? One capable business man would give greater satisfaction than would a board of three.,61
192,Mr STEWART,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Wimmera) [10.49] I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that the Minister's estimate is altogether too low. The proposed new sub-section 1 0 j readsA gVower who has not received from the proceeds of the sale of his dried fruits produced in the year One thousand nine hundred and twenty-five an amount sufficient to repay any advance made to him under this Act and provide for the maintenance of himsviii and his family, may apply to the board, on of before the first day of September One thousand nine hundred and twenty-six, for release, either wholly or in part, from his indebtedness in respect of the advance. That gives the grower an invitation to apply to the board for relief. The Minister admitted that every grower of lexias and currants had-suffered heavy loss. That being so, every such grower will be an applicant under this bill ; and he will be able to prove that he has made a loss. The proposed new sub-section 1 0 K (2) providesThe board may, if it thinks fit, defer the making of a report under the last preceding sub-section in respect of any grower until the proceeds of the sale of the dried fruits produced by that grower during the years One thousand nine hundred and twenty-six and One thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven are ascertained. That means that the board will remain in existence u n t i l the proceeds of the crop are ascertained. It therefore practically three years' l if e assured. The of the correctness of the proposed new sub-section 1 0 L readsNotwithstanding anything contained in Act the Minister may, upon receipt of a report from the board appointed under this Act, lease any grower either wholly or in part' from his indebtedness in respect of an advance supplied. made to him under this Act. Here again is an invitation to the growers. In view of the Minister's mission that every grower of currants and lexias suffered heavy losses, every such grower would be foolish riot to apply for relief. I suggest that the GovernI n any ment should f r a n k ly recognize the position of the growers of currants and lexias, and wipe out the advances made to them. If that ' were done, the board would deal with the sultana growers only. The position would be met by arranging for those who can to repay their advances from the proceeds of their 1926 and 1927 crops. U n less something in this direction is done, the board will remain in operation for a long time.",61
193,Mr ATKINSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Member s of the board will be paid only when working.,61
194,Mr STEWART,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The board will be working for a long time. If , when its work is completed, its members send in an account for £250 only, I should be glad to know its personnel.",61
195,Mr ATKINSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,They could get through the packing sheds much of the information required.,61
196,Mr STEWART,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The board will be unable to deal with individual cases through the packing sheds. The individual grower, and not the packing shed, must, under the bill, apply to the board for any relief desired. I urge the Minister to report progress, so that my suggestion may be considered.",61
197,Mr ATKINSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Wilmot-Honorar y Minister) [10.55] - The statement which I have already made should answer the objections, of honourable members. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr . Stewart) has suggested that the advances made to the growers of currants and lexias should be wiped of f ; but I cannot see why a man who is in a position to do so should not be required to repay the advances made to him. If all these growers have made losses, the granting of 1927 relief to them should be a matter re has quiring very little time. I am satisfied estimate of the cost of the board, provided that the growers do their part in supplying inforthis mation.

This appears to be an innocent measure, but it may cost the country 720 Dried Fruits [REPRESENTATIVES.] more than the Minister .predicts. I canthe not accept his statement that the board will not cost more than £250; on the trary, it will probably cost many thousciently ands of pounds. I base that estimate my experience of a number of boards.",61
199,Mr FOSTEB,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"I have had experience of boards, but I do not think the honourable member's estimate is correct.",62
200,Mr ATKINSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,It will be a departmental board.,62
201,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"It s members will have to be paid, and, as they will have to visit four States, their travelling penses will be considerable. The suggesthree. tion of the honourable member for Wimmera, who is conversant with every detail of the fruit-growing industry, one. To postpone this matter now would not delay the business of the committee. If a board is appointed to deal with all these cases, the time occupied will probably be two or three years.",62
202,Mr FOSTEE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Nonsens e !,62
203,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The bill provides for two years. If any applications made the board must deal with them, and I cannot accept the view that it can deal to the growers. with them in a few weeks. My experience of similar boards is that they not work very rapidly. In any do not approve of a board of three, and I think that one man could do the work the Mr. satisfactorily. One efficient officer be able to deal with the matter even more satisfactorily than a board of three members. He would only have to elicit the facts and make a recommendation as to the relief to be granted. The Minister would be well advised to report progress at this stage. When he informs me that £250 would cover the expense of the posed board, I can only say that it against common sense to believe such statement. If one application were cover everything, the expense might not be great, but provision is made in the bill for over 4,000 separate applications. The honourable member for Wimmera great knows more about the frui t industry than do many other honourable members, ancl the Minister would be well advised to consider his request.  with other honourable members, that the proposed board is likely to be found cumbersome. One efficient officer visiting Advances Bill. settlements and investigating applications for relief in a sympathetic manconner would carry out the work more effithan a board of three.

204,Mr FOSTER,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Wakefield) [11.3] - I hope that progress will not be reported .until the committee has dealt with the appointment of the proposed board. It is utter nonsense to say that the growers would prefer a board of one, who would exbe a departmental officer, to a board of",62

206,Mr FOSTER,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Yes .,62
207,Mr STEWART,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,Where is that stated in the bill ?,62
208,Mr FOSTER,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,I am going by what the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) said.,62
209,Mr ATKINSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"I said that the third are member would be a person outside the department, because that would be fairer",62
210,Mr STEWART,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"The honourable gentledo man did not say that he would be apcase, I pointed by the growers. ATKINSON - I do not say that growers would have the selection of should the third member of the board.",62
211,Mr FOSTER,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"I sincerely hope that the growers will have one representative on the board. I remember that on a board appointed to deal with applications for seed wheat, the wheat-farmers were represented. In some places there would probe only half a dozen fruit-growers, and is it would not be necessary that the whole a of the members of the board should visit to such places. I am. surprised that there should be any haggling over this matter when it should be put in hand at once. I do not think the board would entail expense, but whatever the expense, forit should be faced, and that is a matter the Government. I protest against further delay, because from one end of the Murray to the other, the growers of these fruits want this matter settled as early as possible.",62
212,Mr KILLEN,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON OVERSEAS,"Riverina) [11.8] - I too should like to support what was said by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) with regard to the advisability of reporting progress at this stage. It would be a mistake to pass the clause as it stands. I agree with the view that the proposed board would cost a great deal more than the Minister anticipates. Instead of costing £250 it is more likely to cost £2,500. I believe that the cost of the appointment of the board might be avoided altogether if the suggestion of the honourable member for Wimmera were adopted and the indebtedness of all growers of lexias and currants wiped out altogether. If a board is appointed, it is certain that that is what it will' recommend. Progress reported. House adjourned at 11.10 p.m.",62
