OATTS,-*-During the very expert, it was stated that there is a danger of pests, from which Australia is now free, being imported from other countries with cotton seed. As we are on the eve of developing the culture of cotton, I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he will take immediate steps to prevent the introduction of cotton seed that is not free from pests and diseases ?",19
2,Mr GEEENE,Unknown,"Action has been already taken by my Department to that end, and no cotton seed can be imported except with the permission cf the Government, and then it must be planted within the quarantined area.

An arrangement was made from it up to date? between the Commonwealth and State Governments to have these mental cases segregated at Mont Park, and treated, not as ordinary inmates of a lunatic asylum, but as men afflicted by war 6er- . vice. Some 700 cases have been dealt with, and I am very pleased to be able say that iri^a great majority of the cases th© treatment has been satisfactory, not more than about 107 men will remain permanently in the institution. We have practically completed an arrangement under which these will always remain segregated as men who lost their reason through war - service. TATTERSALL'S SWEEPS.",21

Sir JOSEPH COOK^The question should be put to the Postmaster-General. No doubt the honourable member will find many anomalies of a similar kind should he look far enough. We cannot pretend to rectify them all, and in the meantime Navy, upon noticewe need all the revenue that we can get.",21
21,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,This is the second owing evasion of the question. Later :,21

26,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Will the Acting to Prime Minister make available for the perusal of honourable members copies of and the'British Army Act?,21
27,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am afraid I cannot do so. I understand that there are some copies available in the Library, but that. there is not in Australia a sufficient number to enable every honourable member to be supplied with a copy. I do not know very much about the Act, I am told it is a library in itself, and that' to reprint it would, therefore, insweeps-, volve great cost.",21

32,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"for Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN) asked the Minister for the 1. Is it a fact that much, distress exists to the dismissal of nearly all the men at Cockatoo dockt 2. If so, as it is reported that the manager has stated that there is plenty of useful employment waiting to be done to complete necessary work there, will the Minister obtain sanction from the Treasury to have this work carried out without delay, so as to relieve any existing distress?",21
33,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It has been reported that considerable distress exists in Sydney owing to unemployment, but this cannot be attributed solely to the dismissal of men from the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. 2. The whole question of shipbuilding at Cockatoo Island is under consideration, and it is hoped that construction will be resumed as soon as existing circumstances permit. CHILD ENDOWMENT.",22
34,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the child endowment applies to employees in the Government industrial undertakings and those employed on the temporary stalls in the various Government offices? 2. If the endowment is not conceded to such employees, why not?",22
35,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Child endowment is not applied to employees in Government industrial undertakings or to temporary employees paid under outside trade awards. 2. It is not considered that the principle is applicable to industrial undertakings, &c., where the conditions must approximate to those observed in outside industries. LIMITATION OF PROFITS: REFERENDUM.",22

38,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the Government has yet received its quota of the profits in connection with the wool-top operations in association with Messrs. V. W. Hughes and Company? 2. Whether the profits of the Federal Gor vernment amounted to £500,000? 3. What profits did the company named make in connection with the same transaction which was arranged by the Prime Minister? 4. What quantity of wool was dealt with, and what was the value of same in its raw state?",22
39,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Inquiries are being made in connection with this matter, and a further reply will be furnished to the honourable member as soon as possible. NA AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE ACT.",22
40,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Is it a fact that under the British Army Act and the Australian Defence Act officers simply fill in a form but do not take the oath of allegiance to His Majesty the King, and that non-commissioned officers and men must take the oath? 2. Is it a fact that during the great war the Army regulations were altered to permit of men saluting officers with either the right or the left hand, a privilege previously permitted only to officers? 3. Is it a, fact that this practice was altered in Australia by promulgation of Commonwealth regulations as extracts from the British Army Act? 4. In view of the case of Captain E. Edwards (Eichengrun) and others, will the Minister issue instructions to make the present procedure .democratic by compelling all members of the Defence Forces (Military and Naval) to take the same oath without any differentiation ?",22
41,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. No, but an amendment to the King's Regulations provided for the right-hand salute on all occasions except when impossible through physical incapacity, when the lefthand salute is to be given. 3. The Australian Regulations were amended : to qonform with the King's Regulations in this respect 4. No. The oath of allegiance forms part of the oath of enlistment to serve for a definite period, while an officer is not required to enlist and holds the King's Commission. E'XPOR TOFMETALS : EMBARGO .",22
42,Mr BLAKELEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice Whether it is a fact that there is an embargo on the exportation of metals; and, if so, what metals are affected, and to what extent?",22
43,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The proclamais tion under the Customs Act prohibiting the exportation of metals without the sent of the Minister for Trade and clip Customs is still in force, but consent granted in every ease where the contract relating to the sale of the metals has been registered with the Australian Metal Exchange. MINISTERIA L STATEMENT. FINANCE, ""WHEAT, AND WOOL. Debate resumed from 4th May (vide page 8064), on motion by Mr HUGHESThat the following paper be printed:-Woo l - Resolution s of a meeting of wool-growers held at Parkes, New South Wales, on the 23rd April, 1921, with reference to the wool-growing industry.",23
44,Mr RILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"South Sydney) [2.47] This question has been discussed at such length that the debate has lost some of its interest, and it is somewhat to be regretted that it was opened before the Government were ready to submit to the House the substantive resolutions by which they intend to give effect to the scheme. The whole subject, however, is of so much importance, and involves to such an extent the prosperity of Australia, that I do not think it can be said that there has been any waste of time in dealing with it as we have done during the last few days. When we recall the fact that 80,000 people in-Australia are engaged in the production of wool, and that thousands of others axe employed in the handling of it, we must recognise that anything that would detrimentally affect our wool trade would re-act upon the whole community. I am pleased that the question has not been discussed in a party spirit. We are all anxious to do what is best in the interests of the country, and we have to consider what is the most desirable method to adopt. Having followed the discussion very closely, I am inclined to think that the Government should take a bold stand and deal promptly and effectively with the whole question. Bawra proposes that the number of'bales of new wool sent out of this country shall be limited in proportion to the number of bales of carry-over wool sold in the Old Country. The mountain of wool that has accumulated is the stumbling block, but the Government proposal not to reduce it immediately, but to control the quantity leaving Australia. conThat is to say, that for one bale of new wool sold in Great Britain, two bales is of Bawra will be sold, and we will gradually accumulate here a mountain of wool",23
45,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Simultaneously three bales of the new wool will be sold in Australia.,23
46,Mr RILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,You expect that three bales of new wool will be sold here?,23
47,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Yes .,23
48,Mr RILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I submit that that is not the way to get rid of the mountain of wool.,23
49,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Altogethe r there will be two bales of Bawra wool for four bales of new wool.,23
50,Mr EILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,We are told that Australia is going to suffer because we have overproduced wool. We might as well say that there is going to be a famine because we have overproduced wheat. It is an absurd argument in a country like this that overproduction can cause disaster.,23
51,Mr HAY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The wheat-grower has had 5s. per bushel paid to him as a guarantee.,23
52,Mr RILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I understand that, .and I also understand that the greater part of the Bawra wool has all been paid for here, so that there is no great difference.",23
53,Mr HAT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Yes , there is, with the current crop and the carry-over.",23
54,Mr RILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"All the black clouds painted by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) and other speakers disappear on examination. The wool-growers of the country have been paid for their wool at a price 50 per cent, oyer the pre-war rate.",23
55,Mr ATKINSON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Not for the current crop.,23
56,Mr EILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"But we are now talking of the Bawra wool, and we see"" that the pastoralists are not so badly affected as we were led to believe. They have been paid for their old wool, and they have a new crop which they wish to be paid for. In the case of the Bawra wool in London the wool-growers here will receive half the receipt of the sales, so that no matter what happens the squatters and the wool-growers will gradually be recouped any losses caused by the drop in price. Of course, I know that the Government have power to prevent the free export of commodities if their exportation would tend to injure the country; but I cannot see how free exportation can injure us. Of course, it may reduce the price of wool on the London market, but, according to the cables this . morning, there has been a recovery, and an increase of from 7-J per cent, to 10 per cent, in the price in the last day or two. In my opinion, the best method of getting rid of the Bawra wool would be to take it out of the market, if an arrangement to do so can be made with the British Government. My idea is that the Prime Minister should negotiate with the British Government with a view of saving the market by removing this wool from sale for two years. The Bawra wool in London is of a very inferior quality, the "" eyes "" having been "" picked out"" of it ; consequently, it can be bought in Great Britain for £5 per bale, and it would only require £4,000,000' to acquire the interest of the British Government, and give us complete control. If we hold it for two months or even six months, the cloud will still remain , over us, and may seriously affect - the whole of th© wool industry. If , . on the other hand, it was known that the Australian people had control of the wool, and had made arrangements for paying for it by debentures, as suggested by the - honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham), all would be well until the market' developed. I know this is a "" large order,"" but there are when one must take large risks. In this case, however, I think there is really no risk at all, because we have the value there, and, in my opinion, the whole of the wool-growers would agree to the suggestion that has been made. A sum of £4,000,,000 is amere bagatelle when in the balance against the prosperity of the country. I believe the British Government would take debentures, and that would give us a free market, and provide employment throughout the whole of Australia. It has been suggested in some quarters that we should try to get rid of the wool by selling it to Germany and other late enemy countries. The war is now over, and we are victorious, and T do not see that we should stand back and refuse to trade with our late enemies. According to the Treasurer (Sir Joseph [330] Cook), when he was in Europe, he saw Germans without any woollen garments; as a matter of fact, there is a famine oft wool in Germany; and we have an abundance. I do not think we should be so narrow-minded as to refuse to sell this commodity to the German people; in any case, the time is coming when we shall quickly have to trade with them.",23
57,Mr FRANCIS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"""We sold them our wheat.",24
58,Mr EILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Then why not our wool?,24
59,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,We are selling Germany our wool at the present time.,24
60,Mr EILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I believe the whole of the German people would be glad if they could trade; and why not, if they are prepared to turn our wool into manufactured articles, and to pay for the wool in a few months'' time ?",24
61,Mr FOWLER,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The United States is sending large quantities of cotton to Germany for manufacture.,24
62,Mr EILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The United States is taking a sensible course. The Prime Minister ought to be instructed or requested to enter into negotiations which, would have the effect of enabling us to dispose of our wool, on terms, to Germany and Austria. It is said that if we do this our late enemies will send their manufactured commoditie's into our local market.",24
63,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That is the.trouble.,24
64,Mr EILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"It is, but I feel confident that it will be some years before times Germany will be able to ' supply the demands of her own people. We could let them have the wool on long-dated debentures, at current rates of interest, though I would be prepared to make the stipulation that they 6hould supply no manufactured articles to any of the Allied countries. However, we must get rid of the wool, for so long as we have these large stocks in Great Britain and Australia there is a danger of the market being manipulated. It is suggested that the scheme proposed by the Government be carried out under the Customs regulalations, and the Treasurer read one section, empowering the Government to prohibit any export trade which would prove to the injury of the Comonwealth. I have yet to learn, however, that the export of wool can injure the Commonwealth. Only by a wide stretch of the imagination can we believe that the Commonwealth will be benefited by the prevention of exp o r t . I believe that such a course would be injurious to the country. I am afraid that the growers who do not wish to enter into this scheme and are opposbd to the stoppage of export will be sacrificed by the financial institutions. If I were .a grazier and did not desire to join Bawra., but wished to get rid of my wool in my own way, I would have no guarantee that I would be allowed to export my wool, and the banks would not lend me money on it because they would say that it was worth nothing if it could not be realized. In that way many men might be ruined simply because they do not believe in joining this scheme. Export is to be permitted only by a permit from the Customs Department, but who is to decide whether a permit is to be issued? Will the decision rest with Bawra or the Minister, for Trade and Customs, or the .Government? ' Those are details which the House is entitled to know. I am afraid that if any restriction is placed on the export of wool by growers who do not join the B.awra scheme there will be a disastrous financial crisis. Of course, if men were guaranteed the right to export their wool independent of Buwra the wh61e scheme would collapse, but the men who are not in the scheme must be protected, and they have a right to loob to Parliament for the safeguarding of their interests. We are told that a large number ,of growers do not favour this scheme. There may be only a few who will hold aloof from it, but they are entitled to protection, and I hope tha*. the Minister will explain what that protection is to be. If an independent grower is offered more than the price fixed by Bawra, must he get a permit from the Customs Department or Bawra before he can sell overseas? Surely if a man is able to sell special quality wool at a price higher than the fixed average he should be allowed to sell where he likes - But there is no protection for him.",24
65,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I think there is.,25
66,Mr RILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I should like to have that point elucidated. It is said Bawra will look after the interests of whole of the producers. What secondary industries - fellmongering; scouring, and wool top manufacturing? . Mr JOWETT - The honourable member .remembers what I .said about those industries.",25
67,Mr RILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The honourable member is on the. Central Wool Committee, and I believe he means what he says, but I have had some experience of the Cen'.ral Wool . Committee, and I remember when it tied up the fellmongering and wool top industries in my electorate for six or seven months on account of a dispute. I am afraid that under this Bawra scheme 1 those secondary industries will run a similar risk. They should be protected. Mr JOWETT.;- I quite agree with the honourable member.",25
68,Mr RILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The honourable member said last week that fellmongeredwool should be freely exported.,25
69,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Why fellmongered wool more than any other?,25
70,Mr RILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Because more labour has been employed upon it, and it is therefore more valuable, and also because we should try to keep our secondary industries going. In any case the fellmongered wool is a very rsmall proportion of the total production. Mr FLEMING. - Is not labour employed in shearing the wool-.?",25
71,Mr RILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Yes , but by the time it has reached the stage of wool tops a great deal more labour has been put ir. to it, and both the machinery and th-^ labour employed are expensive. It would be disastrous to have those works idle.",25
72,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I quiteagree with the honourable member.,25
73,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The secondary - industries enhance the value of the wool.,25
74,Mr RILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That is another reason why that wool should not be tied up until liberated at the will of any committee.,25
75,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Top e are made of shorn wool as' well as of fellmongered wool.,25
76,Mr RILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I admit that. Hundreds of men are out of employment in my electorate through the absence of any stability in the wool industry. I understand that the Government scheme is to restrict export of wool for a period of six months. Why should the period be limited in that way ? Why cannot the Government make some arrangement that will stabilize conthat ditions some years ahead? Any restricthe tion on the wool trade will be detrimental of to the neople. I had intended to say a good deal more, but I shall defer my further remarks until the - Government have submitted a concrete proposal. I am glad this debate has taken place, because it has shown the importance of the wool in dustry, the existing danger to the community, and the necessity for doing something that will stabilize wool production and manufacture and keep our people employed. Any scheme that will effect that will have the endorsement of the people and this House. I feel confident that if the matter were lef t in the hands of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), with instructions to get r i d of the Bawra wool in Britain , he could do it easily; money would not be required, because debentures could be issued, and the British Government would be only too pleased to accept them in order to be quit of the wool difficulty. I shall await the disclosure of the Government's proposals, which I shall examine carefully to see that they guarantee protection to the secondary industries in my electorate and elsewhere.",25
77,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Robertson) [3.8] Now, before the Government submit concrete proposals, is the time for honourable members to express their opinions, and therefore I take this opportunity of. stating my views upon this very important matter. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) before departing for Europe made a Parthian shot-on e might almost call it a jeremiad:-whic h has certainly created a great deal of unrest throughout Australia, and something must be done in this debate to allay it . We cannot overlook the fact that the financial position of Australia is such as to cause a certain amount of misgiving. The Prime Minister told us that the commitments of the Commonwealth Government f b r the pre6ent financial year amount to £98,000,000. I wonder how many people realise that that represents more than le. per 'day for every man, woman, and child in the community, "" merely for the expenditure of this Parliament, and apart from the expenditure of the State ments and other commitments. This financial welter has been made infinitely worse by the statements of the Prime Minister, but other people who are equally well informed, and possibly better in formed, take a much more hopeful view. Here is an extract from a statement made by people who are well qualified to express an opinion on the financial condition of AustraliaThere are signs that money is more plentiful, as a result, no doubt, of the Federal dis[330]- 2 bur.sement of nearly £16,000,000 to last seaBon's, wheat-growers; but the depressed state of the market for wool, meat, hides, and metals has caused some uneasiness in the minds of those who have money to invest. The fear of English labour disturbances, too, has been an important factor in restricting the flow of money to the Stock Exchange; but the likelihood of a general strike in Great Britain is now happi.ly over, and the commercial situation appears at the moment to be more cheer-"" ful than for months past. Of course, it is too early as yet to predict .an improvement, but there are certainly grounds for hoping that matters are on the mend. The most notable' sign of a cheering character is the re-appearance-for the first time since the Armisticeof buyers of wool for Central Europe. Before the war, Germany and Austria were very large importers of our wool, which they would export again in the form of manufactured articles of all descriptions, and the quantity they could buy depended, not so much on what was required for their own use as the extent of their ability to re-export manufactured goods to other countries. But since the war Central Europe has been in ""a state of virtual bankruptcy; having little or nothing to expqrt, they have not even been able to buy from other countries the material they sorely need for their own consumption.",26
78,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,They were not prevented from buying in Australia.,26
79,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"But the Prime Minister placed an embargo on our export tq Germany. It was childish, once we demanded reparation, to say that we proposed to restrict trade with Germany. In the early stages of and righ t through the war I was opposed to indemnities and trade with Germany. But if we have the one we. must have the other. It would be disastrous for - this outlying country, which lives by producing Taw products, to demand reparation and indemnities, as it has' done, and then say that it, alone amongst the comity of nations w i ll not trade with its late enemies.",26
80,Mr GABB,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I am pleased to see that Parlia- the honourable member has been converted.,26
81,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I am stating what I have always stated. Without demanding indemnities we need not have traded with. Germany, but, having once demanded reparation, we must trade with that country. As soon as the Allies stated that they intended to extract indemnities, we, in common with the rest of the world, ought to have commenced trading with the powers fro m whom those indemnities were sought.",26
82,Mr JH CATTS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Half-a-doze n Prime Ministers could not make a financial crisis in Australia.,27
83,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,On e Prime Minister has almost done so.,27
84,Mr JH CATTS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"No , he has not; although his statement"" was one of the most damaging ever heard in this country.",27
85,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"He has done his best to do so. His statement on leaving, made exactly at the wrong time, has undoubtedly had an ill-effect on the finances of Australia. He said, "" I have spent the money; the Government have committed the country to an enormous expenditure, greater than ever known before, but now that trouble is coming I aim getting out from under. You people must face it . "" The other day, the Honorary Minister (Mr Rodgers) took up a somewhat similar attitude. We were saying that returned soldiers had not received reasonable treatment, and he said, "" I am not to blame; I have spent all the money."" One would think that the spending of money - was all that was required.",27
86,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I said nothing of the kind.,27
87,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That is the Minat ister's statement as it appears in Hanquoted sard, in the report of my speech.",27
88,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I am sure it is not.,27
89,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The position of the Minister and the Government is exactly that of a man who was employed by the overseer'on a station to make some gates. He had a good deal of material to work on, and the overseer, when he returned in the evening, had a look at the material, and then said to the man, "" You can knock off; you will be paid off in the morning."" The man replied, "" What is little the matter 1 I have been working here day on that material; I have used it all practical experience. up."" "" Yes,"" said the overseer, "" you have used it all up, you have spoilt it The Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers) has spoilt the material he had to work on. Ho has spent the money, but has little to show for it . We have a very poor return for the money spent on repatriation, compared with what we should have. Yesterday the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook), who was endeavourtime ing to convince the House that the per course to adopt was to carry out the proposal to prohibit the export of wool except at a certain price, must have been speaking very much against his convictions. Fundamental economic laws cannot be operated in the way suggested without courting disaster. Knowing the right honourable gentleman as I do, I was very much impressed with the manner in which he was battling against the stream. We may be in difficulties, but surely we are not going to jettison all those basic principles for which we have fought., which have made the Empire and Australia what they are today, and which make for the stability of any country? Therefore, if he will allow me to say so, I pitied the right honourable gentleman when I heard him making statements which I knew were against those principles he has always so worthily upheld. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), following the Acting Prime Minister, told us that the number of sheep in Australia had' not fallen off to the extent to which some claimed they had, and he quoted figures which, up to a certain point, were correct, but stopped the wrong year. The last period he was 1918,, and he told us that there were 87,000,000 sheep in Australia in that year. As a matter of fact, the number dropped to 75,000,000 in the following year, and, so far as I can gather, at the present time it is between 70,000,000 and 80,000,000. It is very difficult to get at the exact figures for the present year. Most people are under the impression that the clip per sheep has increased to a great extent, but they are mistaken. Statistics show that the yield today is a less per head than it was four years all ago. The reason is plain to any man with We have had a succession of bad years., and in bad years . "" the heavy carrying sheep always die most freely, because the more wool a sheep carries the less able it is to withstand the effects of drought. For that reason, the yield per head has decreased, and as the numbers have also diminished to a large extent, the wool production of Australia is now by no means what it was five years ago. Yesterday we were told that the graziers of Australia have had such a good that they can put up with some of prothe losses they aro likely to sustain through the Bawra scheme. A leading newspaper of Melbourne has repeated the statement this morning. It is true that, as a whole, the graziers have had a reasonably good time in the matter of prices; but in many cases this has been counterbalanced by losses in sheep and stock generally. I could multiply by scores the instances quoted last night by the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) as to the number of individuals who have had very severe checks.. In some cases, men have suffered extreme losses. One small owner of sheep who started about three yearsago with 6,,000 sheep spent £4,000 in purchasing fodder for them, and thus managed to save 2,000 head. To-day those sheep are worth, at the outside, not more than £2,000, or half the amount the owner spent .in keeping them alive. It cost him £400 to shear those sheep, and now he cannot sell their wool. This Parliament talks of preventing him from selling it unless he will accept the price which it proposes to fix. I admit that it is unusual for the shearing of 2,000 sheep to cost as much as £400, but cases of extreme hardship make it altogether unknown. This man, and others, must Tealize on their wool to carry on. In many instances men have lost all their sheep. I know a man in the electorate of Gwydir who bred a flock for thirty-three years and lost every head of them; an excellent flock, as good as man could look for. He has no wool to sell except that from some inferior * sheep which he has since bought. He must get money to carry on. Will this Parliament prevent him, and others like him, from doing so? Speaking generally, the pastoralists have had good times owing to the high prices of wool; but there are many cases of hardship, and we should see that men are not mined.",27
90,Mr FRANCIS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Does the honourable member think that these wool producers would get more for their wool if the Government proposals were not passed than they would get under the proposed restrictions ?,28
91,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"In . my opinion, the best plan to adopt is to allow the disposal of the BaWra wool in Europe, if possible to those nations which were our enemies and which are now destitute of wool. Every one who has studied the situation knows that the people of Central Europe are in rags, and need wool; that if they get it they will work day and night to bring it into use. Once they, have made it into clothing, this will wear out, and more wool will be required by them. Thus this mountain of wool of which we hear so much will speedily disappear.",28
92,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Do not the Bawra directors know these things?,28
93,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I believe them to be a capable lot of men with a wide knowledge; but having evolved this scheme, they are more concerned for the Bawra wool than for the free wool.",28
94,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,No .,28
95,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"My remark applies, not to the Central Wool Committee, but to the Bawra Wool Committee. This scheme is their baby; they are interested in seeing it carried through. We have to take up the cudgels on behalf of those in Australia who desire a free market to enable them to carry on. If the Bawra wool were sold to Central Europe, on terms, if necessary, we could have a free market for our own wool here. Last night the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) suggested that the mark should be stabilized, not at 240, its current rate, but at 60, and that our wool should be sold on that basis. That suggestion was a blot on an otherwise excellent speech. If we stabilize the mark at 60 for the realization of our products, while it remains at 240 for every other purpose, we shall be selling our wool at one-fourth of its value. In other respects, the honourable member's scheme seemed to meet the situation better than any other that has been advanced here. The Bawra wool has been paid for so far as Australia is concerned, and anything that we may get out of it will be profit. But Great Britain still has to get her price for it . If she disposes of it to Central Europe"" on terms, that will, of course, create difficulties for her. Naturally she wants a profit out of it , and she would be inclined to say that it should not be used to compete with her own manufacturers. That is quite reasonable. The position is a difficult one; but something might be done to bring about the manufacture of this wool in Central European countries, and its use there. It is only by selling wool at a cheap rate to get it into use and to get"" it worn out that we shall be able to dispose of the increasing production throughout the world. During the past few years there has been a decrease in production, but? from now onwards production will probably increase. The people of the United States of America are doing all they can to get their cotton goods iuto use. They are sending raw cotton to European countries, and are disposing of it to the starv- qualities ?. ing people's there on long terms, so that they may absorb it. Are we going to allow that cotton to oust OUT wool? During the war millions learned to use wool who had never used it before, and we should see that they continue to use it. We do not wish them to fall back to the use of cotton. The world has become accustomed to a better standard of clothing, and it will be to our profit in maintain that standard. If the Bawra wool is kept off the market to force an extortionate price* American cotton will - take the place of our wool. Different sums have been mentioned during the debate as the cost of producing wool. The honourable member lor Darling, who represents one of the big pastoral constituencies, interjected that wool could be produced for 3d. per lb.",28
96,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I think he said 4d.,29
97,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Eve n that estimate' is' a ridiculous one. No man can say exactly what it costs to produce woolj because: nowhere in Australia do men live wholly on the proceeds of wool. Some men sell wool and fat stock; others sell wool and breed sheep;, others, again, ran horses and cattle .as well as sheep. But beforethe war our wool was sold on an average of a little over £10 per bale, or at about 8d. per lb., and we know that in those days wool just about paid its cost, with very little over. But it must be remembered that land was not so dear then, that wages were not so high,, and, more portant still; that the taxation was not so heavy. To-day it would be impossible to produce wool for as little as it cost ten years ago; and it is evident that we could not produce it for an average price of 8d. per lb. In my opinion, it would be wise for Bawra to fix its minimum for the held-over wool at at least no more than Sd. We have been told that the best wool has been sold, and it is reasonable to think that. Therefore, what remains is, on the whole, inferior. Some of it has been in. the bales long enough to deteriorate. As those who have had to do with greasy wool know, such wool takesno harm for the first couple of years; but if it is kept baled up longer than that itdeteriorates-. There is little doubt that the Bawra wool is not in as good condition now as when it was shorn.",29
98,Mr MAXWELL,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Does it include all,29
99,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Yes ; all classes of wool grown in Australia. But probably more of the good wool than of the inferior wool has been sold, so that 8d. is a high value for what remains.",29
100,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That is the average, price.",29
101,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,It is to be the flat rate. But all the wool in. Bawra is not Australia to of fair average quality.,29
102,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Then 8d. will not be asked for it. It will be sold for less.,29
103,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"If there is to be a flat rate, it will include all the wool in. Bawra.",29
104,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The flat rate under thei appraisement scheme was 15£d - per lb.,, but some of the wool was sold for aslittle, as 2£d. per lb., and some at nearly 40d. per lb. The same thing will occurin regard to the Bawra wool. The price. of the wool that was left, over will, when, put up for sale, be just half what it would have been under the old arrangement.",29
105,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"If all the good, wool were left in Bawra, the pricewould, be reduced, by one-half, but. as a .bigger proportion of - good wool than of inferior wool has been sold, if the flat rate is 8d., the reduction will not be one-half. Sup^ pose that, originally, Bawra wool was. half good, and half inferior,, it may be assumed that 25 per cent, of the 50 per oent. of good wool has been sold, making what remains one-third good. wool. and. two-thirds inferior wool. If you fix a. imflat rate of 8d. for the whole lot,, you do not reduce the price by one-half.",29
106,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That is not proposed.,29
107,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The general impression is that 8d. will be charged for the 1 wool now in Bawra. The people outside believe that a flat rate is to be charged for all that wool.,29
108,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That is not intended. 1 Mr FLEMING. - If what is intended is a. reduction of price by nearly one-half.,, it is quite probable that we shall be able to sell the Bawra wool, because it will really be offered at 6d. or 7d., or even 5d., at which price it should compete' successfully with wool from other countries. But if we' fix prices above a low margin, we may lose trade, to the^advanlage of South Africa and other woolgrowing countries. Much idle talk has - been indulged in about our importance as a wool-growing country. Australia produces only from 20 per^ cent, to 25 per cent, of the wool of the world. All the talk we - have heard in regard to our cornering the market is simply foolishness. It .is within my own personal knowledge that the stoppage of the wool sales here .during the last - three months 'has .driven buyers .to other countries. .If - we continue to carry on in this way, and fix the price of wool here above the rate ruling in the markets of the world, we shall drive away still more of our trade. It is absolutely essential that we shall arrange .sales of wool to the Central European Powers in order to relieve us of the tremendous ""bur-den which Bawra now holds. It is also essential that we shall allow our people to sell their wool here, as they produce it , at a reasonable rate. In so far as sales go we have had good times. Our wool has not been sold at the price - which should have been obtained for it ; but, on the whole, we have had satisfactory 6alesNow that the market has fallen we have to take 'the bad with the good, but if - we stand up against eternal principles «our wool market will suffer, not for - one or two years, but. for eight or ten - years. Unless the Bawra wool is absorbed there will 'be no chance 'of buyers coming here to take away our wool as they have in the past. We have ""established quite a good trade here in Australia, and in that way, our Protectionist friends will be pleased to know, have been spending our money in our own country. Buyers have been coming here instead of making .purchases overseas. But if under this new scheme we prohibit the sale of wool here below a certain price, buyers will leave for other countries. Some have already left, and more are thinking of leaving. If we impose restrictions .on our wool sales here we shall spoil Australia's .reputation as a wool-selling centre.",29
109,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That is not the GovernCentral ment's proposal.,30
110,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"We do not know yet what the Government's proposal is. am, therefore, getting in early because .hope that .they will not adopt the Bcheme which has been put forward, and under which the Bawra people are to be free to deal with this wool as they pleasefree to sell it where they like, to control it as they please, to hold it off the market* as long as it is thought desirable; or to hold it as a menace against the wool that may be produced for the next ten years, andmeanwhile an embargo is to be put on the export of our wool. That is not a fair proposition. Unless we dispose of Bawra wool to those who want it today, - and who will quickly wear it out in its manufactured state, and so make a market",30
111,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,We have sold in both Germany and Austria.,30
112,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Quite recently we have sold a little to those countries, but >the sales so made represent but a very small proportion of what were our ordinary sales to them, and are as nothing compared with the accumulation .of wool which exists overseas. It is idle to drag in little issues of that kind with .the object of trying to side track the main issue. We have to face the issue for the ,good of the communitv, for the stability of Australia, as well as in the interests of .the one industry which above all others has built up this Commonwealth. Honourable members may talk of what is going on here, but the one thing that has kept Australia solvent is her wool. Yet we have honourable members dealing with - this question today as if it were a matter of no great ;moment to talk of restricting a trade which has made Australia stand in - the eyes of the world as a country worth - coming to in - order to buy one of-the main - raw products of the world.",30
113,Mr MAXWELL,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,What is the honourable member's proposal?,30
114,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I thought I had' made it clear. My proposal is that the wool now held by Bawra should be sold to the Central European countries on the best terms that can b.e made, but always taking into account the fact that Great Britain must not be allowed to lose her trade because of the manufactures of Europe. Surely some scheme can be devised which would keep for use in those countries the goods made from the ' I wool that we supply. There is a keen I demiand for such 'goods there. There is a igreat shortage-= a gap which it will take some time to fill up, and the filling up of which should absorb by far the greater portion of Bawra wool. While thus disposing of that wool we could at the same time dispose of our own free wool on the open market. Many suggestions have been put forward. One of them is that we should destroy Bawra wool, but such a proposal is repugnant to all humanitarian instincts.",30
115,Mr BELL,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Who made that proposal?,31
116,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"It has been made, not in the House, but in Australia. Mr BELT' - But by whom?",31
117,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The suggestion appeared in print more than once.,31
118,Mr BELL,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I have heard it said it might pay to destroy the Bawra wool, but no such proposal has actually been of the wool-growers themselves. made.",31
119,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I have more than once seen the suggestion in print terms that it should be destroyed. To do that would be to return .to dark ages. Another scheme is that the wool should be held over. That, too, would be extremely dangerous. If we hold it over, the result will be that facturers will refrain from buying free wool.' What business man would come in and buy our free wool when knew that there were tremendous reserves of Bawra which might be brought into the market at any time? Such a proSome posal is opposed to all business principles. A man would not think of manufacturing goods from our free wool when he knew that at practically any moment the Bawra reserves might be placed on the him. market and that his competitors would be able to come in and buy at rates which would enable them to greatly him? I repeat that the Bawra wool should be absorbed by Central Europe, and that we should leave our people here things. a free market to dispose of the fresh wool. The honourable member for Gramskies, pians (Mr Jowett) will bear me out when I say that the new wool will for naturally bring a little more than Bawra wool.",31
120,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,It is better wool.,31
121,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Yes ; it will be greater demand, since it has more life it, is more responsive to treatment, consequently, will make better cloth. In my opinion, there is no occasion for the waitings of the Cassandras of the community. I deprecate the extreme pessimism in which some have indulged. We can weather the storm if we will only set our faces to it and deal with the difficulties as men should deal with them. We * should not shirk the position. We should rather say that we have had good times, and that we are prepared to realise oh our surplus wool as best we can, not only for our own good, but for the good of suffering millions who are in need of the' commodity. I do not think any one ever goes wrong in following broad principles. has To do so is correct from the point of view of humanity, from the point of that view of our own trade and that of the Empire, as well as from the point of view The only sound course for us to follow is to dispose of the Bawra woofe on the best 1 to those who really need it, leaving our own people free to sell their wool in the the be3t market they can get.",31
122,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Wakefield) [3.43] - It is well that we should clearly understand that the scheme under discusmanusion has been propounded, not by. the our Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) or his Government, but by Bawra; and that no he good purpose can be served by seeking, as some honourable members have done, to depreciate the Prime Minister's efforts. honourable members, and particularly the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming), have gone out of their way to do so. I cannot help remarking the change that has como over",31
123,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,May I tell the honorundersell able member one thing?,31
124,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I shall tell the honourable member two or three When he came back from the war, he lauded the Prime Minister to the and slobbered over him in the most sickly fashion. I am at a loss to account his departure from the attitude which the he took up towards the Prime Minister at the close of the war. It is necessary that we should leave on one side personal matters, so far as the Prime Minister is in concerned, and deal with the subject in under discussion as one that has emanated and from Bawra. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), in his opening sentences, paid 'the very highest compliment to the members of the Central Wool Committee, and to those who are responsible for the Bawra proposal today. was particularly pleased to hear him express the hope that, above all things, this House would not attempt to deal with the business side of the scheme. thought that the Government, or the Parliament, was going to meddle with the general management of this great wool scheme, I would not be a party to it. If there is one point in regard to which there is overwhelming unanimity in Australia, it is in respect of the magnificent services rendered by the Central Wool Committee throughout the war period. Wherever growers meet; one hears nothing but expressions of the utmost gratitudeand it is an appropriate gratitude-for the excellent services which these gentlemen rendered throughout the war without fee or reward. Surely we ought to trust these men whose work in handling the product of the wool-growing industry to the tune of untold millions has been almost faultless, and who, at a time of , financial stringency, helped to keep this country going - I propose, now, to speak very plainly concerning the misrepresentations of this great question by the press. There is no such misrepresentation in my own State; but in this State there has been much advocacy of the secondary industries, and a total forgetfulness of the men who own the wool now under consideration. We were told only the other day, in a section of ""the press, that this scheme was in the interests of the wealthy and influential squatter, and that he was the favoured section of the community. Prom a political point of view, the wealthy and influential squatter does not account for a great many votes, and it is something new to learn that he is popular with politicians or Parliaments. The statement that this scheme is solely in his interest is untrue. A considerable majority of those who hold the wool existing in Australia today are small men. This is merely an experiment, but it is put forward by the best experts in wool, commerce, and finance, and I am therefore going to follow their recommendations. If one section of the community more than another will be benefited by it, it is the struggling, small wool-grower. Further, it will be of inestimable value I to the workers of Australia, as I shall endeavour to show in a few moments. Another objection delicately touched on by the Acting Prime Minister (Sir If I Joseph Cook) is that this scheme cuts into the first principles of economicsthat it is declared to be a mischievous departure, especially by men who are not business men. These are not the exacfJ words of those who raise the objection, but that is their line of reasoning; and 'to use that line of reasoning is to stretch the application of such an argument, when we remember the unique conditions obtaining today. We are told that this industry ought to be left to the people to whom it belongs, and who know most about it ; that they have passed through similar experiences before in the matter of low prices and adverse conditions, and have pulled through. It is true that there have been similar experiences in the past, when, with stocks not so heavy as at the present, and prices as low as id., they did not pull through all right. God knows there was then much misery and destitution, many ruined homesteads in every direction. All in the industry were affected, from the big man_ right down to the small man, and we do not desire a repetition of such experiences. A ll that can be done should be done by this Parliament in the way of affording constitutional power to tide over the present difficulties, without, however, interfering in the management of the business. Experiences such as I have indicated in the past are not known in a State like Victoria. If we desire to realise what then occurred, we must turn our eyes to the large wayback stations in the dry areas. In those days, pastoral areas and stations were thrown up and deserted; and where then there might be seen half-a-dozen stations . there are today only one or two. The Governments of the States in which these conditions prevailed know well what were the results. In order that the deserted areas might be occupied, the State Legislatures have passed Act after Act in the direction of liberalizing the land laws, taking the view that it does not matter what may be realized in the way of rents, so long as there is occupation and settlement. Those with a knowledge of this wool business feel their blood boil when they find newspapers misrepresenting as if it were of importance only wealthy squatters. As to the objection about cutting into the first principles of political economy, we must remember that Australia, and every country in the world, has been ing that right through, the war. The. prebanks sent conditions are an aftermath of the war, and we cannot evade the fact. On previous occasions, we have had stocks greater than the world required, but not of value. to the present extent as the result of. the war and war conditions. the circumstances, surely the Government* is justified in extending assistance which they are. is absolutely essential, assistance which can be given without involving try in any liability except from a constitutional stand-point, at the same time leaving the whole management of the business in the hands of men who know the infinitely more about it than we here or the situation. the general community do. In spiteof what the honourable member for Roberttion son (Mr Fleming) has said ters-possibl y squatters around Toorakthere is a unanimity that is remarkable amongst the wool-growers in desiring Parliament to assent to the request that has come from Sir John Higgins and colleagues. The position is such that is necessary to extend assistance such has been suggested by the Prime Minister, and also by the Acting Prime Minister. we were to take the view that the law of supply and demand should operate undishave turbed we might have a long misery and destitution ahead of us. Then God help the people of the country and vide a minimum? the Government! God help the people on: the land 1",31
125,Mr HILL,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,And also the people off the land ,33

I have had fort y years' experience of country it and way-back life , and I do not know to that I ever found such a rapid transit from a fair amount of prosperity to a really blind end, as I see in the changed conditions of the men who have been in terested in this wool movement - during dothe last two or three months. Ask the or other' financial institutions, and they tell us that they cannot handle this wool industry; that they cannot help it , because there is no value in it-n o basis",33

In my asopinion the market can never satisfactorily be set going u n t i l the European are settled, and im the meantime questhis scheme is proposed and recommended by the highest authorities, ashonorable members admit. It would be criminal on our part as a National Parliament not to take the opportunity presented to us. As I say, we are not in volving ourselves in any liability, but are simply rendering indispensable aid, .and possibly saving the country from disaster. As things are the "" bottom "" may drop out of the market altogether if there is not some control over reserves, and some discrimination in feeding the market. There may be a .temptation and a desire on the part of some men to realise in the absence of this scheme; and, if so, it would be the poor man who would be sacrificed. No doubt the rich man might lose, but the poor man would "" go under."" The scheme proposed will , at all events, relieve the situation, and if it is not adopted, what might happen in the meantime? Stock values would f all and land values follow, as, indeed, they are following. L et any one try to sell a station and see how he gets o n; and these conditions would be felt throughout the community. The Government have a repatriation scheme in volving a liability of millions of pounds, and if something is not done to secure the future of Australia, these Government enterprises may have margin of safety wiped one stroke. It is well, therefore, from the Government point of view, .and from the point of view of the man on the land, to adopt this scheme a3 a measure of safety. I do not regard it as cutting into the first principles of economics. I deplore as much as any man Government meddling with the details of business. Indeed, I hate it ; but there is a big difference between such in terference and the Commonwealth M in istry..seeking to aid the operations of men in the matter of exports by finding .markets for them. I believe that the principle of the scheme is approved by thousands in this country who, in the past, would' have scouted the very idea, it is said that it is a compulsory scheme; but, on the other hand, we are told that from 95 to 98 per cent, of the wool-growers favour it . Where, then, is the compulsion? There is absolutely untrammelled freedom within Australia, and in regard ito the business outside Australia there is simply the one limitation , that the wool must not be sold below an average flat rate of 8d.",33
139,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Whic h is appraised value.,34
140,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That is so. I apologize for taking up so much of honourable members' time, but I feel keenly financial upon this subject; I know what in terests are at stake, and I and my colleagues representing South Australia have been urged to press this matter to an immediate decision. Time is the essence of the contract, and every day that elapses makes the solution of this problem more difficult. Every hour means a serious loss that none of us can possibly estimate. So I ask honourable members to give this scheme their earnest consideration. I hope there will be but one voice and.one feeling on this question, because fro m the industrial point of view, this is a mighty big thing. I do not believe in making extravagant statements, but I know that if some relief is not forthcoming, the lambs in many districts will not be .shorn this year.",34
141,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,It will not pay to shear them.,34
142,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The growers cannot get the money lor continuing the shearing; and for the *ame reason tens of thousands of sheep will probably have to carry two years' fleece. their The flocks cannot be sold - I shall posout in sibly have a chance of debating other points when the Government's motion is before .us, but in the meantime I hope that honourable members will earnestly and unanimously, in the interest of every, section of the community, give support to this proposal of Bawra .that is being submitted by the Government.  [4.8] - So much has been said in regard' to this matter, that the shorter the remaining speeches the better. The name of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has been freely drawn into .the discussion, and there has been a difference of opinion as to whether or not his remarks were calculated to do injur y to this country. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr . Richard Foster) has denied that the statement of the Prime Minister contained m anything of am alarmist character. I thought the reverse. I agree with the honourable member for Robertson (Mr . Fleming). 1",34
143,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Naturally .  - orable member for Robertson is a recent convert to the opponents of the Governhalf the ment. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) said that at one time the honourable member for Robertson used to slobber over the Prime Minister, and now he is kicking him.

144,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"And I would kick him now if he were to do what he did then.  Prime Minister sometimes denies that has changed his convictions, but I leave the interjection of the honourable ber for Wakefield to answer him.",35

I think honarmistice, orable members had better discuss wool.  rate, honours are equal between the orable member for'Wakefield and the honsuch trade. orable member for Robertson. I think that the statement made by the Prime ister may be truly described as alarmist. before Bawra? What other interpretation could be put on his reference to a mountain of wool that wholly. threatens to topple over and crush us ?",35
146,Mr WATKINS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Is it not true?  good to advertise our difficulty to world. We have to find a way out of controlled the wool. the difficulty, and I think the honourable ""member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) will agree that the best thing to do is to our trouble as much as possible while seek for a solution. The honourable memPowers. ber for Robertson suggested that the solution should be the sale of the wool Central Powers. To a certain extent, agree with him.",35
147,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Every one does.  why was this not done twelve months when practically every other country the world was trading with the Central Powers ? The Prime Minister made self conspicuous by declaring that, if we wanted to trade with Germany, the counPrime try would have to find another leader. The honourable member for Robertson followed the Prime Minister in that attiadvice tude, but today he says that the thing to do would be to trade with Gernaturally many and Austria. For the last months we have been living in a fool's pwadise. If twelve months ago the negotiations which have been by the honourable member for Robertson today had been opened up with the Central Powers, we would not now be confronted with this immense accumulation",35
148,Mr BURCHELL,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"On e of the main difficulties all the time has been the question of payment by the Central Powers.  honourable members who now propose to trade with the Central Powers expect to payment? I complain that no endeahe vour was made to find a means of trading with them, as the rest of the world has membeen doing. Britain has been trading with the Central Powers ever since the and Australia alone, at the instigation of the Prime Minister, backed by the honourable member for RobeTtson, hontook up the stupid attitude of refusing",35

154,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The Central Wool Committee was not influenced in the slightest suggested degree by that statement.  heard the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) state last night that we would have been getting a flat rate of 15£d. for our wool up till 1925 but for the advice given by the Prime Minister.,35
155,Mr BURCHELL,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That was to be during the period of the war.  honourable member for Balaclava said definitely that negotiations were entered into for the sale of our wool to the Imperial Government at a flat rate of 15$d. until 1925.,36
156,Mr BURCHELL,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"During the period of the war. °  these interjections of the honourable member do not refute the statement made by the honourable member for Balaclava, who was in closer touch with the wool question than was the honourable member for Fremantle.",36
157,Mr BURCHELL,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I ask the honourable member to repeat correctly what the honourable member for Balaclava said.,36
158,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The honourable member for Balaclava admitted that probably the Imperial Government, would not have continued the contract for such a long period.  reminded that the Prime Minister did more than advise the Government not to proceed with those negotiations; he practically ordered that they be discontinued. That was the statement made by the honourable member for Balaclava, who, according to his own statement, went to London ""to pick up the loose ends of the wool tangle,"" The wool control was in a hopeless tangle, and has been so from the beginning of the war. I recall this fact, because the Prime Minister, before departing a few days ago, sought to shift the burden from his, own shoulders to those of honourable members; he ran away from his own task and duty, but said that if his advice had been carried out in the first place, there would not be any such tangle as exists today. I say that but for the action of the Prime Minister the present tangle would not exist, and my statement is supported by that of the honourable member for Balaclava.",36
159,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That is pure speculation. There were only negotiations, and what would have been the outcome we do not know.  think that the proposal brought forward by the Government will help us out of the difficulty. Any proposal is worthy of consideration, but I agree with the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) and. the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) that the scheme that has been put before us will not provide a solution of the problem.",36
160,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The Prime Minister said the same.  should have a greater guarantee of a solution if we were to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham), who interjected when the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) waj speaking, that the. best plan would be to' hold Bawra wool off the market for two or three years. The honourable member for Grampians replied that he believed that that would be the best solution. Later on, the honourable member-for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) came into the House and repeated the same proposal.",36
161,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Fro m what I read in the press I thought that the honourable member for Gwydir proposed that the Government should buy out the whole of the carry-over wool for £20,000,000. I suggested financing Bawra to enable it to buy out the British interest, and, if necessary, that the Commonwealth should do so.  was the suggestion of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham), and it seems to me that the honourable member for Kooyong should have apologized to that honourable member for having stolen his thunder. However, wherever the proposal emanated, it is the only remedy likely to be really effective in the direction of what we desire. I have a great many small growers in the constituency I represent who have had a particularly bad time for the past two or three years; but, of course, we all realise that anything which affectsthe interests of all who are engaged in the wool industry reflects upon the whole community. ..Our desire is to prevent the bottom falling out of the wool market through throwing an over-supply into consumption, for the benefit of unscrupulous' speculators, and the proposal put forward is that we should so regulate our sales so as to prevent that happening. But the Government scheme will not he effective in doing this. The only remedy likely to prove successful is that put forward by the honourable member for Gwydir-to buy out the British interest in this carry-over wool, and keep the wool off the market for a period of, say, two - years. The proposal of the honourable member was criticised by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming), but his only criticism was that people would hold off in the belief that in six months' time Bawra might decide to put the wool on the market. That difficulty could be obviated by fixing the period at two years, which would prevent the flooding of the market feared by the honourable member for Robertson. At any rate, the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir is well worthy of further consideration. There is no need for us to take a gloomy view of the outlook. There is every prospect that as the result of .the present difficulty efforts will be made by enterprising people in Australia, assisted by the Government, to launch out in the direction of establishing woollen mills in every State. In this way we may be able to get away from the foolhardy policy of sending our raw material overseas, and again importing it in .the form of manufactured goods. I understand that at present we consume not more than 2 per cent, of our own wool. That is a position from which we should escape at the earliest possible moment. If the predicament in which we are placed .today assists us to go in more largely for the manufacturing of our raw material by the establishment of woollen mills, the tangle of the present moment will not be without its bright side. One great benefit from stabilizing the wool market will be that we shall know exactly the price manufacturers are paying for the wool which is used in the manufacture of the clothes we wear. The excuse offered by those who made exorbitant profits during the war period was that higher prices had to be .paid for raw material. We know that the additional cost of the wool in a suit of clothes was not more than 5s. However, they will 'no longer be able to make that excuse. We shall know exactly what they are paying for the amount .of wool - that goes into our wearing material, and we shall be able to prevent the exploitation which has  been proceeding for a considerable time past. The Government have been aware of this exploitation-the Acting Prime Minister told us yesterday that the value of the wool in a suit of clothes does not exceed 7s. or 8s - ye t they did not raise a little linger on behalf of the people to prevent it. The stabilization of the industry will enable the people to know exactly the price they pay for the amount of wool that goes into their wearing material.",36
162,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"We have always known it. Wool has always been bought at auction.  remarkable that the statements of manufacturers here and elsewhere that the increase in the price of clothing has been due .to the increase in the price of wool have always been accepted. I quite realise that the Government cannot keep the 1,700,000 bales of carry over wool off the market, because the British Government are interested in it ; but the difficulty could be overcome by adopting the remedy suggested by the honourable member for Gwydir. The small producers of wool are interested in keeping the Bawra wool off the market, in order to prevent that glut .for which the speculators of the world are so anxiously waiting. Undoubtedly the world is teeming with speculators on .the watch for the bottom to fall out of the wool market, so that they can purchase our wool, and later on sell it again at fancy prices. »""This would land us in difficulties again. We must prevent it, not only in the 'interests of the small .growers, but also in the in terests of the large .'growers and the whole community. The market must be stabilized ; but I do not think it can be effectively done by adopting the proposals of the Government.",37
163,Mr HAY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"New England) [ 4 . 3 1 ] - It is regrettably that honourable members waste so much time An recriminations when dealing with such an important question. The (present outlook is certainly gloomy, but honourable members - should cast their minds back to the period following the outbreak of war, whenthere was great depression, and when the prices of wool and other commodities were tumbling in all directions. The lack of shipping was one of the chief causes of that depression, but the British Government came along, and purchased our raw materials at very satisfactory prices, and paid in cash-as a matter of fact, even 'before our goods were delivered. To a certain extent, we have been spoon-fed by the British G-overnmeiit for a number of years. A situation has now arisen similar to that which arose after the Napoleonic wars. Great disturbances always follow great wars, and history always repeats itself. It is true that it took many years for the world to recover stability after the Napoleonic wars, but conditions are different today. Through interchange of commerce, through shipping, and in a thousand other ways, the spaces of the world have, more or less, contracted, and so it is to be hoped the gloomy period we are now facing ' will soon pass away. Although the sky is grey today, the sun will shine again, and if we put our best efforts and best thoughts into all our undertakings, I have nodoubt - it will not be very long before the sunwillshine again. I am rather sanguine about the future. I have always been, an optimist. I am. now what one might call a conservative optimist. There are three or four proposals in the minds of honourable members for dealing with the present situation-. There is the Bawra proposal; a proposal for storing the carry-over wool for two .years, or a fixed period, ih order to give place to the current clips ; a proposal to purchase-the British interest in that wool, and so control the position; and, finally, the proposal to have, an open market, permitting wool-growers to sell 'anywhere at any price they can get to the speculators who, as the honourable member for Hume  ing like hawks to pounce on their prey. The Bawra scheme is the only one that appeals to me. I would prefer selling two bales, instead of three bales, of my current clip to one of Bawra, because it would pay me better to do so.",37
164,Mr BOWDEN,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Bawr a is all profit.,38
165,Mr HAY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Yes , and so, if I sell two hales of my wool at a loss, I have Bawra to draw on, and may thus, perhaps, convert the loss into a profit.' That is an aspect - of the case which honourable members might consider. We all know that those - engaged in pastoral pursuits suffer at times greater mental distress than any - other section of the community.",38
166,Mr BLAKELET,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Not so much as the workers.,38
167,Mr HAY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The workers bring it on themselves; it comes on the pastoralists by the visitation of God. The pastoralists are suffering more today than they have suffered, perhaps, at any other time in their history. Yesterday the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) said that Australia is not riding on the back of a sheep only. I say if she is riding on anything else, 6h© is riding for a fall. I do not know on what sort of animal he thinks we should ride; but' if we do not ride on the backs of sheep the country will become a desert, and then we shall ride on the backs of camels.",38
168,Mr JAMES PAGE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,O r on goats ,38
169,Mr HAY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That occurred to me, but I thought the mention of goats might be offensive to honourable members. Those engaged in wool-growing are under greater difficulties now than they have been at any other period. There have been droughts and other visitations in the past, but the financial institutions were then able to come to our assistance, and they saw us through.. 1 To-day they are unable or unwilling to do so, and many who have hitherto relied on their assistance, under circumstances similar to the present, have now to use their own capital to continue in existence. Many men whose business is wool-growing are compelled to send to market sheep which they expected to shear this year and next. Now they must sell in order to live.",38
170,Mr FENTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That is because the. banks are pushing them.,38
171,Mr HAY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"If a man is being pushed,, it. does not matter to him who is doing, the pushing. I do not know that the financial institutions are unable to give assistance so much as unwilling to do so. It is clear to most of us that the country is approaching, very grave and responsible times. The Customs, revenue must diminish,, because imports are declining in both value and quantity; and the receipts from income taxation will be reduced because today comparatively few persons are earning large incomes. The financial institutions feel compelled, I think, to warn the public of the dangers ahead, and this is what is chiefly governing their proceedings. They are compelling the people to exercise economy. Governments cannot compel the people to economize except by force and imposing burdens of taxation. The people, however, can, and will, compel Governments to economize at the first opportunity they have of exercising their opinion. The war has involved this' and future Governments in very grave responsibilities, which I see no means of escaping. We must find the means necessary to provide for those who fought in defence of our country, and they are statutory obligations. Therefore, prudence is compelling those interested in financial matters to take a stand which was unnecessary in the past, and it behoves us to join with them in seeing this country through. If we are not to depend upon the sheep, on what can we depend? Can we depend on our mineral wealth ? I would remind honourable members of the fact that Broken Hill and Cobar have practically gone, that Mount Morgan is on the verge of going, and that Mount Lyell may follow suit.",38
172,Mr BELL,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"No . They are sensible men at Mount Lyell, and will come to terms. Mount Lyell will carry on, I am sure.",39
173,Mr HAY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I hope so. The time is not far distant when it .will be necessary to exercise moderation and deep thought in many of our industrial undertakings. When those directly engaged in metal mining are thrown out of work, they, in turn, take away the employment of a great many more. Many of the miners have been invited to accept a reduction of wages of from 20 to 25 per cent. I admit that it is difficult to alter the conditions under which these men work. They are living under awards, and it is very hard for the men employed at, say, Mt. Morgan, to be called on to accept a reduction in wages of from 20 to 25 per cent., while those engaged in coal mining, coke burning, and other employments in the same undertaking suffer no reduction. But the time will come when it may be necessary to suspend awards.",39
174,Mr BLAKELEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Suppos e we concentrate on the cost of living first of all.,39
175,Mr HAY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Tb e cost of living went up first, and so I think that it should come down first.",39
176,Mr BLAKELEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,We have been trying in vain for the past six years to catch up to it .,39
177,Mr HAY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I hope that honourable members will support the Government proposal. I think that Bawra can deal successfully with our surplus wool. When the European situation is clearer the wool may be disposed of to European countries . on long credits. The people of these countries, at present, are almost without raiment. I am not pessimistic about the future. I hope that within six months the clouds will have passed away, and that Australia will again be rejoicing in. prosperity.",39
178,Mr ATKINSON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Wilmot)"" [4.47] - I am glad that this very important question has been debated in a non-party spirit. An industry of so much importance to Australia as wool-growing should be placed above party conflict. Abnormal conditions were created by the war, making it necessary for the Government to assist certain industries, and the cessation of the war has .plunged us into other abnormal conditions, so that we are faced with unprecedentedly low prices for wool at a time when our growers are not in a flourishing condition. During the debate individual cases have been mentioned that are really pathetic. If our wool cannot be marketed season by season, what will become of the pastoral industry, which, directly and indirectly, employs more Australians than any other, and in the .aggregate creates far more wealth? On this Parliament is cast the duty of providing, if necessary, special remedies for abnormal difficulties. I do not wish the Government to take control of matters which can be better dealt with by private individuals, but it seems to me that the proposal of the association known as Bawra is the best that Has been presented to us. Some propose that the surplus wool should be bought and taken, off the market, but I think that if so great a quantity of wool were held back indefinitely, speculators would wait for a collapse of the market, and then take advantage of the lowness of prices. That would knock.the Australian growers out completely, for the time being.",39
179,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Coul d we not put intogaol the gang that wants to do that ?,39
180,Mr ATKINSON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I do not insinuate that any one wants to injure us; but I am afraid that that may happen if the surplus wool be held back for a long, period. With so much wool in reserve, a. collapse of the market might come at any time. Several propositions have been made in addition to that supportedby the Government, which is that the exportation of wool from Australia be prohibited for six months, except under the condition that it shall not be sold below a fixed price.",39
181,Mr CONSIDINE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,How does that square with your principle of freedom of contract ?,40
182,Mr ATKINSON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I do not like this interference with private action, but the position is so serious that something must be done, and, as practical men; we must meet the occasion as best we may. I have read the various schemes put forward, together with endless letters and leading articles on the subject, and it seems to me that, looking at the case all round, the Bawra proposition is that most likely to succeed. The owners of the Bawra wool know their business. They are familiar with the commercial side of it, as well as with the actual growing of the wool, and it seems reasonable, therefore, that their judgment.should be accepted. They tell us that this is the best way in which to dispose of the enormous accumulation, and that something must be done a.t once. As the honourable member who has just resumed his seat said, it is a well-known historical fact that after the Napoleonic wars there were many sudden collapses in industry. Industries which during those wars had grown up in certain countries became poverty stricken, so to speak, two or. three years after the close of the struggle which was responsible for their existence.",40
183,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,On e need go further back than the Franco-Prussian war for instances of the kind.,40
184,Mr ATKINSON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That is so. The people most interested in the Bawra wool urge us to adopt this scheme, and it is obvious also that special action must be taken to keep the wool industry of Australia going. Unfortunately, too many of our growers at the present time are in a sad financial position, and badly need to obtain the returns from their free wool. It is all very well to say that' the proceeds of the sale of the Bawra wool will represent wholly profits, but I am afraid that by the time that the wool is disposed of those of the growers most in need of money today will not have very much coming to them from that source. They will need a good deal more than they actually receive from Bawra. The growers are very anxious that this scheme should be carried out, and, therefore, I think it should be given a trial. Should it fail, it will be open to us to say that we followed the advice of those best able to determine what course should be pursued. Honourable members, in speaking of mistakes made in years gone by, very often forget to criticise the actions of which they complain in the light of the conditions actually obtaining when those actions were taken. I have heard some honourable members charge the Government with having practically robbed the wool-growers because of their failure to get better prices during the war. I was a member of this House during the war period, and, knowing what the wool position was at that time, I do not hesitate to say that the Government did what was best in the-circumstances. Some of the largest wool-growers that I have been able to consult share that view. They are perfectly satisfied with what was done by the Government. ""We should not have been able to ship our wool if the British Government had not come to our assistance, and, even had we been able to shift it to the United States of America, a great deal of it probably would have found its way to Germany. The chances are that German agents in America would have secured a good deal of our wool. All fair-minded men must recognise that the Government did what was best in the circumstances in respect of both our wool aud our wheat, and I am prepared now no to give them the necessary support to enable them to meet the Bawra propose tion. Before concluding my speech I desire to refer to the question qf economy, to which reference was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in opening this debate. Like many other honourable members, I was returned to this House at the last general election pledged to the policy of economy. Economy was a plank in the platform of the Ministerial party, as well as in that of the Country party,' and the Government, accepting the position they took up on that occasion, must make a serious effort to economize. I listened attentively to the Prime Minister's statement, and the conclusion I fonned was that he was convinced that wherever possible savings should he effected. It seemed to me that he considered we had reached a stage at which it was necessary, to exercise rigid economy in every Department. If the Government do that, I do not think they will encounter any difficulty when the Budget statement is submitted. If , however, they make no serious .attempt to economize, with .the result that they do not get the support upon which they have hitherto been able to rely, they will have only themselves to blame. The fault will rest not with the honourable member who carries out his election pledges, but with the Government for departing from those made by them. I .am not going to say that the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) will not attempt economies. I believe he is thoroughly in earnest in his desire to effect economy, and that when the Budget is presented we shall find that the Government have done as much as could reasonably be expected in the direction of reducing ournational expenditure. Ausr tralia today occupies .a pecaliar position. The situation in regard; to our wool is alone sufficient to show us that we cannot hope, in the.future, to obtain anything like the revenue we are now deriving through the Customs and the Income. Tax Departments.",40
185,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"We have not yettouched the last shilling,",41
186,Mr ATKINSON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"And I do not de: sire that Australia, shall be reduced to the last shilling.. This is not a time for reckless spending. It is, rather, a time for ""doing without"" and. for.the practice of real economy. While I hold that view, I do not say that where the prospects are favourable the Government should not assist people to develop the country. The Government should be particularly ready to assist our returned soldiers to velop our big primary industry, or to assist in mining development, which may open up a big asset', rather than spend money on relief works which are usually unproductive. Relief works in cases of serjous unemployment are, no doubt, necessary, but there are better means of"" employing labour. Such works are frequently provided' in our large cities,, whereas-- afar better return, from the money so expended might be obtained i h country districts. While I urge that we should practise economy, I do not suggest parsimony. The Government announced' at the last general election that they would avoid unnecessary expenditure, and I intend, so far as I can, to keep themup to that policy.",41
187,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Gwydir) [5.1].. - I have listened with a good deal of attention to the views - expressed during this debate from all sides of the House,' and, as the representative of one of the largest wool-growing districts in Australia, I am naturally interested in the - disposal of our wool. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), in opening the debate, rather overstated the seriousness of the position. We certainly ought not to be too optimistic,, but it is well known that the Prime Minister is a scaremonger and an alarmist. He stampedes the country and then poses as having saved the people from something which actually never existed. It is well, therefore, that we should not be carried away by his final utterances in this Houseprior to his departure for England. It seems tome. o that, on that occasion he followed, his usual bourse of overstating the seriousness of the position. I am not in. favour of the. proposals which the Government have submitted, and-1 believe that they are based upon an insufficient knowledge, of the facts. Much, relating to this subject has appeared in the press from the pens of interested' parties ; andeven the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) stated yesterday that a good deal of the advice which-had been offered to the Government had not been of a disinterested character. It was only to be expected that buyers would endeavour to depress the market and to stampede the Government. Now .that the matter has been taken up by the Government, it becomes a national responsibility, de- and consequently those who. are interested in securing wool at the lowest ..possible rate will do all they - can. to lead .the Government to believe that We shall .be in a hopeless position unless the whole of the Bawra wool is unloaded on a market which is at present glutted,, within a very short' period. In order to strengthen that argument, I ' should liketo draw attention to a press account of woo! sales held' ih Great Britainon the 3rd' May: While' we on this' 1 side of the House stand second to none in our respect and admiration for the British Government, and the British people generally, we know that there are private interests in Great Britain not above exploiting the people of Australia to the greatest extent in their power. The press report of these wool sales informs us that a general increase of 10 per cent, had taken place, but it is significant to noticeGreasy merinos realized 10 per cent, above April closing rates, scoureds from 5 to 10 per cent., and medium to fine crossbreds 7£ to 10 per cent - almos t all taken by the Continent. In another part of the newspaper it is stated that English buyers did not operate to ,any extent.; and, I believe that these people would like to see the wool market collapse. It is to our interests, just as it is in the interests of other industries which deal with perishable goods, to have cold stores and other means to prevent gluts-to withhold goods from the market, and thus evade the effects of an over supply for the time being. That is why, when the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) was speaking a few days ago, I suggested that, as we have a partner in the Bawra wool- a partner who is insisting on the wool being unloaded on the market-w e should, as happens in any other partnership business, when one's partner does not agree, sell out to ,him, or buy him out, and get control. .If the British Government insist on placing this wool on the market, whether we like it or not, we should take the necessary. steps to come to .some arrangement with the British Government in order to acquire their interest in the wool, and thus place the control of the fine merino wool of the world entirely in Australian hands. We could then, if we liked, withhold it from sale until a favourable opportunity presented itself for placing it on the market. I .am told by some that this is an impracticable scheme, because it cannot Be financed. That is to belittle Australia; I do not think we are so barren of statesmanship that we cannot finance a transaction of this character. The result of not being able to come to an agreement with the British Government is that, if they insist on unloading the wool, the market will be depressed to an. undue extent, and there will be great financial loss to the people of Australia-. That loss will not only be felt by the grazing industry, but will extend to other industries;, which, under our modern scheme of civilization, fit in like cogs in a machine. As an illustration let us look to the banks, which, let me say, are not disinterested parties in this matter. Their overdrafts and mortgages are largely on the lands of Australia, and they are the financiers of .the small growers. Anybody of experience knows that in a period of depression such as this- a depression which, in my opinion, is only temporary-it is possible for banks to order their customers to reduce their overdrafts. If a 'Customer - has been dealing with a bank practically .all his life, and he is asked to .reduce his overdraft in a period of depression, he has to :sell his stock or wool for less than it is worth. It is not possible for such a man to go to any other bank for financial assistance. Even if this proposal of the Government is carried out, there will still be need for immediate steps to finance the small growers and tide them - over the depression, so that they may not ,be forced by the banks to dispose of their properties. It is the duty of the .Government to take such steps, because .the resources of the nation should be at the command of any industry that is vital to the interests of the whole community. This is necessary in order to save industry, prevent disaster to the people, and to protect our financial stability .and preserve our credit, not only within our owni borders, but throughout the whole world. Why is it that I .say the Government - have 'come to their decision with insufficient 'knowledge? The Government have - no knowledge of the position in regard 'to Continental markets today. My belief is that we have reached the lowest rung in the ladder of prices, and in that belief I am supported by the newspaper reports today, supplemented by the reports of the various agencies. Cables are p_ublished from the Australian Mercantile Land and Finance Company Limited,. Dalgety ,and Company, Goldsbrough, Mort, and Company, The'New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency, John Sanderson and Company, and Younghusband Limited, and all these companies state that the competition .was keen, that values had increased 10 per cent., that newbuyers appeared in the market, and that the Continent was well, represented. Goldsbrough, Mort, and Company said that the principal buyers represented the Continent, and the Australian Mercantile Land and Finance Company report that the competition was animated with some American buyers. That latter fact is significant in view of the heavy import duty on wool in America. If America finds it necessary to buy in Britain, there must be strong reasons in view of the enormous import duty that has to be faced. Then we have no direct representative of this Government actually in touch with the whole operations of Bawra. When this Parliament, or the machinery of the country, is put into operation in order that we may arrange to carry some of the responsibility, the first principle to be observed is that, before anything is done, the Government should have a direct representative on the spot to make himself conversant with the whole of the transactions of the association into which we are asked to throw our weight. In addition, I dare say, there is not one member of the Ministry, there is certainly not one member of the House, who can give us any detailed statement of the efforts that have been made to dispose of this Bawra wool. There is no one to tell us what arrangements have been entered into, what correspondence has taken place between the principals of Bawra on the other side of the world and on this. We do not know what has been done, or is likely to be done, by the British Government towards arranging with the Continental Powers for the carrying out of the scheme of reparation, which will have a very great effect on the ultimate result of the sales in Great Britain. If the conditions by the Central Powers in the matter of reparations are fixed, I do not think it will be long before we shall have industry within those countries placed on a solid footing. It is ridiculous to carry out a trade boycott against those people who were previously large buyers of our primary products. To do so is simply "" cutting off our nose to spite our face."" Take, for example, the position in Australia. Prior to the war we used thousands of tons of German wire in Australia, and today there are thousands of miles of fencing waiting to be done. This work would provide employment for ' Mr Cunningham. hundreds of .men, but we cannot get the wire, except at prohibitive prices. Every man on the land wishes to improve his land to the greatest extent, but he cannot be forced to do so if the 'material. - necessary can be obtained only at exorbitant prices. We do not make wire in Australia in sufficient quantities for our needs, and thus there has been a limitation of trade detrimental to us as well as to those other peoples. To carry on a vendetta with the helpless peoples of those countries who had practically no say in their government, but are forced to carry out the will of their rulers-to persecute those peoples is contrary to the principles of Christianity.",41
188,Mr CONSIDINE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,What of war itself?,43
189,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"So long as humanity remains as it is I am afraid there will be war. It is remarkable that while the controllers of the Allied Governments who were at war with the Central Powers have carried out a persecution of the helpless peoples of those Powers, who, owing to conscription, were forced to fight, have allowed the great offender, the Kaiser, to live in luxury in Holland. This makes us in Australia wonder whether, after all, these peoples were so sincere in their protestations of hatred for the Kaiser as we were led to believe. The proposal of the Government is to fix a limit below which wool cannot be sold. When the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) was speaking, a statement was made - .that if we fixed a minimum price of 8d., other sellers would sell at just a shade below that minimum, and thereby get the market. The honourable member on that occasion said that we could not control the whole of the brokers and growers of the' World and prevent them selling below our minimum. We certainly cannot do that; we cannot control the people of South Africa, the Argentine, or any other country, and prevent them selling their wool at a shade below our price. There are 842 different grades of wool, and the prices of these wools run from, say, 3d. up to 2s. 6d. per lb. Let us take the case of a man in South America, whose wool is of a similar quality to ours. Our appraised price is Is. 2d., and if such a man places his wool on the market at Is. l^d. he cuts us right out. So long as we continue to auction our wool with a fixed minimum, so long will people be able to undercut us and get our market. There is no escape from that.",43
190,Mr EODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Obviously , that is not the whole truth, because the grades and standards are different in every country. - Mr CUNNINGHAM - Yes ; but wools of similar qualities produced in ferent countries can be put to identical uses, and if Australian wool is appraised at 15id., and wool from other countries that can be used for similar purposes as our wool of a certain grade at, say, 15jd., it is obvious that the latter will be bought in preference to ours. In industries which handle perishable goods, cold storage is resorted to in order to regulate the market. ""We should adopt the same policy, and either acquire Britain's interest in the wool, or arrange for it to be withheld from sale in order that the market may not be flooded.",44
191,Mr EODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,What will the British Government and public say to that?,44
192,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Britai n desires to sell the wool. Let us say to the Imperial Government, "" Bather than that you should sell the wool piece-meal, unloading a few thousand bales at a time and thereby depressing the market, we will buy out'the whole of your interest at the appraised value."" The honourable member for Grampians. (Mr Jowett) intimated that the British interest would probably be purchasable at about 5d. per lb. I believe that the carry-over wool is mostly of inferior quality. If that be so, and the average weight of a bale is 450 lbs.,* the amount of money required to purchase the British interest will not be more than from £8,000,000 to £10,000,000. We know that the injudicious unloading of £10,000,000 worth of wool on the market in competition with our new clip will lead to a collapse in values. I do not think the Commonwealth is so bankrupt' that it cannot finance the deal I am suggesting. If any honourable member were in partnership with a man who) insisted upon selling at the wrong time, he would either sell out, or buy out his partner. iWe cannot sell out; we should, therefore, buy out the other fellow, who desires to sell, in order that we may be able to stabilize the market and give our primary producers a fair chance.",44
193,Mr EODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That would accentuate our trouble.,44
194,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Are not trusts and combines formed in order to acquire products and withhold them from the market? A lot of twaddle has been talked by honourable members opposite dif- about flying in the face of the law of supply and demand. That law does not operate today. The Steel Trust and 'the Wheat Trust in America can and do create artificial demands and shortages.,44
195,Mr EODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The honourable member is suggesting another combine.,44
196,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Wherea s the operations of private trusts and combines are in the interests of individuals, my proposal is in the interests of the whole community and is designed to protect a big section engaged in one of our great primary industries. Let me warn Great Britain that, whilst she may acquire our clip at less than the cost of production, she cannot force men, who are able to get out of the industry, to continue producing wool. It would be a great loss to Great Britain if the wool industry of Australia collapsed. The British people would suffer as much as, if not more than, we should, and, having regard to the fact - that Britain is today ih the throes of industrial warfare, it behoves her to look well to herself if she is to weather the storm. I am not in accord with those honourable members who have said that Britain spoon-fed us during the war. If she did spoon-feed us, how is it that she owns a half-share in a couple of million bales of Australian wool? Though the wool-growers received a good price for their product during the war period in comparison with the pre-war price, the conditions in Australia today aTe changed. As a result of Australia's participation in the war we have to face an enormous national debt, and the extra price received from the wool will be insufficient to pay the extra taxation placed on the wool-grower in order to meet the interest on our war bill. Although the price we received for our wool during recent years was an advance on the pre-war price, yet it was much lower than the price received by every other country from which Great Britain bought wool.",44
197,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Sh e paid a big price to us - when the condition of the market : was unknown.,45
198,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Sh e bought each year from us at the same time as she bought from other countries. The people of Australia do not mind making any sacrifice for their kinsmen on the other side of the world, but we do not desire people to say that we ought to thank God that we did make the sacrifice. The obligation is not all on one side. The British 'people certainly derived great advantages from the fact that Australia is part cof the British Empire. The position of the wool industry today only proves that 'there was enormous bungling on the part of the Commonwealth Government in disposing of our primary products. I have always said, ever since we received information of the prices paid to other countries, that our primary products were sold at much too low a price. Honourable members opposite talk about insisting upon the world's parity for our wheat, but they did not insist on it when the Prime Minister was .selling our primary products to Great Britain.",45
199,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The proceeds of the wool sale to Great Britain practically carried us .through the first few years of war when our wheat was unsaleable .Jttr. CUNNINGHAM - That does not alter my argument in regard to the return we receivedin comparison with that .we should have received.,45
200,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Is the honourable member aware that honourable members on his side of the House have complained during this debate that the Imperial Government and the Australian wool growers received too much for their wool and were profiteers?,45
201,Mr LAVELLE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That was not said; the 'statement is deliberately untrue.,45
202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND, Order! ',45
203,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I think the honourable member for Grampians is .misinformed, and is therefore unintentionally misrepresenting honourable members on this side of the House. Probably, if he refers to Ham'sard, he will find he has made a mistake. . The policy of the Labour party is that for those products which are used within our own country the consumer shall pay on the basis of the cost of production, but for the things that are sold outside the Commonwealth the world's parity should be received. We should get the best price we can from overseas buyers. If it costs 12s. in a given season to produce a bushel of wheat the local consumer should pay 12s. for it , though London parity may be only 10s. The wheajb-grower should not be asked to grow wheat at 12s. per bushel .and sell ' it at 6s. On the other hand, if it cost9 only 4s. to produce the wheat, but because other countries have been lax in their production, the price in London is 12s., the Australian consumer should be charged not 12s., but the cost of production, plus reasonable profit. If for the wheat sold overseas the grower can get £ 1 per bushel, so much the better. Unless we base prices on the cost of production we cannot hope to eliminate profiteering. The cost of production of wool has been set down as within a fraction of l i d . per lb., and yet we are told that the grower should be prepared under this scheme to receive an average flat rate of 8d. per lb. What will be the position of the smaller men who cannot get financial assistance? The financial institutions will stand by the big men, but they will not be bothered with the small settler. In New South Wales the small men are being ordered by the banks to reduce their - overdrafts. They cannot get financial assistance in other quarters, and the banks, which have allowed their own stock to die, are re-stocking their runs with the sheep and cattle which they obtain as a result of forcing the small men to realise. Sheep which cost the small man 30s. per head are being compulsorily sold for 10s. 'We of the Labour party have always urged that finance should be a national question, because under present conditions interested parties in periods like these are always trying to drive the small men off the land. The position has become so serious that Parliament should legislate to prevent, if possible, the banks hunting any man out of his home because of the temporary depression through which we are passing. These, small men are not drunkards or gamblers who have wasted their means; they have been forced into their unfinancial position by the drought through which they have passed,^and the temporary depression of the wool market. The electorate - I represent has suffered probably more than any other district in Australia from drought during the last four years, and many of the small men are in an awful position. One man with seventy hales of cross bred, wool, which he sent to Sydney, tried to raise £140 on it, but could not get an» advance. At the same time the bank is ordering him to reduce his overdraft. What is the use of sending Percy Hunter to England, at a salary of £2,000 per annum, to send out immigrants, when the best settlers we have-the small, holdersare being forced off the land by the financial institutions ? The position is ridiculous, and remedial action should be taken immediately. The scheme put forward by the Government will not render financial assistance to these men in time to save them. Already in my electorate there have been a number of forced sales. And what of the storekeepers who have given these men credit to the amount of £300 or £400? A property may 'be worth £5,000, and the mortgage upon it is £2,500. The bank will put it up For sale,, and if £2,500 is offered it will be sold. Any man who has been on the land knows, that the. storekeeper often, carries a man when the banks will not; but he is an unsecured creditor, and loses everything. In cases such as I have mentioned,, if .the present tendency continues, the areas which are today the holdings of small men, will soon be again enclosed by the squatter's ring fence, and the settlers will be walking from one end of the country to the other in search of employment. Many of the best men in Australia are those who have risen to the position of owning their own land. - Many a wage earner attains his.ideal when he can secure land of his own, build a home on it and become his own employer. It would be a parlouscondition of affairs for Australia if these men were to be forced off their holdings through the action of interested financial institutions others, those people who have told the Prime Minister that they do not intend to join in the scheme which has been put forward by the Government. This Parliament represents the whole of the people of Australia, and the necessity has arisen for it to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act in order that that institution may be able to stand behind small land holders, thus preventing these interested banks from forcing them out of their homes - The private bank with which, they have dealt hitherto will not advancemoney to them very much longer, and. their position is only that of hundreds of other men. They cannot go to another bank for assistance. If they should attempt to do so the manager of that other bank would say, "" You have dealt with so-and-so for so long; why would he not continue to finance you?""",45
204,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,It is a very sound principle to stick to your own bank.,46
205,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"But the shoe pinches when your own bank will not stick to you, which it will only do when you can pay it twenty shillings in the pound. As business men, we cannot expect the banks to take much risk ;> but they should not exploit and ruin settlers because of a temporary depression. The position of many country storekeepers is exceedingly bad. They stand behind many settlers without asking for any security, beyond their customers' good names, and what will be their position if they are forced, by their wholesale houses to meet their liabilities, and they find that, their customers have been sold up through the machinations of the financial institutions ? Last night the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), tookthe Prime Minister to task for having interfered and broken off thenegotiations that were being carried into effect for a further contract for the sale of our wool to the British Government until 1925. The honourable member said that he was ordered by the Prime Minister, by cable from Great Britain, to discontinue the negotiations;.",46
206,Mr WATT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That is correct. That is what I said.,46
207,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"But the honourable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) seemed to have a different idea as to what the honourable member meant. and He endeavoured to point out to the hon Moloney) that the Prime Minister had nothing whatever to do with the sale of wool, and the honourable member for Hume asked how it was, if the Prime Minister had nothing to do with the. sale of wool', he could break off the negotiations' which were being conducted by the honourable member for Balaclava, as Acting Prime Minister. The great fault displayed by the Leader of the Government in connection with the sales of Australian prodiicts has been, that he regards himself as an Englishman first and as an Australian secondly. If any advantage can be given to the speculators of Great Britain, as against the people of Australia, he will always give it to them.",46
208,Mr WATT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I do not think that the honourable member is correct. Bad judgment has been shown on many occasions by the Prime Minister, but I do not think that he has displayed any preference for Englishmen over Australians.",47
209,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"It is remarkable that on almost every occasion he has displayed his bad judgment against the interests of Australia, and in favour of speculators in Great Britain. I am not speaking about the Government or the people of Great Britain; Australians are always prepared to stand behind them or make sacrifices for tbem, but on too many occasions sacrifices have been made by us in respect to our primary products, not for the people of Great Britain, but for the advantage of asmall speculating section in Great Britain.. We object to this. We object to the primary producers of Australia being made the sport and plaything of a few speculators in England who control the financial institutions there and seem to regard us merely as hewers of wood and drawers of water. It is our duty as a Parliament, when we are asked to participate in a matter like this, to keep a watchful eye open. If our partners in this Bawra wool insist on selling it, thereby depressing the market, it is our duty to buy out their interest so that we may control the supply of the commodity and prevent a collapse of the market, which would mean great loss to the people of Australia. Yesterday the Acting Prime Minister told us that he believed the Bawra scheme would break down. He said definitely that he did not think it would prove a success. Surely it is a ridiculous position for the Leader of the Government to occupy, when he says that he believes the proposal be puts forward will probably fail. The Prime Minister was quite as definite before he went away, because he said that although the remedy was no cure for the disease, it might act as a temporary palliative. What is the use of persisting in applying a remedy that will not cure the disease? If any man has a partner in a scheme and cannot get on with him he will either endeavour to buy him out or get out himself. But Australia cannot get out of the wool-growing industry. We are a wool-growing ation. We cannot sacrifice our flocks and herds. The* wool will grpw and must be shorn, and we must find a market for it . As a matter of fact, at the present time we ought to have men travelling through the Continent of Europe endeavouring to find markets, because there will be no great recovery from the depressed state of the wool market until the looms of Central Europe get going again. M - WATT - Hear , hear 1 r",47
210,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"We ought to' inspire a confidence in the impoverished peoples of the Central Powers that will induce them to utilize the wool we have grown, and which should be put into use in order to clothe them, and provide them with the employment which will enable them to purchase the raw materials they require. The honourable member for Balaclava gave us last night a very interesting outline of the methods by which a scheme for doing this might be financed, and I am pleased to note the general feeling in the Chamber that trade ought to be resumed with the Central Powers. It proves that the stand taken up by the Labour party is correct. Of course, during the war sane reasoning was dispensed with and the refusal to trade with the enemy countries was a good jingoistic cry which served to stir up the passions of the people, buti t is a matter for regret that leading public men must either eat their own words or persist in an attitude which is likely to bring disaster to a big section of the people of Australia, who naturally look to the head of the Government to be watchful of their interests in international matters. Even if it should cost £50,000,000 instead of £10,000,000 to do so, it would be worthwhile spending themoney in acquiring the British Government's interest in the carry-overwool. It would save a great industry. It would enable us to control 50 per cent, of the available merino wool of the world and we could then take steps to send' representatives to the continent of Europe to negotiate with the Governments of the Central Powers with a viewto getting them to set their looms goingonce more, thus bringing into operation again the machinery of production which was utilized before the war for the purpose of turning into cloth the greater portion of the Australian wool sold overseas. There are several sound business men in this Parliament who could very well represent Australia upon this mission. We ought to establish direct trade relations with these countries, and for that purpose the best brains available in Australia should be employed. We want financiers and commercial"" travellers in Europe to sell our primary products. At the same time, our Government ought to stand behind the small men who are being crushed by our banks and other interested parties, and forced to sell their stock. Sheep which these small men could only keep alive during the drought period at great ""expense they are now being forced to sell to these very institutions.",47
211,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The honourable member ought to mention names in support of his"" statement.",48
212,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Surely the honourable member is not' ignorant of the position. Does he wish me to give the names of the banks?,48
213,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I want the names of the men who are using their position as directors of banks to force other men to put into the market stock which they are buying up for themselves.,48
214,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"If the honourable member takes any map of Australia showing land holdings, he will see that the Bank of So-and-so owns this block, and the Bank of. Such-and-such that block. These are the banks which are advancing money to land-holders. inspector of one bank operating in New South Wales has been in the Gwydir district during the last few weeks forcing men to reduce their overdrafts. Holders have been forced to send their stock into the market, 'and their sheep have been sold for less than it cost to keep them alive during the drought, the purchasers in many cases being the very banks which - called for the reduction of overdrafts.",48
215,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The honourable member means that the stock are simply being drafted into other holdings.,48
216,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That is the position. Many sheep-owners paid as much as 30s. per head to keep their flocks alive. In any - provincial newspaper honourable members will find advertisements of forced sales where mortgagees have foreclosed. They will see: "" The Bank of So-and-so has foreclosed "" aii,d in such a case, if the stock are followed to their destination, many of the sheep will be found on land owned by this particular bank. That is why the Labour party advocate the nationalization of banking. Power ought to be given to the Common1 wealth Bank to stand behind these small men, just as the New South Wales Government stood behindthe farmers last year to the extent of £i,000,000. The Premier of New South Wales declared that he would not allow any man to be hunted off the land. Many persons were waiting for mortgagees to foreclose. Their credit having gone, they had no money to enable them to carry on; but the assistance given by the State Government enabled them to tide over the time of trouble. As a result, a magnificent crop was harvested. It saved the people of the State from a financial debacle. This is a matter whch should engage the attention of the Commonwealth Ministry at the earliest possible opportunity. If necessary, arrangements should be made by the Commonwealth Bank to take up the securities of these men who are threatened with foreclosure by the private banks. Every fair-minded man will admit this is necessary in the interests of the whole community. As I am not satisfied with the proposals of the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook), and as he has said that he thinks they will end in failure, I moveThe Tliat the following words be added to the motion:- "" and in the opinion of this House it is advisable that the Government immediately enter into negotiations with the Imperial authorities for the purpose of having all B.A.W.B.A. wool withheld from sale for a period of at least two years."" The acceptance of the amendment will permit of negotiations for getting the wool into consumption in Central Europe, which every honourable member opposite admits to be necessary. The weaving mills and looms of the Continent must be set going to provide for the absorption of the wool. I suggest the fixing of a period of restriction of at least two years to prevent the destruction of confidence in buyers. There will be sufficient wool, apart from the Bawra wool, to meet the demands of the world during that period, and at the end of it, when the looms are all going, there will he an opportune sion for disposing of the Bawra wool by whatever method the Commonwealth Government may see fit. My proposal will stabilize the market sufficiently long for the position to be cleared up.",48
217,Mr LAVELLE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Calare) [5.54] - I have much pleasure in seconding the amendment, and have one or two words to say in support of it. Every honourable member recognises that our wool industry is now in a parlous condition, and it is, therefore, our duty to do our best to stabilize it, and thus prevent a financial disaster, which would affect, not the growers alone, but every other section of - the community as well. I have listened 'to the speeches of this debate, and have followed the discussion of the matter in the press, and have conversed with wool growers about it. Australia has now to face the most serious position which has confronted her since the bank smashes in the early nineties; and unless something is done to stabilize the wool industry, the pastoralists will be absolutely ruined and the whole community will be injured. Some members have said that, the wool growers had a very good time while the war was on; but the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming), while admitting that, pointed out that their profits have since been taken from them, and - that, on the whole, they have not had a good time. 'Of late years, those who have done well out of sheep and stock have been, not the growers and breeders, but the speculators. While the war lasted, 'the prices of wool were fairly remunerative; but during the past two years Australia has suffered the greatest drought that has yet afflicted her, and most of the stock-owners have lost heavily. Although ithe remarks of the honourable member for - Gwydir were .questioned by interjections from members opposite, the fact remains that the banks ,are today using their influence and power to force men to .sell their stock at reduced prices, and that for two reasons: the first being that the banks may be able to re-stock their own nuns cheaply, amd 'the :next that they may be able to acquire cheaply the land of those who are ruined.",49
218,Mr WATT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I do not believe that.,49
219,Mr LAVELLE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I am not responsible for the honourable member's beliefs. Every occaman in this Chamber knows that what I say is true. The banks are the largest holders of land in Australia. While the drought was on, the price of fodder rose enormously, and they realized that it was better to let their stock die than to buy fodder to keep it alive. They knew that the longer the drought lasted the more those who endeavoured to keep their stock alive would become involved in their meshes. As soon as the drought broke, and prospects brightened for those who, at great sacrifice, had kept their stock alive, the banks refused further credit, and asked for the reduction of wool- overdrafts, with the result that sheep and cattle have been forced on lo the market, and have been sold at ridiculous prices. At Homebush, the week before last, the highest price paid for prime, cross-bred wethers was 21si ,a head, although it had cost at least £2 per head to keep them alive during the drought. The highest price paid for ewes at the same time was 20s. a head. At the Goulburn sales last week, the highest price paid for sheep ef any description was 14s. a head. That price was paid for merino - ewes. It must be remembered that the stocks of Australia have been enormously - depleted, and that there are now only .25,000,000 sheep in New .South Wales; but the present slump in the wool market, although it may last for .a year or two, is only temporary, and those Who are selling their jsheep at these low rates have been forced to do so. to' meet their financial obligations. The number of sheep in New South Wales is as low as it has been for forty years. It is fair to assume that, of the 25,000,000 sheep there now, not more than 12,000,000 are breeding ewes, and that these will not produce more than 6,000,000 lambs a year. The Homebush consumption of sheep is about 50,000 a week, or about 2,500,000 a year. Adding to this the 'Consumption in other parts of New South Wales, and the losses from the blowfly pest, and natural causes, it will be seen that the increase in the flocks must be slow.",49
220,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The honourable member is not allowing for any export trade.,49
221,Mr LAVELLE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That is so. But before many years are over the demand for wool will be .as great as, if not greater than, it was before the war. "" Although conditions are bad today, and may remain bad for some years, they will eventually become normal,, and if by adopting the scheme of the honourable member for Gwydir the pastoral industry is tided over a bad time, the growers will eventually get on their feet again, and we shall evade the financial panic and r u in which must otherwise result. I have one or two reasons for opposing the scheme of the Government. One i6 that 8d. per lb. is not a sufficiently high price for wool. It is less than the cost of production, and no one can carry on a business without a. reasonable profit. I am chiefly opposed to the scheme because it would stem the tide of disaster for six months only. As a wool-grower, and the representative of a wool-growing constituency, I am aware that the position is even more acute than it has been admitted to be; but if the buyers of wool here and elsewhere know that this restriction is to be for six months only, they will stay their hand, and at the end of that time our growers will beworse off than they are now. The periodof restriction proposed by the Government is. inadequate, and its adaption, instead of helping to stabilize the industry, will have the opposite effect-. If we get into touch, with the Imperial Government,, there should be no occasion for us to buy back the wool. We have been told, in season and out, that the protecting hand of Britain is ever extended to Australia. We have had it dinned into our ears that we owe everything that we possess to Great Britain . Now we have an opportunity of allowing the statesmen of Great Britain to prove that they have thei n terest of Australiaat heart. The wool industry is our principal industry, and should it collapse, a very bad time is in store for Australia, and for many persona outside this country. But the British. Government can, without loss to their taxpayers, keep the Bawra wool off the market for a period of. two or three years. Without this country or Great Britain in curring any expense, this veritable mountain of wool, as it has been termed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), can be kept off the market for a couple of years, * and this will stabilize the industry. The profit which the British Government has made out of the sale of wool is more than represented by the Bawra wool, and I have no doubt that the Imperial authorities would be prepared to do the right thing if properly approached. been said that the suggestion has been made that the Bawra wool should be burnt. The honourable member for Robertson said that the suggestion had. been published in the press.",49
222,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The man who woiftd do such a thing should be hanged.,50
223,Mr LAVELLE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I do not advocate . the burning . or destruction of the wool; I think that it should, and could, be put to use Those who adversely criticise the wool grower who, in certain circumstances, finds it necessary to destroy sheepskins or hides should be full y conversant with the facts before they suggest the punishment of such a man. Two bales of sheepskins, belonging to a grazier in my electorate, were sold in Sydney the week before last. They weighed 630 lbs., and after expenses had been paid the net return to Ihe grower was l i d .  tically given them away.",50
224,Mr LAVELLE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Yes . Having regard to the present state of the market, he was lucky, as an honourable member suggests, to get even l i d . for the two bales. When hides and sheepskins are unsaleable, very great precautions have to be taken in storing them to save them from 'the ravages of weevils and other vermin. If a producer finds that his hides or sheepskins are being practically devoured, by vermin, and are of no potential value to him, the only course open to him is to destroy them. If hides and sheepskins are being destroyed by growers, is isonly where it is impossible, because*of the ravages of vermin, to preserve them u n t i l they will be a marketable asset - I am satisfied that there is not one grower who thinks that either wool or hides should, be destroyed. No man is prepared to de; stroy anything that can be turned to commercial advantage. I refer to this matter in passing only because I am convinced that all the talk we have heard 1 as to the burning of wool and other primary products by growers emanates either from wholly irresponsible persons, or from those who deliberately make mis-. statements with the object of creating an entirely wrong impression.",50
225,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Such stories are a pure invention.,50
226,Mr LAVELLE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"It is a pure invention to say that the suggestion is being, made generally that wool and sheepskins,, It has because of the present low market rates, should be destroyed. In conclusion I would emphasize the point that this is the most serious situation with which Australia has been confronted since the banking crisis of 1893, and that it is the duty of every honourable member to deal with the question from an Australian, and not from a party, standpoint. I have endeavoured to deal with it from a national point of view. .1I have no desire to make party political capital ""out of it . I want, if possible, to assist the Australian wool-grower, knowing that by helping the most important industry in the Commonwealth I shall thus assist every section of the community.

239,Unknown,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Sitting suspended from 6.25 to 8 p.m. EXPORTATION OF WOOL.,52
240,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"ParramattaTreasurer and Acting Prime Minister) [8.0] -(B y leave.)- I beg to move1. That this House approves of the issue of a proclamation under the Customs Act 1901-1920 prohibiting for a period not exceeding six months the exportation of wool from the Commonwealth unless(a) in the case of wool purchased witliin the Commonwealth, a price, not lower than the price agreed upon as the official reserve in respect of wool of that type, is paid by the purchaser - either at auction or by private treaty; and (6) in the case of wool consigned for sale ' overseas, security is given to the satisfaction of the Minister for Trade and Customs that the wool will not be sold, either publicly or - privately, at a price lower than the equivalent of the price agreed upon as the official reserve, in respect of wool of that type, .plus the freight and other charges on the wool from the port of shipment in Australia to the place of sale overseas: Provided that the price agreed upon as <the official reserve in respect of wool of each type shall be such a price as will produce an average price of eightpence per pound for an average Australian wool clip, and that such official reserve shall be determined by the British-Australian Wool Bealization Association Limited in accordance - with the principles upon which the prices of wool were determined by the Central Wool Conimittee during the period of sales to the British Government. 2. That this resolution be forwarded to the Senate for its concurrence. This is the fourth day on which we have debated this matter, and I should like to, if Dossible-in fact, we must;-finis h it in our House to-night. On Monday the sales begin, and the Senate requires to also consider the matter when we have concluded it . first of all, as to why we are proceeding by resolution instead of by Bill . This motion is, to all intents and purposes, a Bill , except as regards statutory rigidity. In this case, we proceed by proclamation. AB ill binds us for a certain defined period during which no alteration can be made in , no matter PAIBS - how urgent the circumstances, unless a repealing or amending Bill be introduced. The outlook is not altogether clear-indeed , it is anything but clear-and we are treading our way in the through a maze of difficulties and perplexities in an endeavour to stabilize the market, and at the same time get wool into consumption, for there is a dual object running all through these proposals. In these circumstances, we think that the more facile the instrument by which this object is accomplished the better for all concerned. As to creating a precedent, we need not, I think, unduly stress the point, for the reason that we have the same control over these proposals in their shaping and adjustment as over any Bill . The discretion of the House, its judgment and its actions, are not limited in any sense of the word. Therefore, to all intents and purposes, this is a Bill with out having the rigidity of a Bill ; we gain as much by this way as we gain by means of a Bill . Moreover, if we proceed by Bill , we must incorporate in the Bill the provisions from the Customs Act, in order to make it effective and at the same time constitutional. We have no control over exports except through the powers of the Customs Department under section 112 of the Act. We cannot by any Statute create a new power; we are limited to the power we possess under the Constitution. That is, therefore, our sole power to deal with the fixation of a reserve of this kind. I think it is quite clear at this time of day that we have not the power to fix either a reserve price or any other price, except as incidental to the export powers. And now as to the purposes of the motion. The wool industry is a very varied one, as I am beginning to fin d out since I had something to do with it . It represents many interests and activities, and some of these are conflicting; A word, all of them are certainly varied, and i m portant. We have to gather up these in terests and reconcile them in the best way we can in one proposal, and that is not an easy matter. For instance, wool is bought and sold in many places, and under many varying conditions. Buyers are sent out specially on behalf of particular firms, and wool is purchased outright here for consignment direct to warehouses' at Home. Other wool is shipped a-way for consignment, to be dealt with in London by organizations of wool-brokers, by that known as Bawra, and other bodies at the other end of the world. As this motion relates to wool at the other end as well as to wool in Australia, we must make provision in the resolution to meet the .circumstances. There are other buyers who buy for consignment to foreign countries-Japan , America, and other places-wher e there are not organizations such as obtain in London. Therefore, we must fix our reserve and our guarantees at this end ; and paragraph a is introduced with that object. It sets out that, in the case of wool purchased within the Commonwealth for exportation, the price as agreed upon shall be charged, and guarantees shall be offered that it will be paid. There is a little uncertainty as to a certain class of purchasers of wool to whom, perhaps, I should allude now. I am referring to the buyer who purchases small lots direct 'from the grower and' pays ready cash. Such a buyer goes round from farm to farm picking u*p these little lots, and paying for them as he gets them. It would seem on one reading of this motion that a buyer of this kind' would have to get two certificates, one that he had paid the Bawra price to the farmer, and another when he came to ship overseas. If we make the man who goes round collecting these little lots for ready cash pay the full market price to the farmers, he is cut out altogether; and' I wish to make it quite clear' that we not desire in any way that he should be cut out. It appears to me that he may purchase those lotsof wool at a price as agreed between himself and the seller, and that he may then, under paragraph h; ship, the wool away on consignment, giving guarantees and securities that when the wool comes to be sold overseas. Bawra conditions will be 'observed. If that point is not so clear as some wish it to be'expressed in the motion, it can be altered,, for there is no desire, as I say; to interfere with this small buyer. To me, the arrangement seems right enough.",52
241,Mr JAMES PAGE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,It seems to me anomaly. Sir Joseph Cook.,53
242,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"At the Customs House, in the case of such a buyer, all that the Customs House officer has to say to him is, ""Have you purchased this wool for the warehouses at Home? Have you purchased it on your own account to export it, or are you sending it"" away on consignment?"" The Customs House officer has nothing to do with what has been paid for the wool in Australia; all he is concerned with is that it may not be exported unless Bawra conditions are observed.",53
243,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Is there no restriction on the price within the Commonwealth?,53
244,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Not within the Commonwealth; we are dealing, only with wool for export.",53
245,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I am afraid that is not the object, according to the wording of the motion.",53
246,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That is the governing principle of the proposal. ""We are concerned with the export of wool; what Bawra does is Bawra's concern. We are not hereto run Bawra; all we do is to prescribe a new reserve,' to try to stabilize the market, and bring our wool industry into a healthy condition.",53
247,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"What does the "" official reserve"" mean in paragraph a of the motion ?",53
248,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That will be made quite plain later' on. In the second paragraph is quite clear that,, in respect' of wool consigned to England there must be guarantees that it will not go into consumption at a lower price than the stipulated reserve, and according to the d'o- proviso, "" the' priceagreed upon as. the 'official reserve in respect of wool' of each type shall be such ""a price as will produce an average price of 8d. per lb. for an average Australian wool clip."" ' We are told that there are 858 types of. wool. The classification is fairly .extensive, and I understand that there is what is known as "" a wool Bible "" in which all grades of wool have been reduced to a mathematically ascertained standard. The prices realized for. these 858 types must work out at an average of 8d. per lb. Some wools will be worth 3s. or 4s. per Ib., and other wools only 2d., or I d . The average Australian clip, is to be ascertained by taking the average of the an three years of control by the Central Wool Committee, namely, 1916-17"", 19i7-18, and 1918-19. The figures for those three years will enable us to arrive at a . fair average Australian clip; and to fix ' the types . under which the average price will be settled: The machinery for doing this is already in existence. The best wool experts in the world h.ay.e been gathered together in Bawra regardless of . any other consideration than to press into the service of the wool industry the best brains in the industry. The whole scheme has been so organized that there seems to-be little room for improvement. Therefore, we adopt that machinery for the ascertainment of all the minute details and particulars by which the average price will be fixed. intothis scheme is not only Bawra, but t i e Central Wool Committee, who will have a say as to what the reserve shall be, and what the price shall be of each of the 858 types of wool. The final determination will appear bo reside in the 'Central Wool Committee. That is the scheme in brief, and it aims at one thing in ' particular, viz., the stabilization of the market, whilst at the same time moving off the wool as fast as we can safely and properly' do so. We are fixing an official reserve of 8d. per lb. because' that is well below, the profit line. This House has no right to determine the profits of wool sellers or wool buyers. We are concerned only with the preservation of a national industry, and as the bulk of Bawra wool has already netted a good price, and as a .good deal of the remainder may be said to represent extra profit, it is dear'.that, in coming to the help of the industry, we should make our stipulations - such as not to interfere with the making or losing of profits by the individual - sellers and growers. That I think is a .safe line for us to take. The object is .to reconstitute the markets of Europe, and I do not - see how we shall be able to do that by keeping our wool off those markets. The locking up of all this wool for a number ofyears will not help us to get r i d of it ; it is the mounting up of the wool that is dislocating the market, and making the commodity so troublesome to handle. Clearly, therefore, con- sumption, and not restriction, should be - the ultimate aim. This scheme aims at getting a fair price for the wool, and at . the same time moving it off with.as much 'rapidity as may be found safe, in accord'enee with the agreement .with the I m iperia]. authorities.",53
249,Mr FENTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Will export be allowed io any country?,54
250,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Yes ; and I sincerely hope that we, may make such arrangements with Germany as will enable her to be amongst our customers. I read into-night's paper that the German Government has resigned. I hope that is a prelude to a more reasonable attitude on the part of Germany, for the soones we can make arrangements with her, and give her her head, so that she may get back to her old-time purchases of our wool, the better it will be for the Commonwealth, and for every other country in Europe. Brought Mr BRENNAN - Blam e Germany for the Government's folly.",54
251,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,To what folly does the honourable member allude f,54
252,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I mean the restrictions on trade which have operated for years past.  Minister said that he would resign if Australia traded with Germany.,54
253,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The Prime Minister said nothing of the kind.. He stands today for the reconstitution of Europe at the earliest moment it can be done with safety to the Allies and justice to Germany. The first thing we have to do with. Germany is to bring her to her senses, and let her understand that she bas to stand up to the requirements of justice for the crimes she has . committed against humanity. The moment that is done and the principle of reparations settled, there will be no longer any object in refusing to trade with Germany; rather should wo encourage all the central powers of Europe to take our wool and other products. - Mr Considine - Do the Government intend to k ill the Kaiser - with bales of wcol ?",54
254,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I would like the honourable member to understand that I am thinking just now chiefly of the in terests of Australia and the Empire.,54
255,Mr SPEAKER,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND, I think ' the Treasurer might be - allowed to make his speech without' in terruption.,54
256,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Once the reparations are fixed up we shall have to address ourselves to the task-of restoring Europe to the old purchasing conditions in ' respect of our .raw materials. The trouble is that whilst the Germans require wool and can take an endless quantity of it at present, they cannot buy it . The only thing to do,, therefore, is to get settled conditions as a preliminary to the reorganization of exchanges and of the commercial relations between our erstwhile enemies and our Allies. And here I think the relationship of the Imperial Government to this wool scheme . becomes important. If our object be to unload our wool in the European countries where it is so much needed, we shall have in the Imperial Government an agency of the greatest possible value. Therefore, the Imperial Government, as a partner in this scheme, can be of more use to us than if she were outside the scheme. ever, all that has been made quite clear during the debate. I hope this motion will realise the intention of the Government by stabilizing the wool industry, and at the same time moving off the stocks of wool with, reasonable facility. I said last night that Europe has no wool, that the Central Powers want wool and cannot purchase it , that the world has no stocks of wool, that it is buying from hand to mouth, and will continue to do so unless stable conditions are in prospect. A man who seeB a chance of buying wool at a bargain price in a few months time, wil l certainly make no attempt to get stocks into his warehouse.'. He will rather higgle the market from day to day until he finds that he can make no profit by so doing. Therefore, our object is to stabilize the market so as to induce men to stock up, in the knowledge that they will not lose money thereby. way we shall keep the article we have to sell at a reasonable level until normal conditions come, when those eternal and natural conditions of competition may again assert themselves unfettered and unhampered by the irritating causes to which this war has madeus privy i and when we may release all these controls and* let our products find markets where ever they can, to the great advantage of all concerned.",54
257,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Hunter) [8.29] This question has been already threshed out full y, but I find it incumbent upon me to at least lodge my objection to the Government proposal. . I do not regard this as a party question. Every man is free to use his own judgment, because the matter is one affecting the future welfare of the people of Australia Two things stand out prominently. The first is that this Parliament i asked for the first time to give, through the Customs Act , protection to a combination dealing with the wool industry of this country without having any n g h l to interfere for the next six months. It is made quite clear that during that period Parliament will have no right to challenge the position of Bawra. That is a serious step for Parliament to adopt and honourable members should give careful consideration to it . We should not, in our desire to do something beneficial to Australia, be hurried into a policy, of the consequences of which we are not sure. Very few of the How- speakers in this debate have expressed full confidence in the proposal. The Prime Minister wanted a period of two months'in which to carry on negotiations with the Imperial authorities, but he said that he was not sanguine that the desired effect would be achieved. The Treasurer adopts the same attitude, and so do many others who have spoken. There being this doivbt, it behoves us to be very caref u l lest, instead of assisting the wool growers and benefiting the community, wo bring trouble upon Australia. I have pointed out that use of the Customs Act in the manner proposed has neve; been made before. Since I have been in Parliament, I have heard members opposite, and even some on this side, say that we have not the constitutional power to deal with combines. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan), : when he entered Parliament, claimed that In that they could be dealt with by an operation of the Customs Act, but that was said to be impossible. Now, if what the Government proposes is legal, it is obvious that it is possible. The Government is setting up a precedent, and they cannot blame those who - may f ollow them if they - use it to do something to which they are opposed. Sir JOSEI'H COOK - It will be all right if you have the support of Parliament.",55
258,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"But very often we forget that what is proposed is not . of party interest only, and a Government gets the support of the party behind it . I shall put on record my opposition to this proposal, so that if it does not suc-ceed I shall be clear of .blame. Honourable members opposite have changed their views in regard to our constitutional powers. Section 112 of the Customs Act says112. (1) The Governor General may, by proor clamation, prohibit the exportation of goods(a) being arms, explosives, military stores, or naval stores, or goods which, in his opinion, are capable of being used as or in manufacture of arms, explosives, are fools. military stores, or naval stores, or for any purpose of war; or (6) the exportation of which would, in his opinion, be harmful to the Com-' monwealth. Under that provision the Governor-Geneto ral has prohibited the exportation of the following goods:Wheat or other grain, ores, sugar, or other bagged products, which in regard to shipment or stowing must necessarily be carried on backs of the persons employed in handling same, if the weights of the bags containing such bagged products are, when filled, in of two hundred pounds. That action was taken in the interests of the people of Australia, because it was considered h a r m f u l to allow men to carry bags weighing 250, 300, and even 350 lbs. The provision is being used to prohibit the exportation of meat unless certified to by an inspector under the Customs Ac t as fit for export. again, is for the benefit of the people Australia, because meat unfit for human consumption should not be allowed to go cases. abroad. . The things that have been prohibited are those that should be prohibited under the Customs Act.",55
259,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That was the dedoubt, sign of the Act .",56
260,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,But the honourable member will agree with me that it is doubtful that what is now proposed to be done can be done under the Act.,56
261,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I should think so.,56
262,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I speak as a l a y man, and am subject to correction by the legal members of the House; but it seems to me that the proposed prohibition may be harmful to the Commonwealth, and therefore contrary to the intention of the Act. Is there any certainty that it will not? The Treasurer told! us that the as populations of the devastated countries of give 6d. or 7d. Europe have not today the money with which to clothe themselves. If they have not, we shall not be able to sell our wool to them until they are earning enough purchase it . Suppose that by reason [331] the fact that there is a falling market, Bawra wool cannot be sold against the competition of wool from the Argentine, from South A f r i c a , or some other counany try- a thing for which we should all be sorry-wha t will become of this scheme? '",56
263,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"If we lose the trade, being we lose it ; but may I suggest that the the assumption implies that the Bawra people",56
264,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"S h o u l d what I suggest happen, the prohibition will be against the spirit of the Act , because it will have resulted in something harmful Australia. Should those who are not connected with the Bawra scheme supply the market with wool at a lower rate than the reserve price, what will become of the - Bawra wool ? We prevent sales at a lower the price than 8d.; but there may be growers the who can supply the market at 7^d. Sir JOSEPH COOK . - The honourable excess member assumes that we shall rest supine while our market is taken from us.",56
265,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"If this proposal is adopted, we shall be helpless for a period of six months. That is the intention. The Prime Minister wished for a period of also two months, but the Government, after representations have been made to them, have decided to propose a period of six That, months. I wish now to come to another of matter. The Treasurer said that there will have to be two certificates in certain",56
266,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,No . I did not thin k that that criticism would apply.,56
267,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"If there is a and it does apply, the position should be made clear before action is taken. I have pointed out that we must be careful lest we injure the small man.

There is nothing in the propeople should make advances to posed resolutions to prevent that.",57
272,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The small farmer is not compelled to sell. He will not sell unless it suits him.,57
273,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Those I have in mind are compelled to sell because they depend on what their clip realizes ithe maintenance of their homes. They 'have to take what the - speculator offers. is in Bawra.,57
274,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"What does the honourable member suggest should be done ""<the small man ?",57
275,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"We should take time to consider that, and do everything possible to protect him. If he is prepared to take cash, there should be only a very small margin allowed.",57
276,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The farmer will have the choice of two buyers. He can sell the private speculator or at public tion. There is no restriction upon sale of wool in Australia.,57
277,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The honourable memcedure ber wishes to compel buyers to give email farmers the prices which he thinks they should receive.,57
278,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"What right has buyer to go to a small farmer, when is hard up; and say to him, "" I will you 4d. or 5d. per lb. for your wool""? The small man may have a mortgage to meet, and bills to pay, and must get money. The buyer can hoard up the wool that he gets in this way, or arrange for its sale under the scheme - which Government are supporting. There is mothing to prevent the hoarding up - wool in Australia, for sale when the martion. ';ket may suit. The small man is not pro' tected under this scheme.",57
279,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The scheme does not pretend to protect him.,57

285,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"It has already for been admitted that 5 per cent, of the wool-growers are not in the Bawra association. I have put before the House the objections which I have to this proposal, and I shall register my protest against it . I believe that it is neither in the best interests of the small grower nor in the best interests of the Commonto wealth that the Government should step aucin in this way and give absolute control the to an outside company. During the war I complained on many occasions of proof this kind in connection with the the appointment of Boards to deal with certain commodities - I thought that with the close of the war we should return to a normal conditions. But here we are tohe night legislating on the same old lines, give because of what is said to be an emergency. There are grave doubts as to whether the scheme will be effective, but under it the Government are giving to certain outside individuals quite beyond the control of Parliament the fullest the power to regulate the wool-growing industry of Australia. I shall protest in of the proper way against such a proposi",57
286,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Grampians) [8.58] It is an interesting feature of almost all debates in this Chamber that objection is invariably taken to any proposal by the Government or a private member on the that it will create a precedent which ' may, in the future, do infinite",57
287,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,O r do infinite good;,57
288,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"There are many precedents which may lead to infinite good, but objection is not usually taken to them on that ground. My comparatively short experience as a member of this House leads me not to attach much importance to such an argument, because in practically every case where such an objection is raised, inquiry shows that the precedent has already been created and accepted by the people. Even if that were not so in this case, I do not think that any party in this House would hesitate for a moment to take steps in the highest interests of Australia merely because by doing so they would be creating a precedent.",58
289,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Civilizatio n makes precedents.,58
290,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That is one of the wisest and most noble sentiments to which utterance has been given in this Chamber. . During the last few days we have heard a preat deal, and we shall probably hear more this evening, concerning the wickedness of creating a precedent by using the Customs Act for the purpose set out in this motion. During the last few years, however, the Act has been used on a good many occasions for similar purposes. It may be said that we were at war at all times that such actions were taken under the War Precautions Act. That, how1 ever, was not so. Although the war is oyer and the War Precautions Act has either been repealed for the most part or has lapsed, I find that there are embargoes or partial embargoes in operation. There are many metals, for instance, the export for-which, at the present moment, is prohibited.",58
291,Mr CONSIDINE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That embargo been withdrawn.,58
292,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The export of gold is still prohibited, or allowed only under tain conditions. My honourable friend might have at his command in Melbourne 500 sovereigns, and might wish to remit money for some high and noble purpose to London, Petrograd, Vladivostock, or some other place; but the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) and. the Minister for Trade - and Customs (Mr Greene) would not allow him to export that gold.",58
293,Mr GABB,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,They might if he went with it.,58
294,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Whateve r delightful anticipations the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) may have in that re[331]- 2 gard, I venture to repeat that the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) would not be allowed either to send those 500 sovereigns out of Australia, or to take them away with him. We have, therefore, in full operation a precedent of some years' standing for the course now proposed. I simply suggest to those of my honourable friends, who will, no doubt, give us the benefit of their views upon the question of precedent, that they should bear in mind that precedents of this kind were created long ago. Restrictions on the export of certain commodities have not been removed, but are in full force at this moment.",58
295,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Tell us something about Bawra wool.,58
296,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I intend to do so; but I observe that almost every honourable member who belongs to that noble profession which my honourable friend so greatly adorns, is making notes. Believing, therefore, that this question of precedent will be raised by them, as being practically the only argument likely to carry any weight outside against the passing of this motion, I have deemed it my duty to refer to it. Since precedent for this action has long been created, we have only to ask ourselves whether the circumstances of the wool-growing industry, and everything dependent upon it, are such as to justify the use of the Customs Act in this way. I do not wish to go over ground that has already been traversed, except to say that, even the arguments of those honourable members who strongly oppose this proposal have furnished the most complete has proof of the necessity for carrying this motion to-night. I have heard the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningcer- ham) inveighing at considerable length this evening against the hanks because, being short of money and requiring funds, they have been calling up some overdrafts. 1"" do not wish.to-dwell on that point, or to aggravate the position in the slightest degree, except to say that the honourable member only emphasizes . the fact that the situation is exceedingly serious. Suggestions which might prove very useful two or three years hence have been made by the opponents of this proposal, but not one of them: is calculated to prevent the present and continuous drop in. the value of wool. The only suggestion of any value is .that made by Bawra, and embodied in the motion before us. It may be quite true that the Bawra proposal may only arrest the fall in - wool, and,haps, stiffen np the market by giving some improvement in prices. But, in my opinion, and in the opinion of practically the whole of the wool-growers of Australia, it will probably save Australia from appalling disaster. It is the only way in which we can avert that disaster. There are some who Tegard it as an unwarranted interference on the part of the Government to endeavour to hold back an unrealizable product in order that the market may not be flooded. But I would remind the House that exception has been taken to a similar course in probably every case in which organized or concerted action has been taken to prevent a great and disastrous fall in prices and industrial distress. You, Mr Speaker, no doubt, will remember the great Baring bank crisis which occurred in 1893, when one of the greatest banking institutions in the world found itself suddenly confronted with great culties. That banking house possessed colossal securities- a great surplus of assets over liabilities-but , owing to some sudden contraction of credit, it was unable to meet its obligations. There were people in those days who said, ""Let the laws of political economy take their course., We must not interfere. If the house of Baring has endorsed a greater ' volume of bills than it .can meet when called upon to do so, it must take the consequences, and no effort should be made to prevent its fall.""",58
297,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The Barings were - rivals of the Rothschilds.,59
298,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"They were rivals of some of the greatest banking houses in the worldThere was some hostility to the house of Baring, and a widely-expressed opinion that it should be allowed to go to its ruin because it had been unfortunate enough to endorse bills to a larger extent than it was then able to meet. But we shall be called upon by some of my honourable friends to-night to look at 'the great Mother of Nations, at London, the centre of finance of the world, and to follow the so-called sound traditions of British - bankers and merchants. ' Did those British bankers and merchants follow such advice in the case of Barings' Bank? Did they allow the laws of supply and demand to operate in that case, and crush that great financial institupertion? No; practically the whole of the leading bankers and merchants in London gave a guarantee that the whole of Barings' creditors should ultimately be paid 20s. in the £ 1 ; thus that great banking house was saved, and London spared financial disaster.",59
299,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Why , Barings went smash!",59
300,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"But - ultimately the whole of their creditors were paid in full, and a financial crisis was averted. The position with which we in Australia are faced today is a desperate one, and desperate diseases require desperate remedies. But I do not think it a more desperate remedy to regulate the export of wool than to prevent the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) exporting large quantities of gold.",59
301,Mr GABB,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,There is a difference between gold and wool.,59
302,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Of course, there is a diffi- difference between all commodities that are not the same. The position in Australia today is just as critical as it was in London, during the Baring Brothers' disaster. I have the greatest respect for the opinions of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), who now objects to control of the kind proposed being taken outside Parliament. That may be the honourable member's opinion, but I do not find it an opinion held throughout the country."" Those connected with the producing interests, large and small, have an idea that those matters should be taken out of the control of politicians; they prefer a body like Bawra to a Government Department 'or Parliament. I merely present that point of view to indicate that this objection is not a convincing one against the proposal of the Government. I do not wish to traverse ground already covered, but there is one aspect of the case to which I think attention should be called. Those honourable members who have moved in this House in support of the industry have been accused of acting only in the interest of large growers, squatters, and banking and other corporations. There is, I shall not say in this House, but in some circles outside, a strong misconception as to who are the people who grow the wool for uswhether the large squatter or the small farmer.. The statistics for some of the other States I have not been able to obother tain, but I - have the Victorian Tearable Book, which shows that in that State",59
303,Mr FENTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The biggest sheep-farmlargely ing State in Australia. I,60
304,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That is so, in tion to area. According to the Book, there were nearly 16,000,000 in Victoria in 1919, and it is interesting by to see who owned these sheep -1 find that in Victoria there were 28,338 owners sheep, and that of these there were 20,430 farmers who owned less than 500 improvement sheep. That is a significant fact; and in pleading as I have been pleading for something reasonable and fair to be done to stabilize the wool industry, and preI vent. disaster, I have been speaking every wool-grower in the Commonwealth.",60
305,Mr BLAKELEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,How about protecting the small man under this scheme?,60
306,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Every effort has made to protect the small man.,60
307,Mr FENTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Does the honourable member think for a moment that if this motion was contested in a Court i would stand?,60
308,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Undoubtedly . The very highest constitutional authority Australia, or one whom I consider to such, is of opinion that this proposal stand. Mr..FENTON - If it were an Act Parliament it would, but not as a resoluI tion.",60
309,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,There is no power under which this motion can be one way or the other.,60
310,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I do not think it will be tested in a Court, but if it is I think will stand. There are only about 60,000 or 70.000 wool-growers in the whole of Australia, and we see that in Victoria 20,000 of them own less than 500 sheep. I suppose we may take it that the proHunter portion in the other States is about the same. /",60
311,Mr GABB,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,But do not the owners of large flocks of sheep grow more wool all the small growers put together ?,60
312,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"No matter what exact proportion ""may be in some other States, the fact remains that if the value of wool be allowed to fall to disastrous limits the first to be ruined will be small wool-growers with 500 sheep.",60
313,Mr GABB,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,No ; they rely on other things.,60
314,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"They may rely on things, but I can assure the honormember that in his own State, as well as in others, these farmers rely very for the money with which to pay their way, on the sales of their wool and proporsheep. I venture to say that a Tearlarge proportion of these men are sheep being brought to the verge of ruin the falling prices. However, I do not take by any means a despairing of view of the situation, because, as . I am glad to see, there has been an in the market, due, I have no doubt, to the announcement made last week by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) as to the intentions of the Government. t is gratifying to notice that the wool for sales in London on Tuesday last showed an improvement of 10 per cent., and the fact is easily explained. People have been hanging been cheaper in a fallinginmarket; back for months order to get wool but a change came over them when the Prime Minister's announcement was made last week, and the debate followed here on Friday t last. The reports of that announcement Sand the debate have, I understand, been cabled to the Old Country and America, in and the prospective buyers who had been be holding back, when they realized that will Australia was going to make some effort to stop the perpetual decline, knew it of was no good waiting any longer. This, think, accounts for the rise of 10 per cent, on Tuesday last, and it indicates to what extent it is possible by such action tested to arrest falling prices. The honourable member for Darling it (Mr Blakeley), who occupies an exceedingly responsible positionin connection with the wool-growing industry, asks what provision is made to protect the small grower, and the honourable member for (Mr Charlton) is anxious on the same point. I draw attention to the fact that the motion in paragraphs a and 6 distinguishes between two classes of wool. than Paragraph a refers to wool purchased within the Commonwealth, arid the resolution, > as a whole, deals with wool that the is exported for sale overseas.",60
315,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,What of paragraph b?,60
316,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That seems to refer the exclusively to wool consigned for . sale .overseas.,60
317,Mr LAVELLE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Where is the wool to be purchased ? ' Mr JOWETT - It may be purchased anywhere in Australia.,60
318,Mr RODGERS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Bot h paragraph a and paragraph b refer to wool for export.,61
319,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Paragrap h a relates only to wool - purchased within the Commonwealth. - Mr Charlton - Suppos e I purchase wool from the farmers, .and do .not export it immediately, but store it up until the restrictions are removed ?",61
320,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"It is unlikely that wool would bo purchased under such conditions with, a .prospect of a restriction on export until it could be proved that the purchaser had paid the reserve price.",61
321,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That is very likely to happen.,61
322,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The honourable member is mentioning only an extreme possibility. Paragraph a clearly prohibits the export of wool purchased within the Commonwealth by private treaty from a small farmer unless the purchaser has paid the reserve price - If that were not clear I would not support the motion.,61
323,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Suppose I number of small farmers who are in poor circumstances, and buy their wool at 4d. per lb. I would not export it immediately, but would store it away until the restrictions were removed. (\",61
324,Mr JAMES PAGE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That could be done in any case.,61
325,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Exactly. . The argument of the honourable member for Hunter might be very properly applied to some other resolution; but we are dealing with a motion which relates only to the control of the export of wool. It is perfectly clear that a man who buys wool from, the farmer below the price fixed by Bawra will not be allowed to export that wool. But this does not apply to wool purchased for local manufacture. There will be no intention to export such wool, and the purchaser, being a manufacturer, will be perfectly free to buy at any price. I would not stand idly by and see the small growersfleecedby allowing others'to purchase their wool below the Bawra reserve, and then export it .",61
326,Mr RILEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,I understand that i be allowable to sell fellmongered wool overseas.,61
327,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"That is not provided for in this motion; but I agree with the honourable member that provision should be made for fellmongered wool to . be exempt from these restrictions. I support the motion with the reservation that, if at .any time it is found that it acts prejudicially upon the fellmongery industry I shall ask for its repeal or amendment.",61
328,Mr LAVELLE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,By whom will the price ; be agreed upon ?,61
329,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The price is already agreed upon, being practically half .the price which the grower obtained under the appraisement.",61
330,Mr LAVELLE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The restrictions apply only for six months. If I were able to buy £500,000 worth of wool at 2d. per lb. and hold it for six months with the intention of then exporting it I could do so.",61
331,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Yes , if the honourable member could find men who were foolish enough to 6ell him the wool at that price. Subject to the reservation I have mentioned I support the motion.",61
332,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Kooyong) [9.22] - The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) protested against this motion as being an improper procedure. I share that protest, and agree that the go to a Government have not approached this matter in the right way; but I point out to the honourable member that the motion is nothing more than a bare expression of opinion by the House. It has no legal weight or validity whatever.",61
333,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Excep t that it enables the Government to impose the restrictions indicated in it.,61
334,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"In doing so the Government would be simply yielding to the expressed opinion of the House. In regard to a point raised by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), no question as to the validity of the resolution as such can come before the High Court, because that body' has no jurisdiction to deal with any action by this House. Another point taken by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) was that, by adopting this motion, Parliament would be committing itself to this policy for a period of six months. On the face of it that is so; but it will be quite competent for the House at any time, after t will seven days' notice, by an absolute majority, to repeal the resolution. Consequently, we shall not be irrevocably committed to this resolution, for what it is worth, for a period of six months.",61
335,Mr HIGGS,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Will not the resolution have the force of law? If anybody fails to comply with the regulation will the Commonwealth have right of action against him) i Sir ROBERT BEST - The resolution can have no.force of law whatever unless and until embodied in a proclamation as intended under the Customs Act.,61
336,Mr CHABLTOST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Then what is benefit of it?,62
337,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The only benefit is that it will guide the Government as to their course of action. The House will express its opinion, upon which the Government may or may not act, according as they think proper.",62
338,Mr WATT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The resolution will give the Government the sanction to use the Customs Aot for the restriction of export.,62
339,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"It will give .the Government that sanction undoubtedly, but the resolution itself will have no legal validity.",62
340,Mr FESTTOHV,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Will the terms of resolution be contained in the proclamation?,62
341,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"If the Government choose to give effect to this resolution, the question of law involved will centre in the terms of the proclamation by the Governor General in Council.",62
342,Mr WATT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,In substance the proclamation will he in the terms of this resolution.,62
343,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"There is no doubt but that the proclamation will,-in substance, follow this resolution. It will then be open for any person concerned to challenge the validity of the proclamation in the Courts.'. The Government proposer to use, or rather abase, the Customs Act for the purpose ,of giving effect to the resolution. The Customs Act allows the Governor General in Council to, by proclamation, prohibit the export of any goods, the exportation of which would, in his opinion, be harmful to the Commonwealth. Therefore the Governor General has to come to the determination that the export of wool would be harmful to the best interests, of the Commonwealth. This, on the face of it , is absurd, the truth being that the prohibition of the export would be harmful. It was never intended that the Customs Act should be used in the way proposed. But the qualification that is attempted to be made is that the Government are not deliberately prohibiting export in 'the terms of the Act; they are merely attaching conditions to the export. In my judgment, they have no power to attach special conditions, such as they propose to attach under the* terms of this resolution.",62
344,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,They are doing that with gold at tie present time. the Sir ROBERT BEST - They are doing nothing of the kind. They simply .prohibit the export of gold. But it is the conditions that qualify the validity of their proposed action. - Mr GBEENI! - The Aot gives express power to impose conditions.,62
345,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The Act does give power to attach conditions in certain circumstances, but there is no provision for conditions or qualificationssuch as are contemplated in connection with the export of wool. The cases is which the Governor General in Council is permitted to impose condithe tions or qualifications in regard to the exportation of goods are expressly stated in section 112 of the Oils'toms Act. But the Government are now proposing to attach qualifications the legality of which, to use the mildest language, is open to the gravest doubt",62
346,Mr MASSYGREENE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The wording of "" supsection 2 of section 112 is very clear.",62
347,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Sectio n 112 enacts that the Governor General may, by proclamation,, prohibit the exportation of any goods(6) The exportation of which would in his opinion be harmful to the Commonwealth; or-paragraph s a,, c, d, and e of sub-section 1-in regard to who3e exportation he is empowered to attach conditions, and sub-clause 2 says The power contained in sub-section (1) of this section shall extend to authorize the prohibition of the exportation of goods generally, or to any specified place, and'cither absolutely or so as to allow of the exportation of thegoods subject to any condition or restrictions",62
348,Mr G,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,KXKNX - That is general.,62
349,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Do my honourable friends suggest that we have power to impose a restriction or prohibition, which amounts to the fixation of prices? The fixing of this reserve' price for wool amounts to that. It is a scheme fixing the price .at which wool may be sold. Wool is not to be sold under 8d. per lb. Speaking generally, the fixation of prices within Australia is the exercise of a power which is exercisable only by the States, and for that reason I say that validity of the proposed proclamation to say the least, exceedingly doubtful",62
350,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,The States :not fix the prices at which goods be sold abroad. ',63
351,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Of course they * - cannot.,63
352,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Then we are not interfering with them in that matter, and are free to do as we please. . Sir ROBERT BEST - But it has never been contended, that' the Commoncapacity. wealth has the power to fix prices abroad. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) drew attention to the wording - of paragraph a of the Government prothe posals, and I confess that there is difficulty in understanding what is meant. The paragraph readsThat this House approves of the issue proclamation under the Customs < Act 1920 prohibiting, for a period not exceeding six months, the exportation of wool from'the monwealth, unless, (a) in the. case of purchased within the Commonwealth, a not lower than the price agreed upon as official reserve in respect of wool of that is paid by the purchaser, either at auction or by private treaty. Apparently, what is meant is that, i buyer went round in the manner spoken of by the honourable member for Hunter, - and purchased wool from small fanners at 4d. per lb., that wool could not be . ported. But the provision could be easily evaded by the Te-sale of the .fictitiously or otherwise, for 8d. or another person.",63
353,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"O r the buyer could store'the wool for sale at a future date. Sir ROBERT BEST:-Exactly . The honourable member urged that terms should be imported into the proposal which would prevent men from purchaswill ing at low prices. May I suggest to that we have no power to do that. matter is wholly within the domain the States. Recurring to the point that I was making, that what is proposed an abuse of the powers of the Customs Act, I wish to draw attention to the that there has been a ruling of the , Court in regard to an attempt kind. The Excise Act of 1906 purported to impose an Excise duty, but it was provided that that duty should not be able in those cases in which manufacThe the turers complied with, certain industrial is, conditions -' A question arose as to whether this was a valid exercise of the canlegislative powers of the Parliament in may this regard, and the High Court held that, although the Act was nominally an Excise Act, it was really an Act imposing conditions as to labour, and an exercise by the Commonwealth Parliament of a power which belonged only to the States. The Court held that, in endeavouring to attach such conditions, this Parliament went beyond its legislative In passing the section of the Customs Act which it is intended to apply in this case, the object of Parliament was to protect the interests of Australia by prohibiting of the exportation of certain goods harmful to Australian interests except subject to conditions. The exportation of meat, for instance, is prohibited of a unless it has been certified by an in1901spector appointed under the Commerce ComAct to be of good quality and fit for exwool port, and leather may not be exported if price it contains barium compounds. What is the now proposed is .an abuse of this power of type prohibiting exportation. We are straining the Act in an attempt to do something f a under it which was never intended, and which its language does not justify. I have already spoken at length on the merits of this question, and in view of the vote just taken, I do not propose to atextempt any further to oppose the procedure intended' to be followed by the Governwool, ment. At the same time, I protest 9d. to against this mode of carrying it out. The proper course would be to pass ar Act of Parliament, although I see that some .legal objection might attach to doing so in respect to our power of fixing prices. However, if the Government feel that the passing of this resolution legitimately reach the objective, him namely, that of stabilizing the wool The market, no one will be more gratified of than I will be; but it is a grave and dangerous precedent, the result of which we cannot at the moment foresee. I am is sorry this course has been followed, but will raise no further objection. I feel it fact my duty to indicate the manner in which High the Government propose to abuse rather of this than use .the Customs Act. pay- -\ Dr MALONEY (Melbourne) [9.42] deduction of the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) in reference to the Baring disaster is very different, fro m mine. Hyndman's Commercial Crises of the 19th Century saysA guarantee fund was formed in which the Bank of England took the lead, and every bank or firm of any note in the city joined to insure the meeting of the acceptances of Baring Brothers and Company to the extent of £21,000,000. Gold to the amount of £3,000,000 was borrowed byfhe Bank of England through the Rothschilds from the Bank of France, and more was obtained from Russia; the Barings' ordinary business was turned into a limited company, and several other important firms went into a sort of limited liquidation. It was all thought to be a great stroke of genius at the time, and Mr. Lidderdale practically received the thanks of the Government, and was presented with the Freedom of the City of London. But the aspect did not appear so pleasant one or two years later. The following quotation from the same book shows how callous the very rich are, so long as they can preserve their own rights:Not a single bond-holder or shareholder was represented on this great committee, of which Lord Rothschild was the chairman, and the whole affair was arranged to tfie ruin of the investors, so as to suit the pockets of those who sat with him round the table. That is the end of the Baring episode of ' which the honourable member for Grampians spoke. It shows how those who have most power can use it to benefit themselves. My own opinion on this matter is that civilization can only advance by breaking old precedents-and making new. Therefore, I welcome this proposal. not be the only one of the sort in the great march to the ultimate end of the nationalization of this industry. are told that our wool has been sold for 3^d. per lb. and less, and that it could be had for the carting it away. Senator Guthrie, as reported in the Age today, has said It took 7 lbs. of greasy wool to make a suit of clothes. The grower got 5s. 3d. out of that quantity of wool, and it was scandalous that tlte prices of suits ranged from £8 8s. to £16 IDs. Manufacturers had been ""making a big thing out of it,"" and the wholesale houses had made fortunes, and were "" squealing"" because they could not still get the high prices they had obtained. When an honourable member on this side of the House moved to lock up the whole of the Bawra wool for two years, my mind flashed immediately to the human beings in Europe in need of cloth made from wool. People the whole world over are holding up their hands for wool, and second only to the infamy of preventing food from reaching the hungry would be any step taken to prevent them from clothing their bodies. . Therefore,, I voted against the honourable member's proposal. We have been told to produce, produce, produce. We have produced wool. We have been told also to beware of the Greeks bringing gifts. I am not speaking for the few thousand wool-growers, but for the millions in Australia who want cheap clothing, and who by robbery and extortion are prevented from getting it at a fair price. I do not blame the Government for fixing the price of this wool at 8d. per lb. I support them in doing so. They are establishing a precedent that will be followed, possibly not by the party in power today, or by any other party which may replace it ; but when the people outside secure control of this Parliament, there will be no more of that infamous fraud , bribery and corruption that has been in evidence for years. In order to show what has been done, let me point out that Buckley and JTunn, of Melbourne, are advertising a. Canadian production of very fine quality, made from Australian wool sent to Canada and woven there. It is described as follows:FAVOBITE MONARCH HAND KNITTING YARNS. Monarch Floss - A 2-ply yarn made from fine Australian wool put up in one-ounce balls. It will Monarch Dove - A 4-ply yarn suitable for stockings, scarfs, &c, made from fine Australian wool put up in one-ounce balls. We That wool is 6old at Buckley and Nunn's at 3e. 6d. an oz. or 56s. per lb. That is an infamy. Such wool could be manufactured here, and I hope that when the Tariff is tinder consideration the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) will give the matter his attention. If this scheme is adopted, I hope we shall not have in connection with it a repetition of the wheat scandals. It has been said from this side of the House that 5,000,000 bushels of wheat, which was under the control of the pool, disappeared, and that most of it was stolen. That statement has never been contradicted. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , when speaking last night, said that there were some 200,000,000 people in the enemy countries of Central Europe. I knew he was wrong when he made the statement, and I have since taken the trouble to look up the Year Book, with the result that I find that in the new Austrian area, taking the v population as at the pre-war standard, and not allowing for losses in population during the war, there are only 7,000,000 people; that in Czecho-Slovakia there are 13,900,000, in Germany, 63,000,000, and in Hungary 20;000,000. Some time ago through the courtesy of the Minister for Trade and Customs, I was able to transmit l is . to an old friend of my student days residing in Germany, and I received from him a letter stating that for that lis. he had obtained 137| marks. pre-war standard was 20 marks to the sovereign, so that he got 12| times as many marks as he would have obtained for l is . before the war. How are we to settle up with an exchange of that kind ? Before the war in Berlin a piano could be purchased for £20. The honourable member for Balaclava will probably remember that the late Mr Sachse, then Minister of Education in Victoria, endeavoured manv years ago to arrange for the purchase of a large - number of German pianos at a cost of £15° each for use in our State schools. To-day, with the mark at 250 to the sovereign, even assuming that the cost of pianos in Germany had increased by 300 per cent., we should be able to obtain three pianos for the money paid there for one before the war. If German pianos were landed here at such rav ""- Wertheim's and Beale's piano factories would have to close down and no pianos would be made here. I think that we shall have to fix the purchasing price 'a the currency of the country, and then bring it back to the pre-war standard before goods so purchased are admitted to Australia. Does the honourable member for Balaclava follow me?",63
354,Mr WATT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I do, but I do not know whether the Minister for Trade and Customs would say that he had the power to do what the honourable member suggests.",65
355,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"My honourable friend spoke almost in terms of admiration of the time when, in the name of economy, the Victorian Government ""cut to the bone."" Surely he must remember the misery of those days. More men and women, whose only crime was the Christlike one of being poor, were jailed at that time than at. any other period in Victoria's history. Old women were asked to live on a pension of 2s. 6d. a week, and to my own knowledge two lives in one family were lost through the infamy of that ""cut to the bone"" policy. Victoria at that time was really as rich as ever it had been. There had simply been a manipulation of the finances. Finance at the present time is being, and during ""the war was, manipulated in a way previously unheard of. Never during any previous war did the gold reserves mount up as they did during the late war in all the banks of all countries, including The the 'banks of those countries which lost the war. Every reader of finance knows, however, that all the money that has ever been coined would not pay for one month's transactions on the New York Stock Exchange alone. The process of manipulation may be simply illustrated. If a man in this chamber had £1,000,000 in four different pockets, and, leaving the House for a minute, put the whole of that money into one pocket, he would return here a millionaire in one pocket and a pauper in the other three. Australia, blessed with good seasons, will be rich in its crops, and if we devote attention to mining operations and manufactures she will be rich also in respect of both those industries. But the financial strings are pulled from the great financial centres. I have already referred to the great banking firm of Baring Brothers-the only firm to stand up against the Rothschilds. In the crisis of 1893 it was decided to eliminate that firm. Nominally they were to be assisted to the extent of £21,000,000, and, in addition, through the Rothschilds they obtained £3,000,000 from the Bank of France. Later on Lord Rothschild took the chair at a certain meeting, caring little or nothing for the bondholders or shareholders so long as his friends around the table were safe. I make no accusation against the wool growers of Australia, but I cannot get away from the arguments advanced in a leading article published in this morning's issue of the Age, in which it is stated thatThe Government of the country is exceeding its duty by invading the area of private trading and financial interests at the wish of a relatively small and wealthy .section of the community. That way lies grave, abuses. Most people are familiar with the obstinate objections raised by this Government to fixing the price of meat against the wishes of the big graziers when that course was advocated for the benefit of the great mass of the people. When will the people, the creators of this Parhament, exercise controlover the created thing? A' minimum export price is now to be fixed for wool to suit mainly the wealthy section that was then strongest in its objections to price fixing. Sir Joseph - Cook may argue, of course, that, as only about 2 per cent, of our wool is manufactured locally, and only 5 lbs. of wool is required to make a suit of clothes, the local consumer in the present instance has' only a trifling concern. But these matters are not to be settled according to questions of degree. Neither a Government nor anybody else is entitled to stand on principle when the interests of the majority are concerned, and to abrogate principles for the sake of a wealthy minority. That is an answer to the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett). If Victoria be the most closely-populated part of the Commonwealth, it must have a. larger number of small growers of sheep than has any other State. The Age circulates amongst the wool-growers throughout Victoria, and if such a statement as that which I have read were objectionable to them they would promptly contradict it. As I understand that there are others who wish to speak to this question, I shall not delay the House further except to say that I view this proposal with some trepidation. I welcome it , however, because I believe it is "" blazing the track "" towards nationalization. I Btrongly urge on the Government that, if , as in the case of the Wheat Pool, it is found this new authority is not carrying out the original intention, the scheme should be resubmitted to Parliament immediately for amendment. It is, of course, the right of every Parliament to alter or amend its own laws; and this motion will be a law, however it may be named. If we are going to give our enemies wool on better terms than we get it ourselves, as is done in the case of wheat, then our enemies will have beaten us. The people outside axe being robbed at the present moment, and I only wish that the Government could take up the meat question. The Commonwealth could have bought 700,000 head of cattle in the Northern Territory, at an average price of 25s. per head. The people, as I said, are suffering greatly, and there is a l i m it to their suffering. We have observed how the English Government have not dared to force the people back to pre-war conditions, and neither can our people go back. If the Government were willing to spend £300,000,00 0 on war, and the killing of human beings, surely they ought to be prepared' to spend tens of .millions on the welfare of the* people. Arguments used in support of this motion are arguments against profiteering, as between buyers and sellers; and surely it is worthwhile to get the support of the publio in these movements, and show that it is the people who govern for the benefit of the people. To be successful, government must be based on the good-will of the community, and no Government can gain that good-will when there is such glaring injustice as is r if e in our midst.",65

The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page), in the oourse of his fine speech last night, made ""one statement to which I take exception. He said that representatives of metropolitan constituencies do not understand the requirements or need's of the man on the land.",66
357,Mr LAVELLE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Generally speaking.,66
358,Mr CAMERON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Perhaps that is what the honourable member for Maranoa meant. So far as I am personally concerned, although I represent a metropolitan constituency, I have always felt that one obstacle' to my carrying out that representation efficiently is the fact that I and my family, for three generations, have spent our l if e on the land, and all our interests are in the wool industry. This House, by a large majority, has approved of the principle of assisting that industry in the way requested. The motion now before the House, about which there seems to be some diversity of opinion, means, so far as I can read it , that clause a applies to wool sold to the buyer in this country and exported, and that paragraph b applies to wool which a buyer ships to England to be sold there.",66
359,Mr GREENE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,That is right.,66
360,Mr CAMERON,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"I am sure I shall not be accused of being a Jeremiah if I say that the wool industry is sick, has displayed serious symptoms of a malady which wil l be very difficult to dure. Those most interested in the industry have failed to effect a cure, and they have now come to the Government with a - call for 8154 Exportation qf [REPRESENTATIVES.] assistance. That is one point which the people of the country should understand - that those interested in the industry have made an appeal for assistance. The Government have given the scheme fore us, and all alternative schemes, the fullest consideration, and have decided accept the one put forward by Bawra, which represents the almost unanimous opinion of the industry. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) said last night that the wool industry has faced more serious situations than the present one, and referred to previous great droughts. On those occasions, howparently ever, the industry did not labour under the great burden of taxation which i does now. and it will be more difficult recover from our present troubles than difficulties. from those of the past. Some reference has been made to the cost of the production of wool, and I agree with the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Flemin ing)- that it is difficult to ascertain the them, exact figures. In the case of Queensland, - representative I cannot ascertain whether figures have been arrived at; but in 1913-14, prior to the war, the average price received' was 9Jd. per lb., and no one can deny that the cost of production since that day has increased almost 100 per cent.",66

But the honourable member for Darling is the head of a vast organization that is vitally interested, and despite all the appeals that have been made by honourable members opposite for support of the resolutions, the interests of the working class, that is to say of those most conoerned in the industry, have not received consideration. From my point view, honourable members who represent and kindred industries in this are doing just what they were 6ent here to do-lookin g after .their own inThis is an example of that process which is slowly but transforming this deliberative assembly into an industrial machine. The industrialization of society is being rethat flected in the debates in this chamber.

I in. do not stand for the existing order. who represent the particular interest concerned in I the subject, now under discussion' can settle amongst themselves whether this proposal will operate to their advantage up or disadvantage. What interests me is the fact that these gentlemen, who are so anxious to safeguard their own interests in a particular commodity, whether it be the wool, wheat, . lead, copper, or zinc, overlook the interests of the working-class population whose commodity, labour power, is subject to the same disadvantages as hitherto. We do not find these honourable gentlemen coming forward with any scheme to stabilize the labour market by holdingoff the surplus labour, known as the unemployed. On the contrary, while, in this case, there is an attempt in this House to keep up the price of wool, there is, outside, a well-arranged plan of campaign to reduce the value of the other commodity-the labour power of the workerby utilizing the surplus labour to beat down the price of labour in this country. What amuses me is that the crocodile sympathy that has been expressed during this debate for the interests of labour has now been forgotten, and labour may look after itself as best it may. My view.is that Australia's position in regard to .the sale of her primary products overseas is absolutely dependent upon the rehabilitation of Europe. We have no other market, and until Europe is reconstructed our primary products cannot be sold overseas. The result is that Australia, which was comparatively immune from the effects of the war while it lasted, is now experiencing the aftermath of the huge destruction that occurred, and is suffering from the stupidity exhibited by Allied statesmen in drawing up the economic clauses of the Peace Treaty. What has been the result of their compelling Germany to hand over large quantities of coal to France? Immediately huge armies of coal miners were thrown out of employment, and ' we have the ridiculous spectacle of France selling German coal to Britain, and displacing large bodies of coal miners in both England and France. The same thing will happen in connection with other commodities if the indemnities-as they are now called in plain language, instead of the hypocritical ""reparations""-ar e paid. Nobody believes that the indemnities will be paid in cash. They will be paid, if at all, in commodities; and how, at the same time, prosperity can be retained in the Allied countries that absorb them is a puzzle which I leave to Allied statesmen to solve. As evidence of how Allied statesmen are proceeding to stabilize Europe, I quote the following passage from the New York Nation, the chief Liberal organ in the United States of America, in regard to the Allies' dealings with one European country:The crudity with - which the Georgian Republic and the Georgian people were held up and looted is scarcely believable. There were three Allied "" missions"" in Tiflis when we arrived in the late summer of 1019, going full swing-British , French, and Italion. They were there in a blaze of warlike uniformsbankers, promoters, engineers, who had never seen a gun or heard a shot fired, and whose general's stars were shiny new-to impress the natives with their importance and authority. Their business was concession hunting-minin g rights, water rights, railway concessions, municipal contracts, land flotations, anything not nailed down. For its independence, Georgia must mortgage itself, body, boots, and breeches, for generations to come, by much the same method of protected foreign capital investment as Venizelos had pledged in Greece as the price of his continued Premiership. . . . . . Similar procedure was followed by the Allied missions over the manganese mines at Mingtelia, the tobacco-fields of Sukhum, the silk orchards of Kutais, and everything else of value or prospective value in the Georgian Republic. It was a scramble with each mission undercutting the others, intriguing, cajoling, offering bribes, of influence with the Peace Conference to obtain commercial prizes, or threatening the partition of Georgia among the other Transcaucasian States to prevent a concession going to rival interests. The British specialized in loans. A brigadier-general represented a well-known financial house in London, with the aim of tying Georgia up by some such permanent mortgage as the Anglo-Persian Agreement of August, 1919. The French specialized in mines; while the Italians, with an eye to immediate turnover, sold rifles, ammunition, and shoes, captured from the Austrians, to Georgians, Azerbaijanians, and Ar-. menians, without favouritism, to equip armies in each country to fight the other. Add in this process of exploitation, the Transcaucasian ruble (based, after all, on quite as sound a foundation as pound, franc, or lira) was hammered down by the concerted action of three great Powers, until its market value was little more than that of Confederate money. Then, with their paper pounds, francs, and lire, they bought labour at a dollar a month, and despoiled a poverty-stricken and desperate people of their last valuablesjewellery, ruga, furs, silver-whic h the Georgians were forced to sell for bread. The writer goes on to say that the same process was applied to every little nation from Poland and Greece to Aberbaijan and Siam. If that is the Allied statesmen's way of stabilizing Europe, it is no wonder that the .bottom has fallen out of the market for Australian products. What happened in Austria and Hungary ? We know there was practically an auction sale of the nation's effects. The same thing is happening in other portions of Central Europe today. Last night honourable members were bewailing the fact that the Central Powers, which were in pre-war times our greatest customers, are today buying nothing from us; and the honourable member for Cowper ('Dr Earle Page), the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), and others said that war hatreds and accusations must now be forgotten. Why? Not because they were wrong or false, but because we cannot sell our primary products to our late enemies. The process of wholesale and retail robbery of unprotected nationalities by the chief brigand powers who are controlling the World at the present time is responsible for our economic crisis. The system which made it impossible foT us to stay out of the war has landed us in the present condition of affairs and is also ing a cleavage between the Allies, and making it mathematically certain that we shall have to engage in another war to decide which of the five Allies shall have full control of the remaining plunder. I can quite understand honourable members opposite who think their interests are wrapped up im maintaining the existing order, but I cannot understand the attitude of representatives of a class who have no interest in continuing the present system, whose interests are concerned in taking such steps as will prevent this kind of trouble from perpetually recurring. The trouble is one which cannot be prevented while the present profit-making system goes on. We know that periodically these crises must recur, because of the overstocking of the world's markets. There is no protection sought for those whose labour power is rendered of no avail. The European war has thrown a blinding light on all the cir- off. cumstances, and those with eyes to see can perceive that the whole system is toppling. hearted. Europe cannot carry on with two antagonistic economic systems.",67

367,Mr CONSIDINE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"The only school in which the interests in Australia will learn is the school of hard experience in. which the other nations have had to get their knowledge. The European situation con-1 trols the position in Australia. The failure of the European markets will mean prophets.. the shutting down of industry after industry here, and if our. workers will not learn through their intelligence they will be forced fo learn through their stomachs. Then, perhaps, it will be seen that it would have been wiser to take time by the forelock. There has never been a revolution which has not been a stomach revolution. It is not the people in Australia who now advocate social reconstruction on definite lines who will be the revolutionists. Does any one believe that the Australian people will remain content with pious platitudes when large armies of unemployed are constantly growing? The incapacity of the so-called captains of industry has been plainly displayed. These people, who arrogate to themselves the right to maintain the existing order, have revealed their intellectual bankruptcy, and the causpeople will be forced to make such changes as will insure their right of existence and put an end to their slow pauperization. Honourable members have received copies of a circular from certain Australian manuf acturing interests. Therein it is pointed out that in Sydney alone there are more than 70,000 people in receipt of benevolent relief. As the circular puts it, about 10 per cent, of the city's population is receiving assistance from benevolent organizations because the people have not the means to keep themselves going.

The Government Will probably find themselves involved in lition the legal and constitutional It will, however, give us six months' additional experience, and during that time there is the possibility of arrangements being made with the Central Powers, which is, I believe, our only hope. The alternative proposal of the wool up for a couple of years is impracticable, because buyers would that a huge stock was accumulating, and that at any time it might be placed the on the market, and this would only Bawra has already made arrangements with Poland and Austria for the sale of wool a Government guarantee from those countries; and .a similar arrangement will have to be made in other directions if we are to stabilize industry. During the six months that will elapse, buyers will know that they can only purchase wool at Bawra prices, during that period Bawra will have an opportunity of making some such arrangement as I have mentioned, and of disposing of the tremendous surplus while it exists, will always be a be danger. I support the proposal rather reluctantly, and solely because it has been put forward by Bawra.",71
397,Mr LAVELLE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Calare) [10.55] - I cannot say that [ I am entirely in accord with the motion before the House. We all know that we are suffering from the effects of war, and that the real aftermath will be upon us before long. I fully realise the difficulties' confronting the Government .and the pastoral industry in disposing of our wool at a reasonable price, and I am of opinion that the present expedient will not do what the Government claim. In the first place, if it is necessary-and I think it is-to take some steps to deal with this problem, the time-limit imposed is quite inadequate, because, if this motion is carried and is in force for six months, foreign buyers will not purchase our wool during that period, because they will expect to buy at a lower price when that time has expired, and the position will then be more acute. Growers say that they require assistance, and if it happens that they are unable to sell their wool at the end of this period, the financial position would be more pressing than it is today. I recognise that Sd. per lb. is not a price which will return adequate remuneration to the producers of wool. It is all very well for the supporters of the Government and others to say that 8d. per lb. is better than a lower price, or nothing at all. If Sd. per lb. is not sufficient to show a profit and allow the grower to carry on, I cannot see how selling wool at this price will stabilize the industry. The proposal embodied in the amendment that Bawra wool should be held off the market was defeated; but efforts should be made to sell our wool on the Continent on long terms, if necessary, because that is essential if we are to do business in that direction. It is no use attempting to follow the advice of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) and his supporters not to trade with enemy countries, because in the interests of Australia, the markets of the world must be available for the sale of our products. We must not lose sight of the necessity of rendering almost immediate financial assistance to the growers, and that the Government, with the .assistance of the Commonwealth Bank, should take over the whole of the Australian wool, and make an advance to the producers, be[332] cause, unless something in that direction is done, a large number of wool-growers will be forced to' sell their holdings to the banks, or other financial institutions. That would have ,a disastrous effect upon Australia, and the wool industry generally. I am afraid that the motion before the House, if carried and given effect to, will not have the beneficial effect which the Government anticipate.",72
398,Mr LISTER,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Corio) [10.59] - I have listened with a good deal of interest to the speeches made on this important question last week, and again today. It w.as my privilege during the week-end to attend a gathering of persons very closely identified with the wool industry, and I heard them express their opinions as to what should be done to overcome the difficulties confronting us today. Among those present were, bank managers and gentlemen who for }'ears have been closely associated with the woollen industry. It is remarkable that on a question of such magnitude there should be so little difference of opinion as to the best possible means of solving the difficulty. The solution suggested was that the Government would be wise to acoept the advice given to them, and upon which they are acting, namely, to place the control of the matter entirely in the hands of Bawra. , As usual, the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), has been adversely criticised by some of our friends opposite. But no matter what he does, the right honourable gentleman meets with adverse comment from our friends, and therefore we are perhaps at liberty to take very little notice of what they have said concerning him in this respect. However, he has been blamed for not bringing this question before the people at an earlier stage, and, furthermore, for having stressed, as he did; the present financial position of Australia. But he only did his duty in bringing home to the minds of the people the actual position of affairs, and in doing so may have considered it necessary to use strong terms. I have risen, not so much with the idea, that I could add anything fresh to the discussion of this very great problem, but rather for the purpose of emphasizing the fact that the wool-growers are not the only people who are likely to suffer if our wool is not sold. Many in dustries are absolutely dependent on a. satisfactory solution of the difficulty. In the Corio electorate, hundreds of men are employed in normal seasons in industries, which are allied to pastoral pursuits, and. they in turn afford employment in various forms to many other people whose position today is becoming extremely acute- The 'Government, in coming to a decision upon this question, must realise that they are face to face with the problem of unemployment. They must confront this issue, and, if necessary, introduce legislation which may put our people once more on the high road to prosperity. I offer no apology to honourable members for making a few passing references to this question even at this late hour, because I am not one who rises at every touch and turn to get rid of a lot of hot air. The position today is very critical. A gentleman who is in a position to know what he is speaking about has told me that selling agents in Victoria who have been receiving skins from growers have been forced to send back to those growers not cash in payment for the skins, but accounts for the expenses incurred in bringing them to the market' and in disposing of them. As I had a similar experience in Queensland thirty years ago in connection with another line of produce, I have considerable sympathy for producers who are placed in that position. The Government have been well advised to place this matter entirely in the hands of those who have proved their capacity to handle it by reason of the fact that they have been extremely successful in their own businesspursuitsI am sure that they will keep a close eye, not only upon the interests of the growers, whose cause has been so ably championed in this Chamber, but .also upon the needs of people in other industries dependent upon the pastoral industry. Some honourable members have made reference to the disposal of a portion of our clip to the Central Powers of Europe. There are many' people in my own electorate, as no doubt there are all over the Commonwealth-rand I wasjust as narrow in my views a few'months ago as they are today-who have strong objection to trading with Germany at any price. But the conditions which obtain today are very different from those which prevailed during"" the war, and when we rememberthat France, which Mr Lister. suffered so much from Germany, has for a considerable time past been trading with that country, I think we ought to look upon this question with a wider outlook. The only danger I perceive in the disposal of our Wool to Germany is the possibility that there may be a. tendency to accept German goods in exchange for it. We must be extremely careful to see that we do not encourage the dumping of goods in Australia.. We owe a duty to our people here in this regard Many of the industries which have been built up in Australia during the war through the protection afforded to us by reason;of the high shipping freights then prevailing, and the lack of production overseas, would - be ruined or endangered if we allowed the dumping of great quantities 1 of stuff already manufactured in Germany, and only awaiting the opportunity to be disposed of. I trust that the suc^ cess of the Bawra scheme will be all we hope it will be, and that the darkness which seems to have overshadowed the pastoral industry and the community generally will pass away speedily, so that the Commonwealth may emerge once ' more into the sunlight of prosperous days. .",72
399,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Gwydir) [11.10]. - I have read with a good deal of interest the proposals embodied in the motion submitted by the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook). I have no desire to enter upon a discussion of the legal side pf the question; but I may say that we are pleased to observe that the Government have at last been converted to the legal principles laid down by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Ryan), who has long contended that the Government have power to prevent profiteering by taking action in this direction 'under the Customs Act. In another place yesterday afternoon,. I heard followers; of the Government express opinions very adverse to this method o-f giving effect tp the Bawra scheme. It was foreshadowed that costly litigation might result from giving effect to the proposal by means of a proclamation issued under the Customs Act. We have not the last word in the interpretation of the Constitution. The opinion of the High Court of Australia may be invoked,, and two or three months hence we may have an'injunction issued toi restrain the Commonwealth Government from, going on with the scheme. Inthat event, endless complications would arise, and great losses would be sustained, not ,only by the Government, but by those who had acted in the belief that this exercise of authority was within, the law. I would urge the Acting Prime Minister to consider the desirableness of placing on the Bawra executive a representative of the Government, to protect the interests of the taxpayers of Australia who have been induced through Parliament in this way to grant assistance. It is an old axiom that there should be no taxation without representation, and no body should have - the assistance of Parliament unless the Parliament is represented upon its executive. We should have on the Board a Government representativea disinterested authority fro m whom we may obtain all the information we require - Those who are at present controlling Bawra might have reasons for not supplying us with accurate information as to the transactions that take place, and since the Government have 'intervened in this way, it would be wise to have a Government representative on the executive - wool, and thereby preventing a glut in I desire now to point out> that the orable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) was under a misapprehension in the view that he took concerning the amendment which I brought forward this too afternoon, and which he voted against, believing that if it were carried i have the effect of withholding wool fro the ragged and ill-clothed people of Cencould t r a l Europe. I thought I had made it very clear that the idea behind my proposal was not by any means to withhold our wool from those peoples. I pointed out that, quite apart from that held by Bawra, there would be sufficient Australay lian wool to supply the needs of the Centhe tral European countries. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) also saiii that there Would' probably be more than sufficient to supply the legitimate needs - of Central Europe, without using any of our carry-over wool, and that looms there would be kept working at f u pressure for the next two years by means of our present clip and the clip in The honourable . member for Melbourne, however, drew a picture of the situation which suggested that we were rather hardlent hearted in voting for such' an' amendment. I think the utterances of the honourable members of the Labour party as to the need for the restoration of trade with Germany and' our other one-time enemies-regardin g the need for breaking down the senseless hostility exhibited by the Prime M i nister and his followers here-shoul d be sufficient to convince every one that those of us who voted for the amendment had no such object in view. We voted for the amendment to withhold' supplies of Bawra wool, only because of our desire to Save Australian' producers. Figures could be produced if nedessary to show that there is sufficient wool without drawing on the carry-over, to supply the needs '>f Central Europe. The Commonwealth should have taken up a strong stand in regard to this matter. The Government should not have allowed it to go forth that we were so lacking in statesmanship that we could not deal with our own affairs. I 'believe that the transmission of a report by cable that a section of this Parliament was in favour of buying out Britain's interest in the Bawra the market, has been responsible for the honkeen competition at the recent sales. We all know that if a man in business gets downhearted, .and believes that he cannot recover himself, every one else is only please] to "" p ut the boot into him , "" whereas a bold front often carries a man t would through. And so with the Commonm wealth. I believe that the Commonwealth finance any scheme to save the woolproducers of Australia. An y one who says otherwise is a traitor to Australia's in terests, and is not taking a right stand - in the interests of our primary producers. At this late hour I do not intend to dethe House further, except to say that scheme brought in by the Government, in my opinion, is utterly impracticable. It will involve such all enormous amount of detailed work in - following up the various transactions in connection with the sales of wool that it must inevitably break the down of its own weight. In paragraph b l l of the motion it is provided that wool may be exported if security is given to the view. satisfaction of the Minister thatThe - wool will not be sold either publicly or privately at a price lower than the equivaof the price agreed upon as the official reserve. It wiH. be quite possible for people to give the necessary guarantee, and then to fix up bogus sales on the other side of the world which will enable them to sell at the whatever price they pleased. Soutb Wales the Minister for Lands will not agree to a transfer where exorbitant prices have been paid for improvement leases or a preferential right to holders of'land. But although it would be very hard to prove, I believe there are men patient fixing up bogus sales, because much of land so held is worth an enormous price. They are prepared to make declarations the price they are paying is not exorbipassing tant, although the price actually paid them is excessive. In the same way, so long as private sales of wool can be carto ried out under paragraph b, bogus transand actions will be possible; people will be pared to swear anything in order to tain this wool, and arrange sales to suit themselves. The details involved such that it will be impossible for organization which the Government can set up to follow the wool through all ramifications from the time it leaves the producer t ill it reaches the manufacturer.",73
400,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,Bawr a can look after,75
401,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Then i have to look after it better than it has one. done. So far as we know we have authoritative information from Bawra; and before the whole of the wool is sold, it will probably be found necessary for Royal Commission to inquire into its operations. I hope the Government will insist on having a representative of liament on the executive of Bawra, in order that we may be kept informed by somebody who has not the same interests as Sir John Higgins and Sir A r t h u r finch, and who should have the interests of the great mass of the of Australia at heart. I shall oppose the motion for the reasons I have outlined. I shall not be surprised if the Government, in a short time, have to come to this House seeking for some amendment of this proposal; nor shall I be surprised if the High Court is moved, and the whole scheme blocked.",75
402,Dr EARLE PAGE,BRITISH ARMY ACT A ND,"Cowper) [11.88]. - I think the proposals in this motion are much more satisfactory as a basis on which the Customs authorities can work than the mere passing of a motion to print a paper. I agree with the view that has been expressed that the proposals before us in the for m of a motion are much more valuable than they would be in for m of a Bill , because, the motion In New permits, if necessary, of Government action to abrogate the conditions. The Government are to be congratulated on the view they have taken, and on the fact that they are willin g to accept expert opinion. The wool industry is like a in a very serious condition, and it the is much more advisable in such circumstances to accept the views of an eminent that physician rather than those of some quack. The honourable member by for Hunter (Mr Charlton) expressed the opinion that, instead of allowing experts operate on the patient, we should wait let the patient die or get better. I preregret very much that it has been necesobsary to bring this matter before the House; and it would not have been necesare sary except for the fact that unanimity any could not be obtained amongst those actually interested outside. To secure that its unanimity from only a small percentage of the growers- a forced. unanimity, it is true-i e the only reason why we are called upon to deal with the question. It is it . said that what we are doing is layt will ing down a precedent, and a bad But in the previous precedents no quoted, in which the Customs Acthas been strained, or, as some say, not strained but properly used, it was ala ways practically ordinary Ministerial action that was taken. On this occasion, the concurrence of both Houses of ParParliament is being sought before action is taken. I venture to think that if in the future, when action of this kind is desired by the Government, and as free a Golddiscussion takes place as now, the public will have no ground to complain that the people matter is not thoroughly ventilated. There are one or two points in regard to which I would like to place my opinion on record. The actual words 'of paragraph a will net, in my opinion, have-the effect that it has been sought to show they will have on the small buyer. I take it we are dealing entirely with a matter of export; and if it is necessary to make the meaning more clear by inserting other words, I am quite agreeable to that course. To me, however, that course seems to be unnecessary. I take it that machinery will be provided to permit of shipping from any port in the Commonwealth where ships can call.
