2,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I have received from Adelaide a telegram which states that there.are about 1,500 tons of chaff on the wharf at Port Adelaide, which is part of an immense purchase made by the people of New South Wales to tide over the severe drought from which they are now suffering. They bave bought a standing crop, leaving agents to make provision for the transport and the shipping of the chaff, but they cannot get it taken away for lack of' vessels, and they are losing their stock daily. As this is a matter of UTgeney, I ask the Prime Minister if he will make a special case of it, and do what is possible to relieve the drought-stricken people of 'New South Wales by putting vessels aside especially for the conveyance of this chaff?",19
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I recognise the importance and urgency of the matter, and shall consult with the Controller this afternoon to see what can be done.  ister aware that there are about 5,000 tons of chaff on the wharf at Fremantle awaiting shipment to New South Wales, and that there are no ships available to take it away? Will the right honourable gentleman endeavour to make shipping available so that the requirements of New South Wales may be supplied? MT. HUGHES - I shall . bring the matter before the Controller.",19
4,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Is the Prime Minister aware that there are millions- I use the word advisedly-of feet of log timber lying at various railway sidings in the Cairns hinterland awaiting transport to the south ?

5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Yes . ALLOCATION OF COAL.,19
6,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Has the Minister for the Navy read in the newspapers the complaints about the allocation of coal? Certain working men in my district complain that the allocation hy Mr MCGowan prevents some firms from getting a fair share of coal. It is said that firms which have been carting coal for years do not now get any coal allocated to them for carting.. Will the Minister see Mr MCGowan, with a view to remedying these complaints? It is not fair that one firm or individual should be dealt with differently from another.",20
7,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I suspect that the trouble has arisen by reason of the granting of priority. When there is not coal enough to go round, certain industries, those most vital to the nation, must have the first preference, and the complaints may bave been caused in that way. I shall be glad to have the whole matter investigated. I have not seen the report, but, if there is any trouble, we must try to remove it. PASSPORT FOE MR. GEORGESON.",20
8,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Has an application been made to the Minister for Home and Territories, on behalf of Mr Georgeson, for permission to leave the country, and, if so, has it been granted?  received by the Department from Mr. Georgeson for passports which would enable him to leave for New Zealand with a nurse and anattendant, so that he might undergo there a course of treatment at some mineral springs. The application was strongly supported by medical opinion. Thereupon I gave instructions that the law officers of New South Wales were to be asked whether Mr Georgeson was required in Australia, and their reply being in the affirmative, I decided that no passport was to be issued.

There was some doubt as to the legal power of the Commonwealth to supply electricity for other than Federal Capital purposes, but after consultation with the Commonwealth Law Department, the Queanbeyan Municipal Council was advised that electric current would be delivered at the boundary of the Territory on certain conditions. The council has intimated its concurrence in the proposed. The Treasury has provided the necessary funds, and the work will be put in hand without delay. 2.

26,Mr RILEY,PERMANENT OFFICERS ON HOME SERVICE,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon nolice1. Is it the intention of the Government to recognise, or reward in any way, the services of permanent officers who rendered such valuable assistance in the organization of our Forces in Australia in the early stages of the"" war? 2. Is it the intention of the Government to dispense with the services of permanent officers who, in the early stages of the war, volunteered for active service, but were prevented from going abroad, as their services were indispensable at that time for local organizing purposes? 3. Is it a fact that permanent officers of long service and with excellent records are having their cases considered by the Military Board, with a view to their retirement from the Service? 4.

The services of all permanent officers, such RS are mentioned, have received due recognition, and, where necessary, due reward. 2.

This is the case only where officers have or are about to reach the retiring age, except in the case of certain officers who did not apply for active service in the great war. These latter cases are under consideration. 4. In all such cases, it is the invariable rule that the Minister considers the recommendabefore action is taken. 5.

29,Mr MACKAY,PERMANENT OFFICERS ON HOME SERVICE,"the Minister representing tihe Minister for Defence, upon notice Whether it is a fact that certain discharged members of the Australian Imperial Force remaining in military hospitals are receiving pensions only, whereas other returned soldiers are having their pensions made up to field rank pay?",22
30,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,PERMANENT OFFICERS ON HOME SERVICE,"Approva l has been given .that in the case of members who had been discharged from the Australian Imperial Porce to pension and who were still in hospital on 25th February, 1919, or in the case of those who, on or after 25th February, 1919, were readmitted to hospital after discharge suffering from a recurrence of genuine war disabilities, the rate of pension would he made up to the rate of pay drawn by such members prior to discharge from the Australian Imperial Force for the period whilst in hospital. Instructions to give effect to tfhis approval were issued some time ago, but it is understood that difficulty has been experienced in obtaining the information required, by the Pensions Department, and consequently there has been occasional delay in carrying out the approval.",23
31,Mr MACK AY,PERMANENT OFFICERS ON HOME SERVICE,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Whether the war leave payment in the estate of a deceased soldier is rightly refused under the regulations in the case of a relation such as a sister who is the sole beneficiary under a will, but classed as ""not wholly dependent "" ? 2. If so, will the Minister reconsider the regulation that penalizes the relatives of deceased soldiers? Sir GRANVIL LE RYRIE - The answers to tihe honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The disallowal of the war leave payment in the case of a relation, such as a sister, who is the sole beneficiary under the late soldier's will, but who was not wholly dependent on the deceased, is in accordance with the regulation governing this payment. The payment is an act of grace, and is only made on the grounds of relationship - to a beneficiary who was the parent, wife, or child of the deceased soldier. In all other cases the condition controlling the payment is dependency, and if such cannot be proved a beneficiary in the estate is not eligible. 2. For the reasons stated in the foregoing answer, it is not proposed to amend the regulation. NA NATIONALS .",23

General, being still in suspense, and, further, that by Article 297 of . the Treaty of Peace this suspension is recognised-Is it the intention of the Government to accept renewal applications from the registered proprietors, or are the registrations to lapse? 2. Is it the intention of the Government to release registered trade marks of German nationals from the existing suspension in favour of the Attorney-General; and, if so, when? 3.

34,Mr JOWETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. If, in view of the great inconvenience felt by travellers in the country districts of Australia in passing through small townships and hamlets without knowing the names of such places, and also in order to be able to usefully employ the services of returned soldiers who have learned sign-writing in the vocational schools, will the Government take steps to have the names of all post offices, telegraph offices, and receiving offices painted by returned soldiers on sign plates in large letters, so that travellers throughout Australia may know where they are without having to stop and ask? 2. Also, if he will endeavour to co-operate with the six State Governments in order to have the locality names painted hy returned soldiers upon similar sign plates posted conspicuously upon all State schools in Australia?",23
35,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The indication to travellers of the names of townships and hamlets throughout Australia is a matter for the local municipal authorities. There is no objection to their placing such indication on the post office building in each case if it is considered the most conspicuous place. 2. This matter is also outside the province of the Postmaster-General's Department.,23
36,Mr MAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Postmaster General, upon notice Whether he will, before the Easter adjournment, state the definite date of his proposed visit to Port Adelaide in respect to the selection of a site for the new post office for that city?",23

What has caused the delay in the adoption of the recommendations of the Economies Commission's report? 5. Will the Minister advise the House of the policy of the Government as regards the adoption in whole or in part, and which, of the recommendations of the Economies Commission? 6. What recommendations is it proposed that the Government should not adopt? 7. Is it proposed that the Department shall be administered by a Commission; and, if so, what number of members is proposed? 8.

39,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: The first progress report of the Economy Commission, so far as it relates to this Department, was dealt with by my predecessor in a report laid on the table of Parliament on 21st October, 1919, to which I would direct the attention of the honourable member. The whole matter, as will be seen on reference to the remarks of the right honourable the Prime Minister and the right honourable the Treasurer in Parliament on 10th March, 1920, is under . consideration of the Government.

44,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Y a r r a ) [ 3 . 2 2 ] - I am as anxious a3 any other honourable member that we should complete our consideration of the War Gratuity Bill tomorrow, so that honourable members may leave for their homes, and not have to return u n t i l after the Easter holidays. At the same time. I do not wish the passing of this motion to be accepted as a precedent that standing order 241 can be suspended without protest at any time merely because there is a majorit y behind the Government. The procedure under that standing order affords members the only opportunity they have to ventilate grievances, except when a Supply Bill is before the House, and, as a rule, such measures are hurriedly dealt with. I suggest .to the Prime Minister that it would be advisable not to pass this motion today. If state of business demanded it , the . ROBERT Government, as soon as the question, "" That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair, and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply,"" was proposed tomorrow, could move the adjournment of the debate in order that we might, proceed with the War Gratuity Bill . I dislike late sittings, but it is extremely I>robable that we shall have a late sitting to-night. The chances are that if we sit until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m."" the suggestion will be made that we pass the Bill through all its stages before adjourning, and that we should not resume u n t i l 2 p.m. The War Gratuity Bill having heen disposed of honourable members would then be able to ventilate grievances.

45,Mr MAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Hindmarsh) [3.26] - I move That the following words be left out:"" 'Member of the Auxiliary Service' means a member of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade, Royal Australian Naval Brigade Staff, or Royal Australian Naval Radio Service, and includes any person appointed for permanent naval duty on shore;"" The adoption of this amendment will bring, within the scope of the Bill many who today feel that they are entitled to PAPERS. participate in its benefits. I refer particularly to those who are engaged in the Royal Australian Naval Brigade, the Royal Australian Naval Brigade Staff, and the Royal Australian Naval Radio Service. As I pointed out during the entitled second-reading debate, there are in the Naval Service of Australia men whose services were retained 'here during the war at the pleasure, of the Department. They feel that an undue hardship is placed, upon them since, because they were compelled to remain here, as desired by the Department, they are not to. participate in this gratuity. There were issued to the wireless men certificates setting out that they had done their duty equally with those who went abroad. These men signed an undertaking that they would join the fighting forces if called upon to do so, and their services were such as should commend them to the favourable consideration of the Committee. I believe that there are sup(Paper preporters of the Government who will vote for this amendment, and since I desire to expedite the consideration of the Bill I shall say no more than that I trust that the Committee will recognise the justice of this claim on behalf of those who were actively engaged in war-like service during the war period, but whose services were retained in the Commonwealth.",25
46,Sir ROBERT BEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Kooyong) [3.29]. - I desire to make a reference to an earlier definition in the clause.,25
47,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH," Then it will be necessary for Aus- the amendment to be temporarily withdrawn. Amendment,, by leave, temporarily withdrawn.",25
48,Sir ROBERT BEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In this clause ""Member of the Forces"" is defined as meaning(6) a member of the Military Forces enlisted for the duration of the war or appointed without limitation of time, I have in mind the position of several men who were high up in the m i l it a r y service, and particularly that of a colonel who had the responsibility of trainin g troops at Broadrneadows, and was subsequently placed in charge of some three transports. It was his duty to take charge of the men on board the transports, which were armed for defence. He had to undergo the risks of submarine attack, and for all practical purposes the ship was portion of the battle front so far as he was concerned. Men of this class were chosen because of their military knowledge and experience, and some of them travelled on three or four transports, and were engaged on military service for a period of between three and four years. They claim that they fought in the same way as did the men in the trenches, and that they are entitled to the same consideration. By the words in the definition of a member of the Forces, "" appointed without limitation of time, "" they are excluded from the benefits of this Bill . The striking out of the words might possibly have a wider effect than I desire to achieve, but I ask the Prime Minister to take into consideration the claims of these men.",25
49,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.33] - The two honourable members who have spoken have raised a question of considerable i m portance, and I should like to set out the views of the Government in regard to the classes of persons referred to, because more than one class is likely to be affected by any amendment that might be made. I know of no measure that was ever submitted to the people in greater detail than was this proposal to pay a gratuity. Certainly no measure was ever more exposed to the limelight of public criticism. Those who were members of the last Parliament will recollect that I announced that the Government had discussed with the executive of the Returned Soldiers' League, not only the principle of a gratuity, but also the manner in which the principle should be applied. A general election followed close upon the heels of the statement made by me in the last Parliament, and as a result of the appeal to the people on this particular matter, a number of facts emerge quite clearly. Certain persons were included in the proposed gratuity and certain others were excluded. I shall mention later the reasons which actuated the Government and the soldiers in the inclusion of certain classes and the exclusion of others. But for the present I am more concerned with emphasizing the fact that these distinctions were clearly presented to the people during the election campaign, and the people, in cluding the soldiers, who were the persons most concerned, affirmed both the principles that are set out in this Bill and the manner of their application'. It is obvious that we are dealing with large sums of public money. Recently we have heard a good deal about the consumer in regard to the purchasing of commodities, and very properly so. Now we must consider the taxpayer, and whilst we have heard lately, as is quite proper, much of the grievances and the claims of different sections of the public, every one of us in this House is a representative of the taxpayers, and we are in duty bound to consider their interests. Now it must be perfectly clear to the Committeethat once we open the door to this gratuity it will be impossible to let in only that particular class that any honourable member has in mind. Others will come in, for the distinction between each class of person is so vague and slight that we cannot distinguish or in justice exclude any if we admit one. I take the cases mentioned by the honourable members for Hindmarsh (Mr . Makin) and Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) - member s of the Naval Reserve, and others who were appointed as drill in structors, and in charge of transports. No' one denies that those men did yeoman service, but we are not proposing a gratuity for the doing of service in relation to the war. This gratuity is the outward and. visible testimony of the nation's, gratitude to men who rendered a certain kind of service. It may be fairly said that if any one of us was given a choice of remaining in Australia and getting no gratuity, or being placed in the battle line and risking death every hour of the day, and being paid a gratuity of Is. 6d. for every one of the days on which he might have been blown to atoms, there is not one of us, not even the bravest of the brave, who would not say, "" Give me the quiet home fireside.""",26
50,Sir ROBERT BEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Thes e men did not say that.,26
51,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Suppos e it is said that they were willing to go.,26
52,Sir ROBEET BEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,But they did go.,26
53,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Some did go, and, of course, there were tens of thousands of men who were willing to go.. Some, however, were medically unfit; they could not go. Some were needed in this country; they could not go. But honourable members contend that because they were willing to go, they should receive the gratuity. That is not the principle underlying this measure. The payment of the gratuity is not to be in recognition of intentions and motives, but of services actually rendered, and not every kind of service, but of services of a certain character. And, if we are honest with ourselves, we must say that those who rendered this particular kind of service axe worthy of a regard at least 'beyond those who rendered any other kind of service. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) stated that some of the men of whom he was speaking were over forty-five years of age, and that, therefore, they, could . not enlist. I suppose there were thousands who found themselves in the same position. But he points out, further, that these men made voyages to Europe on armed vessels. As for that, I myself made voyages to Europe during the height of the submarine campaign on vessels that were .armed. Every munition worker went on board armed ships Every munition worker took the same risk in journeying to Great Britain as did every member of the Australian Imperial Force who sailed overseas. But it was a very different kind of risk, a very different service, comparing the risk of the munition worker on shipboard with the risk of the men of the Australian I m ' perial Force at the Front, and of those who manned the Australian battle fleet. With respect to those who complain that their services are not now being recognised in the same way as those of the members of the Australian Imperial Force, all I can say is that for the services which they rendered this country is grateful. But those services cannot he classed for one moment alongside the services given by the fighting members of the Australian Forces. I admit that all members of the Australian Imperial Force may not have rendered equal service or .have been exposed to the same risks., but it is impossible to draw distinctions between individuals. We must deal with classes; and, under the principle contained in this Bill, all members of the Australian Imperial Force will be treated alike. The general will get no more than the private. My gallant and distinguished friend sitting beside me (Sir Granville Ryrie) will get only Is. 6d. a day, and the private will get no more. I suppose,- by the way, that in the days to come generals will think themselves lucky if they get one-twentieth of that which will be apportioned to the private; but those days have not yet arrived. The next point I desire to stress is that the principles in this Bill, and the application of those principles, were discussed during the election campaign and approved by the people. I regret that there should be dissatisfaction, but that is inevitable. It was certain that some would have to - be excluded. I do not deny that some men have been excluded who have rendered great service to the Commonwealth. It is very hard to draw a line and to say that all those upon the one side shall be getting nothing, while the whole of those on the other side shall receive the gratuity. For example, I do not deny the difficulty of distinguishing between the cases of members of the Australian Imperial Force who had not left Australia before the armistice, and members of the Royal Naval Brigade, or of the Garrison or Permanent Artillery. All I say is that the members of the Australian Imperial Force who had not left Australia prior to the armistice enlisted nevertheless for active service abroad. Happily for us, and for the world, the war terminated, and they were not called upon to go overseas. Members of the Garrison Artillery who waited on me - a splendid type of men-declare d that they were willing, and always had been throughout the war, to go abroad.",27
54,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Some actually deserted from the Garrison Artillery and enlisted for active service under other names, and won honours.",27
55,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is interesting; but I am soTry that, in my official capacity, I listened to the interjection. The fact is that, remaining here, they rendered splendid service. The members of the Permanent Artillery had to stay where they were told to stay; it was a matter of life and death to Australia that they should have done so. In remaining where they were told to stay, however, can it be said that they took risks which compare with those of the men who went into the very jaws of death? Are not these latter worthy of some more recognition than the others? That is the point. The electors have had ample opportunity to discuss the principles of this Bill . They have approved them, and I now ask honourable members not to i m pose additional burdens upon the Australian taxpayers. The principles underlying the Bill are that the gratuity shall be paid to certain classes of persons, and in the form cf non-negotiable bonds; and those principles cannot be departed from. The extent to which the bonds may be cashed is also settled, and cannot be enlarged. The people, with some misgivings, perhaps, have assented to the distribution of some £28,000,000. They have given the Government no mandate to spend one penny more, and I trust that this Parliament will jealously guard the disbursement of the people's money. It will be a difficult matter to raise the millions which will be required in order to cash bonds as provided for in the Bill.. To further extend cash payments will be impossible; at any rate, to do so would be fraught with disaster. I ask honourable members, therefore, while they may desire .to extend the scope of this measure, to recognise that this is not one which emanated merely from the Government, but is a Bill which, in all essentials, has been submitted to, and approved by, the people. The Government is charged with the duty of raising the money necessary to pay a gratuity to those who are eligible under this measure. The Government is making provision in respect to the sum covered by the Bill . Beyond that, I say, with regret, that the Government cannot go.",27

She was submarined in the Medifor terranean, where she was sent for a tain purpose. Some of her men were captured by the Turks and transported into the interior.",29

I volunteered on three occasions, was refused twice, and accepted as a gunlayer at the third attempt. I was drafted to a troopship carrying Australian troops, and made three trips carrying United States troops to England afterwards. I had thirteen months, abroad out of two years, and was discharged at the end of hostilities. The result is that I am completing my trade, which I would have completed two years previously, having lost the difference between 6s. a day and 14s.

98,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"He is guided by the provisions of the Bill . It is very peculiar that the honourable member for H in d marsh (Mr Makin), in order to obtain what he desires, has to delete the definition of "" member of the AuxiliaryService,"" in paragraph.6 of clause 2, which includes the men on the Royal Australian Naval Brigade Staff. I quote the following letter . from a member of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade: Members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade were compelled to take this ship (Barambah), with 1,300 troops, overseas. The for master of the ship was a naval officer. The men were lined up, and as this officer read his commission to them, the first officer and the chief engineer were given temporary naval commissions, so as to command naval ratings, All offences committed on the ship were punished after arrival back at Melbourne, according to the King's Rules and Regulations. They would not give us merchant service discharges, because we were naval ratings, under naval discipline.",30

From there I joined the No. 2 Australian hospital ship Kanowna, and served abroad through all danger zones, working the alongside Australian Imperial Force men, and doing the same duties. I was discharged after doing over two years' service. I would like to state that there are other men who served on men-of-war belonging to the Royal Australian Naval Brigade, and worked alongside permanent men, and we are cut out of the war gratuity.

That includes mine-layers, those engaged in patrolling the coast of Australia in search of raiders, gun-layers, and signallers on transports. The wireless men are not included, as they were not members of the Naval Forces.

121,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I think that the man engaged in laying a gun has the first chance of being hit with a shell. However, it will not avail us much to inquire who incurred the greater risk. The question we have to consider is ""To what arm of the service does any man belong?"" A stoker is a pure civilian.",31

If the payment of the gratuity depended upon the amount of risk that was incurred by different individuals many members of our mercantile marine would be entitled to it. They incurred much more risk than did many of the men who were upon active service. But we have to draw the line of demarcation somewhere. As the Prime Minister has explained, this gratuity is intended to be a fighting gratuity. We would like to include all the cases which have been mentioned if we could afford to do so, but unfortunately we cannot. I wish that I knew where all the millions of which honourable members opposite speak so glibly, are to be found. I do not mind telling my honourable friends that I shall require some of those millions next year. I hope, therefore, that I shall be shown just where these millions are to be picked up prior to the framing of our next Budget.

The statement of the right honourable gentleman means, if it means anything, that no amendments can be made to this measure. If a majority of the Committee decide that certain amendments are necessary, the Government, it appears, will disclaim responsibility, and will refuse to proceed with the measure.

I listened, so far as I was able, the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr. and to subsequent speeches, and am at a loss to understand the line of and demarcation which the Prime Minister draws. H a said a distinction was made with regard to the payment of the grai n tuity, based upon the kind of service renSo far as I remember, that is the He just meaning of his remarks. I am at a loss beto see the difference between the kind of to service rendered, say, by a soldier who went to Rabaul, and a seaman engaged on a transport in the war zone, where there was great danger from submarines. Greater risk was attached to that k in d of service than to the other. The Prime - Minister also says that we have to cona supsider the taxpayer. We were told, in the second-reading debate, that the country could not stand payment of the grat u it y in cash, and that payment would have to be in bonds. We are now told I that not even in bonds can the gratuity be paid to seamen and others. I should like to know what the estimate is of the Geradditional expenditure that would - be in a warcurred through the carrying of, the amendment moved by the honourable l l say member for Hindmarsh.

If the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) or the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) would be good' enough, to furnish rae with an estimate of the probable additional ipenditure, I should be better able to judge whether this great concern for the taxpayer is genuine.",34
160,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"North Sydney-Assistant Minister for Defence) [4.34] - I do not know that I can give - the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) an estimate of what this amendment would mean. It would be very hard for anybody to estimate it , but, in my opinion, it would mean a great many millions of pounds. If the amendment - were carried it would open the door to every naval man, of every description, in Australia, whether he went to the war or not, and whether he served on land or on shore. If the amendservice. ment were carried, we could not possibly leave out the garrison artillery and the other permanent artillery, who are equally due for consideration. After we had done that, we could not leave out any man on the transports. We could not leave out the munition workers, or the seamen, or any of the nursing sisters. Ln fact, we could not leave out any one who served in a naval or military capacity in Australia. If we opened the door in one direction, therefore, would not that mean millions and millions of pounds extra? The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) knows that I am in sympathy with this movement. I undertake to say that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) is sincere in wishing to do the very best possible for the returned soldiers in the matter of the gratuity. I go further, and say that if I thought the Prime Minister was not sincere, or that the Government were not sincere, in attempting to do their very best for the returned soldiers, tak- men. ing into consideration the necessity for not unduly creating a greater burden of taxation on the people of Australia, or an unnecessarily greater burden, than they have to bear at the present time, I would not support the Prime Minister, nor would I serve under him. Honourable members will admit that I am sincere »egarding the gratuity, and would like to include all those people whom honourable members opposite have mentioned.",35
161,Mr RYAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Does the Minister deny that the seamen are just as deserving some that are included? Sir GRANVILL E RYRIE - No , I do not deny it for a moment; but many men will be left out of this Bill ex- who are just as deserving as those who are in it. I say, deliberately, that many such men will be left out; but it is necessary to draw the line of demarcation somewhere.",35
162,Mr RYAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Whateve r is given should be distributed amongst the equally deserving. Sir GRANVILL E RYRIE - We cannot lay down that principle.

165,Sir GRANVILL ERYRIE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I ' am sympathetic towards the people who have been left out, 'but to include them would be to do an injustice to the taxpayers of Australia, and we have to consider them as a whole. Many hundreds of thousands of people had no relatives at the war, and had nothing to do with the war, but many thousands of men wished to go to the war, and were greatly disappointed at not being able to go. All those people are now to be taxed to give a gratuity to men who were in a different position from themselves.",35

Mr .JAMES PAGE - There would have been no taxpayers if it had not been for the seamen. Sir GRANVILL E RYRIE - Quite so; if it had not been for some of them. In my opinion, the carrying of the amendment would mean that we. could not debar any member of the naval or military services in Australia, we could as not leave out the munition workers, we could not leave out the seamen on transports, and we could not leave out any of the wireless men. In fact, many thousands of men could claim to have just as good a right to come in under the provisions of the Bill. It is impossible for the Government to include everybody, and I think honourable members opposite know it. I regret that this measure should be regarded as so contentious, and that honourable members opposite should seek to gain some notoriety by bringing forward amendments which they would' not have carried out, or attempted to carry out, had they been on this side of the House.",35

Many of these men did good service.. While on my feet, I should like to make clear an interjection that I uttered while the Prime Minister was speaking. I stated that there were men who, in their desire to enlist, deserted. The men I had in mind were members, not of the Permanent Artillery, but of the Garrison Artillery.

"" War worker "" means a person retained by the Commonwealth Defence Department for war service occupation abroad. It is necessary to move for the insertion of definitions of "" munition worker"" and "" war worker"" in this clause, so that later I may move an amendment to enable these persons to participate in the war gratuity, and perhaps I may be permitted now to indicate the justification for this course. The Prime Minister has stated that the qualification for participation in the war gratuity is the being involved in war risks. During my second-reading speech I mentioned that the secretary to the Munition Workers Association of South Australia was located at a place in England over which there were forty-five air raids during the time that he was employed there in the manufacture of war material. who were the enemies of our country at that time made a target of such places.",37

August, 1914, and before the 11th November, 1918, and the succeeding paragraph provides that the gratuity may be paid to a member of the Naval Forces, other than a member of the auxiliary service, who did not serve in a sea-going ship between the same dates. Thus the gratuity will be payable to many persons who did not leave the shores of Australia, and. made no sacrifices. Many munition workers to whom the gratuity is not to be paid, according to the decision of the Committee just recorded, made very big sacrifices to serve during the war in the capacity in which they were employed. There is no provision in the Bill for the payment of the gratuity to those who served in hospital ships in the Mediterranean Sea and the North Sea. Yet it is proposed to pay it to persons who served in - a seagoing ship on the coast of Australia, and did not leave the shores of Australia. Last night the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) mentioned the case of those PAIRS. who were engaged in mine-sweeping on Watt, W. A. the Australian coast. There are quite a number of members of the Naval Forces who served on the seas in a sea-going ship, but did not go beyond the shores of Australia. They made no sacrifice; they did not enter into any danger zone; and they have no justification for expecting to receive a gratuity. I wish to test the feeling of the Committee upon the question of the payment of the gratuity to men who did not leave the shores of Australia.",38

185,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I want to give the gratuity only to those who made great sacrifices. Some persons went to the war for love of adventure, and others for various other reasons, but the great majority of those who enlisted, and went away to fight, made enormous sacrifices. In many cases men left their homes with scarcely sufficient provision for their wives and families. Oftentimes the wives, and' even the children, were obliged to seek for work. Others who enlisted were 'preparing for examinations and cleared off without finishing their studies. It was a marvellous response we' had from those who went away, and we cannot give them too much in return.",38

I propose to move to amend subclause 1, paragraph a, by the deletion of the words ' ' served in a sea-going ship'' with .a view to inserting other words in lieu thereof. I do not think that the Minister will treat such an amendment as an endeavour to be at cross purposes with the Government. I am moving it as a matter of principle. Honourable members will realise that there is nothing of the nature of vote catching in it . There are bound to be numbers of people in my constituency who, although engaged in various avenues of war work, will not receive gratuities under this Bill , and may be omitted if my suggestion be agreed to. I would rather see the gratuity in creased to those who made sacrifices than pay it to those who remained in Australia in good johs taking no risk, and making no sacrifices.",38

The men in whom I am specially interested are Royal Australian Naval Brigade ratings and the Royal Australian Naval Brigade staff. I know of several members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade staff who were employed as instructors, and volunteered for service overseas, but were not accepted. They were detailed to do duty on vessels outside the Heads, and had, amongst other things, to examine German vessels that were to be interned. They placed themselves at the disposal of the Department, to be sent wherever the Depart-' ment pleased, and to perform whatever duties were required of them. One of these men showed me a returned sailor's badge, which had been given to him by the Department, showing that he had done what was evidently regarded as active service.",39

193,Mr MAXWELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Ordinaril y duties of these men were on shore, but they had to go outside the Heads during the war, and to do what was dangerous work. Some of the young fellows of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade ratings waited on me recently, and I made a note of one or two of their cases, which I desire to bring before the Minister, with the object of ascertaining whether these young fellows, by the words to which exception is taken, are excluded from the operation of the Bill. One young man, to whom I shall refer as ""A"", had 'the Royal Australian Naval Brigade rating, petty officer. He volunteered for service with the Naval bridging .train, but his services were refused on account of his special rating as a sick berth steward. Subsequently he volunteered for service at No. 5 Australian General Hospital, and remained there for seven months. He then joined the Australian hospital ship Kanoiuna, and worked alongside ratings of the permanent Navy, doing exactly the same duties. He served in Indian waters, and went through the Red Sea to Egypt and England with invalided troops. On returning to Melbourne he was taken off the hospital ship, and was in naval barracks in charge of sick berths until October, 1918. In March, 1918, he had asked to be allowed to join the Australian Imperial Force, but received a written reply stating that under the circumstances the desired permission could not be granted. The Navy Department issued to him a returned sailor's naval badge, bearing the words, ""Returned from active service."" In another case one young man, who was an A.B., volunteered several times for service with the Australian Imperial Force, but received one of the ordinary circular letters, stating that permission to enlist could not be granted. When the Navy called for volunteers to man the PsycJie,' a man-o'war, which was to be sent out on war service, he volunteered, was accepted, and went away, not knowing where he was going. He worked alongside ratings of the permanent Navy, doing the same, duties, and after a cruise to Torres Strait returned to Melbourne, where he was demobilized, and discharged after six months' service. He received the returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial In League badge. I have several other cases of the kind, but these are sufficient the ' for my purpose. I desire to know whether such men will be excluded from the scope of the Bil l if the amendment providing for the deletion of the word's, ""other than a member of the auxiliary service,"" is not made.",39
194,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,They are all included under paragraph d of clause 3. All these men will qualify for the gratuity - that,40

I am dealing now, not with the merits or demerits of the amendment, and others of which notice has been given, but with a question of procedure. My point is that this is a money Bill, and that we are absolutely confined to the Governor General's covering message authorizing an appropriation of revenue to the extent necessary to meet the requirements of the'Bill as introduced by the Government. An honourable member reminds me that no amount is specified in the Governor General's message. That is immaterial. The vital point is that the Governor General's message merely covers the Bill as introduced by the Government, and that the amendment, which would increase the proposed charge or burden on the people, is absolutely unconstitutional. It is not provided for by a message from the Governor General. There can be no escape from that position, since it has been laid down for generations.",40

212,Mr BLAKELEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,He evidently discussed the matter.,41
213,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There was no disthe cussion with me. The honourable for Wakefield did not ask my opinion regarding the point of order.,41

215,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In regard to the brought point of order itself, if I were to consult viding my own inclinations I should be inclined to rule in a manner different from what I am obliged to do. I am not here to Estimates consult my own inclinations, but to in terpret the Standing Orders in accordance with the precedents of this House and the practice of the British House mons. Several honourable members have alluded to the fact that the message which preceded' the Bill mentioned specific amount. That is quite true, but neither have other messages which preof ceded money Bills mentioned any specific sum. On the 1st August, 1907, the then honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr . Fisher) moved an amendment to the Bay, Bounties Bill to add to the schedule a bounty upon an article not already proaged, vided for, and the Chairman of ComBut mittees, the honourable member for Kenments, nedy (Mr MCDonald), ruled that the amendment was in order. Considerable debate took place upon that ruling, and East was contributed to by the present At - whether torney-General (Mr Hughes), the late Sir George Reid, and others. As the matter was of great importance, and would establish a precedent for the guid ance of f u t u r e Parliaments, the Comhis mittee decided, with the concurrence of the Chairman, to refer the matter to M Speaker (Sir Frederick Holder). I think there is not one member of the present Parliament who was a member of this Parliament at that time but will agiee that Sir Frederick Holder was one of the best, if not the best, Speakers this has had'. He gave the fullest measure of consideration to all matters of this A f t e r the Chairman of Committees had vided stated his reasons for ruling Mr Fisher's amendment in order, Mr Speaker Holder gave his ruling, which may be found in . full in Hansard, but which I shall quote in condensed form from the Votes and Mr MCDonald reported that an amendment had been moved in the First Schedule of the Bill, to insert after the word "" Dried"" in the item "" Fruits"" the words "" and canned pineapples."" He had ruled this amendment to be in order, and the Committee had decided that question should be referred for the demember cision of Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker stated he had no hesitation in giving his ruling. He would remind the House of the different stages through which the Bill had passed. First of all there was a from the Governor General recommending an appropriation.

If the Bill did not provide for a bounty on pineapples a bounty could not be. now put in. If an item in the were under consideration the des- tination of a vote could not be altered. He ruled that no amendment could be introduced which would have the effect of giving a bounty on any item not provided for in the Schedule, of Comor of increasing any bounty. I spoke on that occasion, and I may be no pardoned for quoting my remarksUnder the Standing Orders, the reference this question to Mr Speaker must be decided by the Committee; but, as the Chairman has consented to it, no doubt the course proposed will be followed. I am in sympathy with the proposal of the honourable member for Wide and was desirous of making provision in the schedule for the encouragement of industries which, in my opinion, should be encourand for which no bounty is allotted. I have refrained from moving amendbecause I felt that they would be unconstitutional. On one occasion when I was Chairman, the right honourable member for Sydney took similar action to that now proposed. I had ruled on a technical point a non-official member could increase an item in the Tariff,, but I was quite ready and willing that my ruling should be reviewed by Mr Speaker. He confirmed it, and it stands now for all time. We have now before 7 us another point upon which we should have ruling for our guidance. r . Those who were members of the last Parliament will recollect that I gave a similar ruling when the 'honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) proposed an amendment to tihe Invali d and Old age Pensions Bill which would have in House volved the payment of a larger amount kind. from the Treasury than was prof o r in the Bill . I ruled the amendment out of order because it was"" beyond the scope of the Bill and would increase the appropriation. As has heen interjected by some honourable members, the amount of money to be appropriated for this Bill is unspecified; nevertheless, the Bill itself makes a certain amount of provision, because clause 12 makes an appropriation of revenue ""to the necessary extent for the purposes of this Act,"", assuming, apparently, that the Bill would be agreed to as drafted. I have to consider, also, whether, in the opinion of Ministers, the proposed amendment would increase the appropriation beyond the amount for which they have made provision on the Estimates or arrangements with the Treasurer. I had no guidance upon that point until, during the afternoon, a responsible Minister declared to the Committee that if certain amendments, .this one in particular, were carried, they would increase the appropriation by several millions of pounds. That being the case, and bearing in mind the ruling laid down by the late Speaker Holder, I have to consider whether, if the payment of a gratuity to certain persons not specified in the Bill as agreed - to at the second reading will increase the amount of the appropriation, it will be competent for the Committee to include those persons. Taking into consideration all the circumstances, I have to rulesomewhat to my own regret, I admitthat the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hindmarsh.

There is no intention to pay gratuities those who served on hospital ships, or to people who went away as munition workers, many of whom made big sacrifices. Here, however, there is apparently no compunction about paying the gratuity to men who did not even go on board a ship. I do not know if honourable members recall the case of the transport Barambali.

No one, indeed, cau gainsay that. I have explained that many of them have acted as man-of-warsmen. The ships upon .which they have been employed were used as decoy ducks, or actually rammed submarines. One vessel was used as a man-of-war, and though she had not a gun on board, ca""ptured a German ship that was supplied with guns. Many of the men of the mercantile marine were actually engaged in fighting during the war.

When the definition clause was being considered, I was under the impression that I would be afforded an opportunity to advance the claims of the munition workers by moving the amendment of which I had given notice. Let me illustrate my contention by pointing to the cases of certain persons who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service abroad. Owing to their promise and adaptability, a number of these men were drafted to Duntroon, there to qualify for commissions. Whilst they were at Duntroon, because of the fact that they had graduated in chemistry, they were, at the instance of the Defence Department, and quite against their own inclinations, taken out of the college and instructed to proceed to a munition 'factory in England in the capacity of chemists. They were thus prevented from taking that active part in hostilities which would have brought them within the scope of this Bill.

Only the other day the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) stated that equipment in the case of an army is of just as much importance as are the men in the field, and that the craftsman is just as valuable as is the. warrior.

I wish, also, to mention another case, of which the following particulars have been supplied to meAs you announced your intention of moving some amendments to the War Gratuity Bill, I thought an outline of my case might be of use to you. I enlisted for service abroad on 4th October, 1916, and was in camp with the artillery at Maribyrnong until 1st March, 1.917. While doing battery drill on the latter date my horse reared and came down on top of me. I sustained a fractured base of the skull and laceration of the brain. Naturally in that way. I was discharged as medically unfit, and a generous Department offered me the badge of a reject. They still have it. Later on, had served for more than ISO clays, eligible and received the Imperial silver badge. As a matter of fact, my service with the A.I.F. amounted to 241 days. In June last year my health, which had never been satisfactory ""since my accident, broke and I had to go into hospital for an operadefinitely, tion to my head, and did not resume work until the New Year. I am entitled to of the privileges of the returned soldier though my injuries were sustained while the A.I.F. Furthermore, I have been debarred from participating in the benefits of the Service Homes Act. Colonel Walker has me ineligible, because I did not embark. Under the Gratuity Bill, as it now stands, will be generously rewarded lS4s. Of course, I feel that being financially wrecked, breaking up of my home, and being rendered a physical wreck for the rest of my days, is quite worth £9 4s. I am not even going get Is. per day for the odd 57 days I served over the 184 days, which is the limit laid down by the Bill. . . . The men who were knocked out in camp here were not numerous, and for that reason officialdom takes the that they cannot raise a big enough justify them in redressing any unfairness so far as they are concerned. They the Returned Soldiers League, as they did not go overseas, so there is no large body to fight their battles for them. If the Government intend to consider the cases of men who were killed or died in down by message. camp, I suggest that they also give sympathetic consideration to cases like one I have just mentioned.",48

299,Sir ROBERT BEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The matter raised a very important one. I join with the member for Cook (Mr . man Catts) in asking for a deliberate pronouncement on t i e subject. I speak with a considerable amount of experience, and Do you say that it has always been competent for a Minister of the Crown to move an increase either in duty, as has been suggested, or an amendment to a Bill brought down by message and involving I have not the message before me, and so there might be a technical objection to the acceptance of the amendment. If the message is for a particular amount, there is no. doubt that the Government - would have toamend it , or seek a supplementary message to cover the additional expenditure. But if the message is brought down to' cover the terms of the Bill, my experience is that it has at all times been competent, for a Minister to himself move to increase an. amount, for the reason that, the Government is the responsible Executive of this House. Mr JAMES,PAGE - On a point of order, Mr Chairman, I ask if the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) is in orderin debating, your ruling. On three different, occasions this afternoon you ruled that amendments of this nature could not be accepted.",49
300,Sir ROBERT BEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am not debating the ruling, hut am mentioning a fresh aspect.",50
301,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH," The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) asked. for information for the guidr ance of. the Committee. There is practically, no point of order before .the Chair. I gave this afternoon a ruling, which was exceedingly lengthy and fully detailed, on this specific question, and it seems to me that the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) are misapprehending, the real circumstances of the case. There is - a difference between the Tariff and the Bill now before the Committee. In the case of the Tariff, it is permissible to do certain things, because the Tariff is framed for the collection of money. ThisBill is for the spending of money. I gave a ruling which I had previously given in other cases, and specifically alluded to a matter that cropped up in August, 1907. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr MCDonald) was then Chairman of Committees, and gave a ruling on a point which, by his consent and at the desire of the Committee, was referred to the then Speaker (Sir Frederick Holder) for his decision thereon. The honourable member for Kooyong may not have been here when I quoted what then happened. The honourable member, who was, I think, in the House at the time, and other honourable members, will agree with me in saying that, as a constitutional authority and for knowledgeof the procedure of the House, we never had any one more qualified to give 1 [45] aruling than the then Speaker. He laid it down perfectly clearly in a case similair to this, dealing with bounties, that such an amendment could not be moved. I ruled this afternoon that it could not be moved. I ruled just now that the mem« bers of the Government themselves could not move it at this stage, although they could move for increases in the Tariff: As the honourable member for Kooyong, perhaps, did not hear what I said this afternoon, let me quote again from the ruling of Mr Speaker Holder. He reminded the House of thq different stages through which the Bill had passed. First of all, there was a message from the Governor General recommending an appropriation. This appropriation was voted in Committee, and a Bill, was then brought into give effect to the vote, and providing for bounties on certain items in the first schedule. If the Bill di'd has not provide for a bounty on pineapples-, such bounty could not be put in. Sir. ROBERT BEST.^-That was, by a private member.",50
302,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No;- Mr Speaker Holder applied it to all members.,50
303,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Was that a limited appropriation?,50
304,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No . Mr Speaker Holder further stated that if an item in the Estimates were under consideration, the destination of a vote could not be altered. He ruled that no amendment could beintroduced which would have the effect of giving a bounty on any item not provided for in the schedule, or of increasing any bounty. I applied that ruling to the matter before the Chair, and gave a ruling, which I stand by. It would be very much more pleasant) bo me if I could rule otherwise, but I have to interpret the Standing Orders. I have gone to'the highest authorities, and also quoted other precedents this afternoon, showing how the matter has been decided in another place on several occasions-. I was therefore bound to rule, as I did just now, that the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) was not in order. I may remind the Committee that it is very easy for the Government to apply a remedy, if. they so desire.",50
305,Mr RYAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The matter whichyouy Mr Chairman, have dealt, with inseveral rulings during the noon and evening is very important, and I may be permitted to submit that, in the circumstances, seeing that there are several similar matters in front of us in this measure, the course might be adopted, if you were inclined to do so, of referring the point to Mr . Speaker. I agree with you to this extent, that if your first ruling was correct, then your second ruling is also correct.",50
306,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is quite possible for the first to be correct and the second to be wrong.,51
307,Mr RYAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am expressing opinion that if the first is right, the second is also right, because it is founded upon section 56 of the Constitution, which lays it down that a proposed resolution, or proposed vote for the appropriation of revenue or moneys, shall not be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message from the Governor General to the House in which the proposal originated. Your ruling is therefore founded on the fact that a message has to come from the Governor General, and not from Ministers, recommending the purpose for which the appropriation is made.",51
308,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"A war gratuity, but in this case not limited in amount.",51
309,Mr RYAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I quite agree; but my position is that if the first .ruling is the second is right. . Seeing, however, that a very important question is in - tion. volved, I suggest that the matter should be referred to Mr Speaker for his cision. I do not wish to move that your ruling be disagreed"" with ; but I think you will see the importance of obtaining an authoritative decision, and perhaps may be induced to take the course, which is certainly open to you, of referring matter to Mr Speaker, and having i debated in the House. In May, 10th Edition, page 532, I find it laid down thatAs is subsequently explained, the tional principle which vests in the Crown sole responsibility of incurring national expenditure forbids an increase by the mons of a sum demanded on behalf of the Crown for the service of the State. principle, however, is apparently disregarded when the recommendation of the Crown is given to a resolution empowering the expendiI ture of public money whioh, framed in general terms, places no limitation on the amount expenditure to be authorized by the resolution. after- As the resolution sanctions, without any specific limitation, the application of money to be provided ;by Parliament to certain purposes, when the clauses in a Bill founded upon such a resolution are before the Committee, the freedom of action sanctioned by that resolution can be exercised. The Committee is not bound by the terms of the provisions which the Ministers of. the Crown have inserted in the Bill; and any member may propose an increase of the grants specified in these clauses, or to extend the application of the provisions of the Bill, whatever may be the cost resulting therefrom, so long as the power conferred by the royal recommendation is not exceeded. Acting on this principle, when, in 1812, a Committee was considering a message from the Prince Regent recommending, in general my terms, provision to be made for the family of Mr Spencer Perceval, amendments were permitted for increasing the provision proposed by the Ministers; and this practice has been supported toy rulings from the Chair. In view of that authority, sir, I submit that ' t h is is a very proper case for you to exercise the discretion which is vested in you. There is no doubt that the Government have it in their power to get over the difficulty which has arisen. It is a very simple matter for them, even this evening, to obtain a fresh message authorizing an additional appropriation. The honourable member for Kooyong C Sir Robert Best) is aware that all the Prime Minister has to do is to send a minute through, which will be forwarded to the Governor General, and for t h with approved, when the necessary message can right , be despatched to the House ""at once, authorizing the additional appropriaI t is just as well to emphasize that fact, so that the public demay not run away with the impression that the sending of a message is the Governor General's own apt. It certainly is his act, but it is always done on the advice of his Ministers. If Ministers sitting on the Treasury bench desire to the have the amendment moved by the hont orable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) carried, it is well within their power, and quite a simple matter, to obtain a supplementary message. If they take that course, I hope they will also see that the constitumessage is wide enough to cover the the amendments that have been moved from Comthis side of the Committee. As you know, it is a very handy thing to have This the ruling of the Chair to obviate the necessity of honourable member's voting. t relieves honourable members of the responsibility of recording their votes, and of of having it go forward to the public in Hansard that they were for or against the extension of these provisions. know that that consideration did not influence your decision in any way. In fact, I am quite certain that you would have been inclined, personally, to rule the other way. I recognise that you feel bound by your interpretation of the Standing Orders and parliamentary practice as you see it. Notwithstanding your view, however, I submit that, in view of the fact that the message already sent by the Governor General and approved by resolution of the House is in general terms, it allows of the amendments that have been moved from this side of the House and also 'by the honour the able member for Parkes on the other side.",51
310,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It would, perhaps, be discourteous of me to allow the matter to pass without replying to what the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) has said. I should not have the slightest objection to having this or any other matter referred to Mr Speaker, if the Committee so desired. But this question was referred to a previous Speaker on a practically similar case, and I have quoted already what Mr. Speaker then said, and also what took place on another occasion in regard to the Tariff. In those cases where reference has been made to Mr Speaker, rulings have been given which must be adhered to by any one who occupies my present position, so long as the Standing Orders remain unaltered. I have no desire to. restrict honourable members, it is my duty, which I must faithfully perform, to apply to all sections of the Committee any ruling which I apply to one section. I have applied my ruling in this case to all sections. I have ruled that in this case a Minister may not do what a private member may not do. In the case of the Tariff, however, the position is different, owing to the special provision laid down in our Standing Orders, and the practice of the House of Commons, enabling Ministers at any time to move for increases. I have also had dissents - from my rulings referred, with my consent, to Mr Speaker regarding the right of an unofficial member to move for an increase in the Tariff. I have ruled that [45]- 2 at certain stages an unofficial member I can take that course, and that ruling has been upheld by a gentleman who was one of the best Speakers-and I say this without any disrespect to other occupants of that exalted position-that ever filled the chair. I , therefore, do not think that anything is to be gained at this stage by traversing my ruling. The Committee, however, can, if it chooses, decide to refer the matter to Mr. Speaker. As the honourable member for West Sydney pointed out, if it is the desire of the Committee, and that desire is intimated to the Government, there is a very easy and simple way by which Government can solve the difficulty.",52

There but is no question of an increase in the amount to be paid either to an individual or in bulk. I move That after the word "" made,"" in sub-clause 2, the words "" in cash"" be inserted. That is quite a simple amendment, and if the Government say they intend to accept it I shall sit down at once. The two words which I now ask the Committee to insert have only six letters between them. What is the intention of the Government in regard to this matter? The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) has said that practically every provision in the Bill was before the people. Members of the party on this side of the House view with disfavour the method of paying the gratuity which the Government proposes to adopt. The other day, speaking on the sugar agreement, the Prime Minister twitted the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), myself, and others with claiming to have been able to see further ahead than could be seen by those in control of affairs and in session of the fullest possible information, and he added that within two months from the signing of the armistice the Imperial Cabinet-of which he reminded us he was a member-wa s making preparations for a campaign in 1919-.20.",52
314,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Quite right.,53
315,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Treasurer (Mr. Watt), when putting his Budget before us, told us that had the war continued until the 30th June, the cost to Australia do so. for the two years which have run since the armistice was signed would have been another £160,000,000 or £200,000,000. But had the war continued, the money necessary to finance it would have been found.",53
316,Mr CORSER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,At what cost?,53
317,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No doubt it would have been a very heavy cost. Now we are asking that only one-sixth of the amount that we would have found, if necessary, for the continuance of the war shall be raised to pay this gratuity, the cost of which no Minister, so far as I am aware, has estimated at more than £30,000,000. I believe that the money could be found. When speaking on the second reading of the Bill, I showed that the bank deposits in Australia increased from £181,000,000 at the end of 1914 to £280,000,000 at the end of 1919, and Mr Knibbs estimates that the private wealth of this country when thewar broke outwas £1,200,000,000, and during the five years of warfare increased by another £400,000,000.",53

319,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"For that the people are being compelled to pay today in higher prices for the commodities they purchase. If the Government accept the amendment, and decide that the gratuity shall be paid in cash, the money can be found. For over twelve months we had on the business-paper a Bill providing for compulsory subscription to war loans. If that Bill were passed into law, there would be no difficulty in getting the necessary money. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls) pointed out last night that Great Britain paid in cash, and not in bonds, the gratuities which she awarded to her naval and military leaders. They were not asked to accept lOU's. The Government of which I was a member passed a Bill providing for a gratuity to the widow of General Bridges., pos- and we gave her £4,000 in cash. Why should our soldiers be treated differently? Many seamen and private soldiers may urgently need this money.",53
320,Mr RILEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"South Sydney) [8.37]. - I have much pleasure . in supporting my leader (Mr Tudor) in this matter. The Government say that they cannot find the money that would be needed to pay the gratuity in cash, but I have yet - to learn that they have taken any steps to They could find the necessary money by floating a loan. Honourable members opposite tell us that the soldiers who went away saved this country, and made it secure for Democracy; they speak of them as the most intelligent and best members of the community, and yet they say that they are not to he trusted with a gratuity paid in cash, and must, for their own protection, be given bonds bearing interest at 5 i per cent. What a slur this is on the manhood of the country! They tell us, too, that most of the soldiers wish to get bonds, and not cash. If that be so, no harm will be done by giving them the opportunity to take cash, because they will ask for bonds; we aTe not obliged to force cash on them. While some honourable members opposite may have made it appear to their constituents that they were in favour of paying the gratuity, in bonds, I made it equally clear that I thought it should be - paid in cash; and visiting the Randwick Military Hospital, whioh is the largest in the Commonwealth, I put the Labour party's position in this matter before the men there, and my majority went up over 2,000. That is an indication that the men want cash. We are spending nearly .£1,500,000 per week now on military contracts, notwithstanding that 'the war was ended nearly eighteen months ago. Why should not the Government meet its obligations in respect to these contracts by giving bonds to those to whom it is indebted, and pay cash to the returned men? It will be a great disappointment to a man who has been looking forward to the gratuity to find that all he has got is a ""piece of paper.",53
321,Mr MAXWELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member would like a few of tihese bonds.,54
322,Mr RILEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"What will be the good - of them if they cannot be exchanged for money? I possess some war bonds, and they have fallen in value; not that I ject to that. If the Government desired to pay cash, tihey could make a forced loan, though I do not think that the public need be compelled to subscribe to raise funds for the payment of the gratuity in cash. We said that we would do 'all that we could to assist our soldiers, and probably if a voluntary loan were placed on the market the wealthy would ago. show their gratitude to those who saved the - couantry by subscribing liberally it. The honourable member for West soldiers Sydney (Mr Ryan) suggested last night that it is the Government's desire to crease the number of bondholders, but, my opinion, Ministers do not wish to the gratuity payable in cash, because lobbies or in the streets. they are afraid of interfering with the money market. If cash were given under a proper scheme, the soldiers would be more content than they will be if - they tive officers ? receive bonds. Half of them are looking forward to receiving cash. Half-yearly interest at 5 i per cent, on £100 or £150 worth of bonds does not amount Moreover, it is to be a criminal offence to deal in these bonds, so that they will not be negotiable. Were I to pay cash to soldier for his bonds, I would be liable to a penalty, because trafficking in them is prohibited. I ask the Government, the interests of the men, and of the general peace and harmony of the country, to make provision for a cash gratuity. selves.

Now, leaving that aspect of the question, I come to the more serious side, the raising of the money, and the wisdom of raising it in order to pay the gratuities in cash. The matter is not decided hy the statement of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) that during the war the wealth of the country has increased from £1,200,000,000 to £1,600,000,000an increase of about 25 per cent., less really than the general increase in the price of commodities and the cost of living.  the increase in the equivalent to the pur- capital.

334,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH," £400,000,000 increase merely represents an inflation of values, and if it has any bearing on this argument, should merely be accepted as a warning to us not to further innate the credit and currency of the ouuntry, and so further reduce the value of money.",55
335,Mr RILEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Government, are doing that now by issuing bonds.",55
336,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have yet to learn that the issue of non-negotiable bonds will innate the credit and currency of the country. On the contrary, I had the impression that this form of payment would tend to keep prices down rather than increase them. Th© increase in the deposits in the general banks from £180,000,000 to £280,000,000, quoted by the Leader of the Opposition, does not represent any increase in real values during the war. We ought to be obliged, to the honourable member for quoting those figures. They simply represent an increase in inflation.",55

I have heard many suggestions during this debate as to where the money quired to pay this gratuity could be found. The honourable member Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) suggests that we should try to float a forced loan.",55

It would not help the country. It would not help any business man who had to borrow money - to find that, in eonsequenc6 of the depletion of the working capital of Australia by £30,000,000, the interest rate has been increased through the balance of the capital having to earn what was previously earned by the full amount of the v lend, .and has a moiety of his capital taken away from him will endeavour, if The he has free and unrestricted use of the balance in the world's markets, to spread the interest he would have gained on his Eull amount of capital over what remains to him. Then there is the other matter of the raising of a forced loan. I should like to remind honourable members of the outlook. First of all, let me revert to the last loan we raised. We had the greatest difficulty in securing the money, and it was only in consequence of our threat to take it that we did succeed in getting the ful l amount subscribed, and then only at great inoonvenience and dislocation to the trade and business of the country. With all our inducements to the banks and private lenders, there are £10,000,000 or £11,000,000 of loin money still owing to the banks on account of previous loans. This shows that money is not running about seeking investment in-war loans or in anything else. The plain fact of the matter is that the wealth of Australia consists largely of working capital, and a forced loan would simply mean taking away something from the working capital",55

He told us that Garfield said, in effect, that no nation was worthy of being called a nation if it did not gather up its jewels of manhood, and go down into this horrible pit of war prepared for either measureless ruin or unqualified success; but why bring such a quotation into an argument of this kind ? After all, it is a question of what is prudent-wha t is best to be done in the interests of Australia as a whole, including the soldiers whose special interests we are now caring for. The casosare not parallel. It is useless to make comparisons between Australia and other countries that have had to do what has not been necessary here. We can do a generous measure of justice to our soldiers without impoverishing the nation to the extent that has heen necessary elsewherp. We can grant this gratuity in a form that, will be acceptable to our men without further unduly inflating the credit and finances of this country, and so causing prices to soar as they have, comparatively speaking, in almost every country but this. Prices undoubtedly have gone up here, and have hurt us in the going up. I am not justifying that; I am merely stating the undoubted fact that this is the best of all countries for the working men. That is incontrovertible.",55
343,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is it?,56
344,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is; and is largely due, I believe, to our better financial conditions. We have less inflation here than elsewhere, and, therefore, our prices do not. soar as they have done in other countries. I believe we shall do the fair thing by this country, and the best thing by our returned soldiers and the working men of Australia generally, by prudently taking the course we now propose, and avoiding the undue inflation of our financial position. This matter does not stand alone. To pay the gratuity in cash, we should have to find the money, and we could find it only by floating a ioan, or, as some honourable members opposite have suggested, by taking it from the wealth and capital of the country. May I suggest to my honourable friends opposite that we have to raise l6ans for other purposes than the payment of a gratuity to our soldiers? Next year we shall have to borrow between £30,000,000 and £35,000,000 for war purposes. The war is not yet nearly paid for. Our annual obligations are towering up, and our capital obligations are augmenting from day to day, month to month, and year to year. We shall also have to raise next year about £16,000,000 in respect of "" loan redemptions",56
345,Mr WEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Stat e loans.,56
346,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes ; but State loan obligations have to do with the general financial condition of the Commonwealth. They have an important bearing on the question of the inflation of currency and credit as a whole. We shall have to raise next year £16,000,000 of redemption money for the States, apart from the provision that will have to be made for other State spendings. If on top of all this we are to float another loan of £30,000,000 on the Australian market to pay the war gratuity in cash, what is bur position likely to be? To attempt such a thing would be to smash the market.",56
347,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Has not the Prime Minister guaranteed that if the German war indemnity is not forthcoming the Commonwealth will borrow what is necessary to redeem these bonds ? In that event the Government would still have to find the cash.,56
348,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am not concerned just now with that point. I am endeavouring to impress upon the minds of honourable members the-extent of our financial obligations. Every man would be glad to give the soldiers the money, if he had it in his pocket to give to him. It is this question of how the money is to be raised that I am trying to discuss. It seems to honourable members opposite to be a trifling matter, but to me it is a task of great magnitude, responsibility, and anxiety. In addition to these loan requirements, there are obligations arising in connection with our revenues and expenditures. Remember always that when we issue the bonds for the payment of this gratuity, we shall require to find £1,500,000 per annum for the payment of interest on them. That is one of the outlooks for next year. Then, again, on account of war loans we shall have to find from £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 in respect of additional interest. Even that is not all. The Bill dealing with war pensions that has come down to us from the Senate suggests that we' shall have to find next year extra millions for war sions. We shall also have to find next year £750,000 for old-age pensions. And so the sum goes on. Honourable members opposite say that the expenditure of the Postal Department must be increased, and that further provision must be made for arbitration awards. The outlook, instead of being easy, is very grave. hope, therefore, that honourable members will not press further their demand for the payment of the gratuity in cash, but be content to accept the Government proposal to issue non-negotiable bonds with the limitations already imposed upon them, so far as the promises of individuals and Governments are concerned. We shall have quite as much as we can do to face, the financial obligations of next year, without taking on our shoulders the obligations arising from the findceived ing of cash for the payment of the war gratuity.",56
349,Mr GREGOHY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We shall have to get this speech from the right honourable ber when we are dealing with the Estiand mates.,57
350,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I shall take care that you do, and I hope that when it is made my honourable friend will, us, devote all his energies to the task of so contriving our finances for the financial year as to make them as little irksome and troublesome as possible .to the general community. Meantime, I point out that to do what my honourable demption loans. friends opposite suggest-to place further loans immediately upon the market, in view of the towering financial obligations we must meet, would be to dislocate the finances of Australia. It would lead an inflation of the currency and credit of the country; and in the result re-act profoundly upon every section of the community, but, most adversely of all, upon the workers and taxpayers.",57
351,Mr WEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"East Sydney) [9.9] am very pleased that we have drawn from the Acting Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) the speech he has just delivered. Those who read the newspaper remeans ports of it tomorrow will, however, view with some alarm the financial position of Australia. As I said on the motion for the second reading of this Bill, the Government, are taking no steps, nor did they take any during the war, to meet the outstanding obligations which every man interested in finance has long pen- known would have to be faced. It was intended by the .people of Australiaelection or no election-that with the passage of this Bill our returned soldiers should receive something which they could handle and dispose of as they pleased. To the general surprise of the community, when the. Bill was introduced I it was found that it provided only for the issue of non-negotiable bonds. The Acting Treasurer has spoken of the .dangers of an unduly inflated currency. If there is one thing more than another which leads to an inflation of capital it is the issue of long-dated paper securities. The Acting Treasurer says that during the next two years we shall have to raise enormous sums of money by way of loan. I would point out that if our soldiers rethis gratuity in cash, and were allowed to spend it as they pleased, the money would be circulated amongst our business and commercial houses, and within three months would be back in. memthe coffers of our banking institutions available to meet further obligations. Ever since I have been a member of this House I have endeavoured to in with duce my fellow-members to take an interest in the question of finance. I next have repeatedly urged the Treasurer to bring about the consolidation of our State debts,, and by means of stock or consols to avoid the recurrence of reEvery soldier I have met has told me plainly what he intends to do with his gratuity. I believe the men will make good use of it. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) to would make it appearthat the soldieT is a person who should not be intrusted with his own money. When the soldier receives his gratuity it will belong to him, and it will be for him alone to say how the money should be expended. I What to one man would be a luxury to another would be a necessity. Had the Government realized the position from the start of the war they would have, by of the income tax or some other form of taxation of capital, insured that those who benefited by the war were drawn upon by the Government, in order to enable the country to carry on its war burdens. There seems to be no one on the Government side, however, who has the courage to stand up to those with whom the Nationalist party is particularly identified. They have not had the eourage to do what has been done by those people who have charge of the public finances in Great Britain, Canada, and New Zealand. We, as custodians of this Commonwealth and its great resources, should say to the people who own the wealth, ""We have run the country into debt for the sake of your interests and your liberty, and it is for you to fgot the bill."" It is useless to seek the money from empty pockets. We must levy from those who have the capital. A paragraph in yesterday's press shows that the Clearing-house returns in Melbourne so far this year show an increase of £39,954,568, and in Sydney of £36,635,800, as. compared with t i e corresponding period of 1919. Honourable members will admit that that phenomenal increase is a true indication of the marvellous growth in the volume of tTade. We find, also, that land in the big cities of Australia , is being sold at £1,000 per foot. In the face of these facts, will any honourable membeT claim that there is not in Australia sufficient money to enable the gratuity to be paid 5n cash ? After all, the gratuity is a gift by the nation and not by the Government, and the Government should try to come to an understanding with honourable members in order to give effect to the will of the soldiers. The unanimity with which the House agreed to the second reading of this Bill shows the spirit in which honourable members on all sides regard the gratuity, and in the same spirit we should give the soldiers the cash that they need. I went down to the rooms of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' League a few days ago, and one soldier told me that he wanted the gratuity in cash, because he was trying to acquire a little home.",57
352,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,He can buy little home through the Repatriation Department.,58
353,Mr WEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"He wants to buy the home with his own money and the gratuity to which he is entitled. He does not desire to crawl about any Department; he desires to be treated as a man. What is the good of offering the man something on which he cannot realise for four years? An honourable member might as well buy a box of chocolates for his wife and tell her not to open it for four years. With these non-negotiable bonds they would not be able in time of distress to raise even 2s. 6d. from 'TJncle."" We who have been reared amongst the industrial classes know the wants of the soldiers, and they expect us to voice them in this National Parliament. I have tried to persuade Parliament and the Government to actin a way that will meet with the respect of the people outside. The soldiers will not be satisfied with bonds that are not redeemable for four years. Why should they? Is there any honourable member on either side who would not deem it a pleasure to hand to the soldiers negotiable paper? It is all very well for a commercial man to give an impecunious customer four years' credit in return for a mortgage over certain property, but payment deferred for four years is useless to a soldier who has a wife and family. Let the Government break away from the vested interests and put out of their minds the idea that prices will be inflated by the issue of negotiable bonds. There will be just as much inflation of prices if the bonds do not mature for four years. Every financial expert in the House of Commons has pronounced in favour of calling in all long-dated stock issued by the Imperial Government The question of the next Estimates does not frighten me at all. It is for the Government to face the position. They will be forced to impose either additional income or land taxation, or to introduce a tax upon capital. We are bound to get rid of our war loans. But instead of trying to do so, we are now involving ourselves in a fresh one. In the Sydney Sun I have just been reading that a sum of £3,000,000 is about to be raised for the purpose of building new picture theatres. A Combine is to be created a which will secure the whole theatrical business in the hands of one company; yet we are told that there is not enough money in the country to pay the soldiers in cash. The other day I read of a certain ecclesiastical party whose head was about to leave Australia for Europe. The newspapers reported that there was a proposal to make a cash presentationto this notable churchman, and that about £25,000 was promised within a few minutes by those present at the gathering. Further, it was stated that the sum of £50,000 would be raised in less than seven days. The cash gift was not availed of by the proposed beneficiary, but the fact remains that somebody in this country has money to spare. Somebody has sufficient money upon which the Government can draw in order to make cash payments to the soldiers. Perhaps the chief objective of this Parliament is to remove causes of discontent among the people. Will anybody say that if this Bill is passed in its present form there will be no more discontent in the community? The real issue at present is whether we shall give the soldiers a cash gratuity or hand them bonds that can,not be ""cashed until 1924. ""Will we be better able to provide cash four years hence than today ? To-daythere are chances of securing the necessary money, but we do not know what may be the condition of the Commonwealth four years ahead. If we put the money involved in the soldiers' gratuity into immediate circulation it, will soon be. back in the coffers of the banks. When the millions involved in the gratuity are put into general circulation, the Government will have something upon which to impose necessary additional taxes. We should give the soldiers what we promised them. It is only an insult to hand them a piece of paper that is nothing more than an unsigned cheque. The bonds will be of no use to them. A soldier will have his useless blank cheque framed and hung up in his dining room, and he will be able to point to it and say, ""I have framed this thing, and hung it up, as a monument to the incapacity of the Government."" If the Government were sincere, they could at least provide for the bonds to fall due over brief progressive periods. Another consideration is that if the bonds are paid in cash the Government will have saved themselves the interest bill, which will, in present circumstances, have to be met; and the sum will amount to several millions when managerial and other necessary expenses are added. I urgently appeal to the Government to make the gift in cash. Mr West. Mr J. H. CATTS (Cook) [9.40] - The Minister for - the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) has stated that returned soldiers do not want cash. It is silly and childish to say such a thing. Can it be imagined that any returned soldier would rather have an inalienable bond than a gift in cash ? There are some, of course, who do not want the money. I refer to wealthy men, who, if they received cash, would invest it. They would as soon have an interestbearing Government bond as a cash gratuity. But those are the only soldiers who do not want cash payment, and it is nonsense to insist upon the contrary. I challenge any honourable member opposite to give me particulars of a meeting of any considerable number of returned men, in any part of Australia, since first the gratuity was mooted, at which gathering it was resolved that those present would prefer non-negotiable bonds to a monetary gift. Speaking upon the second reading .of the Bill, I furnished details of mass meetings held in Sydney time after time. I was present at three myself, and at the largest there were approximately 10,000 returned men. In Brisbane, 4,000 soldiers gathered in the central squares. A crowded meeting was held in the Adelaide Town Hall. There was a great gathering of soldiers in Perth. Over ihe length and breadth of this country meetings of returned men have denounced the proposed presentation of non-negotiable bonds, and have requested cash payment. In the matter of payment of the gratuity by way of bonds, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has made use of a little of his skilled art. He got a few officers into a quiet corner and. hypnotized them into an agreement in respect to that which he wanted to put before the country as his own policy. The Prime Minister then came along to the soldiers of Australia, and represented this as the view of the returned men.",58
354,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It was the suggestion of the executive of th© soldiers association.,59
355,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have here thestatement of Captain Dyett, the Federal President of the organization, that when the Prime Minister placed him in the position with the returned soldiers of"" Australia of having agreed to the payment of the gratuity in bonds, he deserted him, and then said he had. arranged with, the hanks aud others to have the bonds taken over the counter and cash given for them. The Federal President of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers League complained of this in the press. He said it was an u n f a ir position to put him in , and that it was because the Prime Minister had represented to him that it was impossible to find the money to pay the^ gratuity in cash that he agreed to its payment in non-negotiable bonds. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) need not in the circumstances tell me that he was present at the interview when I had before me the statement of the Federal President of the Returned Sailors and. Soldiers League.",59
356,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Nothin g the honourable member has said has controverted the with today. statement. I made.,60
357,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I shall leave that point with the further statement that I challenge any Minister or supporter of the Government to call a mass meeting of returned soldiers in this or in any other city in Australia, and ask them cash can get it. whether they would prefer the gratuity to be paid in non-negotiable bonds or cash, and induce any considerable numaccording ber of them to accept bonds. that they would indignantly repudiate the payment of .the gratuity in bonds. therefore say that I cannot conceive that the statementthe statement that the men would prefer bonds could be honestly made. But that is not the main reason why lia. the Government should pay cash. main reason why they should do so because they promised to pay cash. B referring to Hansard for 25th March, page 858, it will be seen that in my made with the associated banks. speech on the second reading of this B I gave references showing the expansion of the policy of the Government from time the Prime Minister first mentioned the matter in Brisbane until, as he went from place to nlace, he liberalized proposal into a cash payment. references have not been, and cannot disputed. I will now give the referthe ences to three main pledges by the Prime Minister. In the Sydney Morning Herald, of 7th November, it is reported that the Prime Minister said1. That the banks would take these bonds equivalent to cash, for land and houses collateral security. 2. That the Government would, by 1921, Tfcdeem the bonds to the value of no less than £12,000,000. 3. That this would altogether mean that £20,000,000 worth of the bonds would be paid in cash by May, 1921. Those statements are definite enough, but there is no attempt in this Bill to carry out that definite pledge, that by May, 1921, the Government would, through the banks, redeem £20,000,000 worth of these bonds.",60
358,Sir GRANVILLE RYBIE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is not to say that it will not be carried out. _ Mr JH CATTS - If it is the intention of the Government to carry it out, let them show their bond fides by putting it within the four corners of the Act, so that it may not be the subject of further juggling >as the matter is being dealt According to the Dail y Telegraph, of Sydney, of 11th November, the JPrime Minister saidThe banks will receive these bonds as collateral security: Arrangements have been made with the Savings Banks and all the Associated Banks that those who want the This is a week later than the first referi n ence quoted, and a week later still, to the Sydney Sun, of the 20th We know November, at a mass meeting of the soldiers themselves in the Protestant IH all , Sydney, the Prime Minister made The bonds will be accepted as collateral security by the Associated - Banks of AustraThe If honourable members looked up the is whole of the reports upon the matter, y they would find that the Prime Minister at stated that an arrangement had been He ill said, further, that he had arranged with the great employers of Australia to pay the cash to their employees in exchange for the bonds. In my second-reading speech, I gave a list of great - corporations in the Sydney, including banks and insurance These companies, and showed that 150 of the be, great employers of New South Wales, chief employers of the State, had said that they would pay cash in exchange for these bonds. The Prime M in ister appealed to the State Government of New South Wales, and - they said, "" We will pay cash for the bonds to the whole of our returned soldier employees."" as He appealed to the State Government of Victoria, and also to the State Government of Queensland, and each said the same thing. The Governments of the three largest States of the Commonwealth, agreed to pay cash in exchange for the* bonds. On the 22nd November, the Prime Minister saidWe shall pay cash to the whole of the employees of the Commonwealth services who are returned soldiers. On the 28th November, on being asked by the soldiers to say what would happen in the case of soldiers who were unemployed, the Prime Minister pledged him self that for all soldiers unemployed cash would be made available at once. furthe r said to the maimed soldiers' association in SydneyCash will be paid to all soldiers w.bo have- riot and lawlessness in this country. lost an arm, an. eye, or a leg. I suggest to honourable members that if in a l r the cases covered by the references I have qfuoted the gratuity were paid in cash as promised by the Prime Minister-, there would be practically no returned soldiers left to whom the payment could' be made in non-negotiable bonds. On the top of all this, there was the unlimited promise that cash would be paidover the counter for the bonds by the banks. There is a substantial pledge on the part of the Government to the returned soldiers, and: their dependants that this was to be a cash gratuity. We are now asking the Government to carry out their pledges definitely made-, and proved' to have been made up to the hilt. There is not an honourable member on the other side who can deny it . I challenge any honourable member opposite, from the Prune Minister down, to take the references I have made from the daily newspapers, .and say that those utterances were not made by the Prime Minister. They cannot do it , and they dare not attempt to d o . it . Only one course is left to*, them, and that is to repudiate the pledges made to the returned soldiers'. Before the election, and while their votes, were wanted, the flag was waved and the 1 big drums beaten; but now, when the Government are called upon to carry out their pledges, they are not prepared to do so. Sooner or later, the returned of this country will get full up of this business. I notice that the Prime ister has on two occasions-and Mr J. ff. Catts. from the head of the Commonwealth Government-invite d riot and revolution in. Australia. Coming across.from Westerns Australia, after he landed in Perth , from* London, on the first occasion, he said:There is some talk of direct action is this, country. I will give them direct action. Let there be no mistake about it. I ' am not nowreferring to the law; He thought he would head a revolution against some one, with a pack of soldiers at his back. What did he say in the second-reading speech on this Bill t He said, in effect, "" Dare to delay this, and the probabilities are that there will be a revolution here, and men will come-, up and tear the place down.."" N.o. one He can read the right honourable gentleman's second-reading speech on this Bill without noting the half-veiled invitation to I have never in my l if e, until this moament y made any reference to revolution and direct action; but I say, now, that if the returned soldiers of the country will put up. with this humbug, they are very different, men from what I think them to be..",60
359,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Nepean) [9.5-7] - I have listened twice to the speech that, has just beendelivered, and I think it. is; about, the most hypocritical statement and line of argument that has been used in this House. Every one, not onjy in this House but in the Commonwealth, is aware that this matter was in a state of flux in the beginning, and that it was finally crystallized in the statement made by tibie Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) at Brisbane..

374,Mr LAZZARINI,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Werriwa) [10.5] I would like to refer briefly to one or two* statements made by the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) in reply to the speech, of tha Leaden of the Opposition (Mr Tudor).' Earlier in the evening the Minister went Ito some trouble in an endeavour to prove that money was difficult to obtain, but I do not know whyshould be any scarcity. The aittitudej the Government have adopted from beto end is that all. the money im the country has been blown away as were? many other things during the recent war* It is absurd ito express such anopinion,, because there is still as much moneyi; availableas there was before thewar. In replying to the speech of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. ""West) the Minister said that crowding the market with additional loans would have a grave effect upon the present financial position of the Commonwealth. But the Government are actually floating a loan today, because issuing bonds is really floating a loan. Whether the soldiers accept the Commonwealth's promise to pay certain sums in four years or some one else accepts the promise, it is an interest-bearing loan just the same. I intimated in my second-reading speech, during the election the necessary money to pay the gratuity should be raised by a direct wealth levy. The Minister stated that that also would have a disastrous effect upon the country. The whole"" crux of this question is in a statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), which is embodied in the Bill, that the gratuity is a free gift from the nation. If it is a free gift from the nation in recognition of services rendered in time of war, we have no .right to cavil at how the money shall be raised. The Government have no right to say that it is a financial obligation they have undertaken. If the Government said it was a duty that they had to face, they might have some justification for coming before this Parliament and saying it was difficult to raise rhe money. They have admitted that it is a free gift from the natioiybut now tell us that they cannot make a free gift, and can only pay on a deferred system. The Minister for the Navy stated that if the money were raised by a wealth levy, prices would rise. If he accepts or assumes one position, aud admits that prices would rise, he can only do so on the grounds that the soldiers, on receiving cash, would do nothing until it was spent. We know that one reason why prices are high today- I do not suggest that it is the only reason why they are as high 'as they areis because production has been interfered with by the removal of the producers into other channels of activity. If the Government assume that the soldiers will cease to produce while the cash is in their pockets, they are taunting the soldiers with being lazy and inefficient. It is only on that assumption that the Minister's argument can stand. We are merely taking it from the hands of some to place it in the hands of others. We should ATr. Lazzarini. impose a wealth levy on the institutions and organizations which have piled up millions - which is the only honourable way of redeeming this promise to the soldier-whil e the country was in dire peril. Honourable members oppositesome wearing returned soldiers' badgeshave said that they speak for the soldiers, and in doing so have stated that a majority of the men want bonds, and do not desire cash. I know more than one returned soldier, and I have no hesitation in saying As that a large majority desire cash. I am prepared to repeat the challenge thrown out by the honourable member for Cook, (Mr Catts) and defy the Government to take a referendum of the whole of the soldiers on the question of whether payment should be made in bonds or cash.",62
375,Mr OOKSER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member wish to delay the passage of the Bill?,63
376,Mr LAZZARINI,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not wish to do that. The Bill could he passed in its present form, and a vote taken after. In the arguments submitted by the Minister for the Navy against the payment of the gratuity in cash, the Minister has shown his incapacity to deal with the financial aspect of this question, as well as the financial affairs of the Commonwealth. He certainly displayed his inability to grasp the significance of important financial problems when he referred to the Commonwealth Bank notes as "" Fisher's flimsies."" In concluding, I would like to designate the war bonds to be issued under this measure as "" Hughes' humbugs and Cook's camouflage.""",63
377,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Maribyrnong) [10.14]. - I regret the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden) is not present, because he made the statement to the Committee that the last word of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) on this matter was at a meeting he addressed in Brisbane. Whatever the Prime Minister said oh that occasion, varying opinions were expressed in the different capitals. On the second reading of the Bill, I quoted the essence of a statement made by the Prime Minister in Adelaide before a meeting of returned soldiers. For the information, of honourable members, I shall again quote a portion of the report, which readsA TIRED VOICE - We want cash. (Laughter and applause.)",63
378,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Government have' made arrangements with the banks whereby soldiers who want cash for their bonds can get it. (Thunderous applause.) There is no getting away from statements such as that, and it is ridiculous for honourable members opposite to say that the Prime Minister did not promise to pay the soldiers in cash. Instead of affirming that we are sending up a smoke screen, the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden) is. himself guilty of those tactics. A similar proposition to that which we are now discussing was brought forward in the Hew Zealand Parliament, in 19 IS, when a Bill dealing with the Expeditionary Forces from that Dominion was passed. that measure provision was made for the payment of a bonus to returned soldiers. Consequently it was not necessary at the close of the war to pass another. Bil l authorizing the payment of the gratuity. All that was necessary was for Sir James Allen to submit a printed statement setting out the lines upon which the gratuity was to be distributed. In making his speech, he stated that the Dominion was then in process of floating a Victory loan, and the fact that the Government were about to give £6,000,000 in cash to their' returned soldiers should be an inducement to the people to subscribe to that loan. I believe the money for which they asked on that occasion was raised.",64
379,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No , it was not.",64
380,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am under the immen pression that it was. New Zealand was the first overseas Dominion to insert in her War Loan Bills a provision which imposed very serious penalties upon those who could subscribe to those loans but failed to do so. There were only a very few cases in which persons possessed of the means to subscribe neglected to honour their obligations. Last night bonds instead of in cash. the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) stated that New Zealand was a position to pay her gratuity to her soldiers out of accumulated surpluses. Obviously, she must have been better financed during the period of the war than was the Commonwealth.  Dominion encouraged production.",64
381,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I quite recognise that. The man who did more courage production in New Zealand than anybody else was the late Richard Seddon. The Minister for the Navy has referred to Great Britain, and to the way in which she has been compelled to do things. He has argued that we ought not to institute a comparison between Australia and the Mother Country. I admit that - Great Britain has to carry very heavy burdens, and that her people have submitted to great sacrifices. I suppose that the national debt of Britain has increased from £600,000,000 in pre-war days to nearly £4,000,000,000.",64
382,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"£8,000,000,000 .",64
383,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I did not know that. In With an indebtedness of £8,000,000,000 on 45,000,000 of people who are obliged to import the necessaries of life from 'countries oversea, including Australia, is it any wonder that her population cannot live as cheaply as we can? But notwithstanding all the burdens that she has to carry, Great Britain did not ask her soldiers to accept bonds. When a thanksoffering was given to Admiral Beatty by the nation, he was not invited to accept bonds, although it is safe to assume that he is a wealthy man.. Nor was General Haig requested to accept bonds. Both were paid in cash. Similarly the coalminers and the railway men of Britain were given cash bonuses. The soldiers, too, were paid liberal gratuities in cash. This is the only portion of the British Empire in which it is proposed to offer a gratuity in the form of non-negotiable bonds for a period of four years.",64
384,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The British soldier would like to have similar conditions.,64
385,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We shall occupy a unique position amongst the English-speaking races in respect of our treatment of returned soldiers if we pay them in We have boasted of the wealth of Australia. A l in though up-to-date we have merely scratched the surface, this is the richest country under God's sun. We shall not occupy an enviable position in the eyes of other nations if we pay this gratuity in bonds. Talk about the depletion of Who says that there is going to be a depletion of capital? If the wealth of any country be spread to enover a wider area, is not there a greater degree of happiness amongst its people? Yet it is argued that if we take £30,000,000 from the richest persons in .the country, and distribute it amongst 300,000 soldiers, we shall be making the people poorer. Such a deduction is ridiculous. The capital thus distributed will still remain in the country. I quite agree with the statement of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) that we have either to brand every returned soldier as - a spendthrift or as one who will use the cash, if it be given to him, for legitimate purposes. There are thousands of returned men who, if granted cash, will use it productively, either upon the fiarm, in the factory, or in the shop. At ,iihe present time we are called upon to produce, produce, produce. Here is an opportunity for us to increase the wealth of this country. Let us embrace it. It is my belief that in 1924 we shall be less able to meet this payment than we are today. In 1925, we shall have to redeem our first war loan. Between now and tihen there is a huge - expenditure confronting us. We are, therefore, more bapable of paying this gratuity today than, we shall be in 1924. The Ministry have given their position away as the result of speaking with many voices. The Prime Minister has said that we cannot raise the money with which to pay the gratuity, and the Minister for tihe Navy has painted a very doleful picture of the financial outlook. But the Acting Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) has told us that, according to the state- Cook, Robert ment of the Prime Minister, about £20,000,000 of this war gratuity will be paid in cash by May, 1921. That is only twelve months hence. What is the difference between paying the gratuity in cash today and paying it in cash then? The honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Bruce) and the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden) have both expressed the opinion that where banks, Governments, and employers have proliaised to redeem the bonds of their employees, they should be allowed to do so nnder this Bill.",64
386,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,They are allowed to do so,65
387,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member for Flinders says that they are not. He informed us that 'he 'has been making arrangements to redeem the bonds of his own employees, amounting to £15,000. That means - that his firm is willing to incur a liability to that extent. Will the State Governments also be permitted - to, redeem the bonds of their employees? We should follow the example of New Zealand and Great Britain, by paying the gratuity in cash. - Question-That the words proposed to be inserted be so inserted (Mr TTJDOB'S amendment) - put.

A war gratuity shall not be payable in respect of the service of any of the following persons:(a) a iperson absent without leave who has not, prior to the commencement of this Act, surrendered or been apprehended; (6) a person who is proved to the satisfaction of a prescribed authority to have suffered i r o n i wounds intentionally self-inflicted; (o) a 'person who is serving, or has served, a sentence - of penail servitude, imprisonment, or detention, at the expiration of which he has been or is to be discharged from the Forces with ignominy or for misconduct; i(d)' a peison who, by reason of a 'sentence of penal servitude, imprisonment, 'or detention imposed while on the voyage or in a training «amp - or dep6t, was unable to join his unit in the field; (e) a person who has, upon conviction by court martial or by a civil Court, received a sentence of imprisonment m it h haTd labour for not less than one year, or any greater sentence, unless the sentence expired or was remitted before the eleventh day of November, One thousand nine hundred and eighteen, or has been suspended and the suspension has not been revoked; i(f) a person who has been discharged from the Forces with ignominy or for misconduct; and -(#) - a person who has been cashiered, dismissed or discharged Forces, or whose services have been dispensed with, for any disciplinary reason or misconduct which, in the opinion of the prescribed authority, renders him undeserving of a war gratuity; . . . .",65
388,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Cook) [10.87] - I move That paragraphs .(?>) to (g ) , inclusive, be left out, and the following inserted in lieu thereof:"" (b) A person who has, i u the opinion of the prescribed authority, committed an offence against military discipline, impairing the efficiency of the Army, or has been guilty of desertion in the face of the enemy, or who has committed an offence against a civil law."" My object is to limit the disqualifications so as to bring the Bill into conformity with the Prime Minister's pledge. Speaking to a meeting of returned soldiers in the Protestant Hall, in Sydney, on the 20th November, 1919, the Prime 1 Minister (Mr Hughes) said he looked with a lenient eye on men guilty of offences against military discipline, in so far , s they did not a impair the efficiency of the Army or involve desertion in the face of the enemy or a crime against the civil law. Instead of the long list of disqualifications set out in paragraphs i to g, I wish to limit the'persons to whom the gratuity will be denied to those described in the amendment, in conformity with the Prime Minister's own pledge to the soldiers. If I were asked to choose, I would rather have no limitations. Even in l i e matter of desertion in 'tjhe face of the enemy, some men have been overwhelmed with the awfulness of conflict, and have, after years in the firing line, lost their nerve altogether, and probably did not understand what they were doing. I could develop that aspect, but do not wish to take up time in doing so. It is paltry and mealy-mouthed for us., now that the whole thing is over, to be picking out little isolated cases here and tfhere, where men have already been punished, and setting up another judgment upon them. At any rate, this is the Prime Minister's own pledge, and I want to see the Government kept to the pledges which he made. The amendment which I move embodies the very widest extent from the to which there should be any disqualification.",66
389,Mr MAXWELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Fawkner) [10.42] I have pleasure in supporting the amendment of the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts). We should look with the most lenient eye possible on offences committed by men who have undertaken military service overseas, and have gone to fight for their country. I quite agree, also, that in many of the cases included in the clause the offence has been the result of the nerve-racking experiences through which the men have passed. There is another way of looking at it . Where men have offended against military or civil law, they have suffered the punishment due to them for their offences, and they may still have a splendid record of service to their credit. Having regard to these facts, we ought to be very lenient indeed.",66
390,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH," I do not like the clause, and I do not like the amendment very much, hut I like the amendment better than the clause. There are too many disqualifications in the clause as it stands. Unfortunately we are going to be rushed for time over this Bill, and, owing to the desire of the Government to get it through, we shall not have that leisure to discuss it which the Treasurer (Mr Watt) foreshadowed here some time ago. I hope the Government will not insist on the whole of the disqualifications set out in the clause. Even the disqualifications suggested by the honourable member for Cook (Mr. Catts) are too many. As every honourable member knows, the men went through a nerve-racking and trying time. We know that some of them enlisted when only eighteen years of age, or a few months older. Those who committed offences have been punished once"", and the Bill proposes to punish them again. I have received a letter from a gentleman, who asks that consideration should be extended to officers who have been cashiered. He says they will be absolutely prohibited from receiving the gratuity. I would suggest to the Government, if they have no time now, that they should make an alteration before, the consideration of the Bill is completed in another place. I am always reluctant to suggest that we should leave our work half finished, to be completed in another place. I should like the Government to agree to wipe out. practically the whole of this clause, except, perhaps, paragraph a, and the proviso in an amended form. Of course, a man will have some sort of appeal, but it will be a very slim .chance. I do not think it will be held that, in making this amendment, we are adding to the expenditure under the Bill. I trust that we shall look as leniently as possible on the offences of the men who went overseas. It is not British fair play to punish them again by withholding the gratuity.",67
391,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Parramatta-Min ister for the Navy) [10.47] - I hope honourable members will not agree to the amendment. The fundamental idea of the Bill is that the gratuity shall be, as was aptly put by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt), the gracious gift of the nation to the soldiers for orable service. In clause 8, the spirit of the gratuity is set out in very appropriate language, as follows: The war gratuity payable under this Act shall not be claimable or recoverable by any person as a matter of right, but shall be deemed to be a free gift by the Commonwealth in recognition of honourable services during the war. Will honourable members say that a man who from start to finish would not go into the front firing-line, and intentionally inflicted wounds upon himself in order that he might escape that duty, is one to whom we should be anxious to pay a gratuity?",67
392,Mr MAXWELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It might well be. It would all depend upon circumstances. Men may have been suffering from shellshock.,67
393,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"My honourable friend is letting his emotions run away with him. Numbers of men never got near enough to the firing-line to have shell-shock. They took good care that they did .not. The disqualifications set out in the Bill are not so very abnormal or harsh, after all; and I appeal to honourable members not to be led away by too much sentiment or emotion. My ownexperience of the war is that the men's own oflicers always looked for a way out for them when they could find one; and we may be very sure that, when these sentences were imposed by their own fellows at the war, they were in most cases well deserved.",67
394,Mr MAXWELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I have had more experience of wrong-doers than the Minister has.,67
395,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member has not had more experience of wrong-doers on the field of battle. My experience in that matter was nil, and sowas his; but - I know many of the officers, and from all the conversations I have had with them, I believe that in courts martial an officer always looks for what is favourable to the accused, rather than for what is prejudicial to him. A man who inflicts wounds on himself in order to keep out of the fighting is deserving of the greatest ignominy. Such a man endangers the lives of those whom he is supposed to help, and commits an offence which cannot be overlooked. We cannot show sympathy with those who, so to speak, black-legged on their mates, honand refused to do their job. The gratuity is not intended for men who disgraced themselves; it is a gift to those who did their duty to the country. Further, it must be remembered that the cases that have been alluded to can be brought before the ""prescribed authority,"" who, we may be sure, will deal as leniently with them as possible.",67
396,Mr MAXWELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But why multiply instances? Why not be content to name one or two exceptions, and leave the rest to the ""prescribed .authority""?",68
397,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"B y doing what - is proposed, we should be making eligible for the gratuity men who are not entitled to receive what is in effect a gift of the nation in recognition of .honourable services.",68
398,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"A person who has served a sentence is not disentitled to receive the gratuity unless he has been cashiered, or dismissed from the Forces.",68
399,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes . Only - those who are deserving of no consideration are deprived of the gratuity. I hope that the Committee will stick to the Bill, and not be led away by emotional pleading on behalf of the amendment.",68
400,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Melbourne) [10.55]. - Sub-claus e 2 readsNotwithstanding anything contained in this section, if the prescribed authority is satisfied that in any individual case, having regard to the meritorious service rendered by the member, or such other circumstance as the prescribed authority thinks sumcient, it is inequitable that any gratuity, which would, but for this section, have been payable, should be withheld, the prescribed authority may authorize the payment of the whole gratuity, or of such part of it as the prescribed authority thiuks sufficient. If I interpret that provision correctly, a man who has committed an offence, hut has afterwards made good, would be entitled to the gratuity.",68
401,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is so.,68
402,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I should like, nevertheless, to see the amendment adopted. Everything depends upon the nature of the "" prescribed authority."" A just "" prescribed authority"" might perhaps enable a bad law to be administered satisfactorily, while a bad ""prescribed authority"" might kill the administration of a good law. If the "" prescribed authority "" has the full confidence of both our soldiers and the citizens of Australia, the clause as it stands is perhaps sufficient.",68
403,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Such a ""prescribed authority"" will be appointed.",68
404,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Maribyrnong) [10.57]. - It seems to me that the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) is trying to bring this measure into conformity with the New Zealand law, which contains only two disqualifications. It disqualifies (a) those discharged with ignominy or on account of misconduct, and (b) those undergoing a sentence of penal servitude, imprisonment or detention at the expiration of which they will be discharged with ignominy. We could not do better than adopt a similar provision. At one time offenders against the law were treated with the utmost rigour, and often with great inhumanity. But nowadays we make even prison life comfortable, and try to reform the offenders. If it is right to deal thus with civil offenders who ' committed their offences when in full possession of their senses, ought we not to be still more lenient with military offenders, who at the time their offences were committed were labouring under physical and mental disability? I believe that many good fellows who did magnificent service for the country have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment which they ought not to have suffered.",68
405,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,To have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment does not exclude a man from the benefits of the gratuity.,68
406,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There is a multiplicity of words in the Bill, and I think we should do better by adopting the simplicity of the New Zealand legislation. I agree with the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell). Now that peace has been brought about by the efforts of our soldiers, I would release all but those who have committed the grossest offences.",68
407,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Would you give the gratuity to men who would not fight?,68
408,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Would the right honourable gentleman visit the sins of the fathers upon the children? Would he deprive the wives and children of these men of the gratuity? A man may have fought honourably and well for. three years, and then, perhaps because he had imbibed too freely, may have acted contrary to the military regulations, and have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment that would prevent him from getting the by gratuity. What is to be done with that man's wife and children if he happens he married? Are they to be penalized? Mr HUGHES.:-The honourable member gratuity.1 should look at the proviso, which .reads follows:Provided that, where the prescribed authoas rity is satisfied that a person absent without leave, who has' not, prior to the commencewhich ment of this Act, surrendered,, or been apprewent near enough to strike one. hended, has neglected or failed to provide adequately for his dependants, payment may be made to some or all of those dependants such sum (not exceeding in amount which' might, hut for this section, have been paid to,, or in respect of the service of, that person)' as the prescribed authority thinks m.",68

416,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Melbourne) [11.31]. - At the request of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, I desire to place a matter before the Government. I do not know whether the point at issue is already provided for in the Bill ; but, if not, the returned soldiers desire the in sertion in this clause of the following words: Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other Act, the mother and dependants of an ex-nuptial soldier shall benefit in the same way as the mother and dependants of any other soldier.",71
417,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If the honourable member will peruse the definition of "" dependants,"" he will see that the word proposed to means "" the wife, or widow, and children clause-put . (including ex-nuotial children)."" That is to say, ex-nuptial children and their .. 32 parents will be placed in exactly the same .. 15 position, as dependants, as any other persons. 17 Clause agreed to. AYES.

418,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Melbourne) [11.34]. - It is my intention to move for the insertion of a new paragraph in subclause 1 in order to give the same rights to a de facto widow and children of a deceased soldier as are to be conceded to a de jure widow and children.,71
419,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.35] - In this relation I will cite a case which may interest honourable members. During the war the wife of a soldier who was abroad presented herself at the Defence Department, and claimed separation allowance, which was granted to her. Some time afterwards another wif e of the same soldier made a claim for separation allowance. My colleague asked me what he should do in the circumstances. I said, ""Pay the other lady also""; and the Department paid her.",71
420,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Melbourne) [11.37]. - Some interesting cases have come under my notice also. Although in Australia a woman is supposed to possess equal citizenship rights with any man, there are many circumstances in which she has not equal rights; for instance, in respect to naturalization and the legitimization of her children. Some countries have enabled women to legitimize their children, hut a female citizen of Australia has no such right. I move That the following new paragraph be inserted :(aa) The de facto widow of a deceased member of the Forces;",71
421,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yarra) [11.40] - I am afraid that the honourable member's amendment will not accomplish what he desires. It should have been moved in an earlier clause. The clause now under consideration deals with cases in which the gratuity will be paid in cash instead of in bonds. I realise the force of what the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) has said, and that if , afifcer the de-facto wife has been paid, the genuine wife and family turn up later their claim cannot be ignored, but there should be some limitation of the time within which successive claims can be made. I am afraid that we cannot in Australia pretend that we are patterns .to the world in these matters, in view of the many hard cases that have been - brought under the notice of honourable members during the war. In the case of a de facto widow who, unfortunately for her, did not go through the religious ceremony of marriage, it would be well if something could be done to prevent the parent or other relatives of a deceased soldier interfering to prevent assistance being given to her. Some very hard cases have occurred, and only within the last twenty-four hours a woman came to me complaining that her husband was claiming money in respect of two sons who were killed, and that she would get nothing. I should be glad to assist the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) if it were possible, but I think he has moved his amendment to the wrong clause. Amendment negatived. Mr J. H. CATTS (Cook) [11.43] - I move- Tliat the words "" or who has lost an eye or a l i m b "" be added to paragraph (d) of subclause 1. This amendment is moved in order to fulfil another of the promises made by the Prime Minister. I will give the honourable gentleman the reference 'to, it.",72
422,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No matter what the honourable member gives, it will not be true.",72
423,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I find, according to the Sydney Sun, of 22nd November, 1919, that immediately, after the visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) to Sydney, Mr Killeen, President of the Limbless and Maimed Soldiers Association, saidMr Hughes informed him that members of the association who were classed as totally disabled would be able to immediately cash tlieir gratuity under the provision' already made. The Prime Minister also said that he would give instructions for a man who had a leg or arm amputated,"" or who had lost an eye, to be treated as a necessitous case by the Board or Commission which would deal with the question of converting bonds into cash.",72

433,Mr BELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Darwin ) [11.50] move That the words "" since the date of his charge"" in paragraph (e) of sub-clause 1 - left out. I do not know why the Government have specially included members of the Forces who have married since their discharge. A member of the Militar y Forces who married before going to the war, and It is who had a family of five or six to supis surely more in need of cash than one who has married since his discharge. I certainly do not wish to embarrass the Government by asking them to provide a larger amount in cash. . I cannot estimate the amount necessary to pay a cash gratuity to every married soldier, h u t to judging by the number of married men The in my own regiment I should say that approximately 10 per cent, of the mem16 bers of the Australian Imperial Forces ""were married men. If my amendment were carried, it would probably mean that another £3,000,000 14 would be' necessary. That, of course, is AXES. only an approximate estimate. I thin k it will be admitted that many of the men who will be classed as necessitous cases are absolutely in need of the money to be granted by the "" prescribed authority,"" hu t many are necessitous cases through their own f a u l t absolutely. I would not withhold the cash from them on that account, because I claim that the NOES. soldier in the main should be his own protector. If the finances of the country would permit a cash payment to be made, I would be in favour of paying it , and allow them to fight their own battles. If men who have married since their discharge are to receive cash payment, those who married prior to the war are certainly more entitled to it . We need to be as consistent as we can, and I move the amendment for the favourable consideration of honourable members.",73
434,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bendigo-Prime MinisPAIBS. ter and Attorney-General) [11.54] - I hope that the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell) will not press his amendment, ,as the amount of cash at the disposal of the Treasury is very limited. The extent to which this clause involves the Treasury in liability is obvious on the face of it , and' to include all married men would be to enormously increase that liability. The honourable member has stated d with his logic I do not quarrel- I that men who were married prior to or during the war are as much entitled to a discash gratuity as the men who had married - be since their discharge. That is quite true, but the motive of the Government was to encourage the soldier to marry. When I was asked in Sydney whether a man contemplating marriage would receive a cash gratuity, I replied in the negative, and stated, that as soon as he married he would get it. I think that was a good answer. I have no doubt whatever that if this amendment were carried it would mean increasing our liability to pay in cash tenfold. I ask the honourable member 1 not to press his amendment, because the Treasury will be quite unable to bear the added burden.",73
435,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"""Wannon) [11.59] Personally, I feel disposed to support the amendment of the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell). During the war period I have had equal opportunities with other members of the House of ascertaining the terrific disabilities of mothers, with children, who allowed their bread-winners to go abroad without protest, in maintaining their home and meeting the heavy burdens placed upon them. So far the Committee have not placed any heavier burdens on the Treasury than it was anticipated would be imposed under the provisions of this Bill. But this is a case in which we are really entitled to consider the merits of the recipients. The soldiers who have married immediately after their discharge will^ receive the gratuity. In such cases the money, for the most part, will be expended, not in helping persons who are in dire necessity, but in assisting to equip a new home. I am loath to press this matter, but if there are any persons in Australia who made real sacrifices during the war period, it is the women who were left with young children who were unable to assist in the upkeep of the home. These women ' have seen the struggle through in true Spartan fashion, and if the amendment be pressed to a division I shall certainly support it. If the Government are disposed to make any concession in this Bill, it should cerFoster, R. W. . tainly be to the Australian mothers who "" stuck it out"" so nobly till their husbands - returned from the Eront. These mothers have had to exhaust the whole of their allotment money.' Through organizations with which I was associated during the war period, I learned of hundreds of such cases; and, in order to help them, even if it will mean an increased tax on the Treasury, I shall support the amendment.",74
436,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I desire to make a personal explanation. While I was speaking yesterday of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League, I find from the Hansard report of my remarks that the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Kerby) interjected- How many officers are on the executive? The honourable member will not answer that question, because there is only one. To that interjection I am reported to have repliedThat is one too many. In conversation with the honourable member I have since learned that he - was alluding to a gentleman for whom I have the highest appreciation- I refer to Captain Dyett. That gentleman was the secretary of the Recruiting Committee of Victoria with which I was associated as an original member-the only original member who remained attached to it throughout the war. I found Mr Dyett a thorough gentleman, straight and honest in every sense of the word. Whenever he could do anything foT a soldier or recruit he was eveT ready to do it .

Any person entitled to a war gratuity r e - may give to the Treasurer or other prescribed written authority to deduct fro m the amount of the gratuity such a sum as such person shall desire to contribute to the capital of any co-operative company or society of members of the Australian Imperial Forces and their next of kin and dependants with or s rewithout approved patriotic workers arid payu n - ment of the amount so authorized to be deducted from the gratuity shall be made in The r e is cash to such persons as the prescribed c at e as authority shall nominate to receive the same."" This a m e n d m e n t provides that the Ret u r n e d Soldiers Association m a y , by arrangement , h a v e the o p p o r t u n it y of establ is h in g a co-operative t r a d in g company with the g r at u it y money.

They f e e l that it w o u l d be a great p it y if 16 the o p p o r t u n it y was lost to the r e turn e d soldiers of creating some permanent monument with the gratuity. They fear that quite a number of the men may, if no such scheme is put forward, use their money in directions which will not be very useful. Sumcient men in the association have already intimated their in tention of taking up practically enough shares to establish this concern. The idea is not only to have a co-operative society in the ordinary sense, but also to work in with those soldiers who have been settled on the land.",75
445,Mr MAXWELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is it to be distributive ?,76
446,Mr BLUNDELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes , distributive and trading. The society or store will handle the produce of returned soldiers who have taken up land, particularly along the banks of the Murray, and supply it direct to the consumer, thus altogether eliminating the middleman. By doing this, the returned soldiers will be not only helping themselves, but taking a very material step towards reducing the high cost of living. The scheme is to be quite voluntary. The words "" with or without approved patriotic workers "" appear in the amendment. These were, put in because it was the intention to broaden the membership of the society to enable munition workers, rejected volunteers, and members of similar associations to become shareholders. I did not put the amendment on the notice-paper with any intention of anticipating the speech made by the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Prowse). When he was putting forward the case for the establishment of a cooperative society, I had in my pocket the prospectus drawn up by the Returned Soldiers Association, but could not use it on that occasion because it was marked "" confidential."" terial to me who moves the amendment, or who gets credit for it , so long as we establish; the principle of allowing the returned soldiers to create, - with the gratuity bonds, a co-oper""ative society which will be of material benefit, not only to themselves, but to the whole of the people of Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in consultation with the honourable for Swan and myself, has to the principle that we have both put forward, but not quite in the form which we suggested. I understand that he has had a clause prepared that gives the opportunity of carrying out the principle and enabling the society to be started. I do not anticipate any opposition to that proposal from either side of the Committee. Every one of us can agree to it . By doing so, we shall place no responsibility on our own shoulders, but we shall give the returned men an opportunity of carrying out the very laudable object that they have in view.  I desire to confirm what the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) has said. It would possibly save time if his proposal and mine were amalgamated in the form of a new clause. I spoke at some length on the Address-in-Reply as to the advisability of inducing the soldiers to utilize the gratuity money in helping themselves, and helping Australia at the same time, by forming a large co-operative company for the manufacture of articles from our raw material in the shape of wool and many other products, which would indeed make for them a gratuity in perpetuity. The Bill , as - printed, makes no provision for them to invest their money in that way. If our proposal is adopted, it will be found to have been a blessing that the soldiers did not get their money in cash. They will have a little time for reflection, and for the formation of companies for their own benefit, thus becoming interested in the country they fought for. Considerable capital will be available by this means, and the soldiers can become the chief manufacturers of madeup woollen goods in Australia if they like to put their heads together. The amendment will give them an opportunity to do so in connection, not only with wool, but with other raw materials. In Bunbury, a few of the returned soldiers It is imma- put in a little capital with other Bunbury people, and the Government gave them some assistance. They have woods suitable for axe handles, pick handles, adze handles, and other things. They obtained the necessary machinery, and have developed an industry that will eventually be able to supply Australia, and shut out all outside competition. Undertakings of that sort ought to be encouraged, as member they will help to get over many of the agreed repatriation difficulties, and go a long way towards making this country self-contained. The proposal which I wish to put before the Committee is in substitution of the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Adelaide, and of one of which I have given notice. It is in the form of a new clause, which would read as follows:15A - (1.) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the last preceding section, any member of the Forces may lodge with any approved company, as security for any sum payable by him in respect of any ehares in that company, any Treasury bonds issued to him in pursuance of this Act. (2.) In the event of default being mode by the member in the conditions under which the Treasury bonds were lodged by him, the company may lodge the bonds with any banking corporation, or with any other financial institution approved by the Minister, as security'for an advance to the company. (8.) In the event of - default being made by the company in the conditions under which the Treasury bonds were lodged by it , the corporation or institution with which they werelodged may realise on the bonds. (4.) In this section ""approved company"" means a company(a) formed for the purpose of the development of primary or secondary production in the Commonwealth; (b) incorporated in the Commonwealth; (c) approved .by the Minister; and ((/) the articles of association of which provide that no person other than a member of the Forces as denned in this Act is eligible to become shareholder. It will be noticed that action on the part of soldiers under this proposed clause will be voluntary, not compulsory. The provision will give an opportunity to soldiers to utilize their bonds more freely. Business men and banking institutions will recognise their value, and will accept them as security. The bonds will, therefore, be very far from the worthless paper which some honourable members would make them appear.",76
447,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [1.10 a.m.] The provision just read, which embodies the proposals of the honourable members for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) and Swan  ceptionable. Those honourable members discussed the matter with me, and I told them that I had given the undertaking to Captain Dyett that the Government would do everything in its power to assist the particular association in which the honourable member for Adelaide is interested. We wish, moreover, to do all we can to enable the soldier, as the honourable member for Swan has said, to do something for his country as well as for himself, and something for himself as well as for his country. We shall do well in encouraging these young men to form co-operative associations for the purposes of trade, manufacture, and business generally. Anything that will help them to do that will be advantageous to the country as well as to them. Anything done by a soldier under the proposed new clause will be quite voluntary; it merely enables him to utilize his bonds, despite the prohibition against alienation in clause 15. The Government is quite willing that the proposed new clause shall be inserted in the BillAmendment, by leave, withdrawn.",77
448,Mr BLAKELEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Darling) [1.18 a.m.]. - It is provided in the second paragraph of sub-clause 2 that in the case of a wax gratuity not exceeding in amount such sum as is fixed by the Treasurer, payment may be made in cash. Can the Prime Minister tell us what amount is likely to be so fixed? Obviously, it would be ridiculous to issue bonds for a very small sum.",77
449,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Something must be left to the discretion of the Treasurer. The a amount of gratuity due to a soldier might be a sum like £5 3s. or £4 7s. 6d.,77
450,Mr BLAKELEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,But the Treasurer will have to fix at once the minimum amount for which bonds shall be issued.,77
451,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There is no necessity for doing that. Mr ELAKE1EY - Immediately the Bill becomes law the soldiers will lodge their claims for gratuities, and some one will have to determine the lowest amount for which bonds shall be issued. If a decision is not made today, it must be made next week. The Treasurer must have considered the matter. Prom information at hand, I know that a large number of men have put in their claims, and that for some months past the Department has been hard at work having the accounts made up-in fact, that it is now only a question of writing out the bonds. I have not the slightest doubt that the whole of the necessary information is available as to what the limit will be, whether it be £3, £5, or £6.",77
452,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [1.17 a.m.] As far as I am able to ascertain, the Treasurer is not able to say how much is involved, for instance, in sums of £5, but honourable members may accept my assurance that the amount will .not be. less than £3, and we shall not give more than £5 in cash under this particular provision. Of course, in necessitous cases, the full amount will be paid cash.",77
453,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Maribyrnong) [LIS a.m.] - Hav e the Government decided whether the bonds will be in various denominations, say £5, £20, or £100, and so on? Will the returned soldier who has £100 coining to him have the option of saying that he would like the amount issued - to him in one bond of £100, or in .two bonds of £50, or i i i ten bonds of £10?",78
454,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Each ' soldier will receive one bond for the amount he is to receive. Mr TXJD0R (Yarra) [1.19 a.m.] - If a soldier is to receive one bond, difficulty may be created in the case of a man who wishes to put; half of the amount he is to draw into one of the proposed co-operative companies. He may - not be willing to put the whole amount into such a concern. It seems to me that it is only a matter of extra printing to provide, say, two bonds of £50, instead of one bond of £100. It would certainly obviate the necessity for the returned soldier having to go to the Treasury for the purpose of making arrangements to invest half of his gratuity in one of the proposed companies. The Government might well consider the matter of issuing bonds of various denominations.",78
455,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [1.20 a.m.]. - I am considering the matter. We are making every arrangement to facilitate this very thing. If .a soldier wishes to pay 25 per cent., 50 per cent., or 75 per cent, of the amount he is to draw into one of these proposed companies, the Treasurer will make all the arrangements necessary to enable him to do so. The printing of the bonds has already been proceeded with in anticipation of Parliament agreeing to the payment of the gratuity, but when Captain Dyett saw me about this very matter about five weeks ago I discussed it with him, and said that I would agree to arrangements to enable the soldier to make a portion of his gratuity available for the purpose of investing it in a company coming under the proposed new clause. All I ask is that if the Returned Soldiers' League dosire to take advantage of the proposed new. clause and desire the help of the Government, they should without delay put the prospectuses of their proposed in corporations before us, so that we may be in a position to give them the help they require.  point.",78

We have been told by a private member that some arrangement has been made by the representatives of an organization with regard to the issue of more than one bond to a soldier. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) is under the impression that only one bond will be issued.",78
462,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I think I said just now by way' of interjection that Captain Dyett made a suggestion that I approved of, and that he discussed the details with the Treasury. The Treasury has agreed to his suggestion. It practically amounts to this, that if the soldier who is to receive, say, a £100 bond, desires to give £50 to a society, the Treasury will arrange the matter by giving him a £50 bond, and passing over to the Society another £50 bond.",79
463,Mr BLAKELEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Will that be provided for by regulation?,79

If we have the. assurance of the Prime Minister, after consultation with his officers, that, in some instances, only one bond, and in others two bpnds, will be issued, well and good.  Might I suggest that where a soldier had already received a bond for £100, and desired to put half that amount into a company, he should be empowered to return the original bond to the Treasury, and to receive in its' stead two bonds of £50, one of which could be handed in by him to the company.",79

467,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Wannon) [1.29 a.m.]. - I would suggest that the ordinary procedure relating to negotiable securities be followed in this case. It is quite unnecessary to issue various bonds as permissible operations take place. We should follow the practice adopted throughout the commercial world in connection with every negotiable security. Where a transaction authorized hy law takes place the nature of that transaction is endorsed upon the security, and the general community is thus advised of the extent to which it has been dealt with. There no reason why the 'Treasury officials should not in the same way endorse a bond in cases of the kind under discussion. Clause agreed to. Clause 14Treasury bonds issued in pursuance, of the last preceding section shall be accepted at their face value, plus interest accrued to date, in repayment of any moneys due by the person to whom they were issued under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act 1917-1918 or the War Service Homes Act 1918-1919. Mr J. H. CATTS (Cook) [1.31 a.m.]. - I move That the following words be added to the clause:-""o r as collateral security by the Associated Banks of Australia."" The soldiers were told over and over again that these bonds would be negotiable at the banks. In the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 11th November last there appeared a statement headed in big black letters, "" Cash Over the Counter,"" ""The Gratuity Bonds,"" ""Banks will Pay,"" ""Prime Minister's Announcement ""Bonds will be issued which will be reserved for repatriation purposes.' The banks will also receive bonds as collateral security. Then there followed in big black type the statement that- The Government has made arrangements with the Savings Bank and all the associated banks, by which the soldier who wants to cash his bond through other than the Repatriation Department will he able to go to the bank and get cash for it. A similar statement appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of the same date. The president of the Associated Banks having stated that no such arrangements had been made, the following amended statement by the Leader of the Government (Mr Hughes) was published in the Sydney Sun on the afternoon of the 11th November: I did not say that I had made arrangements with the banks to cash the bonds. What I said was that I will make arrangements with the banks, and most certainly I will. On the 20th November the .Sydney Sun reported a speech made by the Prime Minister at a meeting of soldiers held in the Protestant Hall, Sydney, in which he saidAs you already know, the bonds will be taken by the Repatriation Department and as is collateral security by the banks. There are numerous other references to the bonds being taken by the banks. I submit that the soldiers of Australia clearly understood that these bonds were to be negotiable by the banks, which would hold them u n t i l the date of mat u r it y and receive the interest due in respect to them.

481,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [1.47 a.m.]. - The principle was clearly stated and accepted by the electors that these were to be non-negotiable bonds, subject to the exceptions specifically set forth. One of those exceptions was that a certain number of bonds were to be cashed by the Treasury. We have been dealing with that class now. Another class of bonds wa3 involved in the £6,000,000 worth which the banks agreed to cash. Dealing with the latter, the banks have agreed to take £6,000,000 worth, and to hold those bonds until they mature. That is the crucial point-one . of vital, importance - namely , that they should not 'be thrown on the market. Then, in addition, the Commonwealth Government will cash all the bonds of its soldier employees. The same remark applies to the New South Wales State authorities, and in respect to Victoria also.",80
482,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Als o with regard to Queensland; but I think that South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania have not arrived at any agreement in this matter.",81
483,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In addition to the States, a very large number of .private employers have agreed to cash bonds. Except as prescribed, the bonds cannot be alienated. But we shall put no limit upon the banks; it is the banks which have placed: a limit upon themselves. They have said, "" We will take only £6,000,000 worth of bonds."" In effect, it is a loan. The banks are lending the money; they are advancing cash for which we pay o i per cent, interest for three years. If the banks will agree to cash still more bonds, then, of course, there will be no trouble with regard to the soldiers getting cash. But we cannot allow the bonds to pass from hand to hand, or permit them to become negotiable instruments or currency. Mr BRT7GE (Minders) [1.50 a.m.] I think I have already made my views clear concerning the undesirability of inflating the credit of the country by the process of cash payment for these bonds. But I have a few words additional to say with respect to employers who have undertaken to cash the bonds of their employees. I now understand that the words, "" as prescribed,"" are to cover that position. That is to say, regulations are to be issued under the Act which will indicate to the employer how he may perform this service on behalf of his soldier employees without being stigmatized as a disreputable person, as he might be under the terms of the Bill in its present form. With, regard to the regulations, however, I desire to emphasize this: It will be very simple for any employer to say that he will be generous and will cash the bonds of his soldier employees, if he can walk straight round to his bank and secure additional credit facilities upon those bonds. For generosity of that naturethe soldier employee might well say, "" Thank you for nothing."" The banks are to take their promised £6^00,000 worth ef bonds. Personally; I do not approve of that project. I think it is a mistake; but, at any rate, they will be required to place the bonds in their safes, so that they may not be used for the purpose of creating further credits throughout Australia. The employer, if he is allowed to go to a bank with his employees' bonds and secure extended credit for himself, will not merely bring about an increase of the country's credit and spending power by the amount of the value of the bonds, but will himself be able to operate to that amount. So far as I ' am concerned, I shall have to pay, probably, from £10,000 to £15,000 in cashing the bonds of my firm's soldier employees; and in so doing. I shall possibly pretend toa certain virtue. Then what will be the position if I am. to. be allowed to walk around to my bank? Suppose that I have a fixed overdraft. As a matter of fact, I have not; but many employers have. I may have already operated up to the limit of the amount which the bank will extend to me. But when T present myself before my banker with £10,000 worth of my employees' bonds, I will certainly be in a position to secure another £9,000 credit. That is to say, the soldiers would be getting £10,000-whic h would go to increase the spending power, and, I fear, the extravagance of the country, while, at the same time, I would be getting £9,000, thus in no. way reducing the trading credit of the country. This double procedure would mean anextraordinary inflation of credit throughout Australia. In framing the regulations, therefore, the Government will be well advised if they endeavour to provide that employers shall give cash, and not merely lend a little of their credit to their soldier employees. I suggest that the regulations shall specifically provide that when the employees' bonds are cashed, the employer must deposit the bonds with the Treasury, together with signed receipts from the soldier employees, showing that they have received the ful l face value of their bonds.",81
484,Mr BLAKELEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Darling) [1.57 a.m.]. - It appears that there is quite a lot of work to be done with, respect to this measure after it has left Parliament, namely, in the direction of drafting regulations. During the past five years practically the whole of the government of the country has been carried on by regulations; but on a matter such as the soldiers! gratuity, as much, as possible should be put into the Bill, and as little as possible left to reguthe lation. As the Committee discussion proceeds, I am more and more convinced that this measure has been ill-digested. Apparently it has been loosely strung together, and brought down here in the pious hope and. expectation that it will go through and be all right. But every honourable member must have realized before now that the Bill, at .any rate, so far as we have gone, will involve considerable trouble, not only to the Government, but also to the people of Australia. Certain people provided for in clause 13 will be given the gratuity in cash. Every one agrees that if cash is given at all, those persons should get it. There are others who, under clause 15, will be prescribed by regulation, and not by the Bill, who will be able to get cash for their bonds if they are lucky enough to get in on the ground floor. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has said that the banks will be prepared to give cash for these bonds to the extent of £6,000,000, and the inevitable result of this arrangement will be that a number of soldiers unable to get in early with their bonds to secure cash from the banks will consider that they have been hardly dealt with. It is important that we should know whether private institutions are to be allowed to determine which of the bond-holders outside those covered by clause 13 are to be allowed to get in on the ground floor and secure cash for their bonds. Isthat to be decided by the Governor General in Council by regulation, or by the directorates of the different banks 1 The amendment moved by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) would obviate that difficulty by enabling a bond-holder to cash his bond with any one prepared to pay him its face value.",81
485,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The regulation might provide for the cashing of a percentage the bonds, allowing an equal opportunity to all.",82
486,Mr BLAKELEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is the honourable member replying on behalf of the Governber ment? [46],82
487,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I am making a suggestion which might occur to any reasonable mind.,82
488,Mr BLAKELEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"A certain number of employers will cash the bonds of their employees. If the banks will cash only bonds of their employees, there will be no discrimination, but if in undertaking to cash bonds to the amount of £6,000,000 they will undertake to cash the bonds of outsiders, the lucky bond-holders may have to pay for the privilege of getting their bonds cashed. I can quite understand that some would be prepared to sell their bonds for half their face value. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), with the instinct inherent in the financial magnates of the community, voices his uneasiness at £20,000,000 worth of paper going on the market. The Prime Minister said that the Government are not going to flood the market with paper, but they will give cash to persons covered by clause 13, and will give the right to certain employers to cash the bonds of their employees, and to the banks to cash bonds to the amount of £6,000,000; and the payment of these bonds in cash must iead to a certain inflation of credit. The amendment moved by the honourable member for West Sydney would permit of the bonds being cashed at their face value, but would not allow the money bugs of the community to get rich quick at the expense of the soldiers. I venture to say that there are some persons possessing money who would be quite prepared to help their immediate friends by taking their bonds and giving them cash for them. When pertinent questions are asked about this business, we are told that the matter referred to is to be dealt with by regulation.",82
489,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is all right, and it is 2 o'clock in the morning.",82

506,Mr LAZZARINI,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Werriwa ) [2.9 a.m.] - Some rather extraordinary speeches have been made by honourable members since the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) moved his amendment. I take strong exception to the persistent reiteration of the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) that the issue of non-negotiable bonds has been accepted by the electors. There is no foundation for such statements, as the general opinion throughout Australia is that the soldiers are to receive cash. The statement has been made that if £25,000,000 were thrown on the market A in the form of negotiable bonds, it would have a disastrous effect upon the country. Where is the difference in putting in - £25,000,000 in the hands of the soldiers instead of in the hands of some one else, provided a guarantee is given that the bonds cannot depreciate. There are two main reasons why the Government have adopted this course. They desire to multiply the number of bond-holders who necessarily have a direct interest in the country. They are also anxious that the returned soldiers should hold their bonds for four years, during which time they will expect them to increase the productivity of the country in return for what is supposed to be a free gift of the nation. I suppose that when the bonds are issued the Prime Minister and some of his colleagues will travel the Commonwealth preaching the doctrine of increased production. They will tell the soldier that he will have to sweat a bit harder in order to make his bond secure. will be a good argument to use in an endeavour to whip them into a state of unreasonable activity. These are the only reasons why the Government are making the bonds non-negotiable and compelling soldiers to hold them for four years. Mr J. H. CATTS (Cook) [2.12 a.m.]. - I cannot see why the Government will not accept the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Ryan). We were told that these bonds were to be inalienable to protect the soldiers from harpies and others who would wheedle them out of their dues by offering less than their face value. There may not be many people in this country rushing to pay the soldiers the face value of their bonds if they are to he held for four years. The Bill absolutely prohibits the cash to be handed to the soldier, even though the face value of the bond is tendered. There can be no justification for such an attitude. I am sorry the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has left the chamber, because his statement regarding the £6,000,000 worth of bonds to be taken up by the banks should be further explained. He has stated that a certain number of bonds are to be cashed by the Treasury, and that the banks are also to redeem £6,000,000 worth. I concluded from the Prime Minister's second-reading speech that the £6,000,000 worth to be taken up by the banks was for providing the Treasury with money to pay cash in certain cases. would like the honourable member for Plinders (Mr Bruce) to give his attention to this matter, because I am sure [46]- 2 that he gathered from the Prime Minister's statement the impression that the £6,000,000 to be provided by the banks is in addition to the cash to be provided by the Treasury. Surely, the Prime Minister would not deliberately mislead the Committee. There are two Ministers present just now. Will they be good enough to tell me whether the £6,000,000 which is to be forthcoming from the banks is intended to enable cash to be paid in cases for which provision has already been made in the Bill, or whether it is intended to provide for additional cases?",83
507,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,My impression is that the honourable member has already This been told that it is intended to cover additional cases.,84
508,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If that be so, I shall watch the operation of the Bill very closely. As I understand the position, the £6,000,000 to which I have referred, is to be provided by the banks for the purpose of enabling cash to be paid in the urgent cases which are included in this measure. If the banks pay cash for £6,000,000 worth of bonds, and hold those bonds for four years, it necessarily follows that their securities will be increased to that extent. Now, as they always make advances in relation to the securities which they hold, these bonds will, to the extent indicated, be absolutely negotiable.  and not a complete, negotiation.",84
509,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is not complete. But the banks can make their own advances against those bonds, and they will inevitably do so. To that extent the bonds will become negotiable.",84
510,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Then the hororable member ought to be very glad.,84
511,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"So I am.' But evidently the Government do not realise the position when they affirm that this £6,000,000 worth of bonds will not be negotiable.  for those bonds, they will not thereby enlarge their securities. They will merely have bonds instead of cash. I Mr JH CATTS - The banks expand their credits or advances against securities in the proportion of at least four to one. That is, four pounds of credit or advances based upon one pound of security.",84
512,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The banks provide the £6,000,000 to meet the cases which are enumerated in clause 14, and in addition, the Treasury will pay its the past few years. own employees. "" Mr JH CATTS - That is a totally different statement from that which made by the Prime Minister.",85
513,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member does not want information. He merely wants pellets with which to pelt us.,85
514,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Maribyrnong) [2.20 a.m.] - I quite agree that some provision is required to prevent an unholy rush to secure cash for the £6,000,000 worth of bonds to which reference has been made. I take it that every returned soldier will not receive his bond on the same day. As a matter of fact, there will be 300,000 bonds to be distributed. If they are tributed in alphabetical order, then all soldiers from A to C may possibly receive their bonds ou the same day. But before the list will become exhausted, probably several weeks will have elapsed. It therefore follows that, unless there is some control exercised over the cashing of these bonds, those who receive them first, if they desire to exchange them for cash, .will be able to do so, whilst those who are at the bottom of the list will be left in the lurch. Finally, it seems to me that the banks will have the holding of most of these bonds. I am very glad that the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) has submitted this amendment, because of the information which it has elicited, although that information was doubtless given by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) some time ago to members of the National party in Caucus assembled.",85

I cannot see the difference between the banks advancing that sum and private individuals advancing it , or advancing even £28,000,000 for that matter. If the Government are prepared to allow the banks to make that advance, what sound grounds are there for preventing private individuals from lending the necessary money ?

One honourable member has suggested that between the Federal Government, the State Governments, private employers, and the banks £20,000,000 worth of bonds will be cashed, but I want to know from the Prime Minister what is likely to be the total amount. If it is the idea of the Government to facilitate the cashing of these bonds, if they have arranged with the banks to cash £6,000,000 worth, and if they propose to redeem the bonds held by their own employees, and have made arrangements with the State Governments to redeem certain other bonds, I cannot see what objection there can be to the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan),, seeing that if the estimate of £20,'b00,000 made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong is correct as to the amount to be redeemed by these processes, it only leaves a further £8,000,000. worth to be provided in cash. The amendment, if carried,- will leave it open to the general public to do what' the banks - are to be permitted to do. The attitude of Ministers seems to be, ""Take the Bill or leave it ; you will get no further information;"" and if one kicks up a row about the matter he gets less information. The Prime Minister could very easily dispose of my question if he would only tell me whether he has any idea as to the amount the Government propose to cash, other than the £6,000,000 which he says in one speech the banks are going to make available, although he comes here now and tells us that they will ' not provide it for that particular purpose.

That is an object with which I am indeed well pleased, but if the face value of the bonds is given to the returned soldiers I do not see how it can be said they will be exploited.

I realise the difficulty in defining what is income and what is capital, and I point out that while the gratuity may be recognised as income during the first year in which it is received, it may not be so regarded in the second year, when money may have been placed in the bank. Will it then be exempt? not want the income of the aged and in firm to be free of taxation only during the first year, and taxable in subsequent years.",94

The parents of those boys would be entitled to nearly the full amount, which is estimated at approximately £ 1 3 0 each, or £ 2 6 0 for the two. As the Income Tax Act stands at present, the pension is reduced 10s. per week for every £ 1 0 of capital possessed. these circumstances, deserving people such as I have mentioned would be seriously affected, and provision should be made whereby the gratuity paid in such cases should not be counted as in come for only the first year. I trust that the Prime Minister's amendment will make it clear that so long as. this money is forthcoming it will not be charged as capital, but as income. Many of these old people have only a few years to live, and it is only righ t that we should show them every consideration. the Pensions Act is administered in a proper way, there should be no reason to complain; but if we cannot give the necessary protection now, we shall have to do so when an amending Pensions Bill is under consideration. If the Government assures me that the Act will be administered in a sympathetic way, I shall be satisfied. Mr BI.AKEI.EY - Would it not be possible to frame a regulation to make the position clear?",95
636,Mr TUDO R,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The matter is one which rests entirely with the Administration. I am sure that it is the opinion of honourable members generally, irrespective of the political party to which they may belong, that we should not extort blood money from these people.",95

Now, presumably the bonds will be taken up by the banks and private employers. Personally, I hold the opinion that the interest earned by these bonds should not be exempt from income tax save in the case of bonds held by soldiers. Certainly interest thus earned should not be free from income tax when of the the bonds are held by banks, private employers, and others. If necessary, I shall move an amendment upon the lines I have indicated. I believe thatbefore very long about £20,000,000 of these bonds will be in the hands of people other than soldiers. Exemption from income tax of the interest earned by the bonds would thus mean the exemption of more than another £1,000,000 fro m taxation.",95

F o r example, the banks will have to pay the face value of the bonds, and I am not quite clear as to the position they occupy in regard to the interest accruing upon them. Certainly we must not do' anything which will tend to induce them not to cash the bonds as freely as they have So long as agreed to do. But if the honourable member will leave the matter in abeyance, I promise him that I will look into it, and if I can adopt his suggestion without in any way affecting the principles of the Bill in their application to the banks and other institutions, I shall be glad to do so. But , offhand, I cannot agree to it . I must have time to consider exactly how far it will operate. I ask the honourable member to allow me to look into the matter, becauseI share his opinion that it is not good business to allow interest earned by these bonds to escape the payment of income tax. He will be quite safe in leaving it in m y hands.",95
639,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Wannon) [4.2 a.m.]. - I tliink that the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) has made a suggestion to which the 'Government should assent. The exemption from income tax of interest earned by gratuity bonds should be limited to bonds which .are held by soldiers. We have long departed from the principle that interest earned by war bonds should be free from income tax, and we should Tefuse to recognise that principle here. Any corporation or company which cashes gratuity bonds should be well content to Teceive 5£ per cent, interest upon the amount which it thus invests, and to know that it has rendered some aid to our returned soldiers.",96

Honourable members must know that these gratuity bonds will be operated upon by the banks - Only the interest earned by bonds held by soldiers or their dependants' should escape the payment of income tax. We have already affirmed that principle in another measure, and we cannot afford to depart from it here. We shall negligent in our duty if we permit rich firms to escape the payment of income tax upon the interest earned by gratuity bonds.

Are we to understand the Minister's statement as another contribution to Ministerial opinion upon this important subject? Throughout the debate successive Ministers have been in charge of the measure, and not one of them has taken the trouble to have the necessary information availbe able for the Committee. The Minister who has just sat down takes it for granted that this new issue of paper is going on to the market, and again I ask if the £6,000,000 to be taken up by the banks will be utilized by the Government to provide cash for the necessitous cases mentioned in clause 13. The banks will get these bonds at 5 i .per cent., and the exemption will probably represent another re2-i per cent., so, taking into account the be incidence of the income tax, they will represent about 7% or S per cent.",96

I am confident that the carrying of the will be a great shock to some of those capitalists who were figuring on paying face value for the bonds, with the idea that they would be able to get a return of 5J per cent, free of income tax. Dp to the present the war loans have been issued at only i i per cent, free of income tax, and it would be a distinct advantage to the financial institutions if rethey could get 5£ per cent, on the same amendconditions.

It seems to me, If in the light that we are getting as the the debate on this subject proceeds, that it by is going to be a gratuity to the banking institutions more than to the soldiers. Why is the exemption from income tax included at all? As the.honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) points out, I take it that about £200 will be the largest gratuity that any individual soldier will be paid, and the income from that amount will be about £10 10s. per it. annum. Where, then, does the income But when the bonds accumulate into an amount of £6,000,000, I the income tax exemption begins to work. I understand, from the latest statement made by one of the Ministers, that the only institutions or individuals who will be allowed to cash the bonds or get hold of them will be the banks. I suppose they will take £6,000,000 worth, and in twelve months' time, after the cash has circulated through the ordinary channels of commerce and come back to them, they will lend the same £6,000,000 out again, and will then have £12,000,000 worth of bonds. In spite of the smiles that I see on the other side, the fact remains that the banks, by means of the circulation of £1,000,000, can get hold of £12,000,000 worth of these bonds.

The Minister for Home and Terri body could buy war bonds at 94^ or 95, free of income tax. If we make the interest on the gratuity bonds subject to income tax when they are transferred from the hands of the soldiers into other hands, the implication, from what the Minister said, is that the banking institutions, or whomever else the Government depend upon to cash bonds, will refuse to cash them. Apparently, then, we are getting right down to the mercenary spirit of commercialism, and the vaunted patriotism of these institutions is thrown to the winds. It was a good thing for the purpose of camouflaging the issue, and useful when the general outline of the Bill was being propounded. It served to throw dust in the eyes of the electors, but when it comes down to bedrock, and they have to pay the price, their patriotism goes by the board, and the good old precepts of commercialism are strictly adhered to by those who are here in the interests of the capitalistic institutions.",98

We are all anxious to make the interest on these bonds free of income tax for the soldiers, but the soldiers would be paying tax at the lower rate, which would not be more than 5d. or 5£d. in the £ 1 . It would be a very different matter if the bonds fell into the hands of people or institutions paying 6s. or 7s. in the £ 1 . This was pointed out by Sir John Grice two or three months after the Minister and myself had fought the matter out on the floor of this chamber. We were accused of being fool financiers, but when other people took it up they were hailed as heaven-born financiers. We have no right to give to any section of the community an advantage over others. I trust the Government will see that the exemption from income tax, Federal and State, is given only to the soldiers, and not to others who may acquire the bonds. There are some people who pay income tax, Federal and State together, at the rate of at least 10s. in the £ 1 .

668,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Barrier) [4.42 a.m.] - I move That the following proviso be added to the clause:-""Provide d that the prescribed authority hereinbefore mentioned shall include not less than two returned soldiers' and sailors' representatives who shall be selected by the members of the returned soldiers' and sailors' organizations of the Commonwealth."" When the Repatriation Bills were before this House I submitted a similar proposal. I think the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was on the other side of the world at the time. My idea is that soldiers and sailors should be represented on the prescribed authority-that they should have in matters concerning them the same representation that industrial organizations have on any board dealing with matters in which the unions are concerned. The Prime Minister has already announced that three persons will constitute the prescribed authority, but in the belief that this body will be something like the Repatriation Commission I seek to provide that at least two of the persons constituting it shall be elected by the returned soldiers or sailors.",100
669,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The soldiers have one representative on the Repatriation Commission.,100
670,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Prime Minister overlooks my previous statement that I moved to have two members of the Repatriation Commission chosen by the returned soldiers and sailors. When that amendment was moved the Government would not consent to the delegates being selected by the men themselves, but said that they would nominate certain returned soldiers. My view is that the men themselves should elect their representatives on the PAIRS. Board, which is to be the "" prescribed authority."" I have moved for the appointment of two, but if the Government will consent to embody in the Bill the principle for which I am contending, I am willing to waive my request for two members of the Board to be selected by the representatives of the men themselves, and to agree to only one being so appointed.",100

It was agreed that there should be one representative of the League on the "" prescribed authority,"" and that the other two should be appointed by the Government. The honourable member is asking that the League shall select its own representative.",100
672,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Not the League. I understand there are several organizations of returned soldiers in the Commonwealth and a number of soldiers who do not belong to any organization.,100
673,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I can hardly believe that the honourable member is serious. I propose to deal with the only organization in existence which gives me an opportunity to meet the representatives of - I do not say all the soldiers-bu t the majority of them. I know no better way of giving the soldiers representation than through the League. That is what I propose to do. The League will select their man and we shall appoint him. If that is what the honourable member wants, I shall give him my assurance that that is what the Government will do. are to Mr Considine (Barrier) [4.48 a.m.] - I do not desire that the selection shall be restricted to the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League. I maybe wrong, but I am under the impression that the majority of the returned sailors and soldiers are outside that organization. I am informed that there are several organizations in the various States. That is the position in Victoria and New South Wales, and if the returned sailors and soldiers desire to select a man to represent them, there should bo no difficulty in the way of these organizations meeting for that purpose.",100
674,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I shall offer no objec-, tion to that. If the soldiers and sailors like to do that, it will please me very well.",101
675,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"My amendment would provide for that, whereas the Prime Minister's agreement is specifically made with the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League.",101

688,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Cook) [4.51 a.m.]. - This is another case in which the proposals of the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) were reported in very definite terms. The right honourable gentleman, accompanied by the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) and a special representative of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, went to Wollongong during the election campaign, and addressed two meetings. It is reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 21st November last thatTn the evening he was escorted by a band to the Crown Picture Theatre, where he addressed an overflowing audience of over 3,000 people. . . . Asked if officers or ""diggers"" would fill the soldier positions on the Gratuity Board",101
689,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH, Order ! The honourable member is now departing from the question immediately before the Chair.,101
690,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am dealing with includes a pledge which the Prime Minister gave, and which is directly associated with the question now before the Chair. The report continuesMr Hughes said that the positions would be given to the best men', whether officers or ""diggers,"" and the diggers would have a say in their appointment. On the following day he addressed a meeting of soldiers at Wollongong, and emphasized this point. In the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 22nd November last, it is reported thatPrior to leaving by motor for Sydney this morning, Mr Hughes addressed a meeting of returned soldiers in the School of Arts. The At this meeting he dealt with the question of making available the sum of £10,000,000 by May, 1921, and referred to cases of distress which would be dealt with by the Gratuity Board. The report continuesA VOICE - How will you pay the £10,000,000 to' be made available in May, 1921 ?",101
691,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We will pay widows and mothers and sick soldiers in cash. Then, perhaps, the men could be taken in order, the 1914 men first, the 1915 men next, and so on. There must be some order just as you came home, but I am perfectly willing to ' leave that to the League or to the men. ' ' That was his statement to the soldiers. Now we are told that the soldiers are to have one representative.",101
692,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That was the understanding with the League, and I am standing by it .",101
693,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is a pity that the right honourable gentleman did not maintain that attitude throughout his election speeches. At Wollongong, where he was speaking in support of one of his supporters whose seat was being hotly contested, his first proposal in gard to representation was made more liberal; now he says he will stick to his earlier statement. It is a pity that he did not maintain some consistency in his promises to the soldiers.",102
694,Mr KERBY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Ballarat) [4.58 a.m.]. - There is practically only one returned soldiers' organization that has any considerable numerical strength. There are several other organizations without' any Federal constitution, and if we are to wait until a representative is chosen by the whole of these organizations, it will be hard to say when the prescribed authority can be appointed. The Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia represents 50 per cent, of the returned soldiers, and it is undoubtedly the body from which their representative should be chosen. Even if the whole of the associations are brought together at a conference, the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia will have the preponderance of voting strength, and its representative must be chosen. Therefore, it would be a waste of time to hold such a meeting as was suggested by the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine). I interjected a few moments ago that all those soldiers who counted were members of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Im- Lavelle, T. J. perial League of Australia. I did not apply that remark to the men themselves; I meant that that organization was the only one that counted with the great bulk of the men.",102
695,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Melbourne) [5.0 a.m.] - The statement of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Kerby) was not quite accurate. Some very good soldiers are not members of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia, because of the unjust rule of would be dictators who were in official positions, and from which they were ultimately violently removed. The suggestion made in the amendment I commend to the Prime Minister's consideration. I introduced a deputation today to a Minister representing the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and it was suggested that a real representative of the soldiers might be chosen by reballot, the soldiers using their discharges as the old electoral rights were used; thus all soldiers, irrespective of whether they belonged to the stronger or the weaker organizations, would have power to choose their representative. Another suggestion I make is that, as a soldier can.hardly be expected to understand all the minutiae pertaining to naval service, any more than a sailor can be expected to understand all the minutiae pertaining to the life and calling of a soldier, Cabinet should consider whether it cannot appoint to the Board two men-on e to represent the soldiers, and the other to represent the sailors. By so doing a better result would be obtained than by having one representative of the two services. Question-That the words proposed to be added (Mr Considine'S amendment) be so added-put .

697,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But they can do so by making use of their bonds for purpose. If this clause restricts the of bonds solely to association with PAIRS. panies formed among soldiers themselves it will be doing an unjust thing. I will cite as an example the case of a hundred returned men who are engaged in farming operations in a Mallee district of Victoria. They are a fine community, and have been exceptionally successful. They live in a locality in which cooperative organizations are flourishingly carried on, and they may naturally desire to join such organizations. Will they be prevented from making use of their bonds in doing so? I know of another comclause be inmunity of returned men who are engaged in fruit growing. Throughout the fruit growing district cool stores have been erected, or are being constructed, on cooperative lines, among the fruit-growers themselves. Are the returned soldiers to be prevented from employing their bonds in order to identify themselves cooperatively with fruit-growers around them?",103
698,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [5.12 a.m.]. - There is nothing in this Bill to prevent any soldier or any number of soldiers from becoming interested in any company or companies, apart altogether from those which are covered by the proposed new clause, providing that the returned men are able to get the banks to accept their bonds as collateral security. Let us assume that 100 soldiers, working in community, possess bonds averaging in value £50. They may desire to invest half the amount of the accumulated value in a neighbouring co-operative organization. If they take their bonds to the bank, and explain that they desire to secure shares, the bank will in the ordinary, course, consider whether or not it can accept the security offered. There is nothing to prevent such a procedure, seeing that the banks can accept the bonds. (M a r i by r n o n g ) [5.8",103
699,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is that provided e d soldiers m a y use the i r anywhere in this Bill?,103
700,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not say that it is provided in the Bill, hut the banks may accept these bonds as collateral security.",103
701,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Has an agreement to that effect been made with the banks?,103
702,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The banks may, if . the they choose, advance money on these use bonds as collateral security, and the regucomlations under this Bill may prescribe the conditions upon which that may be done. If it is desired to follow out the suggestion completely and allow returned soldiers to invest their bonds in any way they please that cannot be permitted. Very careful provision is made to prevent returned soldiers being victimized. I remind the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) how difficult it is to draw the line. The cases to which he has referred are cases to which no exception could be taken. It would be a very good thing to encourage returned soldiers to invest in such enterprises as he has mentioned, but if they are free to invest as they please, other proposals each less desirable than the one preceding, might be made until we came to palpable and open victimization of the soldier, and we must protect him against that. Therefore, the regulations will prescribe the conditions under which these bonds may be utilized for this purpose, either by way of collateral security or in any other way, but they cannot be used for their face value for any other purpose than that provided for in the Bill.",103
703,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Maribyrnong) [5.17 undertaking. a.m.] - If what I have suggested is not provided for in the Bill, I ask the Prime Minister whether, if a group of soldiers situated as I have indicated made a joint request to the Treasurer to be permitted to invest their bonds in the way I have mentioned, would, consideration be given "" to such a request?",104
704,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Certainly . Proposed new clause agreed to. Mr J. H. CATTS (Cook) [5.18 a.m.] I move That the following new clause be inserted "" 15AA.

(2) Any such corporate bodies and shall accept such gratuity bonds and provide a cash equivalent to an employee who enlisted from their service. (3) Any corporate body or person included in the schedule mentioned in sub-section failing to comply with sub-section (2) shall be States agreed to the same thing. guilty of an offence against this Act."" The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) stated on numerous occasions that bers of employers gave him taking that they would cash gratuity bonds for their employees. It is perfectly true that the Government could frame regulations to permit of that being done where employers desire to give effect to their undertaking. But if certain employers do not desire to do so, there is no means provided by the Bill to compel them to carry out their undertaking. I do not propose now to read the list of 150 employers in New South Wales who gave this undertaking, but it includes all the big employers of that State, and may be found at page S65 and following pages of Hansard of 25th March. Unless a clause such as that I have moved is inserted in the Bill, many of the employers will refuse to carry out what they have - undertaken to do. They were electioneering, as well as the Prime Minister; they did not want a Labour Government returned, and they were stampeded into giving this public undertaking to their employees in order to assist the Prime Minister in his election campaign. It is only fair now that we should compel them to make good their publicly-given We know that various employers undertook that their employees who enlisted would, on their return to Australia, be re-employed by them; but evidence has been supplied in this Chamber that certain employers have refused to re-employ men to whom this promise was made. The Prime Minister said that he would pillory such an employer, but no action has been taken against them. In one case that came under my notice, the winner of a V.C. was refused re-employment by ;a previous employer on his return to Aus:-»- tralia. By submitting this clause, I give and the Government a last opportunity of to giving effect to a serious undertaking made in between the Prime Minister and the great persons employers of New South Wales.

I trust the House AYES. will agree to the recommittal of the Bill for these purposes, and I submit thab the Committee will have power, if this course is adopted, to make amendments""of the nature I am suggesting in connection with these particular clauses. AB ill of this character must be founded on a message from the Governor General under section NOES. 56 of the Constitution. I do not propose to keep honourable members very long, but I desire to obtain a decision on what T consider an important matter. Section 56 of the Constitution providesMaxwell, G. A. A vote, resolution, or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneys shall not Prowse, J. H. be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended Ryrie, Sir Granville by message of the Governor General to the House in which the proposal originated. The message from the Governor General in connection with this message, and on which it was founded, was presented to the House on 17th March. The message PAIRS. is in broad and general terms, and it is as follows: R. M. Ferguson-Messag e No. 2 - In accordance with the requirements of section 56 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Governor General recommends to the House of Representatives that an appropriation of revenue and moneys lie made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act relating to the payment of the War Gratuity. This is in wide and general terms, and that message was dealt with in Committee on Friday, the 19th March, when it was resolved on the motion of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) after debateThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue and moneys be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act relating to the payment of the war gratuity. On the House resuming after the resolution had been carried, the Prime Minister moved, pursuant to a contingent noticeThat the Standing Orders be suspended to enable the remaining stages to be passed without delay. Also to That resolution was adopted by the House.",105
706,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It could not have been done in Committee.,105
707,Mr RYAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The resolution was adopted by the House; and a motion carried to this effectThat Mr Hughes and Sir Joseph Cook do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. The Governor General, in pursuance of section 56 of the Constitution, sent a message to this House in broad, general terms, which was adopted in Committee, and reported to, and affirmed by the House. The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy prepared a Bill which was in accordance with their views as to how provision should be made for the payment of the gratuity. Now I contend that when a recommendation is received from the Governor General in such broad, general terms, the power resides in the Committee or in the House to move amendments such as I have indicated. In support of my contention I desire to refer you, sir. to page 532 of the 10th edition of May's Parliamentary Practice, where you will find the following:A'o Increase of Sums demanded on Vehalf of tke Grown - As is subsequently explained (see page 580), the constitutional principles which vests in the Crown the sole responsibility of incurring national expenditure, forbids an increase by the Commons of a sum demanded on lichalfof the Crown for the service of the State. This principle, however, is apparently disregarded when the recommendation of the Crown is given to a resolution empowering the expenditure of public money which, framed in general terms, places no limitation on the amount of expenditure to bo authorized by tin resolution. As the resolution sanctions, without any specific limitation, the application of money to IKS provided by Parliament to certain purposes, when that clause in a Bill founded upon such a resolution are before the Committee, the freedom of action sanctioned by that resolution can be exercised. The Committhat tee is not hound by the terms of the provisions which the Ministers of the Crown' have inserted in the Bill, whatever may be the cost resulting therefrom, so long as the power conferred the Royal recommendation is not exceeded. ing on this principle, when, in 1812, a Commithis tee was considering a message from the Prince Regent recommending, in general terms, provision to ho made for the family of Mr Spencer Perceval, amendments were permitted for creasing the provision proposed by the ters; and this practice has been supported rulings from the Chair, though, on the last occasion, not without remarks which deserve careful consideration. I have shown to the House that there w i be ample power in Committee to make tion amendments to the particular clauses to which I have alluded. I cannot refer to mittees. [48] the happenings in Committee, but I have pointed out that when we reach that stage we shall have ample' power to make amendments of the nature I have indicated. Every honourable member will agree with me that it is of the utmost importance that the representatives of the people should be afforded an opportunity of saying whether or not certain classes of persons shall be included in the category of those who are entitled to receive the war gratuity.

I was endeavouring to show that when the Bill is again referred to the Committee we shall have ample power to make the necessary amendments which are indicated.,107

717,Mr RYAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have made no suggestion regarding what happened in Committee. I have merely said that there were* certain happenings there.

718,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member wanted these clauses recommitted because he thought the Committee would have power to deal with them.,107
719,Mr RYAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No . We have the power to make .the alterations; and I am suggesting that they should be made.,107
720,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Then may I ask the honourable member another question? Has the Chairman of Committees already decided that in Committee we have not that power?,107
721,Mr RYAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am not allowed to give that information to the House. The right honourable gentleman knows perfectly well that if I attempted to say what had happened in Committee I would be transgressing the Standing Orders of this House, and you, Mr Speaker, would very properly pull me up. I say, however, that if an important question of this sort arose in Committee, I should think the proper course would be for the Chairman of Committees to refer it to the Speaker, and that some means should be found whereby the final decision should rest with you, sir. However, all this is beside the point. The real substance of the matter .is this: I believe that large numbers of persons, at the present excluded from the provisions of the Bill, are just as much entitled to the gratuity as those who are provided for in the clauses which I desire to have recommitted. I particularly refer to the seamen, and to those persons mentioned by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr), the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), and by other honourable members, who moved amendments from this side of the House; but I do not want to. refer to them in detail at this stage.",107
722,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I must ask the honourable member not to revive any proceedings in Committee.,107
723,Mr RYAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"J f I did so, it-was done quite inadvertently, Mr Speaker. I hope we shall leave no stone unturned in an important matter like this to endeavour to have incorporated in the Bill, by whatever forms our procedure will allow, amendments of the nature I have indicated. This can only be done by a recommittal of the Bill.",107
724,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker, I think it very desirable that on an important matter of our parliamentary procedure the position should be made perfectly clear, otherwise the proceedings in Committee may be reduced to a nullity, so far as concerns the governance of the Committee by the decision of the Chairman. You may have no official knowledge of what has happened in Committee, but throughout the whole of his speech the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Eyan) endeavoured to prove that if we carry his motion and go into Committee we shall be able to do this, that, and the other thing. Why should this be the subject of a discussion at all at this particular stage ? The more we consider the matter the clearer it becomes that the honourable member is trying, by means of this motion, to get through a ruling of the Chairman of Committees, which prevented him from discussing this subject in Committee.",108

Honourable members having risen to speak,",108
737,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am quite prepared to give my ruling upon the point of order. There seems to he some obscurity in the minds of some honourable members in regard to the motion before the Chair. There can be no doubt that this House has the right to decide whether certain clauses in a Bill shall be recommitted. The merits of the arguments of the honourable member for West Sydney in support of his motion, so long as they did .not refer .to the proceedings in Committee, are matters for the judgment of the House, as long as they were within the scope of allowable debate. A motion for recommittal may be moved without assigning any reasons. The honourable member stated that in his opinion certain things can be done, and desires that the Bill be recommitted for the purpose of considering certain clauses. I am not asked to decide whether those things can be done. ceedings in Committee are subject to the control of the 'Chairman, although the Speaker can, if necessary, be appealed to in certain circumstances. will be for the Chairman .of Committees to deal with that question of order if the House decides to recommit the Bill. The only motion that I have before me is that the Bill be recommitted for the consideration of clauses 2, 3, and 4.",109
738,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Darling Do w n s - M i nister for Works and Railways) [5.56 a.m.] - The reason the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) gives, is that the Committee has power to deal with the matter, and that he believes it is necessary to deal with it . Judging by the time he spent on his argument, his strong ground apparently was that the Committee had power to deal with it . I submit that the Committee has no such power, and for that reason it. is useless to recommit the Bill. The Committee, in its deliberations, will be guided by the practice of this Parliamient, which has been settled by Mr Speaker Holder, a gentleman of the highest reputation and integrity, and thoroughly versed in constitutional procedure"". In the ruling he gave on the 1st August, 1907, he traversed statements similar to those made just now by the honourable member. In the first place the Bill upon which the matter was decided was introduced by message from the Governor General in general, and not in specific, terms, and the procedure f o l lowed was exactly as the honourable member has described. Mr Speaker Holder stated thatThe message having been considered in Committee, it was determined that the appropriation should be made. Permission was given to certain members of the Government to prepare and bring in the Bill. The Bill was brought in, therefore, in pursuance of the decision of the Committee. When it was brought in, it provided that certain bounties should be payable upon certain itemsJust as this Bill provided that certain gratuities should be paid to certain persons under certain conditions. Mr. Speaker Holder addedI rule now that no amendment can be introduced which would enable any bounty to be payable in respect of any item which is not already provided for in the Schedule. The report in the Votes and Proceedings Pro- also states that no amendment could be introduced which would have the effect of increasing any bounty. Then a rather ingenious suggestion was made tt by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Crouch). I only mention this now because the honourable member for West Sydney spoke of a Governor General's message being brought up at any stage. Mr Crouch suggested that the Bill might go into Committee, that the schedule might be altered, and the Bill reported to the House, and that the Government might then bring down another Governor General's message to cover the amendments. Thereupon Mr Speaker Holder said: Such a course as that suggested by the' honourable and learned member is not forbidden under our Standing Orders, but. we have never followed it. Whenever any message has recommended an appropriation, that message has been at once referred to the Committee; and has been dealt with in what I conceive to bo the constitutional way. I should not like .to give authority to follow any such course as the honourable and learned member for Corio has suggested. The practice of our own Parliament has, I submit, decided the question.",109
739,Mr RYAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That argument might well be directed to the Chairman of Committees.,109
740,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member's argument might just as well have been. The honourable member preferred to address it to the House, and I am following his example.",110
741,Mr RYAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If the Chairman of Committees gives a decision on the lines which the honourable member suggests, then I have some way of getting to the Speaker. Thero must be some way.",110
742,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not want to refer to what took place in Committee, but the matter has been fully considered, the Bill has been before the House for a considerable time, the House knows its mind on the subject, and in the circumstances the House should decide that the recommittal should not take place.

745,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Maribyrnong) [6.9 a.m.] - I am surprised that the Minister for the Navy has introduced a controversial subject at this late hour of the sitting. If we allow the interest, earned by gratuity bonds held by banks and big firms to escape taxation, we shall be making an invidious distinction between one set of citizens and another. The House has already affirmed the righteous principle that the interest on money lent to the Government should be subject to PAIBS. income taxation. By remitting the in come taxation on the interest earned by the war gratuity bonds held by others than soldiers, the Government will be losing revenue which the country greatly needs. I hope, therefore, that, in another place, an amendment will be moved on behalf of the Government which will i m pose taxation on the interest from these bonds when they are held by others than soldiers. Sr. MALONEY (Melbourne) [6.11 a.m.] - As an old banker, I feel sure that theTe will be an accumulation of these bonds in our financial institutions The remission of income taxation upon the interest of bonds in the bands of soldiers amounts to nothing at all, bethey cause the tax paid in any individual oase would be so very small. The big emdestination of a vote. ployers and financial institutions, however, have to pay taxation at a much higher rate per f l , and by letting draw the interest on the gratuity bonds free of taxation, the Government will losing a very large amount of The plea has been advanced that the banks have acted nobly in this matter. will allow that they have, though it must how. be recognised .that had they not come to the assistance of the Government, our credit might have collapsed, and in that «ase they would have suffered. I remember the crash that followed upon the boom in Victoria. Had there then been in existence an ""institution like the Commonwealth Bank, there would not have heen that disaster. When that happened, houses which had been rented at £1 a week did not bring in more than Is. a week. I ask the Government to amend the Bill in another place, so that interest drawn on these war gratuity bonds, when held by employers or financial institutions, may be subject to income taxation. It is to be remembered that these bonds will form a gilt-edged security.' Five and a quarter per cent, is a high, rate of interest even in these times, for a security guaranteed not only by a Government, but by the only Government in the world that is backed up by the possession of a continent. No institution or capitalist should benefit by accumulating these bonds, which are the gift of the nation to men who risked their lives in its service. Question resolved in ithe affirmative.
