A warning that the Argentine and America may soon attempt a monopoly of the Euroing pean market for apples, with a view to the exclusion of supplies from Australia or the other Dominions, is issued by Jf. W. Moore & Co., London, fruit merchants, in their October review. This competition, they state, may be promoted by a skilful extension of the period over which United States apples' are placed on European markets, and by a large increase of .Argentine production, similarly handled. As the vote of the apple growers of Australia is averse to the formation of an apple pool, is it the intention of the Minister to initiate some other form of organization among them to effectively it meet the American and Argentine competition, and will he convene a conference to discuss the subject of organization?  present to initiate a fresh scheme of organization.

Is it a fact that the celebrated aviator, Mr Bert Hinkler, intends to fly to Australia in the near future, and that, ns Bundaberg is his native city, it is his intention to land there? 3. In view of the importance of Bundaberg and district and the great impetus recently given to civil aviation, w i ll he state who made 3,145 the report on the proposed aerodrome at Bundaberg and what was the nature of such report ? 4.

To 5. What is the estimated cost of establishing au aerodrome at Bundaberg? 6. How many aerodromes has the Civil Aviation Department established in each State of Australia, and at what centres? I a m now in a p o s it i o n to f u r n is h the following replies:1. The Government's intention is to apply the proposed grant in the first place to the establishment of additional aerial services over certain approved routes, and at this juncture it is not considered expedient to incur expenditure on aerodrome sites that are not essential for the operation of these services. 2. Statements that Mr Hinkler proposes to fly to Australia have appeared in the press but no official intimation to this effect has been received. 3. The Superintendent of Aerodromes the (Captain E. C. Johnson), who reported that he did not locate any area which could be obtained and prepared as a permanent aerodrome at a reasonable cost. 4. If and when it is found that funds are available for the establishment of aerodromes that are not essential to the development of the present programme, an officer will be sent to further investigate the possibilities of obtaining a suitable site at Bundaberg. 5. No detailed estimate has been obtained of the cost of acquiring and preparing a site for a permanent aerodrome at Bundaberg. 6.

39,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"On 23rd November, 1927, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, (Mr A. Green), asked me when I would be able to lay on the Table of the House the report of Dr Cook on the inspection of natives in the north-west of Western Australia. I now inform the honourable member that it is probable that owing to pressure of work at the Government Printing Office, the publication of this report will be delayed until early next year. Yesterday the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Eorde) asked the following questions of the honourable member representing the Minister for Defence1. What was the date of the first representation made to his department by the honourable member for Capricornia for the establishment of an aerodrome at Rockhampton ? 2. What was the estimated cost of establishing the aerodrome? 3. Why was it not established? 4. In view of the large sum of money made available for civil aviation during the current year, and in view of the growing importance of Central Queensland in civil aviation, will he reconsider his decision and make a special, effort to have a suitable aerodrome established at Rockhampton in order to give the desired encouragement to civil aviation in that district? I a m now in a p o s it i o following replies:1. 29th November, 1924. 2. The site, which is now considered to be most suitable for the purpose of an aerodrome is estimated to cost £1,000 for purchase. The clearing and levelling of the area would cost an additional £600. 3. It has been the policy to concentrate activities upon certain approved aerial routes none of which embraces Rockhampton. 4. The proposed increased grant to civil aviation is to be spent primarily in the development of certain aerial routes, but the Government will give sympathetic consideraBrisbane, tion to any request for reasonable financial assistance towards the cost of establishing an aerodrome at Rockhampton in collaboration with the local authorities.

40,Mr COLEMAN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Reid) [11.18] - I view of the fact that the debate on tariff proposals is to be resumed week, I should like to know from the Minister when the many voluminous ports by the Tariff Board will be able to honourable members. It is unfair to ask us to give consideration to various items in the tariff schedule we are in possession of the board's reof ports and recommendations. stand that many of the reports are already printed, but not circulated. I have viously complained of the inordinate lays that occur between the presentation of reports and their distribution to honour the able members.",19
41,Mr FENTON,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"I understand motion for the printing of the reports only a formality, the reports being already in print. ""Will the Minister ask the Government Printer to expedite the supply of copies to honourable members?",19
42,Mr THEODORE,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Dalley) [11.19] No doubt the reports are available to those honourable members who ask for them; at any rate, I have secured copies of reports. of those in which I am specially interested. The convenience of honourable members, liowever, would be met if the were automatically circulated as soon as the order for their printing waa official given by the House. Will the Minister outline the procedure that will lbs., be followed in connection with the forthcoming discussion on the tariff schedule? Will only a few speeches be heard before the discussion is closured, or will ample opportunity be given to all honourable members to set forth their views? The matter is of vital importance, and a full, and even protracted, debate may prove advantageous to the Minister and the sub638,548; 1923-24, ject generally.  Trade and Customs) [11.21] - So far as I know the usual procedure will be followed. I have made what is equivalent to a second reading speech on the tariff schedule and the general discussion will in proceed nominally on item No. 1. After, on that is disposed of, discussion will be to the individual items as they of are dealt with seriatim. For four or five weeks I have been anticipating the desire of honourable n members hy getting the Government the Printer to print extra copies of the this Tariff Board's reports. A few days ago, I paid a well-deserved tribute to rethe Government Printer, Mr Fargher, availand his staff for the very fine work they have done; I understand that most c the of the important reports of the TarifF unless Board are already printed, and 150 each is available for the use of honorI underable members. There remains only one important report to be laid on the table, prenamely, that relating to the iron and desteel industry. Honourable members will require to consider it in conjunction with departmental reports and dissections, and as they cover certain confidential in the formation, I cannot disclose them withis out the consent of the parties interested. I am trying, hqwever, to obtain that consent, and as soon as possible I shall make the whole of the information available to honourable members. I shall consult with the the Clerk of the House to see what further can be done to meet the wishes of honourable members in regard to copies Question resolved in the affirmative. INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL . In committee (Consideration resumed from 29th November (vide page 2231). Postponed clause 9. (What is in cluded in income). Section 10 of the principal act is amended(6) by adding at the end thereof the followlowing paragraph:""and (ft.) in the case of any person who sells or otherwise disposes of to another person (otherwise than by way of testamentary disposition) (a) either as a whole or in separate parts, the whole of the assets of a business carried on by him, for the purposes of putting an end to the whole of his business; or (6) part of the assets of his business, for the purpose of putting an end to a part of his business; or in the case of any person who disposes of to another person (otherwise than by sale or by way of testamentary disposition)Section proposed, to be amended10. The assessable income of any person shall include",19
43,Mr LATHAM,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [11.26] - The purpose of this clause is to amend section 16 of the principal act, in order to remove a flaw that was by the judgment given this year by the High Court in the Weatherly case. Section 17 relates to what are known as walk-in and walk-out sales, and provides that a profit made by the sale of trading stock or live stock in a walk-in, walk-out transaction shall be taken into account for income tax purposes, as is quite proper. Breeding stock, however, were regarded as capital assets, and the proceeds of the sale of them were not to be included for income tax purposes. The section was intended to cover only walkin walk-out sales, but the High Court held that it had a general application. Sub-section 1 of section 17 upon which the High Court delivered its judgment, reads :-The proceeds derived from the sale of the whole or part of the trading stock of any business after the thirtieth day of June One thousand nine hundred and twenty-one (whether on the sale of a business as a going concern or in any other manner for the purpose of discontinuing the business) shall be assessable income. It was intended by Parliament that the words in parenthesis should impose' a limitation, but the High Court held that they were not words of limitation, and that the section meant that the proceeds derived from any sale of live stock or trading stock should be assessable income, and that the exemption in favour of breeding stock should be allowed in connection with every sale. In the Weatherly case portion of the land on which a pastoral business was carried oa had been sold, and the proceeds of the sale of breeding stock were held to be exempt from income taxation. That was not the intention of Parliament, and the purpose of this clause is to make the intention clear. Perhaps it is desirable that I should state what are the proposed amendments. Clause 9 proposes to repeal section 16, which defines assessable income, and to substitute provisions which honourable members will find on page 4 of the bill. It is now proposed to add the following paragraph:""and (/(.) in the case of any person who sells or otherwise disposes of to another person (otherwise and by way of testamentary disposition) (o) either as a whole or in separate parts, the revealed whole of the assets of a business carried on by him for the purposes of putting an end to the whole of his business; or (&) part of the assets of his busiuess, for the pur* pose of putting an end to a part of his business. . . . The first amendment which I shall ask the committee to make is to leave out the words "" whole of h is "" in paragraph a. The provision will then apply in the case of a person who sells either the whole or any part of a business carried on by him for the purpose of putting an end to the business. This legislation is prin cipally of importance to those engaged in the pastoral industry, but it will apply also to other avocations. If this amendment is accepted by the committee the provision will then apply to a pastoralist who owns stations in , say, Queensland and Victoria, and desires to sell his Queensland property. I move' That the words "" whole of his"", pronosed new paragraph (h) sub-paragraph (a), be omitted. - Amendment agreed to. - Mr LATHAM (Kooyong-Attorney - of General) [11.34] - I move That the words "" his business"", proposed new paragraph (ft) sub-paragraph (6 ) , omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" a business carried on by him "" , and that the word "" his "", second occurring, omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" the "" . Here again it is desired to make it that each separate business shall be treated separately. Amendment agreed to.

62,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"There is something in the contention of the Prime Minister. There is also involved the task of computing the value of the wool on the back of the breeding sheep. At the present time, without the innovation of the new system of separating the wool from the sheep, the purchaser is able to protect himself as to price, and so forth, because the wool on the sheep that he purchases passes with the sheep into his year of accounting, and he thus makes his assessment of the value of the sheep, knowing that he will have to account for the wool, which may be quarter, half, or say threequarter wool. The vendor is asked to account, in some instances, for the wool in the taxable period,-plus portion of the new clip that passes on to a second person, where the vendor has incurred some of the costs of production in the second period. He may be landed, in his income, with the whole of the cost of the production of the previous clip, plus a proportion of the cost of the new clip ",23

67,Mr BBUOE,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"The objection to that is that there would be the possibility of the whole of the wool being kept completely out of the income tax returns by a perfectly legitimate exercise of the power given under clause 10, of declaring the option.",23
68,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"That is why I contend that it is difficult to discuss and arrive at a decision on this matter without a consideration of the next clause. While I am certain that the taxation commissioner and the Government desire to render relief under clause 10 and to separate the two commodities as far as possible, at the date of sale, it will be found, in practice, that the operation of this machinery would be most involved and difficult. I do not think it will be workable. I know of no practical system of appraisement that can be adopted, and, as there are at least 848 different types of wool in Australia, the scheme will be almost impracticable.",23

70,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"It may be easy enough in theory, but, in my opinion, it will be difficult in practice. At first, 1 was inclined to favour the proposal, believing that it was an attempt to help taxpayers; but, on further examination, I have come to the conclusion that it will not work. Let us suppose that a taxpayer whose year ends on 30th June, shears in October, and that on the 30th April of the following year he sells out. He will be taxed in the year of sale on his 12 months' wool clip, shorn in October, and also on that part of the purchase money represented by the six months' wool on the back of his breeders, whereas his expenses will only cover the period from the 30th June to 30th April. I submit that in practice it would be un-'. wise to separate the wool from the sheep.",23

I think that the Attorney-General will find that in practice his proposal will not work out as on paper it would appear to do. It would be better to leave the sheep with the wool until the next shearing time comes round, and to let the man who reaps the harvest declare the whole of his expenses. He should be able to bring his clip and his expenses into account. Surely the trading community is the best judge of how to buy sheep! This "" rule of thumb "" system will only confuse the stock and trading community. The honourable the Postmaster-General (Mr. Gibson) shakes his head; but I remind him that the vendor must take into account his transactions over a period of eighteen months. To a great extent that is an interference with the free process negotiation between vendor and purchaser in respect of one of our greatest national assets-ou r live stock.",24

I do not know whether strong representations have been made the Government regarding this matter. cannot think that they have been, nor I know that the Government is actuated by other than a desire to help woolness growers ; but I am afraid that the remedy ""it proposes will prove a block to transactions on a walk-in-walk-out basis.",24
78,Mr SCULLIN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Yarra) [12.7] Like the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) I do not claim to have had much experience as a pastoralist; but I am beginning to understand the position of the pastoralist from a - taxation point of view. I take it that the general principle embodied in clause 10-and this matter can scarcely be discussed without referring to that clause-is to relieve the taxpayer who has purchased sheep in the wool. If he purchases sheep in the wool, the price he pays for them must necessarily include the value of the wool on their backs. Later, when he shears the sheep and sells the clip, he pays income tax upon the proceeds. Surely, in that case, he is entitled to some deduction for what he paid for the wool. That is the whole point. If a person buys stock from a wholesale merchant, and sells it, he must take it into account at the price paid for it. If he pays for the wool on the sheep's backs, and later, shears the sheep and sells the clip, he should be entitled to deduct the price paid for the wool before his income can be ascertained.",24
79,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,He would take that into' account when making the purchase.,24
80,Mr SCTJLLIN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,I suggest to the honourable member that if he had sheep of with wool on their backs to sell he would not be willing to sell them for the same price that he would accept for them immediately after they were shorn. What chance has the purchaser to protect himself when he is buying sheep with the wool on their backs?,24
81,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,The purchaser is the one man who is able to protect himself.,24

83,Mr SCULLIN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Le t us, for the moment, leave the wool out of our consideration. A man sells the whole of his flock, of which his breeding stock maycomprise the greater portion.",24

85,Mr SCULLIN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"He will probably have as many ewes as wethers. ' Income Tax [30 NOVEI JER, 1927.]",24
86,Mr KILLEN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Sometime s more. Mr SCTJLLIN' - How do we distinguish between ewes and wethers for taxation purposes? Wethers are kept chiefly for their wool. Surely the wethers are as much an asset as the ewes. A wether cannot be treated capital, because it is not heeding stock. In the case of a clearing sale, only breeding stock is regarded as capital. I could understand this exception being made in respect of stud stock, but not in the case of ordinary ewes which are kept largely for their wool. Ewes are kept both for breeding purposes and for their wool. The wether is as much an asset as is the ewe, but because of the fine distinction made, revenue is lost. I do not strongly object to that. The honourable member for Wannon, however, goes further, and says, that if a flock of ewes is sold at the winding up of a business, no account should be taken of the wool on their backs. I point out that if the sale was not effected those ewes would be shorn, probably the next month, and on the clip obtained from them the owner would have to pay income tax. The hoiaorable member cannot have it both ways. We cannot allow a purchaser of stock to deduct the price he pays for the wool on the backs of the sheep, and also, when he sells those sheep later at a clearing sale, get an exemption from taxation for the wool on the backs of breeding stock.",25
87,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,I am not suggesting that.,25
88,Mr SCULLIN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Le t us assume that a pastoralist was selling out. If , at beginning of an accounting period, he took his sheep into account at a certain value, the wool which they had grown while in his possession, would add to value no matter to what extent it had grown. If the sheep are in the wool in each case, there will be no income tax payable on the increased value of the sheep. But if a man buys sheep soon after they have been shorn> and keeps them, he should pay tax on the value of the wool obtained from them. The purchaser is protected; but a man who buys sheep at a fairly low price because there is no wool ori them, and after a period of Assessment Bill. 2285 six months sells them in the wool, and receives an entire exemption from taxation because they are breeding stock, is obtaining a benefit. If he retains them a little longer, and shears them, he will have to pay income tax on the price as received for the wool. The principle underlying the department's suggestion that the purchaser shall be allowed to deduct from the price obtained for the sheep, the value of the wool on their backs insists that in the case of a clearing sale the two things must be separated.",25
89,Mr BELL,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Darwin) [12.14] - The reasoning of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) is sound; but I should like the Attorney-General to say why his proposal applies only to walk-inwalk-out sales and compulsory sales. Th.? necessity of assessing the wool, as distinct from the breeding ewes, should apply to every sale.",25
90,Mr LATHAM,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Kooyong, Attorney General) [12.15] - Specia l provision for walk-in walk-out sales is necessary, because it is arguable whether in the absence of similar provision the proceeds of such sales are income at all. In the case of other sales, the ordinary provision as to sales applies; the clip from the whole flock, including the breeding stock, is taken into account. Unless there was a special provision dealing with to walk-in-walk-out sales, the court might hold that taxation should not be imposed upon any moneys resulting from the sale of a business as distinct from the carrying on of a business. Inconie is earned in the carrying on of a business. If a man sells his business, then, prima the facie, it is not an income-producing operation; it is a realization of assets. At least, it includes the sale of capital assets. It was held in the High Court their that in a walk-in and walk-out sale no income tax was payable in respect of the year in which the sale occurred, although, of course, what was sold included the annual produce. Therefore, it is provided that after a walk-in-walkout sale the proceeds from ordinary trading stock or live-stock shall be taxed; but a distinction is drawn between capital assets and other assets. The sale qf capital assets is not an income-producing operation. If it is a profitable sale, it may make the seller wealthier than he was before; but only by a fortunate sale of capital assets. It is thought proper that, when trading stock of any description, whether sheep or the stock-in-trade of an ironmonger or any other trader is sold for the purpose of putting an end to a business, the proceeds should be regarded as income; but an endeavour is made in this clause to distinguish between sales of capital assets, such as breeding stock, and other sales, and to provide that any profit on the sale of capital assets shall not be regarded as income. This clause is based upon the view that the proceeds of the sale of wool growing on breeding stook is in the nature of income.  seems to me that, in a walk-in and walkout sale, not only the sheep but also the wool on the sheep's back is part of a pastoralist's capital assets. I cannot conceive of separating the wool from the sheep, because, on the average, the wool on the sheep would represent 40 per cent, of the value of the animal, if it were in f u ll wool. Purchasing a sheep is like buying a store and paying, say, £1,000 for the building, and £500 for the stock that is in it. It would be necessary for the seller to clebit his wool account 40 per cent., and credit his sheep account by that amount, in order to keep his accounts in perfect order and see that he was taxed in an equitable manner. If in a walk-in and walk-out sale, a man sells his sheep in full wool, he disposes of part of his capital assets. If he realizes on the he gets a return for it while he is in business; but when he sells his sheep he sells the sheep and wool. Therefore, I say unhesitatingly that he sells part of his capital assets.",25
91,Mr DUNCAN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"HUGHES (Boothby) person, [12.20] - I have with interest heard the learned discussion on this matter, and I cannot help wondering what the ordithe nary breeder of sheep would have made purchaser, of it if he had been listening. A number of honourable members know something about sheep, and I do not think that even they are too sure of the effect of the provisions under consideration. It .seems to me the provision at the end of clause 9 proposed to be inserted in the act merely with the object of seeing that, in the case of a walk-in-walk-out sale, the seller shall not escape paying a certain amount of income tax, which may easily be a negligible sum. That principle is carried into the next clause, which makes a distinction in detail as between wool and sheep. I should like the Attorney-General to make it clear whether this distinction is the result of definite recommendations to the Government by any authorized and reliable body of pastoralists, graziers, or sheep-breeders. If it is not, I am opposed to it. If there is reputable authority for considering that the provisions are workable, and that any authorized body of sheep breeders supports them, I shall be prepared to consider them. But, otherwise, it seems to me, after listening to what has been said, and after reading the clause myself, that they are highly legal provisions, which are simply the despair of the man on the land. Goodness knows, he has to make enough returns already. He has to declare the-number of fruit trees growing on his property, and I am not sure that he has not to estimate the number of eggs that his fowls will probably lay .in the next year! Men. at sales in the country know little of legal details. Their business is simply to buy or sell stock. It seems most unwise to pass any law the effect of which we are not quite certain, and which may embarrass them. I must say that, on the whole, I think that the amendment suggested by the Attorney-General is an imwool, provement on the bill as originally drafted. Clause 10 provides for the repeal of section 17 of the principal act and the insertion of a new section. Subsection 1, as.proposed to be amended, will readWhen sheep in the wool axe sold or otherwise disposed ofby one person to another the sale or disposal may, at the option of the purchaser to be declared upon making his return, for all purposes in connection with assessment of the income derived by the be deemed to be a sale of sheep and wool as distinct from each other. We all know that, in walk-in-walk-out out sales, it is customary for different values to be placed upon. the land with, that of course, the buildings, and also is separately upon the stock. I remember that some fifteen years ago it was heldI tliink in a Queensland case-that , unless it was agreed at the time of the sale that the various goods should be separated, the separation for taxation purposes was not valid. In other words, if a lump sum was offered for the whole lot, the purchaser had to pay tax, or at any rate stamp duty, on the whole amount-o n the value of the stock, as well as on the value of the land and the buildings erected thereon. The point is that the agreement had to be made at the time. But, under this provision, the unfortunate man on the land who sits down perhaps months afterwards to fill in his return, will need to calculate what percentage of wool was on the sheep six months previously. My remarks are not intended to embarrass the Government in any way. I am sure that the clause was drafted in order to avoid double taxation, and was intended to be of assistance to the man on the land. But I put it to the Government that the existing provision is good enough. It is better to leave the law as it stands than bring about some difficult legal position, which is not understood even by honourable members.",26
92,Mr BRUCE,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [12.25] - This is a most important matter. In the first place %ve must appreciate the distinction between breeding stock and the wool upon their backs. Following up the argument of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) as to whether breeding stock should be regarded as a capital asset, I point out that it has been the practice for some time to adopt that view, and exempt the proceeds of their sale from income taxation. Breeding stock has been taken as part of the capital assets of the pastoralist, in the same way as machinery is regarded as among the capital assets of the manufacturer. But the position in regard to the wool is a very different one. ' In the event of a walk-in-walk-out sale, the value of the wool is taken into account, and it is treated as part of the ordinary trading profits of the pastoralist, income tax being charged upon the profit froni its sale. At the time of a walk-in-walk-out sale, there is, possibly, ten months' wool on the sheep, and the wool would have been shorn very soon afterwards and brought to account. Obviously it is not part of the capital assets. I have had considerable discussion on this matter with the representatives of the pastoralists, who, I can assure honourable members, have taken all the points that could be raised to show that the capital assets consist of the sheep plus the wool. One of the points they make is that the wool is not physically detached from the animal that produces it, and that, therefore it still remains part of the capital asset. The Government cannot accept that view. We come then to the consideration of the position in regard to the wool. It may be said that it does not matter so long as somebody pays tax upon it, and that the Government should not worry about it at all . ' The sale consists in the disposal of the capital asset plus part of the ordinarytrading asset, namely, the wool on the sheep, and this is sold to somebody else. If the way the pastoralists had to treat the wool was to bring it in as income ac the purchase value on the one side of their account, and bring into account the asset in the sheep on the other side, using the principle of the purchase price to determine the value on both sides, the revenue would receive that to which it was entitled with regard to that particular wool. Pastoralists are now allowed the option of bringing the sheep in when they are purchased in the wool on the one side, or of bringing the wool in at the sale price on the other side. They can separate the two. But if the suggestion now made were adopted in the case of a walk-in-walk-out sale, the seller or somebody else would not have to account for the wool, with the result that the revenue would lose the whole of the income tax due on the profits from the sale of the wool wbicb is clearly a trading asset the moment it is separated from the sheep. It is obvious that nobody would suggest that it is drawing.on the capital asset to separte the sheep from the wool. We bave had to accept the idea of separating the sheep and the wool in the case of a walk-in-walk-out sale. In that case it only applies to the vendor. The position of an ordinary purchaser in a walk-in-walk-out sale presents no difficulty, for he can keep the sheep and the wool intact if he pleases until the end of the term or he can separate the two. The Government has had a full discussion of this matter with. the pastoralists' representatives. honourable member for Boothby has asked whether representations have been made for the wool to be taken into account separately from the sheep in the case of the vendors. The reverse is the position. The pastoralists' representatives bave naturally said: "" No ; certainly this should not be done,"" and they have tried to maintain that the sheep, plus the wool on it, is part of the capital asset. The vendor, or anybody else wbo is likely at any time to be interested in a walk-inwalk-out sale, would naturally maintain that the sheep plus the wool is part of the capital asset, and try to draw it in as such capital asset. I venture to say that it is only possible to substantiate the case that the sheep itseK and not the sheep plus the wool, is part of the capital asset. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked how far we can allow breeding stock to be taken into account as the part of the capital asset, or, in other words, as part of the machinery of manufacture of the pastoralists. We have accepted the principle that breeding stock shall be so regarded; but we cannot .accept the suggestion that the sheep plus the wool in the case of sales on a walk-in-walk-out basis sball be taken as part of the capital asset.  that all stock must already be accounted for in taxation returns at a specified value. Could not the amount for taxation in respect of the sale of such stock on a walk-in-walk-out basis be taken as the difference between the price realized at the sale and the valuation at which the stock appears in the departmental returns ?",27
93,Mr BRUCE,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"The only point that the Government is firm upon is that it canlose not allow the trading asset which bas been added to the capital asset to cluded in the capital asset, for that bave the effect of adding the value of wool to the capital asset. There must a statement separately as ' to the value the wool on the sheep.",28
94,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Wannon) [12.41] 1 feel that the two great principles involved in this issue have not been clearly followed by the committee. The first point is that income tax is levied on the total amount of the income in a given The period, less only part of the cost incurred in the same period in making it. The case I cited was clearly put. I instanced the case of a clip and a half, or a clip covering a period of one year and ten months, passing into the accounting period in respect of which the costs of only one year bad been taken into consideration. In sucb a case the vendor would be treated inequitably if he were allowed to deduct only the costs in respect of the twelve months period. The basic principle on which income tax bas always been imposed in this country is the calling into account of all income for a fixed period of twelve months and the deduction of the cost of raising the income over the full accounting period, without any overlapping. If this proposal is agreed to, a departure will have been made from that established principle.",28
95,Mr BBTJCE,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Expense s up to the point of sale would be allowed. If in the preceding year the clip was not sold, a greater amount would be allowable for expenses; so that the thing would balance itself.",28
96,Mr EODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"I am afraid that it would not do so. If the income from the sale of wool or station property were as fixed as the salary of honourable members it might be possible to apply this machinery to it with some equity; but under existing conditions that cannot be done. The great pastoral industry of Australia, as every one knows, is subject to many vicissitudes of climate and circumstance. There are periods of depression in which the value of stock falls seriously, and these are often followed by good times in wbicb prices rise suddenly. In the first case the seller may heavily under enforced sale while in the second eventuality the purchaser be inwould benefit materially by a sudwould den rise without having been debited the with a material proportion of cost.. be Immediately we depart from the fixed of period of income and expenditure we step on to dangerous ground. If the principle of altering the period is right in respect of growing wool, it surely is right in respect of growing crops; hut would any honourable member suggest that in the case of a sale of land the of a growing crop on it sbould be taken into account, for income tax purposes, by the vendor np to the day of sale? We are dealing now with what I may call the two breasts of the nation, her agricultural and pastoral industries. We bave deliberately said that the principle upon which the collection of our income taxation sball be based in respect of tbem is that there sball be a fixed term in which both income and expense shall be placed side by side. If we depart from this principle, as it is now proposed that we shall do in the case of walk-in walkout sales, we shall place ourselves in a most dimcult situation. For instance, it may involve the orchardist who disposes of his property while his fruit is forming.",28
97,Mr DUNCAN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,HUGHES - Partl y ripened oranges may be involved.,29
98,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Tba t is so. If we begin over-reaching and overlapping in our accounting periods, we shall never know where we are. I suggest that if our taxing master, for the purposes of simplifying his accounting methods, is able to obliterate from our income tax legislation the great principle of the fixed period, he will place us in an extremely difficult position. I cannot see any reason wby the taxing master sbould fear that the country will lose revenue by the continuation of its present practice. The Attorney-General, and to a lesser extent the Prime Minister, in discussing this subject, expressed fears that losses of revenue would be sustained if this alteration were not made; but I cannot see wby that sbould be so. It is certain that a provision of this kind will seriously complicate the operations of our stock and station owners, and the great bouses wbicb control our stock and station business; and I hope the committee will hesitate before approving of it. I submit that if we continue our fixed accounting period, the position will right itself. We have bad no experience wbicb in any sense justifies us in making this great parture from settled practice.",29
99,Mr SCTJLLIN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Yarra) [12.44] - The honourable member for Wannon is, in my opinion, quite wrong when be says that we sball not lose revenue by persisting value in our present practice. He mentioned the case of a growing crop. If we were to amend the act to provide that a man might deduct the extra price be pays for land because it bas a growing crop upon it from the price be receives from the crop when be harvests it, we sbould certainly lose revenue. The honourable member must have it in either one way or the otber. If the proposal in clause 9 is not proceeeded with, the concession given by clause 10 must be withdrawn, thus leaving the law as it stands at the present time. We cannot give the concession on the one hand and refuse to allow the deduction on the other.",29
100,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,I stand to what I have said. I am not responsible for the bill.,29
101,Mr SCTJLLIN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"No ; but the honourable member wishes to escape from what is a natural corollary of the provision in the succeeding clause; to work from one standpoint on clause 9 and from another standpoint on clause 10. He desires the concession to be given to the purchaser and at the same time not to. be taken away from the vendor. He cannot have it both ways. To me, the merits of the question are very clear. By clauses 9 and 10, we propose to give two concessions. One is that breeding stock may be sold on a walk-in walk-out basis, and be treated as an asset, and not be taxable. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) bas stated that breeding stock is always treated as a capital asset. It is not so treated when it is sold in the ordinary way.",29
102,Mr BRUCE,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,No ; what I said was that we bave recognized that principle in relation to walk-in walk-out sales.,29
103,Mr SCULLIN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,It must be admitted that ordinary breeding stock are not a very much greater asset than the other portion of the flock which produces wool. They produce wool and also breed; the others merely produce wool.,29
104,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,If you were to dispose de- of them you would nojonger be able to grow wool.,29
105,Mr SCTJLLIN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"I am not contesting that question for the moment. We grant that the breeding stock, wben sold at a winding-up sale, shall be regarded as an asset free from taxation. We also permit the pastoralist who purchases that stock to deduct from the sale price of his wool the value of that wbicb was on the backs of the sheep at the time that he purchased them. If that principle is fair and sound-and I submit that it is-yo u must say to the pastoralist who sells on a walk-in walk-out basis "" You cannot claim an exemption from taxation in respect of the wool on the breeding stock.""

The amendment relates to disposals of trading stock other than by way of sale and purchase, and provides that they sball be brought into account in the subsequent year in the ordinary and normal manner.

The provision in the bill would bave made it necessary to make the calculations required in all cases of sale of sheep in the wool. Eurther consideration has led to the proposed amendment.",30
111,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,It is the same principle that we debated for some time in connection with the disposal of breeding sheep on a walk-in-walk-out basis.,30
112,Mr LATHAM,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"It is an application of that principle. The subsequent new sub-sections provide for the apportionment of the price of sheep and wool either in the terms of the contract of sale, stock or on the market value of similar sheep June off shears, or, if that is not applicable, the value is to be determined by the com1 missioner. New sub-section 1 in the bill required that this method sbould apply in all cases. The purchaser is now i to be allowed, if be thinks fit, to separate the sheep and the wool. The vendor 13 unaffected in any case. The ordinary law applies to him in respect of ordinary trading sales, or sales on a walk-inwalk-out basis.",30

114,Mr LATHAM,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,No ; to all sheep bought or sold at any time. No change is being made in the case of the vendor.,31
115,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,When would the purchaser declare his option?,31
116,Mr LATHAM,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"The purchaser, wben making his return, would exercise the option of having the wool regarded as sold separately from the sheep. If that is inconvenient, then the purchaser will not exercise that option, and will be in exactly the same position as be is in today.",31
117,Mr HUNTER,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Maranoa) [2.25] It is quite probable that the opportunity given under this clause will not be largely availed of. In days gone by, however, before the averaging of rates and other methods were adopted, the law inflicted a hardship, as I can show in the case of a client of mine. This man bought sheep heavy in lamb and in full wool at 38s. 3d each. It was just before end of the year, and be brought his return to me. I naturally put the stock in at the cost price, which allowed him, on account of baving other stock sales that year, to show a profit, and be was liable to income tax amounting to about £25. During the next year, after the return had gone in, the commissioner wrote to my client to the effect that he was liable to this tax; but, in order to give him an option to come under the lower provision, the commissioner pointed out that if my client liked to bring in the stock at the rate then fixed9s. or 12s - instea d of baving to pay £25 he would bave to pay nothing. I was away at the time, and my client, thinking that I had made a mistake, put his stock in at the lower price and paid no tax. During that year the sbeep bad lambed, and the natural increase was shown at 9s. in his next return. TI e sbeep had also been shorn, and the wool showed a return of 12s. This made a return of 21s., but on account of the dry spell he sold the grown sbeep for 15s., bringing his gross return or credit to 36s. That meant that be bad made a loss of 2s. 3d. on each sbeep. In furnishing his return for the second year be bad to start with the sbeep at 9s - for which be bad paid 38s. 3d and his return was 36s. as shown, this meant he made a paper profit of 27s. His tax on that amounted to £111. He came to me and complained, and on inquiry I discovered what had happened. That clearly shows the value of the provision in the bill. If that man had been able to separate his sheep and the wool, he would bave put his wool in"" at 12s. and sheep at 26s. wben be bought, and the subsequent difficulty would not have arisen. I might say that on representations being made to the commissioner the tax was reduced. There will be little need for this clause, because of the provisions in the acts of 1924 and 1926. If a purchaser were forced to separate his wool and sbeep there would be tremendous difficulty in accounting in some cases, especially if the sheep were bought a few months off shears; but there would be no difficulty when buying sheep in full wool. However, there is no compulsion, the buyer can do as he likes. The seller has the nothing to do with it. The option allows the purchaser time to consider what to do. Under this provision if a man buys sheep in the wool be will be able to get a proper debit for both wool and stock, and a proper credit for the stock at the end of the taxation period. When a man buys up to the middle of the year, say six months after shearing, he will not gain much advantage, because he will enter the sheep at the average value, which will include the price of the wool. There is then not much difference between the first price at which be buys and the price at which the sheep will be valued on his return.",31
118,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Wannon) [2.31] I suppose there is no use in attempting to do anything more than register my protest against this provision, seeing that the Opposition and the Government are in agreement. I do so because it is a dangerous practice to bring into account a partiallygrown crop of any description. I can foresee a great deal of trouble and disappointment ahead of primary producers. If this principle is admitted as proper in respect to a wool clip, it might, with equal justice, be applied to a growing crop of wheat or corn, to a maturing frui t crop, to the sugar fields in Queensland, to maize, to tobacco, or to any of the agricultural products of the country. Since this country, like every other, is invaded periodically by hordes of pests that attack the growing crops, it is not possible to pre-assess the value of a crop before it is actually harvested. To attempt to do so is to make trouble both for the contracting party and for the taxation department. Naturally, I expected opposition from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to any measure wbicb would be for the good of the pastoralists of tralia. Never bas anything affecting the pastoral industry been before this House when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition bas not taken the opportunity to assail the industry. Yet the pastoral industry might be said today to be the bright spot in the nation's finances. I think he has had some past experience of the ills endured by workmen under the old pastoral conditions; but he ought not to bring those forward at the present time. The pastoral industry is now providing some of the best conditions in Australia for the working man. To the extent which the principle is the same in this section of the bill as in the last, I am not going to blow hot and cold, and support the principle when it suits me, and to reject it when it does not. I do not think we sbould bave stepped over the border of a new year and anticipated the return to be derived from a growing clip especially when we cannot bring into account the corresponding costs which the taxpayer would have to bear.",31
119,Mr SCTJLLIN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Yarra) [2.35] The honourable member for Wannon was entitled to make his protest, and let his view be known; but I would advise him not to make himself look ridiculous. He gave an indication this morning that be did not understand this section, and he has proved it this afternoon - If be understood the first principles of the proposal he would know that it .Was specially designed to benefit the pastoralists;",32
120,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,I am not going to accept the principle in one case and reject it in another.,32
121,Mr SCULLIN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"The honourable member should know that this provision was a special concession to the pastoral industry, and, when I support it, it cannot be said that I am assailing the industry. I throw the lie back in his teeth. I regard the pastoral industry, and all the other industries of this country, as interwoven one with another. I look upon wool-raising as one of the staple industries that will keep this country solvent. If the honourable gentleman was not obsessed with some strange illusion, he would not have given utterAus- ance to the stupid charge which be made this afternoon. This is a concession to the pastoralists to save them from being doubly taxed on their wool clips. I have given it my warm support because it is just, but I would not support any attempt, whether by pastoralists, agriculturists, joint stock companies, or private individuals, to avoid paying their just share of taxation. Wben taxation is evaded it always means that somebody else has to pay more.",32
122,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,The honourable member does not knoAv any instance-in which the existing system has worked an injustice.,32
123,Mr SCULLIN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"I know that it ' would be possible for it to do so. T pointed out to the honourable member that this clause is a concession that bad to be balanced by the conditions in the previous clause. Whatever he might say about my attitude in regard to these clauses, it is absurd to say that this one will inflict any jflijury on the pastoralists, wben, as a matter of fact, it is specially designed to save tbem from being doubly taxed. It gives him the right to choose under which system he is to be assessed. It is evident from his remarks that the honourable member does not understand the clause. Amendment agreed to.

124,Mr LATHAM,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [2.40] - The first amendment of the principal act provided for in this clause, is designed to deal with co-operaof tive societies. The amendment rectify anomalies brought under the notice of the department in regard to distributions among their members co-operative societies. The definition of income in section 4 of the act lays down that income does not include any rebate received by a member of a cobut operative society or company, based on purchases made by that member from the society or company. Rebates are exas cluded from the income of a member because they are regarded, not as income, but as reimbursements of overpayments made for goods. Under the law, as it now stands, however, a company or a co-operative society is not at liberty to pany bad to bear the tax instead. deduct the amount paid in rebates its income. The object of this ment is to allow that. [85]",33
125,Mr BBJJCE,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [2.43] - Paragraph s b and c.of clause 11 link up with the proposals that were contained in clause 23 of the bill which was very fully discussed last night. The debate was adjourned until we bad an opportunity of taking this clause and considering the whole matter in the light of the wider issues raised under these two paragraphs. Before dealing with inthese particular paragraphs, however, I wish to make a personal explanation as to certain views I expressed with the the greatest possible confidence last night, by debenand which I now find do not represent in the actual position: I refer to my exat position of the law of Great Britain comwith regard to the taxation of absentee shareholders. I can only plead in exof tenuation that I concluded my remarks on that occasion by saying that I "" underto the stood"" that the position was as I had if outlined, or I hope I did so. The position is not as I indicated last night. In Great 'Britain they do take very much more definite action in regard to the income of absentees than I gave the committee The need for inserting this paragraphs 2 and 3 of this clause arose to out of the process of expansion going on of in regard to the dividends of companies owned and controlled outside Australia, those owned outside Australia, but controlled here, and those registered and controlled inside Australia. In the case the external company, that is, the will company with its capital owned abroad and controlled abroad, the position is that up to the present time we have not by been getting taxation from absentee shareholders. In the second case, that of it the company registered abroad, with a good deal of the capital owned abroad, controlled in Australia, and declaring its dividends here, we have not in the past utilized one of the section* of the act so to make it pay the tax of those shareholders who are resident abroad unless the dividends were declared in Australia. Recently an English judgment showed that the dividend had to be paid in full to the absentee shareholder and the comIt from is considered unfair to levy from amend the company for income tax payable by its shareholders money which could uot be recovered by it from them. Haviug come to the conclusion that exemptions should be allowed in those two cases, we are now faced with the case of a company registered and controlled in Australia, which has shareholders who are resident outside Australia. ""We believe that if the other classes of absentee shareholders are to be exempt from taxation, the absentee shareholder in the Australian company should not be placed in a worse position than they. Having decided to exempt shareholders of this type, Ave had to consider the position of persons Avho lent money to a company on debentures or on deposit. After considerable thought, the Government decided that it Avas desirable to exempt also those lenders for the sake of encouraging the investment in Australia of capital which Would assist in the general promotion of industry. We Would not have gone to this length in regard to interest on debentures but for the unjustifiable anomalies that exist in regard to share interest. During this discussion many honourable members have indicated that their object is to take the maximum toll of people Avho are investing capital in this country. The Government, on the other hand, regards such investment as esseutial to the opening up of the country and the promotion of neAv industries.",33
126,Mr COLEMAN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,Nobod y said otherAvise.,34
127,Mr BRUCE,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Althoug h at first sight it may appear that the exemption of certain capital from income taxation means a loss of revenue and a resultant heavier burden on the Australian taxpayer, that is not the ultimate effect, if a greater inflow capital is stimulated. Such money will be utilized for the establishment of industries and the creation of employment, and will cause a general increase in prosperity. And as neAv industries are established, and employment is found for more people, the volume of revenue flowing into the Treasuzy will increase. In the long run the actual effect Would be to relieve the local taxpayer.",34
128,Mr THEODOBE,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,Would not that apply also to locally provided capital?,34
129,Mr BRUCE,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Certainly ; but if Australia is to develop at the rate which its national circumstances demand, its capital requirements cannot be provided from the annual excess of income over expenditure. We must get money from abroad to accelerate development and the influx of neAv population. I agree that all monies employed in industry and creating neAV avenues of employment will be of great advantage in reducing the burden of taxation upon the people as a Avhole. But there is another angle from which to view this problem. Very often the question is asked, ""Why sbould foreign investors take toll of Australia in the form of interest and dividends on the capital they have invested ?"" It is suggested that all the benefits that arise from such investments are reaped by the people outside Australia, and that we are entitled to recover from them as much as possible. Sight is lost of the fact that the great bulk of the money is employed in the creation of .new industries or the extension of existing ones; these Avill increase the Avages bill, and the money will circulate throughout the country to the benefit of all sections. Only a small percentage Avill be utilized for the payment of interest or dividends to the foreign shareholder. Money sent into Australia from abroad is of benefit to the country, and not detrimental, as some short-sighted people seem to believe. ' We all feel considerable resentment against foreigners who trade in Australia, and by the manipulation of subsidiary companies appear not to earn any profits and so escape taxation. Tbese unscrupulous methods are applied nearly always in distributing businesses; it would be difficult to apply tbem in manufacturing and productive enterprises. If people do resort to these methods, it is clearly our of responsibility to find means of defeating their machinations. Cases of this kind do not, however, affect the fundamental fact that the investment of new capital is of benefit , to the country. Recently I prepared an estimate of the capital requirements of Australia. The figures disclosed that, if we could afford to be content with the present growth of population by natural increase-and the excess of births over deaths in Australia compares favourably with the natural increase in any otber country-and the corresponding expansion in trade, commerce, production, and industry, we sbould be able to provide out bf surplus wealth the whole of the capital - we need. But, unfortunately, possessing an enormous continent and being faced with the necessity for populating it and accelerating its development, we cannot be content with what in an older country would be considered a very satisfactory rate of progress. Consequently, baving regard to the inequalities that arise under the taxation law as between absentee shareholders in different classes of companies, the Government came to the conclusion that all should be placed on the same basis. It decided to extend the concession to moneys lent by way of debentures or on deposit to companies. However, the discussion last night made clear a consensus of opinion in the committee against the action proposed by the Government in regard to shareholders. The committee apparently is not prepared to go so far as the Government j>roposcs in the direction of bringing absentee shareholders into line irrespective of the type of company in which they are interested. The Government accepts that decision. It would be unwise, therefore, to take the further step contemplated in regard to debenture interest. I do not reflect upon the views expressed by honourable members, but I repeat that the basis of the Government's proposals was the necessity for attracting .capital into the country. This legislation appeared to the Cabinet to be one justifiable method of accelerating the inflow of new capital to develop our industries and increase our capacity to absorb new people. I recognize that our attitude may be misrepresented; the suggestion may be made that the purpose of this legislation is to favour the big companies and the wealthier sections of the community. I hope that that course will not be adopted, and that this issue will not be clouded with prejudice, for, whilst the Government recognizes the will of the committee, it is convinced that at some future time this Parliament will adopt action of the nature suggested in the bill. If , in the meantime, the matter is surrounded with prejudice and political animosity, the task of any goveniment--no t necessarily the present Government-that may attempt similar action to that proposed on this occasion will be made more difficult. The Government does not propose to press paragraphs b and c of clause 11, nor will it, when clause 23 is reached, persist with its proposal.",34
130,Mr SCTJLLIN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Yarra) [3.0] - The Government displayed very much greater wisdom in withdrawing from an untenable position, than it did in inserting this provision in the bill. The withdrawal proves that the criticism of the Opposition last night was justified. I remind the committee that it required continual hammering from the Opposition then before the Government "" saw the light."" I am glad that the Government has displayed greater wisdom at this stage than it did earlier in the debate; but we cannot allow the matter to remain where it is. The Prime Minister endeavours to make it appear that the provision is withdrawn merely because be has a majority against him, but that he is right and we are wrong. The Prime Minister spoke of the different angles from which he approaches the subject. I suggest that his argument was triangular. First of all the right honourable gentleman spoke of the difficulties of collecting the tax, and of ' the companies from whom it is impossible to collect it. He concluded by stating that the whole principle underlying the clause is the great need to attract capital to Australia, and he gave us a lecture on the desirability of encouraging imported capital to develop the country, urging that the money that comes from abroad is very beneficial. That is arguable. Some investments from abroad bave certainly assisted to develop Australia, and to that extent are beneficial; but others have merely exploited the country and drained our resources. I suggest that we set aside all considerations as to whether imported capital is beneficial or otherwise. Surely the right honourable gentleman does not contend that Australian capital invested in this country is not as beneficial as that from overseas! Yet be proposed to tax profits on local investments and exempt those on investments from abroad. It is impossible to advance a sound argument in favour of exempting profits made on investments of foreign capital in Australia and at the same time taxing the profits on local capital invested in this - country. We have had to thresh this matter out since last Monday, and no doubt we shall be told that the Opposition bas held up the business of the country. I venture to say that this withdrawal would not have taken place had the guillotine been applied last night; absentee shareholders would then have been exempted from the tax. It is fortunate for Australia that the Opposition was able to ""secure an exhaustive debate on the matter. We were able to place our views before the Government, and honourable members supporting the Government were also induced to ventilate their opinions. The Prime Minister said that he hopes that an attempt will be made to view the subject free from party influence. I ask the right honourable gentleman to analyze the records of Hansard, feeling confident that ne will find that the case of the Opposition has been presented on a high plane, aud has dealt merely with the merits of the proposal. It is futile to insinuate the proposal was witbdraAvn for fear that pressure would be brought to bear. The Government was forced to abandon its position simply because of the strength of our arguments against an iniquitous proposal.  Opposition cannot claim all credit, if credit is due, for the withdrawal of this proposal. I am glad that the Prime Minister has indicated that the Government does not intend to press it. I believe that there are otber ways in wbicb capital may be attracted to Australia. At the same time, I am of the opinion that the Government was perfectly honourable in its intentions, and was actuated by the desire to encourage capital to come to Australia. No one, however, should be permitted to make profits in Australia and not contribute to the revenue of the country. I remind honourable members that, early in the session, I suggested that the Government would encourage the investment of capital in Australia, if it placed the rate of property taxation on a basis similar to that which,applies to personal exertion. I was glad to hear the honourable member for Bailey (Mr Theodore) advance a similar recommendation yesterday. The investment, of money from abroad in our industries must be retarded if people have. to pay nearly double rates on. profits made out of their investments in Australia. The higher property rate will also increase the interest rate and house rents in Australia, and will be of general disadvantage. If the Government takes from the individual only, it places an impost on the whole community. The country would be better off if there was freer investment in Australia, not only of local, but of outside capital.",35
131,Mr WEST,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"East Sydney [3.10] - I offer my sympathy to the Government. It must be very galling to learn that the Opposition possesses infinitely greater wisdom than do the combined cabinet, and honourable members sitting behind it. One would gather from the remarks of the Prime Minister that those wbo wished to invest in or lend money to Australia were benevolent societies, merely seeking to benefit us. Theirs is merely a busithat ness interest, and they are anxious to make profits. Our present financial position is very serious, and we should endeavour to propound a satisfactory solution. From time to time. I bave advocated that, instead of raising new loans, we should have a conversion loan, and place the money in consols at the existing rate of interest. Had that been done recently, instead of raising a new loan of £36,000,000, the country would have been saved at least £325,000 a year for 33 years over the existing rate of interest. It is regrettable that 75 per cent, of the £10,000,000 loan was left on the hands of the underwriters; it could have been raised in Australia. While we bave gilt edged securities available in Australia under the present conditions people are not likely to invest their money in industry. Two considerations that led me to come to Australia were the low price of land and the low rate of interest, and I have no doubt that other people would come here if the price of land and the rate of interest were as low as formerly. I am not the only person in the community who believes that the rate of interest payable on gilt-edged securities is a hindrance to our development. A gentleman who was formerly connected with the Treasury, but who, for some reason wbicb I have never beard explained, lost his position, is also of that opinion. Speaking before the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce some time ago he made it quite clear that the rate of interest on our war and other loans would have to be reduced before this country could make any substantial progress in its primary and secondary industries. We had a useful discussion in Melbourne some years ago on the taxation of absentees, and I would advise the Prime Minister \o instruct his officers to look it up. Many honourable members pointed out, on that occasion, that absentees received numerous benefits from this country, ancl therefore they should contribute something to the cost of government. I am glad that the Government has recognized the justice of the case made out by the Opposition and others for the taxation of absentees.",36
132,Mr RODGERS,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Wannon) [3.20] - I have sufficiently recovered from the lecture which I . received from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to join him in expressing appreciation of the action of the Government in agreeing to withdraw this proposal. It may be inexcusable for me to have the temerity to disagree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and if anything I have said has injured his personal feelings I regret it. I assure him that I am looking forward with great interest to his speech on the Land Tax Assessment Bill, and I shall judge him afresh after I have heard his remarks on that measure. I do not take the view of many honourable members opposite that this proposal of the * Government was made as a concession to capitalists. It was not intended as such. I am of the opinion that we ought to do all we can to encourage capital to come to this country, but I agree with the view of the Prime Minister that we are in some danger of certain foreign companies setting up great distributing organizations here with the object of participating in our prosperity without interesting themselves in the development of our country by paying reasonable taxation. It is for that reason I commend the Government for having withdrawn this proposal. Nevertheless, certain British interests have done a great deal throughout the years to develop pastoral Australia also North and Central Australia. They have used their money during many years without drawing much interest, and often making losses. I hope that the Government will endeavour to find some way to give them greater encouragement than they have had in the past, for if their capital were withdrawn it would be detrimental to Australia.",37
133,Mr COLEMAN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"Reid) [3.24] - As I did not speak on the motion for the second reading of this bill, I had intended to address myself at some length to this question, but the Government having withdrawn its proposals, it is not necessary for me to do so. The members of this Cabinet will go down to history as the finest political quick-change artists that Australia has known. The abject way in which they abandon policies which they have put forward is, at times, bewildering to us. It is, however, a tribute to the effectiveness of the criticism of honourable members on this side of the chamber who regard their legislative duties a good deal more seriously than some honourable members opposite appear to do. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for' 'Dalley, and other honourable gentlemen on this side of the committee may be specially complimented on having caused Government supporters to realise the iniquity of its proposal to discriminate in favour of foreign investors. Quite apart from the fact that the Labour party stands for equity and natural justice in regard to taxation, honourable members opposite * would have found it most difficult to justify this proposal to certain manufacturing and other interests which stand behind the Government.  cussing this matter on non-party lines.",37
134,Mr COLEMAN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"The Prime Minister has suggested that it is necessary to cause additional capital to come to Australia, but if , in consequence of the Government's invitation to outside capital to come here, a big British manufacturing organization like I . and A. R. Morley and Company should come here and enter into competition with established Australian companies, and be relieved of taxation on its English capital invested here, honourable members opposite would be placed in a most embarrassing position. I am of the opinion that taxation proposals are placed before this Parlament in a very unsatisfactory manner. It is well known that expensive and protracted litigation follows almost every amendment that we make to our taxation laws, and our taxpayers and the Government thereby involved in legal costs wbicb amount to many thousands of pounds annually. The ambiguity of the amendments that are made to our taxation laws from time to time, shows the necessity for the appointment of a standing committee of the Parliament to examine taxation proposals before they are submitted to honourable members. The suggestion that such a committee should be appointed bas been made on a number of occasions, and as the Government delegates far less important matters to standing committees for consideration, it should be prepared to appoint a standing committee to deal with this important subject, which affects the economic well-being of the whole community. If such a committee were appointed, it would be possible-and I say this in reply to the interjection of the honourable  us to examine taxation proposals in a non-party atmosphere.  posal of the honourable member that a standing committee sbould be appointed for the purpose.",37
135,Mr COLEMAN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"The Prime MinisGovernment ter has stated that there are well insuperable difficulties in taxing foreign companies, but I refer him to legislation which was passed some little time ago by the Lang Government in New Soutli ""Wales, with the object of taxing the profits of foreign motion picture interests, wbicb has been the cause of an appeal amended to the High Court.",38

139,Mr COLEMAN,AERODROMES AT BUNDABERG AN D,"In view of that statement. I shall not discuss the matter further than to .say that the experiment, which the Lang Government! made in attempting to tax the profits made by these foreign companies, was justified. Doubtless, the measure will be the subject of litigation before the Privy Council. As to the practicability of imposing taxation upon tbese interests, honourable are members are surely aware that there are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with cream. I suggest that the Government sbould introduce a federal company law in spite of declared constitutional difficulties, either with or without consultation with the States. Foreign companies, which make profits on business which they do in Australia, sbould undoubtedly contribute towards the cost of government here, and legislative control over companies is a means to that end. Tbat seems to me to be the most effective method of taxing the profits of companies. In regard to a company law, Sir Robert Garran, when giving evidence before the Royal Commission ou the Constitution, said It is not at all certain, in view of later decisions' of the High Court, that a law regulating companies would be held today to be invalid. Enormous sums are being taken out of Australia by picture companies, motor companies, oil, and otber interests every year, and it is very necessary that some action should be taken by the Government to levy income tax upon them.

146,Mr GREGORY,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Swan) [3.44] - I move That the following paragraph be added:and (i) Income derived by any person resident in Australia from ments outside AustraliaI am sure that honourable members must have been impressed with the stateAustralia. ment made by the Prime Minister today that there was great necesamount sity to encourage capital ""to come ment. to Australia. We cannot progress in a huge country like this agreed less we have capital to help us. I agree with the honourable member that everything possible ought to be clone to encourage the investment of capital within Australia. When our people become wealthy, and amass capital, they should, if. they invest that capital outside Australia, be subject to taxation by the Commonwealth; of course, with such limitations as might be necessary on account of taxation imposed elsewhere. Australia should obtain some benefit from incomes earned overseas by Australians resident here. Millions of pounds lave been invested in tin mines in the Malay Peninsula, and in the timber resources of Borneo and elsewhere, and from the profits made out of those investments not oue penny is collected in income tax from shareholders in Australia. About twenty companies-of which the paid-up capital exceeds £100,000-ar e operating in this way, and, their dividends paid range from £542,200 down to £95,000. Millions of pounds are being paid to Australian shareholders by tin-mining companies alone, and yet the Commonwealth obtains nothing by way of income' taxation from those dividends. The Royal Commission on Taxation stated in its reportIn preference to any general increase in income taxation in Australia, or the introducof new forms of taxation, we recommend the taxing of incomes derived from abroad. There is nothing new in that proposal. In Great Britain, any person residing the United Kingdom must pay income tax in respect to his "" profession, trade, employment or vocation, whether carried on within the Realm or not."" Similar operate in Canada ancl India. I agree that if taxation is imposed on incomes in the countries in which they are earned, it would be reasonable to make some reduction on account of that taxation, but I do not think that people who believe so little in their own country as to invest their money outside it should investbe entirely free from income tax simply because they derive their incomes from abroad. We need to bring capital into I come from a large , State-on e that requires an enormous of money for its developI would rather see money have coming into this country to develop unit and build up our industries, than Lave the Government borrowing money for that purpose. Tremendous sums were borrowed for soldier settlement, and already £10,000,000 has been written off. Better returns are always secured from money spent by private corporations. The coming of additional capital to this country would induce more production which, in return, would lead to greater prosperity and more employment.",40
147,Mr ATKINSON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Wilmot) [3.50] There seems to me to be one objection to this amendment, and that is that it embodies the principle of double taxation. If the honourable member for Swan could see his way clear to allow concessions to be made in'respect of taxation paid abroad, his amendment would be less open to objection. I do not think we should discourage people from invest-ing their money abroad, even if they do live in Australia. If people who invested their money abroad did not pay any income tax to the country where the money was invested, there would be no double taxation; but if<they do pay sucb taxation abroad, the amount of it sbould be deducted from that collected in Australia. I bave no objection to the amendment if the honourable gentleman will agree to sucb an alteration. I am opposed to the system of double taxation. Ever since I can remember there has been an outcry against double taxation, as it operated between Great Britain and Australia. We have now adjusted that matter to some extent, and we do not want to introduce the principle elsewhere. I cannot agree that, because an Australian is drawing his income from another country, be sbould pay full income tion in that country, and pay f u l tion again in Australia. Such a provision as that would hinder the free flow of capital. Supposing a man drew income from India, and was taxed there on that income; it would not be fair that he should be assessed here at f u ll income tax rates in respect of the same income. If be is paying no taxation in India, there would be no objection to his being taxed here. That is a fair proposition, and if the honourable member for Swan is prepared to admit it, I will support his amendment.",41
148,Mr KILLEN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Riverina) [3.55] - I am surprised that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) sbould have proposed an amendment of this kind. We have, I think, always been opposed' to the principle of double taxation, and yet he is deliberately proposing to introduce it bere. I cannot understand why any one in Australia who invests his money abroad-as he is perfectly entitled to do-shoul d be compelled to pay taxation both in the foreign country and in Australia. The adoption of this pro-, posal would amount to a most iniquitous grab on the part of Australia for money to which it was not entitled. We should be most inconsistent if we supported this amendment, and I hope the committee will turn it down.",41
149,Mr GULLETT,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Henty) [3.57] - I cannot agree with the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen). If a man lives in this country and invests his money outside, no matter what taxation he may pay to the country in which he has invested it, he has no right to enjoy the benefits of Australian citizenship without meeting his obligations , in the way of taxation. If be enjoys the privilege of Australian citizenship, be must accept his responsibility in regard to Australia's war debt, and the maintenance of the governmental services. Mr KILLED"" - He does that from his investments in Australia.",41
150,Mr GULLETT,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Not necessarily. A man may live here and enjoy the privileges of citizenship, and not bave one penny invested in Australia. I think we ought to devise a system such as that operating in Great Britain. Double taxataxation would then be prevented within the l taxaEmpire; but if a man invested his money in a foreign country he would be subjected to double taxation, and rightly so. It seems an extraordinary thing to me that Australia should abstain from this system of taxation. We are practically the only advanced country in the world which does so. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) has quoted instances in which this form of taxation has been adopted, and in practically all other parts of the Empire, and in most foreign countries, residents are taxed on incomes drawn from abroad. Our omission to do so is a blot on our taxation system and an injustice to Australians who invest their money in the country, and endeavour to promote local industries and maintain Australian rates of pay and standards of living. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) has pointed out that millions of pounds of Australian capital is invested in tin dredging enterprises in coolie countries. Persons who thus invest their money and draw huge dividends from cheap labour enjoy all the privileges of living bere without contributing anything towards the maintenance of government. I hope that the amendment will be seriously considered.",41
151,Mr MARRS,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Wentworth) [4.1] - I agree with the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) and the mover of the amendment. Although I am against double taxation as a general principle, particularly as I suffer so mucb from it, I do not think Australians should be encouraged to send their money abroad. My sisters, brothers and I have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in erecting mammoth buildings in Sydney. We ^ pay Federal and State land taxes, municipal taxes, and State and Federal income taxes. Somebody living alongside us may be drawing huge dividends from the capital they have sent to foreign countries, and they pay not a penny towards the government of Australia. It is a sound principle that all profits a man ceives shall he subject to taxation. Let us treat all citizens on an equal footing. If a man invests money in a foreign country he deserves to "" get it in the neck ""-to pay the foreign tax if one is imposed, and the Australian tax also. Let each of us pay something for the protection we enjoy under the flag and for the services we receive in the country in which we live.",42
152,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.3] - The amendment is of a far-reaching character, and, if carried, would a tremendous effect upon the finances of the Commonwealth. The principle it embodies received very serious consideration from the Government when the draft of the bill was before Cabinet. Certain proposals in the measure were designed to attract capital to Australia, ously it is illogical to allow simultaneously native capital to flow out of the country. The two policies are irreconment apply to them? cilable. We were faced with the increasing exodus of capital from the Commonwealth, and had to consider whether steps should be taken to check it . The effect of this is illustrated by the manner in which government securities have been almost hawked in Australia, the Government being obliged to make the income from them tax-free as an extra inducement to the Australian people to lend their money to the Commonwealth. The Government realized, however, that a fundamental alteration of the system could not be proposed without very much greater investigation. The Commonwealth income tax law, when originally framed by a Labour Government, was based on the logical and just principle that taxation should be levied on income actually derived within the country. Abandonment of that principle would be a very radical change, especially at a .time when the principles that govern income taxation are being exhaustively considered by all the nations of the world. The matter was dealt with at Geneva, and whilst finality has not been reached, the trend of opinion is towards recognition of the principle that taxation on investments should be levied only by the country in which the capital is controlled. There is another considerare-, tion that must be thoroughly investigated before we completely reverse our taxation policy in this regard. Australia is vitallyconcerned in increasing its import trade, of which all us would like the secondary industries to contribute a bigger proportion. To illustrate the probable effects of the proposed amendment, I remind the committee that H . V. MCKay and Company have, by their enterprise and initiative, succeeded in establishing themselves in a paramount position in the South African market. The profits 'derived from that trade are not now subject to bave Australian income taxation, and we sbould hesitate before doing anything that .would be calculated to discourage them and otber Australian manufacturers from building up a profitable market abroad. There are also grave questions involved in connection with the export of and obvi- wool and wheat.",42
153,Mr MCGRATH,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,Would the amend,42
154,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,It would apply to all profits earned anywhere.,43
155,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"It should in principle, but according to the wording of the amendment it would apply only to income from investments. Therefore, traders would be free. I assume that that is not the intention of the honourable member for Swan.",43
156,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"The word used in the amendment is "" investments."" I discussed this matter with the income tax commissioner, and, contrary to the legal opinion we have just beard, he expressed the view that the amendment would apply to all moneys invested outside Australia, irrespective of the nature of the investment. So much is involved in the amendment that the Government cannot accept it Without further investigation. I assure the mover that the point be bas raised has already been exhaustively examined by the Government, and that it will be further probed. Australia cannot afford to allow its own capital to drain away to other countries when it is so bardpressed for money that it has to offer special inducements to foreigners to subscribe to its loans. ""We all are agreed as to the desirability of keeping as much of Australia's surplus wealth in the country for the development of its resources as is practicable; but I urge the committee not to make, by this simple amendment, a fundamental and far-reaching change in the taxation system. Moreover, the adoption of the proposal would completely upset the finances of the Government. Nobody can say what would be its effects.",43
157,Mr BKENNAN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,The Government might even get too mucb revenue.,43
158,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,It is perfectly certain that it would enormously increase the revenue.,43
159,Mr GREGORY,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,The Government could then reduce the tariff duties.,43
160,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Tb e honourable member for Swan cannot be allowed to achieve his free trade objective by a side wind. The Commissioner of Taxation has informed me that it would be impossible, without careful research, to estimate the effect of this alteration upon the revenue. I appeal to the committee not to accept the amendment. The matter is being carefully examined by the Government, and, in view of the necessity for retaining Australian capital for internal development, it may be necessary, wben all the facts are ascertained, to take some action to achieve that result.",43
161,Mr SCULLIN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Yarra) [4.13] - The Prime Minister was right in saying that the amendment involved a change of a fundamental and far-reaching nature. I am sorry that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) did not circulate it some days ago. The Prime Minister said that the amendment, if carried, would probably lead to an enormous increase in revenue from income taxation. That proves that the Commonwealth is losing a lot of revenue now. The only sound argument that can be urged against a government baving too great a revenue is that it is taking from the pockets of the people an undue amount of money, which might be put to better use. Tbat objection does not apply in this case, because, if we tax the profits of those who have invested their money abroad, we leave them less money with which to carry on that undesirable policy, and we do not lessen the amount invested in Australia. %  out of Australia altogether.",43
162,Mr SCULLIN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Tber e is a very strong case in favour of the amendment. I certainly agree that if we did impose this class of taxation, which could be subjected to reciprocal arrangements similar to those now in force between Great Britain and Australia, it would be beneficial. The Prime Minister expounded an argument that was exploded when the subject was discussed before the royal commission on taxation, that the provision would penalize men who were making products locally, and sending them abroad .to Argentine, Africa, and other countries, to exploit their market, such as Hugh Victor MCKay. The difficulty could be overcome by introducing a proviso to exempt such profits. The right honourable gentleman also mentioned wool exported for sale on the foreign market. We tax that wool producer on his full income.",43
163,Mr RODGERS,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,There are companies who purchase wool on consignment and sell it at an enhanced price.,43
164,Mr SCULLIN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"That could be overcome by the operation of section 18 of the principal act. We should certainly tax the man who is resident in Australia and has his capital invested abroad, particularly the man who has his money invested in tin-mining and other ventures in cheap labour countries. principle upon which we impose the rate of taxation is ability to pay. There are two main considerations governing the collection of taxation ; one the service that the country renders the individual as a member of the community. The Prime Minister refers to it as the "" protection of the flag."" The other and greater consideration is the protection that the country gives to the industry from which the individual makes his income. We have the right to impose a tax on the resident of Australia who earns his money in this country, ancl that also gives us a claim on the absentee who earns a portion of his income, in Australia. That justified, too, the stapfl taken by the Opposition in regard to.'.the proposals that were to be applied to."" absentee shareholders. We have an even greater claim on those individuals, who, while resident in Australia, ""are exploiting undeveloped countries, where government may not be solid. Great Britain has frequently taken responsibility for the safeguarding of persons engaged in such ventures. It is right that those people should contribute to the revenue of the country that protects them, and in which they reside. The royal commission on taxation was very guarded in its report. It made some recommendations, but hedged later. It indicated that it would prefer to see a tax imposed on profits earned abroad rather than increase existing tax in Australia. I suggest that that was not considering the principle, but rather the expediency, of the matter. To-day, whilst Ave are reducing income tax and other direct taxation, our general taxation per head of population is increasing. It would be possible for us to relieve our people from indirect taxation to the extent of many millions of pounds Avithout affecting the protective effect of the tariff except to improAfe it, leaving revenue duties frankly imposedas such. On the Avhole, I find myself in agreement with the amendment. committee can only affirm general principles, and a principle is affirmed in clear and definite language by the amendment. If the amendment is carried, the Government Avill have to consult its advisers, and probably in another place, insert the proviso necessary to meet objections that The may be raised on such points as the taxing of exports. It may be necessary to alter the verbiage to include capital expended abroad for trading purposes, as Avell as investments. When one considers that the AOAV of capital from Australia abroad is growing, one realizes the need to impose a check. The honourable member for Swan instanced "" shadow"" companies that are exploiting Australia and evading taxation, here. We have people who are shareholders in such companies, actually making profits here, but crediting those profits in another country. I instance the operations of nn American film company, producing films in Australia. Those films .are sold in Australia at such a price that the Australian section of the business makes no profit. But profits are made by the parent company, and the shareholders Avho are resident in Austialia receive their proportion of those profits. Why should Ave encourage that sort of thing and penalize Australian taxpayers? If Ave imposed a taxon sueh activities, it Would at least Avake up Australian shareholders and make them fight for their end of the stick, probably resulting in the introduction of reciprocal taxation arrangements betAveen Australia and the United States of America. I appreciate many of the points raised by the Prime Minister, but the right honourable gentleman is responsible, Will his Government, to see that these provisions are exthe tended in such a way that they Avill increase our revenue enormously. That will reduce the taxation that falls so heavily upon our OAvn people, and will still allow us to put into effect protective duties which will encourage and \ stimulate our industries.",44
165,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [4.26] - I direct the attention of the committee to Avhat is involved in r the amendment in relation to the drafting of the bill and the form of our present act. The honourable member for Yarra This (Mr Scullin) said that the amendment might properly be carried by the committee, and that it should then, be left to the Government to produce other amendments to f it into the scheme of the act. I consider that the committee should appreciate the real significance of the amendment in that regard. Our act was deliberately drawn upon the basis of the taxation of incomes derived from sources within Australia. The definitions in the act are based upon that principle. governing sections of the act are based upon that principle, as are the description of income, in section 16, and the deductions. To accept this amendment and to combine with the principle of taxation upon income derived in Australia, the principle of taxation upon income received in Australia from investments abroad would involve a re-casting of a very large portion of the act. Eor example, income from personal exertion is denned as certain moneysDerived from sources in Australia, consisting of earnings, salaries, charges, sions, fees, &c. . . . Income from property means "" all incomes derived from sources in Australia and not derived from personal exertion."" And so on through the definition section. Section 13 is the governing section of the act, and it provides"" Subject to the provisions of this act, come tax shall be levied and paid for each financial year upon taxable income derived directly or indirectly by every taxpayer from sources within Australia. . . ."" Section 16 provides that assessable income shall include certain specified matters. It occupies more than four pages of the statute. As an. example of the difficulty that arises, I mention the trouble there is in dealing with profits which have been distributed in Australia in the for m of bonus shares. A complicated set of provisions has been worked out to deal with that subject, which depends in part for its administration upon the date on which certain profits were earned by the companies concerned. The provisions are being applied to Australia, but to apply them to foreign companies would be impracticable. It could not be done, except by sending inquiry officers abroad to ascertain whether and .when and out of what moneys foreign companies distributed bonus shares. Provision is also made for the deduction of certain losses and outgoings'; but this likewise has been devised to meet Australian conditions, and could not be applied to ex-Australian income. Everything in the act bas been put tJhere with the object of collecting tax on income derived from all sources in Australia, and the measure would have to be entirely re-cast to make its provisions applicable to income earned outside The Australia. It is, of course, open to the committee to adopt an entirely different system. I have not risen to speak on the merits of the amendment. I suggest that the wise course for the committee to pursue would be to allow the Government to continue its examination of the question, and not create difficulty, and perhaps chaos, by inserting in the act an isolated amendment of this character.",44
166,Mr WEST,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"East Sydney) [ 4 . 3 4 ] - I listened with attention to the remarks of the honourable member for Swan (Mr . commis- Gregory). His proposal is fundamental in character. This subject has been considered recently in Great Britain , the United States of America, and Canada. The Senate of the United States of America bas been specially concerned about the practice of certain Southern Europeans who migrate to America of inhoarding thoir savings u n t i l a time of depression occurs, and then taking them back to their native land. It has also given consideration to ways and means of meeting the financial problems which arise from the practice of wealthy Americans of taking large sums out of the country when they go abroad on holidays. Australia is not greatly concerned with that aspect of the matter, for we have numerous visitors from other countries who bring considerable wealth here. The discussions that have arisen in Great B r it a in have turned on a different aspect. On Monday last I asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that recently in the House of Commons, in reply to a question as to whether Great Britain can continue to lend her resources to develop the enterprises of foreign countries. Mr Winston Churchill (Chancellor of the Exchequer) replied that he had always been lead to believe that such loans leave the country in the form of Britisli goods? 2. If so, will the Prime Minister state whether the reply by the Chancellor of the Exchequer is in accordance with economic facts, and whether it would apply in the case of Australian loans? The riglit honourable gentleman replied that he had no information on the subject, but in spite of that off-banded way of dealing with it, be will have to give some earnest consideration to it before long. The question was raised at the Economic Conference at Geneva, but as that was a free trade body it also evaded the issue. It appears to me that something along the lines of the proposal of the honourable member for Swan will bave to be done sooner or later. At present a large amount of capital is being taken out of Australia annually, by persons resident abroad. It is well known that the members of the Tooth and Allen families draw very large incomes from their interests in Australia. They are not consumers, aud do not assist in relieving the cost of government. This money should be taxed. ""We sball eventually bave to treat this question as one of major importance.",45
167,Mr RODGERS,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Wannon) [4.38] - I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister express the opinion that there was a good deal to be said in favour of the amendment of the honourable member for Swan on the grounds of national sentiment, necessity and obligation. This country is badly in need of capital, and we should do all that we can to see that Australiau capital is kept here to develop our resources, establish our industries, and provide employment for our people. That the principle underlying the amendment is sound cannot be denied, for it is a principle upon wbicb .British and Canadian taxation rests. I was not impressed by the statement of the Attorney-General, that from the machinery standpoint the amendment is impracticable. I have noticed frequently that while one man is busy saying that a thing cannot be done, another comes along and does it. I can see no reason why we should not provide machinery to impose taxation of this character.",46
168,Mr FENTON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,It could almost be done by a regulation.,46
169,Mr RODGERS,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"-It should be easy to do it. We could include another part in our act to deal''with it, and make practically independent of the taxation of income earned in Australia. I was impressed with the statement of the Prime Minister that the proposal was equitable and would enlarge the field of taxation. In my opinion it would exploit a wide and legitimate field which we have a perfect right to exploit. I know of an Australian citizen who, shortly after the outbreak of the war, removed practically the whole of his capital from Australia, although be remained under the shelter of the Australian navy and army and the protection of the British flag. It is no part of our business to shelter individuals of that description from dual taxation. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan has mucb to commend it, but at the same time it would not be prudent at this stage to graft it upon our present act. That would be a somewhat precipitate and almost a clumsy method of dealing with this proposal, because it certainly requires more consideration than we can give it today.",46
170,Mr LAZZARINI,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,The honourable member is raising the difficulty that was mention by the Attorney-General.,46
171,Mr RODGERS,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Not at all. There are no insuperable machinery difficulties in respect to this amendment, but it would be unwise at this stage to graft it upon our taxation laws without giving it mature consideration. I have not the slightest doubt that the Commissioner of Taxation could soon frame new maehinery to make the amendment workable, and I suggest that he should prepare a measure to give effect to it. With reference to duality of taxation upon Australian manufacturers who export, the Prime Minister has given one of very few instances in the whole of Australia, and that is the Hugh V. MCKay Manufacturing Company. That case, of course, can be met by a special provision dealing with such export products. Tbere is the possibility that, unless we carefully frame our legislation,, we may tax capital employed in our primary industries, and therefore legislative machinery must be specially drafted. Butif the principle is right, the details are a minor consideration. The overwhelming sentiment of the Australian people it is that we should exploit every legitimate field of taxation before we increase its incidence upon our already heavily burdened comniunity. I am aware of another citizen holding vast properties that are today almost unproductive, and he is paying high land taxation, both Federal and State, and other imposts, including municipal rates. His holding cannot be further developed at present, and there it remains as his monumental investment in Australia. Could he use capital that has been put into his property, say, in America, he would be receiving nearly treble the return that he is getting from his Australian investment, but he is content to go through this difficult stage of Australia's nnances unt i l conditions improve. There is little profit today to the man who is controlling industry. Our economic conditions are bad, and we are passing through a difficult stage. This is the time when we should see that those who are controlling liquid funds do not take tbem out of Australia to be used in countries in which' there is a big reward for investment in industry. Our first obligation is to Australia, and we sbould do all we can to safeguard its interests and keep capital in this country so as to build un our resources, increase our population and protect our people from the increasing incidence of taxation, by first exploiting this legitimate field of income taxation that is now available to us.",46
172,Mr MCGRATH,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Ballarat) [4.51] - I hope that the honourable member for Swan will persist in his amendment and .that it will be carried by the committee. The Attorney-General raised some technical difficulties under the present act respecting the amendment, but I venture to say that they could be overcome by delaying the bill for 24 hours so that it might be redrafted. The operation of this amendment it has been estimated would bring in a revenue of £2,000,000 a .year. It is a large sum, and well worth collecting, and not one argument has been advanced impugning the wis-dom of imposing this form of taxation. It is remarkable that it has not been posed before. Those who derive income in Australia from investments abroad have enjoyed the benefits of citizenship in Australia. They had the protection of - our army and navy during the war, and yet have contributed little or nothing toward the revenue of this country. We have now the opportunity to make them bear their fair share of taxa- * tion. If it were possible, I should go further ancl make the taxation retrospective for a few'years. I certainly would not delay levying the tax for another year. Tbese .people have not been good citizens. Rather than assist to develop Australia, they have invested their capital in other countries, and are receiving large profits from the employment of black labour. They care not wbo won the war, or who paid for it. Australia is today badly in need of revenue. There are thousands of returned soldier settlers in this country who, unless they receive immediate assistauce, will be forced to leave their holdings. Here we have an opportunity to assist them. The Prime Minister said that there was a difficulty in levying this form of taxation, especially in respect of the firm of Hugh V. MCKay. I have no wish to tax that firm in respect of its export trade, but, after all, its founder, when he died recently, left nearly £2,000,000. The difficulty mentioned, by the Prime Minister could easily be overcome; and as for the technical difficulties enumerated by the Attorney General, they are not worth a moment's consideration. I commend the honourable member for Swan for bringing this proposal before the committee, and I sincerely hope it will be given effect.",47
173,Mr FENTON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Maribyrnong) [4.55] I do not know whether the Lonorable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) intends to persevere with the amendment, but I trust that, in view.of the support that he has received from both sides of the committee, there will be no backing down. Revenue is badly needed in this country, and we have to meet many liabilities. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse) has shown that in the next five years we must redeem half of our national debt, close on £500,000,000. Therefore, we cannot afford to allow the opproportunity to pass to obtain revenue from persons who can well afford to pay for it. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) has indicated that this is a method by which we can relieve the great body of the people of a portion of taxation, and at the same time not affect the protective policy of this country. Duties have been imposed - for revenue purposes only, it is the mass of the people that bear them indirectly. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) has intimated that this form of taxation has been receiving attention in other countries. I have with me an American record of various taxation systems. The Congress of the United States of America authorized an inquiry into the forms of taxation in operation in various countries, Including Great Britain, and no difficulty has been found in imposing a tax upon residents who invest their capital in other countries. Why should we not follow such an excellent example? It. may be said that this tax will injure our manufacturing export trade, but that difficulty is easily overcome. I quite agree with the honourable member for Yarra that there should be no duality of taxation, particularly within the Empire. Great Britain has already made provision for that, because it bas a reciprocal arrangement with the dominions.",47
174,Mr RODGERS,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,That provision is bodied in our own act.,48
175,Mr FENTON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"There is at Newark a company that manufactures and exoperating ports dredging machinery. The firm Thompson's, at Castlemaine, manufaction. tures boilers, and other machinery. bave no wisb to injure that trade, rather to develop it. Vast sums of bave been invested overseas by wealthy Australians, and we should be recreant our trust if we did not impose a tax upon them. The Govermnent may say that there is no'time to graft this amendment upon the bill, but I suggest that between the time the bill leaves this House and is received by the Senate, the proper machinery provisions could be drafted. The precedent for this tax has been estabdid lished in other countries. Some of these moneys invested outside of Australia ploy black labour on tin-fields in various countries and on mining fields in South Africa. When our own kith and kin receive large profits from overseas opposite through the employment of black labour"", it is time that we imposed a legitimate tax upon them. I hope that a vote will be taken upon the amendment, and that it will be carried.  and pliment the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) upon baving brought forward this amendment, but I agree with the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General that it oannot be incorporated in the legislation of this country in a moment. I feel sure that the honourable member for Swan will recognize that, baving introduced the amendment, and having secured from the Government an intimation that it is considering the matter seriously, it is uot necessary for him to go further with it just now. The question is not so simple as it appears. We do not possess that measure of control over our citizens and their investments outside Australia which some honourable members seem to think. This system of taxation might prove to be a two-edged sword. I believe that people with plenty of money, even if they are living privately, are of advantage to Australia, and tliey are taxed in other ways than through the income tax. If we impose such taxation as is here suggested, we might drive such people out of emthe country, and thus do more harm than good. However, I feel that much might be done along the lines suggested in the amendment. There are oil companies in Australia under conditions of which would bear veiy close investigaI think it will be possible to frame We legislation so that we might tax those but whom we wish to tax,' and avoid taxing money those whom we do not. By this means relief might be afforded to the heavilyto taxed citizens of the country.",48
176,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [5.5] - We cannot treat this proposal for altering the whole basis for levying taxation in quite as casual a way as certain honourable members seem to suggest. We not start out on a' system of income taxation in Australia without very exemhaustive inquiries being made as to the best method on which to base taxation. I would point out to honourable members that it is not quite fair to their predecessors that they sbould treat the existing system of taxation as one which is obviously defective. The system which appertains in Great Britain today^ and which it is suggested we' should adopt, namely, that of taxing a- resident on his income, no matter whence it is derived, was in existence when a Labour Government instituted our present system of taxation. I agree that the British system was probably examined, and that due consideration was given to other systems before the present one was adopted. After such consideration, the Labour Government came to the conclusion that the best system was to tax incomes derived in Australia. But circumstances have altered, and I have already indicated that the Government has given serious consideration to whether, Avithout criticism of those Avho framed the present system, i ' : might not be extended to cover investments of Australian citizens abroad. Before this Parliament could commit itself to such a principle, hoAvever, we must have much more information as to the possible repercussions of such an alteration of the UIAV. This idea of taxing incomes derived from abroad Avas not, I presume, brushed aside as umvorthy of consideration when the original system Avas evolved, but it Avas not thought Avise, at that time, to adopt it. We are now considering whether it is not necessary to make some alteration, and Ave are collecting facts as to the probable effects on revenue if such an alteration Avere made. When Ave are in possession of tliose facts, it may be possible to recast our Avhole system of taxation. I suggest that, until Ave have that information, it Would be extremely unwise for this committee to pledge itself to a principle which might not produce the advantages that a great number of people believe IIOAV it Would. The Government fully recognizes the necessity for considering this matter, and has already taken definite action. Therefore, I Would suggest that the honourable gentleman withdraw his amendment which, I agree, is one of very great importance.",48
177,Mr CHARLTON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Hunter) [5.10] This is one of the most important matters which has been considered during the committee stage of this bill. It has been made clear that there exists a large field of taxation which remains untapped by the Commonwealth. 1"" do not think Ave are justified in permitting this state of things to continue, in A'ieAv of the fact that our taxation is very heavy, and may have to be increased in the near future. No one can claim that it is right for certain Australian citizens, to be able to invest their money outside Australia, and to avoid the payment of income tax on the income received. I believe there are some persons in this country Avho draAV very large incomes from outside sources, and they have draAvn these incomes year after year without paying any taxation.",49
178,Mr RODGERS,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,Most of that money is invested in loAv-taxatiou countries.,49
179,Mr CHARLTON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Persons with money invested abroad enjoy all the benefits of Australian citizenship, but they avoid the taxation which the other citizens of Australia have to pay. It is hardly fair for the Prime Minister to remind us that the present system of taxation Avas framed by a Labour Government. It is quite true that the system Avas introduced in 1915 by a government of which the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) Avas a member. It does not folloAv, hoAvever, that those responsible for a taxation system sbould be condemned because defects develop in it after its introduction, and it is seen that people are evading their just share of taxation. The committee should be given an assurance that the present system Avill not be allowed to continue unchanged. During the discussion yesterday the Treasurer stated that the removal of the tax on the incomes of absentee company shareholders would give an inducement to capital to come to Australia. The system by which incomes derived - from abroad are left free from, taxation, gives, however, a direct inducement to capital to leave Australia.",49

181,Mr CHARLTON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"-It is difficult to estimate. Some say it is as much as £2,000,000, but that is a matter for investigation.",49

183,Mr OHARLTON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I agree that it is not possible to arrive at an accurate estimate, but I submit that this committee can affirm, as a matter of equity, the principle that taxation should be paid on inconie, irrespective of Avhere it is derived.",49

185,Mr CHARLTON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,No .,50

187,Mr CHARLTON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"There may be local taxes, but, generally speaking, there is no substantial tax paid on such incomes. If taxes are paid there, and Parliament wishes to do the fair thing, a reciprocal arrangement could be made with the Malay States and other places in regard to the taxation of income.",50
188,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,That would take years to do.,50
189,Mr CHARLTON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Every possible obstacle is being advanced against the introduction of this system.

191,Mr CHARLTON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"There is nothing to prevent this Parliament, if it desires to impose this form of taxation, from instructing its law officers to draw up the necessary amendment, which could be inserted when the bill came before the Senate. The bill is not urgent. If the committee decides that those people who have invested money outside Australia should pay taxation on the income they receive, the Government can make provision accordingly. Where there is a will there is a way. If the Attorney General makes up his mind to effect the amendment, he can do it. The committee can instruct the Government to prepare whatever legislation may be necessary to enable this taxation to be collected. I am aware that the Prime Minister has said that the Government is considering the matter; but how long will it continue to consider it?",50

If the adoption of this principle leads to the collection of £200,000 or £300,000 from a source which is now neglected, the Government will bave an opportunity to reduce otber taxation.",50

If the carrying of it would lead to the withdrawal of the bill entirely I would be very pleased, for, whilst I have faith in the desire of the commissioner to do what is just and reasonable, the Income Tax Assessment Act is becoming every year more cumbersome and intricate. Probably I would have been better advised had I advocated this amendment at the second-reading stage. The inatter could then have been fully discussed, and the Government could have been given an instruction to draft the necessary amendment. I bave brought forward the amendment purely as a matter of principle. In a country whose need of capital is so apparent, it is absolutely wrong that such direct encouragement sbould be given to our own. people to invest their money abroad.

It is rather remarkable that this avenue should have been ignored heretofore.",51

211,Mr HUGHES,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"North Sydney) [5.32]. us, - Wbe n the original income tax legislation was proposed, the Government of the day was not confronted with this problem; at least not, so far as as I can recollect, in an acute form. The amount of Australian money then invested in Siam and Malay was inconsiderable, though the Tongkab Harbour and Tongkah Compound Tin Dredging Companies on are of older date. Now that the subject has been .raised, there can be only one opinion. As the principle underlying taxation is that a citizen shall pay according to his inconie, there can be no doubt about what should be done. We have a most excellent example to follow in the practice which obtains in Great Britain. The Prime Minister, I understand, says that he is prima facie, favourable to the suggested alteration, but has not fully investigated the matter, and is not fully informed of its probable effect on investment and general financial conditions in Australia. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), who moved the amendment, is satisfied with the assurance of the Prime Minister that the problem will be investigated forthwith, and desires to withdraw his amendment. I hope that he may be permitted to do so. In the meanwhile I shall make my own position clear. If the Prime Minister has promised to investigate the matter, and has acknowledged that he is, prima facie, in favour of the change, I think Ave should be very foolish not to allow him to make his investigations. It is extremely doubtful, in any case, that the amendment could be carried in the face of the opposition of the Government. The inquiry should not take A'ery long, as it Avill be a simple one. But the potential taxpayer should not be alloAved to escape the tax on his income for the current year, and, therefore, I Would like the Prime Minister to tell us Avhether he intends that the iiwestigation shall be made Will such despatch as to enable Parliament to pass an amending bill early next year that will operate as if it Avere in force today. If not, one might very Avell object to any delay. In vieAV the attitude of the Prime Minister I sball not support the amendment, as I firmly believe that the judicious and expeditious course is to accept the assurance of the right honourable gentleman and await his action. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [5.38]. - We have to congratulate the honourable member for SAvan (Mr Gregory) result for introducing' his amendment. This afternoon's discussion has done by bringing into prominence a potencause tial' source of income taxation wbicb should assist iri closing some of the existing gaps in our taxation system. Apparently the Prime Minister has been considerably impressed by the debate, and appreciates the justice of the amendment, but be puts forward the excuse that an alteration of the existing act would involve tremendous complications. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has advanced the suggestion that if the Prime Minister makes a definite promise that he will introduce an amending bill to cope Will this leakage of taxation Avhen Parliament meets next year it Would be satisfactory to all. I believe that if the honourable member for Swan insisted upon placing his amendment before the committee it would be carried. It is our duty to see that every citizen pays a fair share of taxation. I urge the Primo Minister to consider favourably the suggestion that he should make a definite statement on the matter.",51
212,Mr DUNCAN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"HUGHES (Boothby) [5.40] - I do not Avish this amendment, to go to a vote Avithout first making my position clear. I am quite opposed to it.

213,Mr GHEGOKY,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Grea t Britain, which is a free trade country, has a similar system in operation.",52
214,Mr DUNCAN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"HUGHES - The difficulties confronting the innovation Avere pointed out at length by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, and it is unnecessary for me to emphasize them. The taxation which was imposed in England during the Avar and immediately afterAvards created extraordinary of difficulty and irritation in its administration. I consider that if the suggested alteration is effected the inevitable result Avill be to drive capital out of the country. That Would perhaps not be displeasing N to a party that does not desire capital to come into Australia. There is probably a considerable number of Australian residents Avho have fairly big sums invested here and abroad. The inevitable of the introduction of irritation tactics sucb as are suggested good by the amendment Would be to many of those people to transfer their investments and residence abroad. Capital Would be driven away, instead of being attracted to Australia. The amendment of the honourable member for Swan was introduced without any notice, and we are expected to pronounoe .a final decision within a few hours on a matter which, as the Prime Minister stated, involves a complete re-casting of our income tax legislation. I am opposed to the amendment. I am, of course, prepared to consider the facts in the future, and to examine the subject in fuller detail. I am ready, to, if necessarybut I do not think that will be the result - to vary my opinion. I hope that the Government, if necessary, will force the question to a division, and obtain the opinion of the committee.",52
215,Mr LAZZARINI,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,Werriwa) [5.45] Apparently the Prime Minister does not intend to reply to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition.,53
216,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,I am in the embarrassing position of having already spoken twice on the amendment. I should very much like to speak again.,53
217,Mr LAZZARINI,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"The principal objection that the Government has offered to this proposal is that it would necessitate a considerable alteration of our tion machinery; but surely if the principle i's equitable we should note hesitate to adapt our machinery to give effect to it. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) spent about ten minutes in telling us that the proposal was sound, and would open up a new and legitimate field of taxation; then he surprised us by saying that he. would not vote for it. The honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) introduced the amendment, and later gave reasons why it should be withdrawn. One reason that the Prime Minister gave for not accepting it was that previous Labour governments had not seen fit to adopt it.",53
218,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I merely said that the present system of taxation had been adopted after considerable investigation, and. that we should give at least equal consideration to any new system before adopting it.",53
219,Mr LAZZARINI,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr . Hughes) told us that the principle was not adopted years ago because the amount of Australian capital invested abroad then was.hardly worth considering. That is not now the position. Huge profits are being made by Australian residents from investments such as those referred to by the honourable member for Swan. The Prime Minister has said that full inquiry will be made into the matter. Does that mean that another royal commission will be appointed, and that the honourable member for Swan will be the chairman of it? It appears to be a favourite practice of this Government to evade the responsibility of making important decisions by appointing royal commissions. Possibly it intends to appoint another royal commission on taxation. If so, it will probably use the commission's recommendations as the basis of a declaration of Government policy just prior to the next election.",53
220,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,The honourable gentleman seems to be familiar with the way these things are done.,53
221,Mr LAZZARINI,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I am too familiarwith the methods of this Government. The honourable member for Boothby argued that if we adopt this proposal we shall probably drive capital out of* the country. I cannot understand how he taxaarrives at that conclusion. The Government a few hours ago withdrew a proposal not to tax absentee shareholders. It appears to me that persons abroad who derive wealth from investments in Australia, and persons in Australia wbo derive wealth from investments abroad should be taxed. The Royal Commission on Taxation dealt with the subject of taxation of the income of Australian residents derived outside Australia. Paragraph 35S of its report reads as followsThe Federal Commissioner of Taxation, in the course of his evidence on the subject of double.inconie tax, expressed the opinion that "" With'the disappearance of the double income tax there is no reason why Australia should limit its tax to incomes arising from sources in Australia."" (See also paragraphs 109 and 170 of Wiis commission's first report.) The Commissioner considered that, upon the elimination of double taxation in respect of incomes taxed both in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, Australian residents should be taxed on their total incomes where ever derived on the basis of their ability to pay. He said- "" It would mean that, instead of the Commonwealth losing income tax on large revenue derived by Australians-usin g the term in a general sense-fro m such countries as Japan, China, America, and South America, we should get the tax on it. There is no reason, to my mind, why that revenue should not contribute towards the tost of government in Australia.""",53
222,Mr KILLEN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,Is that not tantamount to saying that there is no objection to dual taxation?,54
223,Mr LAZZARINI,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,I do not think so. An arrangement already exists to eliminate double taxation to a large extent ,54
224,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,That is only vis-a-vis Great Britain.,54
225,Mr LAZZARINI,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Exactly ; but Australian residents who have investment* in,, say, the Argentine or the Malay, and bad to pay taxation there upon the income that they derive from them, would surely be allowed to deduct from the net income the cost incurred in obtaining it.",54
226,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,That is not the arrangement that we have with Great Britain.,54
227,Mr LAZZARINI,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"That may be so; but I can see no reason wby such au arrangement should not be made in this connection. I do not think that any one would object to such a deduction. We could evolve machinery to meet tbese circumstances, although it may take some little time to do it. If the Prime Minister would frive an undertaking that the principle would be accepted, I should be satisfied.",54
228,Mr GREGORY,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,We have had a very favourable reply from the right honourable gentleman. I am afraid that if we divide the committee we may be defeated on the nrinciple. I wish to avoid that.,54
229,Mr LAZZARINI,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"The honourable gentleman has advocated the principle, but apparently intends to vote against it.",54
230,Mr GREGORY,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,I sball do nothing of the sort. I regard the Prime Minister's reply as satisfactory.,54
231,Mr LAZZARINI,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,All that he said was that the matter would be considered.,54
232,Mr GREGORY,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,He said that it would be favourably considered.,54
233,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,I said more thajQ. that. I said that it is already being favourably considered.,54
234,Mr LAZZARINI,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I am anxious to see the principle adopted. It is probable that this Parliament will sit for only another three months before the election. Neither the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) nor can I be certain of re-election, and if we do not vote on the issue today we may not bave another opportunity to do so. I can see no reason wby the Government should not immediately undertake to ask the commissioner to devise machinery to collect taxation of this character. It has been said that we have no information as to the amount of money involved; but we know very well that it is considerable, and therefore we are justified in acting. This field of taxation has been left untouched for too long. I should be quite prepared to tax incomes of this character three times as heavily as inoomes derived from sources within Australia. I trust that the honourable member for Swan will persist in his amendment, and that it will be carried by the committee.",54
235,Mr MACKAY,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Lilley) [6.0] - The discussion that bas centred round the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), bas been very interesting. Many honourable members bave expressed views favourable to the taxation of profits earned outside Australia. I mucb prefer to see Australian capital used for the development of Australia. Honourable members have at all times spoken of the wonderf u l potential resources of this country, and it is not pleasant to realise that large sums of money are being sent away for investment abroad. No blame can be attached to the honourable member for Swan for moving the amendment. Necessarily, he could not beforehand give honourable members notice of his intention to move it, but the discussion that has take place has induced the Prime Minister to promise that this taxation proposal will be investigated. I do not think for one moment that any member would like to see an important proposal like this hurriedly inserted in the bill, and later oh to discover that more harm than good had thereby been done. It is also unfair to ask the Prime Minister to give a definite promise respecting what may take place in the early part of next year. If this proposal to tax incomes from overseas investments is surrounded with many difficulties, as we have been told, it necessarily calls for a close examination. There is also another aspect. We have not been told what taxation is paid by Australian investors in other countries, and we may find that it is considerable. While I believe that we sbould get some return for the protection that is afforded to Australian citizens, we have to realise that there must be some reason for persons investing their capital outside Australia, and I do not doubt that the heavy taxation imposed by both Federal and State Governments has bad a good deal to do with it. I would hesitate about taking any action that would result in driving either individuals or money for investment away from Australia. It is also very important that this legislation sbould not be delayed pending the inquiries being made as the reductions in taxes apply to the operations of the present year. I think that the committee has made excellent progress in obtaining from the Prime Minister a promise that this taxation, proposal will be investigated. The honourable member for Swan, having heard the opinion of honourable members has adopted the right course in proposing to withdraw his amendment, and I ask the committee to support him.",54
236,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [6.4] - This discussion has been very interesting-, but the manner in which the amendment has been approached by many honourable members has certainly been a great surprise to me. Until I heard the discussion this afternoon, I bad always imagined that honourable members, especially those of the Opposition, were of the opinion that Ave in Australia had evolved a better and more equitable system of income taxation than any other country in the world. At the time of its introduction, there were income tax laws operating in a great number of otbpr countries. I was under the impression that those had been examined, and as a result Parliament had deliberately adopted the present basis of taxation upon incomes derived in this"" country in preference to the systems of other countries. But today quite a different point of view has ' been taken. This question is nearly as controversial as the rival policies in this Parliament in the fiscal sphere of free trade and protection. A new light altogether has been thrown upon our taxation methods in Australia. Let me put this point to honourable members. Is not the outstanding feature of our federal income taxation its tremendous complexity, and yet that is almost entirely due to the desire that Ave have in the federal sphere to mete out justice to the taxpayers. Until today I thought that honourable members had insisted upon that complexity in order that absolute justice should be done to every taxpayer. No matter what system of taxation is adopted, there will be complaints about its complexity, and, perhaps, suggestions from those Avho complain, which Would increase that complexity. This gradual leakage of capital from Australia has been occupying the mind of the Government for some time. To some extent Ave have approached the subject from the wrong angle. Honourable members must realise that, so soon as Ave tax incomes derived from overseas investments, Ave completely alter the fundamental basis of the income tax legislation of this country. If Ave changed the principles which Ave have hitherto folloAved, I believe that we could simplify many of the complexities of the present law and obviate many of the calculations that are necessary under our present taxation system. The leakage of capital is becoming so serious that the Government has been considering whether there is not sufficient justification to alter the principles of our income tax legislation. But it has not embodied any alteration in its financial proposals for the present year, because these, of course, operate only in regard to the income earned last year and do - c not apply to income earned this .year. The Government intends to make further and fuller investigations before it comes to a decision on a far-reaching alteration of this character. If it decides upon an alteration, it Avill not be possible to bring it down to honourable members until the next session of Parliament. I want honourable members to understand that any alteration Would not apply during the present financial year.",55
237,Mr CHARLTON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,Is the right honourable gentleman prepared to apply the alteration to the next financial year?,55
238,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I wisb to make it perfectly clear that the Government at present is favourably inclined towards taking action in the direction suggested; but if , as a result of its further investigations, it comes to the conclusion that it is not wise nor advisable to make an alteration to our present income tax system, tben the Government most certainly will not do it . I am prepared to give honourable members the assurance that the Government will in for m tbem of what it intends to do after it bas full y investigated the position.

Clause 12 amends section 23 of the principal act, which provides for deductions. It provides that there shall be deducted from income all losses and outgoings not being in the nature of losses or outgoings of capital, including commissions, travelling expenses, interest or expenses actually incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income. It is proposed to alter the order of the words so as to make it quite clear that the losses and outgoings which are included amongst the Tellers: litems which may be deducted from the assessable income must be actually in Manning, A.

Amendment (by Mr LATHAM ) agreed to. That paragraph (r) be omitted. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 16 (Partners).  asked that this clause be recommitted so as to give the Minister an opportunity of explaining its import more clearly. It must be evident to honourable members that the power conferred on the Commissioner of Taxation under this clause is very wide indeed. I listened patiently to the statement made by the Treasurer when he introduced this measure, and if I remember rightly, he stated that even when a wife put money into her husband's business, there could not be established a partnership between tliem. The husband could only pay, and the wife claim, interest for the money so advanced. submit that a man could have no better partner than his wife. If she possesses money of her own, and is entitled to invest it, there is no better way to do it than, to put it into ber husband's business. I am, therefore, anxious that Parliament should interpret its will in this regard, rather than that it should impose that power upon any person whatsoever. I recognize the need, for the clause under our graduated system of taxation. There is a natural desire on the part of taxpayers to get together in order that they may divide their incomes, and so come under a lower income tax rate. It is necesproduced, sary that the Government sbould protect the income tax. act against such bogus partnerships, but the Minister should more clearly define under what circumstances a husband and wife may conduct a genuine business partnership. If the position is as I understood the Treasurer to say, that a wife is not able to enter into a business partnership with ber busband, I totally disagree. If a wife owns farming property, and her husband also clause'? owns land, there is nothing more proper than that they sbould enter into a legal partnership in respect of sucb land, and that they should have their legal rights as partners preserved to them.",56
241,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Kooyong - Attorney General) [8.10] - Sectio n 29 of the act provides that a partnership shall be liable to furnish returns, but that the partnership, as such, shall not be liable to taxation, and that the partners shall be separately assessed. That is a proper provision in the case of a bona fide partnership. This new clause is designed to deal with a fruitfu l source of evasion. It must be remembered that if a husband and wife are carrying on a business partnership, and have no outside source of income, the tax payable on the income of the business as a partnership is frequently less than it would be if the business were carried on in the name of only one of the partners, because the division of income allows a deduction of £300 from the income of each of tbem. Tbere are, I admit, many bona fide husband-and-wife partnerships, but there are quite a number which are not bona fide, but which it I is extremely difficult to prove are other than they are represented to be. The department has informed the Government that these cases are becoming more numerous. Many cases bave been observed in which a business has been carried on for some time by an individual as a sole trader. He then obtains advice from a taxing agent, and thereafter he carries on his business in the form of a partnership with his wife. The business may still trade under the same name, but for taxation purposes it is represented as a partnership. The claim for the existence of a partnership may be based on a specific agreement which is and it is difficult to establish, in such a case, that the partnership is not a bona fide one. If it is necessary to prove in a law court in every case that there is a fraud, tbese evasions will continue to take place. The section will not affect any bona fide partnership between husband and wife.  "" bona fide "" as used in reference to this",57
242,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Whether a partnership 'is - bona fide or not in relation to - this clause depends upon the purpose for which. it was formed. A partnership is not bona fide if it is entered into merely for the purpose of relieving a husband and wife of their taxation liabilities.  ney-General interpret a case in which a woman puts actual money, which she owns in ber own right, into her husband's business on the understanding that she is to be given a partnership in the business",57
243,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,That is certainly a bona fide partnership.  surer to say that even in a case like that the wife would be entitled to receive only the current rate of interest on the money which she put into the business.,58
244,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"The Treasurer was probably referring to another aspect of the matter. If the honourable gentleman will refer to the Partnership Acts, as passed by the different State Parliaments, he will find that the mere lending of money does not create a partnership. This clause would not apply in cases where money had been merely lent. It would apply only in cases in which it is contended that a partnership exists as defined in section 29 of the act, and in which it is found that the partnership bas been formed to evade taxation liability. But where there is a contribution of real money to the capital of a firm there can be no doubt that a bona fide partnership in the business may be claimed.  statement. I gathered that money put into ber husband's business by a wife could be regarded only as a loan. There is a distinct difference between lending money and putting it into a business as a ner, when all the risks attaching to a partnership are incurred.",58
245,Mr BRUCE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,It must be a partnership if a wife puts her own money into the business and is prepared to bear the risks of a partnership.,58
246,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,Tber e must be a sharing of risks and profits.,58
247,Mr RODGERS,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Tbi s clause gives complete discretionary power, without limitation, to the Commissioner. The Attorney-General has explained a good many things wbicb are not partnerships, but he has not laid down a basis for determining what is a partnership.",58
248,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Tba t does not matter, because the question only arises wben persons allege that they are in partnership.",58
249,Mr RODGERS,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Wannon) [8.15] If some declaration of partnership ? were to be the determining fact I sbould not object, but there is nothing in the act to define for the guidance of the commissioner a partnership between husband and wife. It is quite common for a wife to hold land in ber own name and to work it with her busband, but without any deed of partnership or annual balance-sheet, or distribution of profits. If this taxation is to be left entirely in the discretion of the commissioner a loose family partnership might lead to a charge by the commissioner of attempted evasion of taxation. Frequently it will be found that partnerships do not exist, and the commissioner's demand for evidence in the form of a deed, an annual balance-sheet, and a statement of profits distributed, might make the partners liable to the highest penalties under the act. The clause is too vague.",58
250,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,Tb e commissioner has not uncontrolled and arbitrary discretion. His decision is subject to review by the board.,58
251,Mr RODGERS,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Tba t is so, but 98 per cent._ of the taxpayers accept the decision of the commissioner rather than appeal to the board.

Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr Bruce and Mr Latham do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foreinconie going resolution. Bill presented by Mr LATHAM , and read a first time. SECOND READING.",58
252,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [S.31] - I m o v e That the bill bo now read a second time. This is a bill fixing the rates of income tax, and reducing the prevailing rates by 10 per cent, in the case of taxation payable by individuals. No reduction is made in the rate payable by companies. The minimum amount of tax payable has been reduced from £1 to 10s. The b i also makes special provision for the 'to be paid by trustees. A difficulty arisen in the case of a trustee receiving income from the estate of which he is a trustee, and retaining it . trustee and not the beneficiary is assessed in respect of that income. has been held in litigation, under War Times Profits Tax Assessment that a distinction exists between - the of an individual trustee and a company trustee. The rule is that a beneficiary in a trust estate pays income tax according to the ordinary provisions of the act in respect of the income which he receives, but sometimes the income is retained in the hands of the trustee. The act then provides that income tax is payable by the trustee upon the' income which is not going to a beneficiary. In a case which came before the court under the War Times Profits Tax Assessment Act, it was necessary to consider and apply legislation from the Income Tax Act, and the court held that where the trustee was a be levied company, the company rate was to be on paid, but that where the trustee was an hunindividual, the individual rate should be paid. Obviously that is quite wrong. It reso-' brings about the result that, in two preof cisely similar estates, with identical One amounts paid into the hands of trustees, made one sum would bear taxation a,t the company flat rate of Is., and the other sum, because it was paid to an individual in One stead of a company trustee, would pay either more or less than Is., according to the amount involved. The bill proposes to make the position equitable by making the rate of tax payable by a trustee, as set out in the f o u r t h scheduleFor every pound sterling of the taxable in respect of which a trustee is liable to be separately assessed and to pay tax, the rate of tax shall be the rate which would be payable under the First, - Second, or Third Scehdules as the case requires if one individual were liable to be separately assessed and to pay tax on that taxable income. Apar t from the specific alterations to which I have referred, this is .an ordinary income tax rates bill.",60
253,Mr SCULLIN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Y a r r a ) [ 8 . 3 5 ] - I do not intend to discuss the second reading of the bill at length. I must concede that we had a very thorough discussion of the Income Tax Assessment Bill , which l l covers the whole range of this subject, rates including the rates to be imposed. has That exhaustive debate proved that if we have a reasonable time to discuss a measure a useful result is achieved for The the country. Our debate on the Income Tax Assessment Bill produced some good It results, although I regret that our rethe marks in opposition to the - proposal Act, to make a general reduction of 10 case per cent., - which is embodied in this bill, did not bear fruit. is not a very popular thing to oppose a reduction of taxation, as is now being done by the Opposition. We take the stand that our financial position is not at all promising. The signs are all around lis that we shall probably have to face a financial stringency, and that we shall need all our available revenues if we are to cope with it successfully. We sbould be applying our surpluses to the reduction of our debt or to preventing an increase of it. It should be our endeavour to relieve the people where we can from the existing revenue imposts. I refer not to the protective, but to purely revenue duties by which so much indirect taxation is raised. That is the basis of our protest against this reduction, and it bas already been discussed at considerable length. We have not met with much success, but the debate has not been altogether ' useless. We certainly saved the country at least £200,000 in connection with the Income Tax Assessment Act. We cannot move to increase the rate of taxation to the original standard, because that would be against the Standing Orders, and we cannot vote against the second-reading of this bill, because if we were successful, it would result in no income tax being collected. We can merely reiterate what we said on the Income Tax Assessment Act, so far as it applies to this bill. Tbere is one thing which I urge the Minister in charge of the bill to consider, and is the minimum tax charged. It may seem a very small matter, but the minimum of £1 operated harshly against many taxpayers. The reduction to 10s. will give a measure of relief, but I understand that some of the States collect a minimum of only 5s., and I suggest that we should reduce our minimum to a similar amount. A man may come into the taxable area with perhaps only £1 above the exemption. Legally speaking, under the terms of the scheduled rates, he should pay only a few pence, but'the minimum compels him to pay 10s. I suggest that 5s. would be reasonable.  a considerable; time. I have felt that this country would do well to impose the same It rate of tax upon income from property as that which applies to income derived from personal exertion. No doubt when the differential rate was fixed it was felt that those people who earned their income by the investment of their capital-eithe r by placing it out on loan, or by erecting buildings and collecting income in the form of rent-shoul d pay a greater revenue than the man who works bard for his money. That may appear to be very reasonable, but when we examine it from an economic stand-point, we realise that it merely .causes trouble and places the nation at 'a disadvantage. An increased taxation on revenue derived from investments in this country means that the interest rate must go up, which is detrimental to the progress of the country. I also submit that under the present scheme the money invested in houses for letting purposes is unduly taxed, so that it is the working man who actually has to meet the higher rate of taxation. Instead of being an advantage to Australia, it is a disadvantage. Foreign investors in Australia are not similarly penalized. Yesterday we had an instance of the considerable cost which is incurred by the Taxation Department in baving separately to reckon and compute the averaging system now operating in Australia. It confuses the existing system just about as much as would the system proposed by that me, to which the Treasurer took exception. I bave no ulterior, motive in urging my contention, but bave in mind only the detrimental effect that the present system bas upon Australia. I am merely asking for something that would be a great convenience to many taxpayers.",60
254,Mr SCULLIN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Would the honourable member apply the scheme to all income tax?  a graduating one and is very severe indeed on big incomes. A man may have a taxable income of £1,500 from personal exertion, and only £50 or £60 from property or from money that he has on fixed deposit. Tbat amount is brought into calculation at a r special and high rate, which must indirectly, affect the interest rate in Australia; a'nd tend to retard our development. I appeal to the Government to take this aspect into consideration to see whether it is not possible to place this taxation on an economic basis.",61
255,Mr WEST,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"East Sydney) [8.45] The honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse) usually directs attention to problems wbicb very few people can properly grasp. I understand that his proposal to-night is that the rate of income tax should be the same irrespective of whether income is derived from personal exertion or from property. Income derived from personal exertion usually represents the wages of a worker in all fields of employment, wbile that from property frequently comes from a person's savings or investments or from an inheritance from deceased relatives. It could hardly be expected in these cumstances that the rate of taxation would be similar. It has never viously been suggested that it should be so, at least not to my knowledge. I regret that provision is made in the bill for the imposition of a minimum tax of 10s. The result will be that a person wbo is liable for the payment of a tax of only ls. or 6d. will have to pay 10s. appears to me to be a heavy punishment to persons of limited means, and as it is not their fault that their income will not permit tbem to pay income tax I do not think that <jt can be justified. If it not so serious, it would be laughable. As I observed on a previous occasion, sucb provisions in our legislation bring our proceedings down to the level of comic opera. I trust that the Government will agree to the deletion of that paragraph from the clause.",62
256,Mr GULLETT,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Henty) [8.50] - I sbould not address myself to this measure were it not for the fact that I consider incidence of direct and indirect taxation of vital importance to our economic life. I should rejoice in the proposed reduction of direct taxation were it not for the fact that it is not a reduction in the totality of taxation, but merely a shifting of the amount involved from a direct to an indirect tax. maimer in which a country will submit to direct as against indirect taxation is, in my opinion, a test of its intelligence and economic.sense. A nation which prefers indirect to direct taxation is deficient in knowledge of economics. An axiom of taxation is that if a government bas to raise £1,000 in taxation very much less economic hurt is done if it clips the amount off a single income of, say, £10,000, than if it takes 50 cuts of £20 each from the recipients of smaller incomes. Our indulgence in this orgy of indirect taxation is having a very bad effect upon our national expenditure. Had I known that to meet the expense of constructing certain works for which I bave voted in this Parliament in the last year or so, the electors would have to sign specific cheques to meet direct taxation instead of knowing, as I did, that the necessary money or the interest to be paid on it would be available from revenue duties, I cir- should certainly. not bave voted for them. The expenditure of this country pre- would have been at least £5,000,000 a year less than it has been if direct taxation had been as bigb as indirect taxation is, and indirect taxation had been down to the level of direct taxation. Had we leaned less heavily than we have done on indirect taxation, we That sbould have been less extravagant, and I am convinced that we should not have approved of many of the schemes for expenditure which have been endorsed. It would be in the best interests of this were country if in the future we were to depend more upon revenue from income, land and other direct taxes than upon revenue from indirect taxes.",62
257,Mr THEODORE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Dalley) [8.55] - I protest against the provisions of this bill. Like the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) I objected during the budget debate to the manner in which our indirect taxation has increased; and I wisb the now to emphasize my views. It appears to me that the Government has adopted the principle of ignoring criticism of its financial policy in this respect. The Treasurer did not refer to it in his budget speech beyond mentioning that the Government intended to reduce direct taxation. He did not examine the inThe cidence of the taxation which is today falling so heavily upon the community in general; he did not attempt to explain the policy of the Government in this respect;, and I do not think that he in any way justified the proposed 10 per cent, reduction of income tax. It was pointed out during the budget debate that in the five years that have elapsed since this Government assumed office, indirect taxation has increased by approximately 91 per cent., while direct taxation has been reduced by approximately 33-J per cent.",62
258,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,Did I understand the honourable member to say that indirect taxation had been increased by 91 per cont ?,63
259,Mr THEODORE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"That is what I consequences. said. The Attorney-General seems to be astonished. The figure is arrived at in this way. During 1921-22, which was the last complete financial year prior to the assumption of office by this Govern-' ment, the receipts "" from the customs totalled £17,328,000, while this year Government is budgeting for a customs revenue of £35,150,000, an increase £17,822,000, or approximately 91 per cent. The Attorney-General may that our customs revenue is not taxation. It may not be imposed as taxation, the fact remains that the moneyflowsinto the Treasury, and the consumers have to pay it as an indirect tax. I feel justified, therefore, in saying that the Government policy has increased indirect taxaI tion by 91 per cent, concurrently with having reduced direct taxation by 33-J per cent. Honourable members cannot past ignore the unstable economic position of the Commonwealth in consequence of enormous flow of imports into the under country. We shall soon be forced to give more consideration to this problem. Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Pratten) will shortly invite lis to discuss the new tariff proposals that be bas tabled, and to suggest a cure for the obvious from which the country is suffering. We shall have to take drastic measures fectively to protect Australian industries and prevent foreign goods from swamptoo ing the country, and such action will evitably have the effect of reducare ing the flow of revenue into the Treasury. It will reduce, so long as our legislation is effective, the indirect .taxation, whether the Government desires it or not, and with that prospective reduction in indirect taxation it will be faced with the necessity of getting revenue from other sources. That is an additional argument for caretem f u l consideration before we reduce the direct taxation at this juncture. If the Government is contemplating a continuation of the present flow of money into the Customs House, if it regards the annual increment of customs receipts as a part of its settled policy, then I can understand it reducing direct' taxation or curtailing its revenue in other directions. But if its policy has been set with that in view, it is wrong, and the Government is travelling along the road tq ruin, and the country will sooner or later suffer the Mr J. FBANCIS - Tba t is an amazing statement, coming from the honourable member.",63
260,Mr THEODORE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,Trut h should not be amazing from any one. The simplethe minded are very easily amazed. Mr J. FBANCIS - The honourable memof ber left Queensland in a maze.,63
261,Mr THEODORE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"What is the imsay plication behind that statement? Mr J. FBANCIS - What I have said. but Mr THEODORE - I was Treasurer in Queensland for many years, and I think that I budgeted, if not always for a surplus, at any rate in strict conformity to the principles of sound finance. realise that this is not an occasion upon which an examination of Queensland finances in the immediate would be justified, but I bave no ob-* jection to discussing the subject with any the honourable members who are labouring delusions regarding the stability of Queensland's finances under my regime. The Whatever honourable members may think of the situation in Queensland, the situation of the Commonwealth is unsatisfactory both from an economic and financial ills point of view-fro m an economic point of view because of the adverse trade balefance, and from a financial point of view because the Government is levying much indirect taxation, and thus inplacing a heavy burden on the people who least able to carry it. At a time wben that burden is heavy and inequitable as far as the family man is concerned, the Government is deliberately reducing the burden on the shoulders of those wbo are best able to carry taxation. The Govern^ ment has not shown that the present sysof. income taxation is bearing with undue severity upon the shoulders of those who are contributing it. If it were to do so, tliere would be no better argument in favour of the bill and of a and reduction in income taxation, but it^has not attempted to show that the income tax is to any extent oppressive. As a matter of fact those who have examined the in-, cidence of ' Commonwealth income tax will, I think,, arrive at the conclusion the existing rates are equitable and just. The tax is graduated, and its incidence progressive. Those who contribute most are best able to do so, but this proposed reduction will give the greatest concession to the wealthy people, and no considerf able section of the less wealthy members of the community will get any advantage.",63

I bave taken from the report of the Commissioner for Taxation the total taxable that incomes on the basis of the 1925-26 figures, which are the last available. is Let me bere interpose that the report of the commissioner used, in the old days, to be a comprehensive and analytical document, containing a great deal of useul information for those interested in taxation; but recently, for some reason, possibly for reasons of economy, many of the tables and statistics and information were included in the old report bave been excluded from the present report, which is now a very skimpy document.",64
272,Mr SCULLIN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,A lot of useful information has been left out of it .,64
273,Mr THEODORE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Tba t is so. Although the old report may have been somewhat costly to compile and to maintain, it was well justified. I find, from an of the last report, that the total taxable incomes under the Commonwealth act amounted to £179,000,000 for last one year. I do not know whether I bave made an error in calculating my figures, but I estimate that the resident taxpayers an have a taxable income of £116,000,000, of £2,250,000, companies of £59,000,000, and casual taxpayers of £1,000,000. I do not know whether the amounts for companies and resident taxpayers include to some extent the same taxable incomes, but if they do not, then total taxable income is £179,000,000 for the Commonwealth. The people who are enjoying these enormous annual revenues are to get the advantage of the to reduction in taxation. The taxable incuscome has been an increasing quantity. The taxpayers are exhibiting no distress and showing no signs of ruin or insolTheir aggregate incomes bave been increasing, and if we measure the prosperity of the general taxpayer on any other system-the increased bank deposits for instance, or the increase in general trade or the bank clearings, or any other commercial test that may be applied-w e shall find that generally the taxpayers contributing to the Commonwealth rein* venue by means of direct taxation bave been enjoying increasing prosperity and bave not been suffering that distress which would warrant any drastic reduction in taxation. The tax should continue, because those people can well afford to pay it, and are far better able to meet the financial burdens of the Commonwealth than are the unfortunate wage-earner and small primary producer who at present do not rank in the list of income tax contributors. Certain classes of Commonwealth taxpayers will get large concessions under this bill. Taxpayers with taxable incomes of £10,000 a year, and there are quite a number of them, will be given a gift of £191 a year.",64

To examine thoroughly and to understand the incidence of taxation and its consequent effect, we should have more statistics thau are available at present. It will be within the recollection of honourable members that the. Commonwealth ordered an examination of the position of private wealth in Australia in 1916. That was a war measure known as the wealth census. A lot of valuable information was obtained. The census was probably costly, ancl could not be undertaken every year, but it could, I think, be undertaken during each quinquennial period. In that way useful information would be furnished, to the Eederal Parliament and to every one interested in taxation aiul the economic progress of the century. Data could be collected which would be a guide as to the consequent effect of the incidence of taxation, and in respect of a great many other matters bearing upon wealth production and the economic situation of Australia.",65

Possibly some people concerned in wealth production would be embarrassed by it, but for the sake of the knowledge that would be obtained, such a census would be justified. I do not wish to unduly delay the bill. If it were left to me I should, prevent its passage. I do not want to be regarded as an obstructionist. The Government is determined to relieve the wealthy people of some portion of direct taxation while continuing the indirect taxation on the working classes. Nothing that I can say will prevent the Government from doing that. But I wish to call attention to what I regard as a significant development of the Nationalists' policy as expressed by the Commonwealth Governof ment in its legislative acts and in its policy this session. It has shown a disposition to favour the rich, and a callous disregard for the hardships ancl distresses of the less wealthy section of the community. It has shown a disposition to bolster up capitalistic institutions. It has lessened the effectiveness of the Commonwealth Bank by a deliberate act of policy, thereby enormously strengthening the opportunity of the private banks to exploit the community; it has surrendered the control of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line and left the privately-owned shipping companies to exploit the producers and shippers of this country. By an attempt to exempt from ' taxation absentee shareholders drawing revenues from Australian companies it was trying to favour another class of wealthy people. In this measure it is making a further concession to the wealthy section of the community concurrently with a continuance of the burdens on those less able to pay the existing taxation.",65
284,Mr MANN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Perth) [9.17] - Ha d I not beeir deprived of an opportunity durwas ing the budget debate to discuss Government's financial policy, I should uot have spoken on this bill. That opportunity --not having been provided, obliged""»'to deal more or less piece-meal with it oii the motion for the second ing of this measure. I should bave preand ferred to deal with the operations of the Government in relation to one another, and not as isolated items; but I cannot let this bill pass without saying something thing on the policy which the Governa ment has adopted. Eor reasons 'which may differ materially from those of honus orable members, on the otber side of chamber, I think the Government is doing ing wrong in reducing direct whilst piling up an ever-increasing burden of indirect taxation. In his budget speech the Treasurer, with that joyful expression which reminds one of Little Jack Horner saying "" What a good boy am I , "" declared that since 1921-22 Govermnent had reduced taxation by £8,000,000; but he forgot to mention he had added almost double that amount tcour indirect taxation. Therefore, the gift of a reduction in taxation was a very unsatisfactory one. It was really a Greek gift. But the position is really worse than the figures indicate. There is something about indirect taxation wbicb makes its incidence much more severe than that direct taxation. This applies especially to the iniquitous taxation-levied through, protective duties which send up, not only the price of things imported, but also the - price of those things which are manufactured, here. We know that Australia is in a very serious financial position today. It does not behove honourable members to give vent toalarmist expressions of opinion, butan honourable member, responsible to the electors of the country, who considers the situation, cannot but feel the deepest anxiety regarding the conditions in Australia today. Mr COOK. - Anothe r pessimist. Mr M^ANN - If an honourable member in this House refers to trouble before it comes, he is accused of being a croaking Jeremiah, and if he does so after trouble has come upon us, he is accused of having brought it about. If honourable members had faced the position squarely in the past, and recognized the serious position into which the country drifting, it might have been possible the to avert the present danger.",66

286,Mr MANN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"If the honourable memreadber has as little knowledge of finance 1 economics as his interjection indicates, he is not fit to be in this House. The greatest financial difficulties face the people of this country today.

288,Mr MANN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I am endeavouring to show why this reduction of direct taxation is not justified. To-day there is an insistent demand for a reduction in the cost of living, but the Government is doing practically nothing to bring it about. It of claims to bedoing so by this income-tax reduction, but this reduction will have 110 more effect - on the 'general burden - of high 'costs than have previous reductions. There will still remain burdens of indirect taxation to weigh the people down. I cannot help feeling that the Government is showing almost a callous indifference to the troubles of the people when it .goes on piling up expenditure, and 'embarking on schemes which necessitate a large revenue and additional taxation. There is no indication anywhere of an intention to shorten sail. If the Government, wishes to relieve the burden of taxation and reduce the cost of living, let it do so in the most effective way, and that is by reducing indirect taxation. ""While I am not in favour of this bill, I recognize that it is useless to oppose it, because the Government has its majority and will put it through. We can, however, register our objections to the Government's proposals.",66
289,Mr THOMPSON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,The honourable member can vote against the bill.,67
290,Mr MANN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I am prepared to do so. If the records of this House are searched it will be found that I have voted in accordance with the way I have spoken more often, perhaps, than any other honourable member. I have never been afraid to back my opinion by my vote, even if, by doing so, I have been placed for the time being in an apparently anomalous position.. The Government should reduce the high customs duties. The burden imposed by customs taxation is not represented merely by the actual amount of revenue which is received by the Government. In the case of income taxation the burden on the people is represented roughly by the amount of revenue which the Government collects, but that is not. so with the customs taxation. In addition to the amount^ of revenue derived from customs duties, there is a huge, and often little realized, indirect, burden laid upon the people, which has been calculated by different authorities to be from four to seven times the amount of the revenue collected. When the Government collects £40,000,000 or £45,000,000 from the people in customs duties, it represents an actual burden upon the country of £150,000,000 or £160,000,000 a year. When a ' Government, insists upon 6,000,000 people bearing so great a burden as that, it surely indicates a callous indifference on its part to the people's needs. Instead of reducing in'conie taxation, the Government should cut down the customs duties. For every £1,000,000 reduction in the customs daties, the people would be relieved, even upon the most conservative estimate, of a burden amounting to £4,OOO;OO0. I '.recognize that as the Government has huge commitments-som e of its own making-for which it needs a big revnue, we should be careful not. to reduce taxation too quickly. The process should be gradual. If the Government wishes to secure a minimum reduction of revenue, with a maximum amount of relief to the people, it can do so by reducing indirect taxation. An honourable member has asked what serious crisis is ahead of us, and why we should use the argument of stern necessity when advocating economy. In the Sydney Morning Herald of this morning, there is a very striking testimony, one o£ a long list of such testimonies given iin this country for some time past, ',to the pernicious effect of the present system of taxation. It is because of the evils pointed out by this article that we are required to raise such a huge revenue. I shall read a paragraph from the speech of the President of the Bank of New South Wales, which . held its annual meeting of shareholders in Sydney yesterday. The President saidThe drain on local funds by Government and municipal borrowings appreciably affects the accumulation of deposits, and in turn the funds available for advances, and I desire to state here most emphatically that this continuous drain on our natural resources by the Government throughout Australia must be stopped if the country is to make headway, for it must be apparent to our thinking public 'that if the Governments persist in the policy they have pursued t""he last year or so of diverting whatever moneys they can collect to their own use, to the detriment of our grazing, agricultural and commercial development, so will they undermine private enterprise, which is the life-blood of advance : ment in all progressive countries. That is the utterance of a responsible man at the head of one of our largest financial institutions. He does not stand alone. Similar warnings have been given again and again, yet the Government continues its reckless expenditure, making still further demands upon the people for funds with which to foster this or that enterprise of a socialistic or paternal character. One would think that in the face of these warnings the Government would realise that it was high time to shorten sail, but, in yachting parlance, instead of taking a rest, it is still running with the wind, with ringtails and spinnakers set, as if indifferent to the rising wind and the leesbore looming ahead.",67
291,Mr ABBOTT,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,Will the honourable member mention one instance of reckless expenditure?,68
292,Mr MANN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I should have been glad to go into this matter in detail if I bad been allowed to speak on the budget, but the honourable member, baving bad his innings, was amongst those who refused me an opportunity to speak. The reduction of the income tax and the maintenance of an undue proportion of indirect, taxation is not in accordance with the best teaching of economists and business men. The Government in continuing this policy has accepted a very grave responsibility. l*here are many aspects of the matter with which I could deal, but I sball not further detain the committee. I know that for the time being my protest is useless, but it is every man's duty to speak as he thinks. I wash my hands of all responsibility for this short sighted policy. That.the Government bas been aware of the approach of the present financial crisis is common knowledge. Three years ago the Prime Minister informed me that in his opinion Ave were galloping fast towards a serious financial crisis. What has he done to avert it? He is still expounding schemes for expenditure, still creating more revenues, still piling burdens on the people. I can do no more than enter my protest. It may be ineffective, but there is a growing rumble of discontent in the community; the people are becoming alarmed by the fears and dissatisfaction expressed by the press ancl responsible leaders of industry. It would be wrong for me to remain silent and disregard the true interests of this country. It is time we. retraced our steps. Over and over again the Prime Miinster has said Ave cannot do that. That is a declaration of weakness. A strong man, finding that he has made a mistake, Avill retrace his steps, and Avill not be afraid to take the responsibility of advising the people as to the course he considers rigbt and proper. The right honourable gentleman has in some States suggested that be agreed with the policy I have enunciated. He has indicated to the people of Western Australia on several occasions that he considers the present tariff policy is wrong, yet, by agreeing to a reduction of income tax he is shackling the high protective policy more firmly on the people. The idea that indirect taxation can be reduced by increasing customs duties is fallacious, and opposed to all experience. Each increase of tariff duty has been folloAved by a greater volume of importations and enhanced customs revenue. The piling up of duties, instead of reducing customs revenue, bas the reverse effect. We have evidence that this iniquitous policy is beginning to cause financial trouble among those manufacturing industries it is supposed to foster and protect. Yet Ave have before us a proposal to still further extend a system that is already stifling the country, ancl the Government is consolidating the evil by reducing income taxation, thereby rendering liigher tariff duties necessary in order to avoid a shortage of revenue. This policy is opposed to the teachings of experience and the advice of students; but, unfortunately, these matters are not decided after open debate and detailed consideration. During the last three days, Ave have had the rare experience of listening to a model debate, but on a lot of income tax details which, important though they be, are insignificant in comparison with great principles of taxation and general policy.",68

I understand that it is customary for you, Mr Speaker, to call upon honourable members from each side of the House alternately. I have yet to learn that the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) has joined the Labour party, and therefore I contend that the call should have been given to a member of the Opposition. Mr SPEAKER,-The order in which honourable members shall be called upon is within the discretion of the Chair, but the usual practice is to call upon honourable members from each side alternately. Eollowing the speech by an honourable member on the Government side of the House, I called upon the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), because, so far as I have been able to observe, his seat on the Opposition side of the House indicates his attitude to the Government.

I rose simultaneously with the honourable member for Wimmera. I have no objection to you giving the call to him, for reasons which, if I may say so, were sound, but I think that it was a waste of time for the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) to suggest that he bad any claim whatever, because I apprehend that if you had not called upon the honourable member for Wimmera, I might have had a chance.",69

Apparently he refers to the time wben I temporarily sank my own convictions aud drifted with the stream upon which today he is drifting, and evidently will continue to drift. I came into this House as a member of an independent party. In dividually, I adopted the policy that I did not belong to either the Nationalist or the Labour party. That is still my attitude. The policy of this Government, particularly of recent years, has been such that I bave been more often at variance than in agreement with .it. I have taken what I consider to be the honourable course, and have sat on the Opposition side of the House. If I attack the Government I at least do so from the front and not from behind. Surely my position is clearly defined. I take the opportunity of joining the honourable members for Henty (Mr. Gullett), Perth (Mr Mann), and others in the rather unsual course of protesting against a reduction in direct taxation. Since certain of my honourable friends have interjected, I shall recapitumember heading? late the position of the Country party and of the present Treasurer (Dr Earle Page). We have the extraordinary spectacle of the leader of a party pledged to a reduction of customs duty, one who in the past denounced his present colleagues and leader for extravagance, piling up an enormous revenue in the .form of taxation from customs and excise duties. In 3 922 the Treasurer declared that the then Treasurer-the present Prime Minister-wa s actually budgeting to receive more from customs and excise revenue than had ever previously occurred. The amount that year was £27,000,000. Now we have the same honourable gentleman (Dr Earle Page) budgeting for £44,800,000 from the same source! I reiterate, for the purpose of emphasizing it in Mansard, that we' have here a party pledged to the^ reduction of customs taxation budgeting for the highest customs taxation on record, and at the same time reducing income tax, land tax, amusement tax, and other forms of direct taxation. And that party allegedly regards customs taxation as one of the most pernicious forms of taxation extant. I invite any honourable member of the Country party to deny that he has pledged himself against increasing customs and excise taxation.",69
308,Mr THOMPSON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,We are not pledged to do that.,70

I did not intend to speak at such length; but my friends, by their interjections and hostility, have encouraged me, for which I thank tbem. I shall take an early opportunity to give them some more home truths upon the tariff issue and the taxation derived from that source. These enormous receipts from customs and excise satisfy neither the protectionist who wishes to prevent goods from coming into Australia, nor honourable members like myself, who object to such a form of taxation. For that reason I protest against the principle involved in the present reduction when it means a continual increase of customs and excise taxation, which is the most obnoxious of all forms of taxation to the primary producers.",70

At the same time, I ask the honourable member to address the Chair, and develop his own line of argument without turning to honourable members individually and practically challenging interruptions from them.",75
368,Mr THOMPSON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Wheneve r there has been an increase in the tariff, there has been a substantial increase in the revenue derived by the Government from customs duties. How can honourable members expect that there will be less revenue when the customs duties are increased? Failing the remedy which the honourable member for Henty said he had, when, speaking the other night, wby should the Government reduce indirect taxation ? All the newspapers throughout Australia have been shrieking for a reduction in direct taxation. Probably 90 per cent, of t.he small wage-earners of the country pay no direct taxation at the present time. A few years ago the payment of a few pounds' income tax by the small wage-earners was looked upon as a great hardship. That burden has now been removed by raising the statutory exemption. It cannot be said, therefore, as was claimed by the honourable member for Dalley, that the Government proposes to relieve the wealthy of taxation at the expense of those wbo are less well off. Tbat is a most unfair statement to make in view of the record of the Government.",75
369,Mr THEODOBE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I said that there were 10,000 taxpayers whose average income was £5,000 a year, and who would each be relieved by this reduction to the extent of £191 a year in taxation.",75
370,Mr THOMPSON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,Many of the taxpayers referred to have their money i i vested in enterprises which are vital to the welfare of Australia. A reduction of income tax does not necessarily benefit only a few wealthy persons living on private means. It benefits principally small companies. The great majority of companies operating in Australia are not wealthy.,75
371,Mr THEODOBE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I referred to individuals, not companies.",75
372,Mr THOMPSON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Many of them, nevertheless, have their money invested in shares, from which they derive their incomes. That is the usual form of investment in Australia. Even if they are relieved to the extent of £190 a year as the result of this proposed reduction it is a small amount when one considers the large amount of capital which they bave invested at great risk.",75
373,Mr THEODORE,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Concurrentl y with the reduction in income taxation, 'there has been an increase in indirect taxation.",75
374,Mr THOMPSON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"If the honourable member can show how we can secure - effective protection, and at the same time reduce indircet taxation upon the wage-earner, I shall be pleased to support him. But although I have been a member of this House for five years, I have not yet heard a practical scheme suggested. The Government has acted wisely in reducing direct taxation at this stage. I disagree with the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) that a great catastrophe is threatening Australia. The honourable member did not indicate the nature of that catastrophe. When I asked him to do so, he said that I ought to know what it was, and that if I did not, I was not fit to be a member of this House. Statements like that of the honourable member are calculated to injure this country by creating a feeling of pessimism. I do not admit that Aus- tralia is in the parlous condition mentioned by the honourable member. But even if his statement were correct, it would still be better for the Government to reduce direct taxation than to wait until disaster overtook us. By reducing direct taxation the Government has lifted a tremendous weight off industry, particularly in view of the fact that all the State governments have increased direct taxation. If the Commonwealth Government, instead of reducing direct taxation, had increased it, the result would almost have been civil war in this country. If the suggestion of the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett), that new direct taxation should be imposed, were carried out Mr GUI.TJSTT - I did not suggest any increased direct taxation.",75
375,Mr THOMPSON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"If the Government decided to sacrifice £10j000,000 through not levying increased revenue duties, and, instead, increased laud and incoine taxation by that amount, the result would be a collapse of the internal credit of Australia. The majority of companies operating in Australia today do not pqy more than 7 per cent, or S per cent. If their income tax was increased enormously, as has .been suggested, they would have to go into liquidation. A.ti the present time one large manufacturing company contemplates going into voluntary liquidation, which would mean throwing 2,000 employees out of 'work. If there was a real danger of that occurring, this Parliament would be justified in taking almost any measures to keep those persons in employment. I regard employment as the greatest stabilising factor in any country. The duty of governments, both State and Federal, is at almost any cost to keep their people employed. There is no better way of doing that than by reducing taxation on incomes. Even if a few wealthy people benefit in consequence, what does that matter, so long as a great majority of the people do so? The worse thing that can happen to the workers of any country is that they be thrown out of employment. It does not matter to them then what in-, direct taxation they have to bear; they cannot keep themselves and have to accept charity. But give men employment at the high wages which rule in this country and under conditions approaching the ideal, and they have very little of which to complain.",76
376,Mr SPEAKER,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,I am waiting for the honourable member to connect his re-' marks with the bill before the House.,76
377,Mr THOMPSON,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I was pointing out that if direct taxation is not reduced, there will be unemployment, and that the worse thing that can happen to any country is for large numbers of its people to be out of work. When workers are receiving high wages, they are not so concerned about the burden of indirect taxation, but it is a different matter when they are out of work. The catastrophe that threatens this country is that of unemployment. If , by reducing taxation, the Government can reduce the risk of unemployment, it will do more to assist the country than any previous Government has done.  sonal explanation. The honourable member for Now England (Mr Thompson) has misrepresented my position as a member of the Country party. I , therefore feel it my duty to make my position clear. I am pledged to a certain fiscal policy, namely, the abolition of protection in favour of a revenue tariff. At every Federal Convention, the Country party has declared itself in favour of the following objectiveCheapening and extending production by a reduction of duties on the staple necessities of the primary producer, and the admission of their implements and tools of trade free of duty when made within the British Empire. The constitution and rules of the Australian Farmers' Federal Organization, provide that among the objectives of the organization is oneTo put into practical effect the platform as promulgated from time to time by the conference of delegates. Honourable members will recognize that during the eight years I have been a member of this Parliament, I have acted consistently with that platform.",76
378,Mr BRENNAN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Batman) [10.37] I do not desire to make a lengthy speech so late at night. In fact-, I come into the debate, as has so often happened recently, as a peace-maker, to pour oil on the troubled water stirred on the other side of the chamber by the course of the debate. The honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) has succeeded admirably in saying very little in a long time. He has proved to demonstration what I have long suspected in connection with this Income Tax Bill - I mention the hill so that my remarks shall not be irrelevant:-namely , that the Country party is not pledged to high duties, to low duties or to middle class duties; to an alliance with the Nationalist party, to its separate entity, to its conjunctivity; or, indeed, to anything on earth or in the heavens above. In that happy position I am prepared to leave him. The position of members .of the Country party is as understandable as it is deplorable. They are as uneasy as they deserve to be. It satisfies me, Mr Speaker, that they have the redeeming virtueMr R. GBEEN - I rise to a point of order. I understand that we are dealing with a bill for an act to impose taxes upon income. I fail to see the relevancy of the honourable member's remarks.",76
379,Mr SPEAKER,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"So far, the honourable member for Batman has simply been criticizing the attitude of certain honourable members to the bill before the House. If the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Green) had been present during the whole of the debate, he would have beard otber honourable members address the House in a similar strain. So. long as the honourable member for Batman confines himself to that-and I assume he will-h e will be in order.",77
380,Mr BRENNAN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I had not intended to confine myself to that, sir, because I had contemplated saying something about the merits and demerits of the bill. I understand that you, sir, with your usual perspicacity and keen observation of the essentials of debate, pointed out that the honourable member for New England had not up, to that point, which was considerably distant from the point of commencement, touched either the merits or demerits of the measure. The honourable member seems to be suffering from a fatal congestion of mental pabulum. moment of inexcusable weakness he admitted that in connection with taxation bills and all otber matters, he studiously reads all the newspapers. In that regard he reminds me painfully, of the chameleon which changes colour according to the colour placed in juxtaposition to it. If that colour is blue, it becomes blue; if the colour is red, it becomes red. Unfortunately somebody, testing it beyond its strength, placed a tartan alongside it and it burst. That has been the fate of the honourable member. I notice that the Prime Minister has entered the chamber, and I feel very uneasy, because I conclude that be intends either to make a speech or to stop one, and neither prospect is very pleasing to me. Returning to the bill, I am against the reduction of direct taxationespecially that class of taxation which falls, as it should, upon those who by reason of their financial standing are peculiarly able to bear it-at a time when taxation is being added and super-added by the indirect method to those least able to bear it. Wben the budget was under discussion we made frequent requests, backed by strong arguments, for a declaration by the Government"" of what it proposed to do to relieve an admittedly most unsatisfactory financial position. And the answer was, "" Not yet."" Since then, and, indeed, before then, the Government bas taken certain definite courses of action which have been deliberately designed to pile up the burdens of the poor and lift the burdens from the rich. ^",77
381,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I object t.o that statement, and ask that it be withdrawn.",77
382,Mr SPEAKER,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,The honourable member for Batman is within his rights of criticism. What he has said may' be an entire misstatement of the facts$ but be is entitled to state what in his opinion will be the general effect of the Government's policy.,77
383,Mr LATHAM,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Tb e honourable member used the words ""deliberately designed.""",77
384,Mr SPEAKER,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"Eve n so, I think the Attorney-General is being rather hypersensitive.",77
385,Mr BRENNAN,REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO,"I certainly bad no intention to be offensive to Ministers, and least of. all to my fellow unionist, the In a Attorney-General. Whatever may be the intention of the Government, it is a curious and almost sinister fact that ever since this Parliament has been sitting in Canberra, the course of legislation has been directed along the lines I have indicated. Now, in the first definite measure with which the House has been asked to deal since the budget was so summarily and ignominiously disposed of by a deliberate declaration, the burdens are being taken off the rich and retained on the poor.

It cannot be done by the simple method of passingan act of, Parliament which will reduce a certain classof taxation,, while, through the medium of borrowing on the credit of Australia,, we are pilingwith up an ultimate burden which the people of Australia, will have to bear. I said, on another occasion, and I . repeat it. now,, that Australia, is shirking its obligation' to meet its indebtedness. this burden upon itself during, the war.

I express my deep dissatisfaction at the aotion of the Government in. reducing direct taxation and at the same 1 titoe imposing additional indirect taxation of such a heavy nature that it will be seriously felt by the community, I"" endorse the remarks, of the honourable Tnember for Perth (Mr Mann), who pointed out that all 'the leading citizens - of Australia have drawn attention to the dangerous position into which we aTe drifting.

I have no desire to indulge in personalities, as did the honourable member for Gwydir. Most of his remarks were beneath notice*, but he asserted that I had made charges against the honourable member for Rivorwa (Mr Killen), Ae honourable member for New England (Mr - Thompson), and other honourable members individually. The records of the House, whioh I am not permitted to quote, show clearly what I said, and I well remember my statement. It was that those honourable members had been returned on the new State issue, and the tactics of their leader had been such that their efforts were barren of achievement. Later in my speech I said that I did not Maine honourable members in the Corner, because they had been unwillingly dragged along the path. The honourable member for Gwydir inferred that I had - made .personal attacks on the honourable member for New .England :and himself:-, but the records do not bear out that assertion.
