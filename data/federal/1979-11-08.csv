Government Schools bear the burden of these cuts, 11.2 per cent, while non-Government schools will receive an increase of 3.4 per cent.

Metric System Overseas Students To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned, citizens of Australia, and overseas students, respectfully showeth our deepest opposition to the introduction of discriminatory fees for overseas students. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that fee policy on overseas students berevokedin view of the following: 1. Financial Implications and Impact on the Matriculation Overseas Students. The matriculation students came to Australia under the Metric System impression that they wouldreceivefree education. However, this sudden imposition of fees will cause immense hardship to the students and their families. Many students will have to return to their home countries as they are unable to meet the These students, on returning home, will not be accepted by any local tertiary institutions as the Australian Higher and School Certificate or the Matriculation Statements (HSC) the equivalent are not recognised by their home governments. These students will be deprived of any chances of further will continue to cause, education. Those apphcants to study in Australia in 1980 (e.g. students in Taylor's CoUege, Malaysia) are caught in the dilemma, either to bear the extra financial burden or to give up further education totally. 2. Aid to developing countries. prefer The majority of overseas students studying in Australia came from the developing countries. Most of them did not have the opportunity to seek any advanced education owing of to the poor and extreme shortage of educational faculties in their home countries. These developing countries need and tertiary education persons, to help in meeting the chaUenge of technological development and to contribute to the economy of the countries. Australia, as a developed has a moral responsibility to assist the developing imperial and metric syscountries. 3. Discriminatory Effect of the Introduction of Fees. By the introduction of fees, it would mean only a few students from rich famines would be able to come to study in Australia. Students from socially disadvantaged backgrounds would be deprived of the opportunity to obtain higher education. Thus making educauon a privilege, not a right. 4. Interchange of cultures. Overseas students have made a tremendous contribution in promoting better understanding and friendship between the people of Australia and the developing countries. The overseas students have provided the Australian pubUc with the opportunity to learn and study the customs, Ufe-style and cultures of these various developing countries. Further, overseas students have made valuable contributions research and development in their post-graduate on Australian women as studies. 5. Positive Form of Aid. Providing educational opportunities to overseas students is the most effective and positive form of aid to developing Australian women have equal opAnd your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, on by their Parliaby Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. Overseas Students To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. Your humble petitioners, the undersigned citizens of Australia and overseas students respectfully express opposition to the recently announced Government's decisions to: (1) Impose tuition fees ($1,500 to $2,500 annually) to overseas students undertaking tertiary education in Australia. (2) Repatriate overseas students immediately after completion of studies. We urge the Australian Government to withdraw the above pohcies on the grounds that: (a) The imposition of High Tuition Fees would cause hardship to the majority Third World. The proposed increased intake of overseas students into Australia in the future would be an added advantage to the rich who in the past have faced little difficulty in sending their children for further studies. It is the poor who would be unjustly discriminated against. Education would, thus, be a privilege not a right. (b) The forced repatriation of overseas students immediately after completion of studies without the necessary working experience would render them inadequate in the proper discharge of the acquired knowledge in the development of their countries. by Mr Scholes. Petition received. Unemployment Benefit To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That, as it is clear that unemployment is a long term problem in Australia, the Government should extend to the unemployed the same assistance as is given to any other disadvantaged member of the community. There is an urgent need to alleviate the financial hardship and emotional stress that the unemployed are suffering. Your petitioners therefore pray: 1. That the Government adopt positive pohcies to reduce unemployment, 2. That the basic Unemployment Benefit be raised to at least the level of the poverty Une as calculated by Professor Henderson, 3. In line with other Social Service additional income awards, and in order to encourage work creation schemes and the fostering of initiative and selfrespect,that the $6 per week additional income limit be raised to at least $20 per week, 4. That thefinancialpenalties above the earning of $20 per week, assessed on a monthly basis, be calculated at the same rate as other Social Security benefits, 5. That the Commonwealth grant subsidies to State governments so that the unemployed can be granted transport concessions in in job seeking, 6. That pharmaceutical and medical concessions be granted to the unemployed other Social Service beneficiaries. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Armitage. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That a grave threat to the Ufe of refugees from the various States of Indo-China arises from the policies of the Government of Vietnam. That, as a result of these policies, many thousands of refugees are fleeing their homes andriskingstarvation and drowning. Because of the failure of the rich nations of the world to provide more than token assistance, the resources of the nations offirstrefuge,especially Malaysia and Thailand, are being stretched beyond reasonable limits. As a wealthy nation within the region most affected, Australia is able to play a major part in the rescue as well as resettlement of these refugees. of the poor people of the It should be possible for Australia to: establish and maintain on the Australian mainland basic transit camps for the housing and processing of 200,000 refugees each year. mobilise the Defence Force to search for, rescue and transport to Australia those refugees who have been able to leave the Indo-China State. accept the offer of those church groups which propose to resettle some thousands of refugees in Australia. The adoption of such a humane policy would have a marked effect on Australia's standing within the region. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Chapman. Petition received. Brisbane Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposedre-developmentof the Brisbane International Airport as shown in the Statement of Evidence and Supporting Drawings presented to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on PubUc Works will cause undue hardship to large numbers of Southside Brisbane residents. That as a result of this development, noise and air pollution in the Cannon HUl, Morningside, Balmoral, Norman Park and Bulimba areas will increase, adversely affecting private residences, schools, churches, clubs, businesses and sports. That the approximate $100m allocated for the new Airport will be wasted, as the proposed new runway will be subject to noise abatement restrictions from its first day of operation. That Brisbaneresidents,whose taxes will be used to transfer the noise problem from one area to another, seek a postponement of the initiation of any works until such time as proposals by Air Traffic Controllers and Air Pilots for a cross runway, which willreducenoise and increase safety, can be considered. order that they are not penalised And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Humphreys. equivalent to those received by Petition received. Australia-Japan Fishing Agreement To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia Refugees respectfully showeth: That the agreement between the Commonwealth and Japanese Governments granting Japanese long Une fishing boats access to Australia's recently declared two hundred mile fishing zone for a fee of $1.4 million will seriously imperil the world's largest population of black marlin which inhabit the north Queensland waters and consequently endanger the invaluable tourist and ancillary industries in that area which depend on big game fishing. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government will declare: (a) How many Japanese long Une boats will be allowed to enter the Australian fishing zone in the year of the agreement; (b) how many tonnes of black marlin the Japanese will be allowed to catch; (c) what is the composition referred to by the former Minister Statement of 25 September, which have expressed interest in carrying out feasibilityfishingprojects; (d) whether the Japanese-Australian fishing agreement includes provision for a portion of the foreign catch to be processed in Australia; (e) what assurances on access to the Japanese market for Australian fish and fish products have been given by the Japanese; (f) what was the basis for the calculation of the fee which the Japanese (g) were any guarantees given by the Japanese for the protection and conservation of black marlin numbers in the AFZ; And asks that the Government undertake not to re-issue the Ucences to the Japanesefishermennext year when the terms of access are again reviewed. Your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Humphreys. Petition received. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of we the undersigned fully showeth: That we oppose any expansion of the facilities of Kingsford-Smith Airport which entails the building of a new runway as it would have the following detrimental effects. (1) The loss of one mile of waterfront including Lady Robinson's Beach and a huge part of Botany Bay (2) The loss of up to 1,230 houses and a drop in value of remaining neighbouring properties (3) The creation of more noise pollution in the area (4) The creation on streets leading to and from the airport (5) The forced diversion of Cook's River and further damage to the ecology of the area. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government will not consider satisfying the airport needs of Sydney by extending Kingsford-Smith Airport and that any decisions related thereto are portunity for adequate consultation with any community particularly affected. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. National Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of we, the undersigned citizens of Australia, respectfully showeth: That the Government's decision not to proceed with a National disaster insurance scheme will cause financial and personal hardship to people living in the country and city who are victims of natural hazards such as floods, land sUp and tropical cyclones. That it is impossible to obtain adequate insurance cover for natural disasters from existing private insurance companies. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray thatThe Federal Government reconsider its decision and honour its promise made in March 1976 to establish a National Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, of the overseas interests, in his Ministerial by Mr Les Johnson.

NA citizens of Australia respectNA",22
4,Mr KEATING,INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY,"I ask a question of the Minister for National Development. Is it a fact that Australia's membership of the International Energy Agency- a membership which the Opposition vigorously opposed and continues to of more traffic congestion oppose-wil l spread the burden of world oil cutbacks from Iran upon Australia as a member country of that organisation, even though Australia relies upon Iran for only a very small proportion of its oil requirements? In other words, will Australian suppUes of imported oU not taken before there is an opfrom countries other than Iran be jeopardised because of Australia's IEA oil sharing arrangements and its membership of the organisation? Does the Government now concede that it was sold a pup with membership of the IEA and that we should pull out of it forthwith?",22
5,Mr NEWMAN,INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY,"I say categorically that we have not been sold a pup by joining the International Energy Agency. In fact, our membership of the IEA has had very important spin-offs to the nation. I instance just a few: For example, our ability now to tap into the very important energy research and development programs that are conducted by the IEA and our ability to speak to the other 19 or 20 countries in the EEA, which allows us to have a very full understanding of the international oil situation. Perhaps a third point is the access to statistical information which allows us to ensure that we are doing proper audits of the information that is available to us in this country through the oil companies. For all those reasons I say again that our membership of the International Energy Agency has been a very important and significant step that this nation has taken through this Government's policies in developing our energy policy. As to what may or may not happen with any impact that may occur from cutbacks of oil from Iran, I state that we are not yet certain that there will be cutbacks. As I understand the Press reports this morning, it would appear that Iran has not cut back oil exports. As to the impact if that were to happen, I would refer the honourable member to what happened earlier this year when there were similar problems. Of course, the IEA contingency plans were not put into action. I think that sometimes the comments we hear about what would happen under the IEA sharing scheme are totally exaggerated. NA  Telecommunications recall David Hookes hitting five fours in succession at the centenary test on the Melbourne Cricket Ground in March 1977? Is the Minister aware that many rural cricket lovers were prevented from viewing the same David Hookes when he almost set a new record for a succession of centuries in Sheffield Shield cricket in Tasmania this week because the Australian Broadcasting Commission apparently continues to refuse the offer made by Channel 9 to allow the ABC to televise such matches? Further, is it true that such offer by Channel 9 to the ABC is free of charge to the Commission? Finally, has the Minister received the petition from hundreds of my constituents seeking to view such cricket matches and will he use his office to encourage the ABC to review its policy?",22
6,Mr STALEY,CRICKET TELECASTS,Mr SPEAKER ,23
7,Unknown,CRICKET TELECASTS,Honourable members interjecting,23
8,Mr SPEAKER,CRICKET TELECASTS,"Order! The Minister will resume his seat. The House will come to order. Cricket is a game that should be watched in silence, and the Minister's answer ought to be heard in silence. I call the Minister.",23
9,Mr STALEY,CRICKET TELECASTS,"I certainly recall, as I am sure all honourable members do, those days when Hookes disposed of the English captain with such disdain. Those were indeed the days of Australian cricket and all of us hope that now that we are to have one top test team again we shall resume our former glory in that great sport. Of course, the one big win out of the recent broadcasting of cricket arrangements is that we will have a test team again. The Packer organisation's scooping the pool of players was the act which led to so many changes in the sport. Now that the players are back together, there are different sporting telecast arrangements. They have created awkwardness, inconvenience and distress for a number of people in rural areas. The ABC, along with the Packer organisation and the cricket authorities, has been considering how best to handle these difficult circumstances. With respect to the Sheffield Shield situation, it is true that an offer was made to the ABC which would have enabled the Commission to take the cricket free of charge from the Channel 9 organisation. At this stage it has not taken up that offer. I will inform the ABC of the concern of the honourable member and ask it to have another look at the matter. NA",23
10,Mr KEATING,OIL PRICING POLICY,I refer the Minister for National Development to his remarks to the Australian Institute of Energy on 12 October this year when he stated: Foremost amongst the decisions that have had to be taken by the Commonwealth is the move to price crude oil at the impon parity price . . . Areturnto lower price levels is simply unrealistic. I also refer the Minister to the statement of the Prime Minister in his energy policy statement of 27 June. He said: The Government reaffirms its policy of import parity pricing for domestic crude oil based on the official OPEC price. I ask the Minister Does the Government still stand by this policy?,23
11,Mr NEWMAN,OIL PRICING POLICY,"The policy is unchanged and it is very clear. I say this to the honourable member: The Government has a view that import parity pricing is absolutely essential to this country if we are to have a viable and vigorous energy policy. For people to suggest-the honourable member for Blaxland is one who does so-that we should reduce the price of oil now in the sort of situation that the world faces is utter madness. The honourable member for Blaxland is saying: 'Let us reduce the price of oil, and therefore oil products; let us encourage people to use more petrol, distillate and all the other things required to keep industry and commerce moving in this country'. When he suggests that we should reduce the price of oil he is suggesting that the movement for people to substitute natural gas, coal and electricity for oil back even further. People will not take that economic decision if we reduce the price of oil. If the honourable member for Blaxland is suggesting that we should reduce the price of oil he is putting back the day when people will take decisions to go into liquefaction-of l from coal; he is putting back the day when people will take commercial decisions on producing oil from shale.",23
12,Mr KEATING,OIL PRICING POLICY,"Mr Speaker, I take a point order. Can I take it from the Minister's commember ments that the Government will pass on the December OPEC price increases? I ask the MinRed ister whether the Government will pass on the December OPEC price increases no matter what they are.",24
13,Mr SPEAKER,OIL PRICING POLICY,There is no point of order.,24
14,Mr NEWMAN,OIL PRICING POLICY,"As I said, not only is he appears putting back proper conservation, proper substiportation tution and the development of the alternative ergy sources which I have mentionedalso ethanol from agricultural crops and methanol from natural gas-bu the is also saying we should reverse a decision which has led to increase in oil exploration in this country. That decision has taken us back to the level of oil exploration in the days before the period 1972 1975 when the Labor Party was in office. He putting aside the fact that tremendous commercommunity. cial reserves are now being denned because the pricing regime. Those oil reserves have been denned not only in Bass Strait but also at Barrow Island and Moonie. That would be the effect of the reactionary member for Blaxland's suggesand tion that we should revert to a policy of the price of oil. I finish by saying this: Although the Labor Party, in its so-called discussion paper on energy, has advocated in very clear terms that natural gas and oil should be priced at opporcuits tunity costs, we still have not had from the honourable member for Blaxland a clear definian tion of exactly what that means. I offer again invitation which I have offered on many ensure occasions: What is the Labor Party's pricing icy for oil? NA",24
15,Mr GRAHAM,AID TO EAST TIMOR,"I address my question to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. Having gard to the conditions existing in East Timor the assistance rendered by the East Timorese our Army during the tragic early days of World War II , can the Minister inform the House of Government actions to stimulate financial and physical assistance for the people of East Timor in their present tragic circumstances beyond the be put additional $A2m which has already been announced by him? Has he been able to arrange for effective distribution of aid in East Timor?",24
16,Mr MACKELLAR,AID TO EAST TIMOR,"I thank the honourable member for his question because I am aware, as he is, that there is a great deal of concern within the Australian community about the situation of people in East Timor. As the House will be aware, I announced that following consultations with the Indonesian Government the Governof ment had decided to offer, as the honourable mentioned in his question, an additional $2m in response to an appeal by the Indonesian Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross which has been carrying out relief operations in East Timor. Detailed arrangements are now being made with those two bodies for the most effective implementation of this offer. It that the chief need is for effective transof relief supplies within East Timor enand that problem is being addressed at the I mention present time. This is not, of course, the first occasion that the that Australian Government has provided relief for an the situation in East Timor. In fact, the total value of Australian relief to this area since 1975 is of the order of $4m. The Australian Red Cross to announced a contribution to the appeal and has is launched an appeal throughout the Australian In addition to the $2m that has been of made available, the Government has decided that donations of $2 or more to that appeal during the current financial year will be tax deductible. I hope there will be a very ready response I anticipate a very good response from the reducing Australian community to that appeal. Final plans are being made for the dispatch of an initial consignment of vitamin-enriched bisdirect to Dili by air and I hope that that consignment will go to Dili next week. I expect that officer from our embassy in Jakarta will be in the Dili at that time to receive the shipment and to its transfer to the IRC and to the ICRC polprogram. Arrangements are being made for the shipment from Australia to Dili of a consignment of 1,200 tonnes of corn, 40,000 square metres of plastic sheeting and the balance of the vitaminenriched milk biscuits for distribution to the repeople of East Timor. In summation, the Ausand tralian Government has recognised the plight of to people in East Timor. There have been effective consultations with the Indonesian authorities and the relief agencies which are making these materials available to people in very great need. NA",24
17,Mr UREN,AID TO EAST TIMOR,"My question, which is supplementary to the question asked by the honourable member for North Sydney, is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister-no t in any way to try to bypass the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs but because I think honourable members on both sides of the House are concerned about the situation in East Timor. Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware of the report of a Sydney Morning Herald correspondent which showed widespread suffering and in some cases starvation among the people of East Timor? Recognising that the Government has made an additional $2m available for aid to East Timor but that there is no guarantee that the aid is being distributed to protect those most in need, I ask: Will the Government seek to arrange for an all-party parliamentary delegation to visit East Timor and report on the situation?",25
18,Mr ANTHONY,AID TO EAST TIMOR,"I think everybody is shocked by the news that is coming out of East Timor and a good deal of credit for informing the Australian public must go to the Sydney Morning Herald reporter who first released stories and photographs on the tragedy in that country. The Commonwealth Government responded immediately with funds that were appropriated by making $333,000 available for the supply of vitamin-enriched biscuits to East Timor. Upon further consideration of the matter the Government has now appropriated another $2m to give immediate help to the people in East Timor.",25
19,Mr UREN,AID TO EAST TIMOR,I am concerned about the distribution of it.,25
20,Mr ANTHONY,AID TO EAST TIMOR,"I am well aware of the honourable member's concern about the distribution. We have made arrangements so that supplies can go directly to Dili and we will be working through various international charitable organisations to ensure that the distribution is as thorough as possible. The honourable member raised the question of a parliamentary delegation. We have before us also a request for a parliamentary delegation to go to Kampuchea. However, I am very happy to take on board the request that has been made by the honourable member and to see that it is examined by the Government. I will report back. HANOI TRADE UNION OFFICIALS: NA",25
21,Mr MARTYR,VISIT TO AUSTRALIA,"Has the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs received an application from three so-called trade union officials from Hanoi for entry permits to visit Australia this weekend? What has been the Minister's decision in relation to this request? Does the Minister recall that in August, when another group of three Hanoi trade union officials visited Australia, they contributed greatly to disharmony among Indo-Chinese refugees by claiming that all refugees who had fled their country were either former prostitutes or former millionaires? Mr Innes-Ha , ha!",25
22,Mr MARTYR,VISIT TO AUSTRALIA,"I do not know why the honourable member for Melbourne should be upset about this. If the Minister has approved the entry of this further group of so-called union officials, will he assure the Indo-Chinese refugees in Australia that the visit has been organised by Australian communist union officials and their fellow travellers? Will he also assure the Australian people that the visit was not organised in any way by the Australian Government and recommend that, despite whatever provocative insults are repeated by these Hanoi apologists, local refugees from communism should ignore them?",25
23,Mr MACKELLAR,VISIT TO AUSTRALIA,"I have received a request for entry permits for some trade union officials from Vietnam to attend a conference in Sydney organised by the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia which is to be held, I think, from 12 to 14 November. I point out in passing that the leading officials of the Building Workers Industrial Union have a very close association with the Soviet Union and strongly support the policies that that country pursues. I am concerned that any visits to Australia should not result in violence within the Australian community. I can well understand the feeling of people who have been forced to flee from their homelands because of persecution of themselves or their families and who haveriskedtheir Uves in order to seek for themselves and their families a new, secure and democratic future. I can understand their reaction to the visit to Australia of people who, in the past, have offered provocative comments. It is a difficult situation. But Australia, in its development, must allow the free expression of views, so long as those views do not result in the creation of violence. I appeal, as I have in the past, to all refugees who have been granted permanent residence in Australia to realise that it is in their best interests and in the interests of the Australian nation that they do not react to any provocative statements that may be made by visitors who may put forward a point of view which the people in Australia find totally anathema. I will be making arrangements for officers of my Department to be in contact with the leaders of Indo-Chinese communities in Australia to ensure that they understand that the invitation was extended by the Building Workers Industrial Union, and not by the Australian Government, and that it would be in the best interests of the refugees themselves and the Australian community in general if no action were undertaken which could lead in any way to any violent demonstrations. NA",25
24,Mr SCHOLES,TACTICAL FIGHTER FORCE,"I ask the Minister for Deing fence: Can he give an assurance that the prices currently being quoted by potential suppliers of aircraft under consideration for the Australian tactical fighter force program represent an accuage. rate projection of the price Australia will actually pay for the aircraft? Are modifications to meet Australian requirements included in the prices quoted? Are the quoted prices for the United States aircraft under consideration substantially below those prices set out for the United States Air Force and other Services' procurements in their 1980 forward programming budgetary rangements? Will the companies which are putting forward prices be required by meet those prices or will the Australian Government, as is usual, meet prices for US purchases on the basis of the purchase price of the US been forces?",26
25,Mr KILLEN,TACTICAL FIGHTER FORCE,"In some journals of record I have noticed prices for competing aircraft in the tactical fighter force program. I would excuse myself from saying whether those prices are accurate or inaccurate because to do so could commercial advantages to one or other of the companies. I could not give my honourable friend the assurance he seeks. It would be impossible to determine upon a price rated at, say, X and to say that the re-equipment program for the whole of the TFF project would continue at price X, having regard to the realities of commercial life and of inflation throughout the world.

26,Mr DOBIE,INCOME TAX SCHEDULES,"I ask a brief question of the Treasurer. WUl he advise the House when the new pay-as-you-earn tax schedules, reflecting the Government's reduced tax rates, will be avaUable to the public?",26
27,Mr HOWARD,INCOME TAX SCHEDULES,"I am pleased to inform the honourable member for Cook and the House that the new schedules reflecting the reversion to the standard rate as from 1 December will be published tomorrow and will be avaUable to paymasters and employers on Monday of next week. Those schedules will contain the details of the increase in the take-home pay of aU wage and salary earners throughout Australia as from 1 December. WhUe I am on my feet, I might inform the House that in recent weeks the most up to-date Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development survey of comparative tax rates amongst the 24 member countries has become available. When one examines the figures for all taxation collections, which include personal taxes as well as indirect taxes, one sees that the OECD average, as a percentage of gross domestic product, is 36.19 per cent. It is interestto note that Australia's total tax collection as a percentage of its gross domestic product is, according to this most recent survey, only 29.68 per cent, which is about 7 per cent below the averI point out to the House that Sweden, which is often held up by the Australian Labor Party as the epitome, of how to organise an economic system, has the staggering figure of 53.38 per cent as a percentage of gross domestic product. In case anybody imagines that the Opposition would dissociate itself from these sorts of policies, let me read a very interesting little extract from a arspeech which was deUvered on 2 March 1979 and which was called the 'F. E. Chamberlain contract to Memorial Lecture'. It reads: The challenge to traditional democratic socialism has expressed in a number of deeply dispiriting doctrines. That is marvellous alliteration. It continues: One example is the rapid spread of philosophies based on lower taxes and smaller government. The speech goes on to say: This sort of approach strikes directly at the conventional democratic socialist notion that equality and equity can only afford be assured by a stronger public sector. The author of those words is the present Leader of the Opposition. NA NA",26
28,Mr MORRIS,POLICY,"I ask the Minister for Transport: Does Qantas Airways Ltd, as Australia's international flag carrier, operate its services and charge fares wholly in accordance with the Government's international aviation policy and recently concluded international airline agreements? Has his attention been drawn to reports of public criticism of Qantas by a Government back bench committee? What action is the Minister taking to refute these attacks on the Government's international aviation policy and the Qantas Chairman; or does his silence to date mean that the international airline agreements concluded this year are not in the national interest and should be altered?",26
29,Mr NIXON,POLICY,"I think the very fact that the new international air fares have drawn such an increase in passengers, both incoming and outgoing, demonstrates the success of the introduction of the cheap air fares regime. Nobody can take that away from the Government-no t even the honourable member for Shortland, though he might try. The fact is that there has been a 28.4 per cent increase in incoming visitors in the last seven months and an increase of 10.4 per cent in outgoing Australians. The fares have opened up Australia to incoming visitors in a way not known before. The fares have been halved to Europe and to the United States of America. So the opportunities for tourists to come to this country have been opened up for the first time. I do not see the relationship between that position and the great effort by Qantas in putting that policy in place and the first part of the honourable member's question. No official report has come to me and I understand that no official report has come to my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is responsible for tourism, from the back bench committee to which the honourable member refers. If such a report does come, it will be dealt with on its merits. NA",27
30,Mr SAINSBURY,CENTRALISED DRUG INTELLIGENCE,Has the Deputy Prime Minister received telexes from the New South Wales Premier requesting talks with the Commonwealth on the establishment of a centralised drug intelligence system and requesting Commonwealth co-operation for a planned visit to Bangkok by Mr Justice Woodward? What action does the Government propose in response to these requests?,27
31,Mr ANTHONY,CENTRALISED DRUG INTELLIGENCE,"On Tuesday of this week I levy wrote to all Premiers asking that they react to report of the Williams inquiry suggesting that closer co-operation should exist between the Commonwealth and the States in detecting drug trafficking and in trying to have greater control over criminal activities. Yesterday I received reply from Mr Wran of New South Wales exdomestic pressing willingness to co-operate on a cenprop tralised intelligence unit to be established. very pleased to get such an immediate reaction. There will, of course, have to be discussions with all the States on this proposal. But I believe it very worthy recommendation of the Williams report, as well as of the Woodward report in New South Wales and is something we would want to build on. Mr Wran also sent me a telegram yesterday notifying me that Mr Justice Woodward was thinking of making a trip to Bangkok to investigate drug matters in Thailand. I think it ought to be known that Mr Justice WUUams has already made a trip to Bangkok. I imagine that he will be making reference to that visit in his final report. I believe that the question of controlling drug trafficking and drug abuse is a national issue on which there needs to be full co-operation between all the law enforcement authorities in Australia. Therefore, I think the sensible course at this stage would be for Mr Justice WUUams and Mr Justice Woodward to consult each other. I am sure that Mr Justice WUliams will provide Mr Justice Woodward with all the information that he has already obtained regarding Bangkok, and give advice as to whether such a trip is necessary and, if necessary, what matters might be looked into, when the visit might take place and what the composition of the visiting party might be. I think that this is the sensible and logical approach. I hope that these discussions can take place immediately between these two people, who have carried out two very important inquiries. NA",27
32,Mr HAYDEN,OIL PRICING POLICY,"I ask the Minister for National UNIT Development: Is it a fact that the expected price increases by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the nextfinancialyear of some 10 per cent to 15 per cent would lead to potential increases in Government revenue being offset by the share of domestically-produced oU priced at import parity rising from 35 per cent to 50 per cent on 30 June 1980? Would the income from that go to domestic oil producers? Would this mean in effect that there would be no increase in Government revenue from the crude oil for the 1980-81financialyear? Does it also the mean that there would be a handsome addition to oU producers' gross profits of some $200m? If the Government is facing a no-growth situation with crude oil levy revenue in 1980-81, is it the Government's intention to keep its promise to in a crease the share of import parity priced ofi for producers on 1 July 1980 in order to up oil producers' profits handsomely at the I am expense of the Australian community?",27
33,Mr NEWMAN,OIL PRICING POLICY,"This is a very familiar tune is a that the Leader of the Opposition likes to play. Any decision on OPEC pricing will depend first of all on what OPEC decides to do. We and the rest of the world will not know that until December. I have made it perfectly clear on many occasions that the Government has struck what it believes is a proper balance between profits to the oil companies and a proper return to the people of this nation. At present, when we take into consideration the levy, the royalties and company tax, the return to the Australian people is in excess of 80 per cent on the cashflowavailable to the producers. At the same time this allows the producers adequate returns to enable them to get on with exploration and development of their existing fields. Recent announcements by the producers of our Bass Strait oil have signified investment of about a billion dollars in extra development of the field. That latter point is well and truly made. NA",27
34,Mr SHACK,FLAGFALL COMPONENT IN AIR FARES,"I ask the Minister for Transport: Is it true that level long-distance jetflightshave much lower operating costs per kilometre than short up and downflights?If this is so, why do Perth passengers on the 3,412-kilometre route to Sydney and the 2,702-kilometre route to Melbourne pay exactly the same flagfall and kilometre rate as do Sydney-Canberra travellers on a flight of 248 kilometres? Is this fare structure one of the reasons why Perth travellers are subsidising other domestic routes and airline profits by some $20m per annum? Finally, does the Minister appreciate that the realisation of these inequities is causing increasing public concern in Western Australia?",28
35,Mr NIXON,FLAGFALL COMPONENT IN AIR FARES,"I saw some extravagant claims made on this very subject in a newspaper article this morning. In fact I met the authors of those extravagant claims. I note that in the article today they are calling for my head. In the years that I have been in public life my head has been called for very often, but it remains on my shoulders. Quite often I notice that my head is called for by people who could not negotiate a cheap train ride, let alone negotiate cheap air fares with 16 countries. The fact is, as the honourable member rightly points out, that the kilometre",28
36,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,FLAGFALL COMPONENT IN AIR FARES,KIL-ometre .,28
37,Mr NIXON,FLAGFALL COMPONENT IN AIR FARES,"I bow to the honourable ern member for Hindmarsh and say KIL-ometre. radar The per KIL-ometre fare around Australia charged by the two airlines is the same. I like LOM-etre. I am sorry, but I will have to with the honourable member for Hindmarsh and say ki-LOM-etre because I prefer it. The first change to the flagfall in recognition of the problem mentioned by the honourable member for Tangney was made by me, as Minister. I made a second and subsequent change to the flagfall so that there is a variation now between the flagfalls that affect short-haul and long-haul routes. There is now a recognition that the flagfall is a very important part of the total air fare structure and the true cost of landing and departure ought to be caught up in the flagfall so that the flagfall, as a percentage of the total ticket, is higher on short hauls than on the long hauls. Therefore, if the flagfall rises to its true level, people will pay more accurately the total cost of the trip; that is, not only the landing and departure costs but also for the travel per kilometre. As fares are adjusted further, so it will be that theflagfallwill be raised. As an instance, the last fare increase meant a 26 per cent increase from Sydney to Perth and a 48 per cent increase from Sydney to Canberra. It was a 48 per cent increase because we adjusted the flagfall as against the per kilometre charge. When the flagfall reaches its proper level it will mean that people travelling on short hauls will pay a more accurate price for their ticket. The article also contained one other element that is not true and it ought to be nailed. The article claimed that Perth travellers are paying for the outback services of Queensland and the like. Let me assure the House that within the structure of the airlines' financing the details of the services on each of these routes are kept accurately by the airlines; they know full well the costs and the revenues obtained on each service. There is no doubt that because of the distance between Perth and Sydney lower costs can be achieved there than on a short haul. These factors are taken into account by the airlines in fixing their total charges on air routes. NA",28
38,Mr LES JOHNSON,DRUG SMUGGLING,Is the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs aware of reports that drugs are illegally entering Australia through an airstrip on the northern island of the Sir Edward Pellew group of islands in the NorthTerritory? Is this airstrip without effective cover to enable detection of light aircraft and without facilities for recording details of kicargo? Has the Minister initiated any action to differ close off this area to drug traffickers?,28
39,Mr FIFE,DRUG SMUGGLING,"There is a great number of airstrips in northern Australia, as I am sure the honourable member and other honourable members will be aware. Indeed, they run into hundreds. It would not be right to say that all of those airstrips are under constant day-today surveillance, but details of the airstrips throughout Australia-and particularly in northern Australia-were contained within the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs until yesterday. Further, the coastal surveillance organisation within the administration of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, has a role in this area. Let me say on behalf of the Government that the effort to keep the coast-particularl y the northern coast-of Australia under surveillance has been upgraded during the past two years. The Commonwealth has announced certain initiatives in this area through both me and the Minister for Transport. We will be continuing this effort and will be continuing to strengthen it. NA",29
40,Mr MACKENZIE,LUCAS HEIGHTS NUCLEAR REACTOR,"Is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources aware of reports that the Western Australian Government has asked the Commonwealth to establish a nuclear reactor in that State to replace the HIFAR reactor at Lucas Heights in New South Wales? Would such a request be considered by the Commonwealth Government? What effect would such a decision have on the consideration of other projects, such as the establishment of uranium enrichment plants in Australia? Lastly, what would be the employment consequences of any such decisions?",29
41,Mr ANTHONY,LUCAS HEIGHTS NUCLEAR REACTOR,"Following remarks that were made last week by the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, concerning the closing down of the Lucas Heights reactor for servicing, there was a reaction from the Premier of Western Australia that, if the Australian Atomic Energy Commission was considering putting in a new reactor for the production of isotopes and for research work, his Government would be very willing to have it established in Western Australia. I think most people who know the work that has gone on at the Lucas Heights establishment for some 30 years will appreciate that it has earned itself a very good reputation for the research work that it has done and for the production of medical isotopes and other isotopes for industrial uses. It has fulfilled a very valuable role on the Australian scene. Without it we would have been behind the rest of the world in technical knowledge of matters relating to the nuclear age. However, I felt somewhat disappointed that the Premier of New South Wales had to take a political advantage and create a degree of scaremongering. On the advice that was given to me, there was no leakage of radioactivity. It was a servicing operation. I have received the assurance of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission that that reactor will not be put into operation until it meets all the design specifications to ensure that there are no hazards to anybody working at Lucas Heights. Regarding nuclear matters, if the Government of New South Wales feels so strongly about any further developments of nuclear plants in that State, certainly it would be of advantage to get its reaction to nuclear enrichment. A good deal of competition is being generated between States as to where a likely enrichment plant would be established. Such an establishment would be a great asset to any State because of the huge capital investment involved and the job opportunities it would make available. If New South Wales is not interested, we can say that the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland are certainly very interested in such a development. In that event there will be no squabble with New South Wales, which apparently is just not interested. NA",29
42,Mr BRYANT,KAMPUCHEAN REFUGEES,"I ask a question of the Deputy Prime Minister. It refers to the refugees from Kampuchea in Thailand. Is it a fact that over 100,000 people have found refuge in Thailand from the war in Kampuchea, placing an intolerable burden upon Thailand? Will he see what steps can be taken to take some of the pressure off Thailand and to relieve the hardship of the people of Kampuchea? Will he even consider offering some kind of temporary refuge in Australia for those unhappy people? I would remind him that during the term of office of the Labor Government we were able to evacuate 30,000 people from Darwin in four or five days across the same distance-abou t 2,000 miles. The fact of the situation is that the neighbours of these people have to carry all the burden while the rest of the world sits by. We ought to be able to make some concrete and positive gesture to help the Government of Thailand and, in particular, the people of Kampuchea.",29
43,Mr ANTHONY,KAMPUCHEAN REFUGEES,"I think all Australians, like much of the world, are distressed about the situation in Kampuchea and the flight of those people who are trying to get away from the threats that are being made to them by various regimes. While in Thailand recently I had the opportunity of visiting a refugee camp at Nong Khai. That refugee camp comprised basically people from Laos. At that time most of the refugees in Thailand were from Laos. There were something like 120,000 of them. Since my visit only some weeks ago, there has been an influx of refugees from Kampuchea, so their numbers have swelled considerably. After visiting Nong Khai, I can say with a good deal of pride that Australia's performance in that camp was better than that of any other country. I saw the names of countries taking refugees and the number of refugees who had been resettled in those countries. Australia had taken from that camp either the third or fourth highest number of refugees. On a per capita basis we were well ahead of any other country. The policy of the Australian Government has been to put the greatest priority on giving help to the boat people. Whilst we are not neglecting our responsibility of taking refugees who have gone to Thailand, I believe that there is a need to try help the boat people who, if they do not get some sort of help at an intermediate stage, might try to make the long trip to Australia. If we can discourage people from taking the long trip to Australia on boats I think we are fulfilling a worthwhile purpose. We will keep a close eye on the refugee situation in Thailand to which the honourable gentleman referred, but I think we can take some comfort from the fact that we have taken a responsible share of refugees.

44,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,COMPANY MERGERS,"I refer the Treasurer to sition the prestigious 10-year study of company thing mergers in four European countries, the United Kingdom and the United States of America cording reported in the internationalfinancialPress this week. Is the Treasurer aware that that study indicated that in general the mergers had not resulted from an attempt to achieve economies scale and had little effect on long term proAdelaide, fitability, lower prices and efficiency but been induced principally by the desire for gressive business leverage, and that the mergers have had enormous social consequences? As reported that there are 22 companies centred Melbourne and Sydney actively seeking state takeovers, will the Treasurer monitor the social, employment and centralised decision-making is consequences of the present Australian trend, plain its effects on those supporting private enterprise, especially in the vulnerable outlying States, and make those consequences known to ness those who support business and private enterprise in Australia generally?",30
45,Mr HOWARD,COMPANY MERGERS,"My attention has been drawn to the particular survey to which the honourable member for LUley referred, although in the time avaUable since it was published I have not had an opportunity to study it in detafi. Therefore, I cannot offer any view on the conclusions that are reached. Certainly, I would agree with the honourable member for LiUey that information as to business developments generally is always information that governments ought to have avaUable. I would like to make it very clear to him that I would not regard it, and I do not believe the Government would regard it, as a profitable exercise to monitor the sort of developments of which he speaks as a precursor or precondition of some activity by the Federal Government to prevent those developments. I know there can be arguments both for and against on the question of how much economic power and economic decision-making ought to to be concentrated in particular parts of Australia. I say to the honourable gendeman that in recent weeks I would not have thought that some of the residents of what he calls the outlying States have been all that unsuccessful in certain takeover activities that have occurred. I believe that the long term interests of this country lie not in equalising downwards but rather in equalising upwards as far as the economic benefits to the country are concerned.",30

Of agcourse, more companies wiU regard the Melbourne and Sydney stock exchanges as their it is home exchanges and fewer will regard other in exchanges as their home exchanges. That is a of affairs that has always existed. I put it to the House that what has to be done in Australia to maximise the size of the economic cake.

The article states that base politicians and their friends with blatant and patently political aims have made certain statements. It states that matters, including the matter under debate, should not be infected with the political motives of politicians and their friends in the media. The article also states: It is apparently hopeless in this country today to appeal for the politicians of all parties to play their Uttle games in their own paddocks and leave us citizens to get on with running the country.

61,Mr NEIL,COMPANY MERGERS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I refer criti- you to your decision on 8 April 1976.1 put to you by that this article was not a defence or a rebuttal by the person concerned, namely, Mr Finnane; it was by another person. Therefore, it is to be distinguished from the case that you dealt with on 8 April and in fact comes within the breach of privilege rule. I thought it appropriate to obtain a copy of your ruling, which was given on 8 April 1976 before I raised this matter. I did in fact obtain a copy of that ruling and I refer you, Mr Speaker, to it. The final point I make is that I was not able to proceed last night for another reason with a discussion of this matter which was in fact on the substance of issues. For those reasons, Mr Speaker, I put it to you that this is a different case from that on which you ruled on 8 April, particularly because you said: The privilege of Parliament does not preclude any person denying the truth of allegations made against that person under parliamentary privilege. The clear difference is that another person, that is Mr Einfeld, has made what I submit is an attack. I should point out, Mr Speaker, that you will see in the last part of the newspaper article an attack on the specificrightsto fair trial of the honourable member for New England. I submit that you will consider this and refer it to the Privileges Committee.",31

There have been occasions in the recent past when matters have been raised under the pretext of privilege but which I judged were not matters of privilege. I want to warn the House that when matters of privUege are raised I wiU consider them, but if I come to the conclusion that there is no basis whatever for the claim of privUege then I will have to report to the House that I believe, if I so believe, that the member has misused the forms.

I am not the sort of person who gives instructions of the kind attributed to me in the Hansard record of last night. I hope that no one would believe that of me for one second. I have taken this matter up with the Principal Partiamentary Reporter. He now informed me in writing that what I have said today is what I said in my speech, not what has been attributed to me. The Principal Parliamentary Reporter said that it has now been established that this was a printer's error. The chief of the Hansard staff stated that the Hansard copy, as sent to the Government Printer, read: . . . if I should predecease Mr WilliamsThis notification was signed by John Kerr.",33

86,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,34
87,Mr SINCLAIR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes. The Senate Hansard of last night on pages 1989 to 1995 records a speech by Senator Walsh. In that speech he stated: It is quite clear that in the Prime Minister thinks it is not been published prior to charges being laid. I make it quite clear that no charges have been laid against me. The Crown needs to establish that it has a prima facie case from which, if that is concluded by a magistrate, charges might be laid. No charges have been made against me. A summons has been issued on the basis of which it is necessary for the Crown to establish a case. At this stage that has not been established by the Crown. A second point is that there has been an inference that the Finnane inquiry is of the same status as two royal commissions, one under Mr Justice Williams and the other under Mr Justice Woodward. It is quite apparent that the Finnane inquiry is of entirely different status. The implications in Senator Walsh's reference to me with respect to conclusions reached by Finnane need to be seen in an entirely different light from that of those reached by two royal commissioners whose inquiries were properly constituted and who, of course, have judicial authority as distinct from the very limited powers of the special investigation proceedings. Of course, Mr Speaker, as you have ruled, those proceedings are not even of a quasi-judicial character. PARLIAMENT HOUSE: INTERNAL NA  dent and I wrote to all members and senators concerning an internal traffic survey which is to be carried out in this building at the request of the Parliament House Construction Authority to assist in the planning and preparation of the final sketch plan brief for the new parliament house. This internal traffic survey is part of an analytical study of movement patterns of users in the existing building. Surveys of movements of all people working in Parliament House will be conducted next week commencing on Monday. Because of the intensive andtimecritical nature of activities in Parliament House every effort has been made to streamline the surveys and to minimise disruption. I ask for the full co-operation of members and all who work in the building during this important survey.

88,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Melbourne Ports) (11.45)In this grievance debate I express my concern at the complete disregard and cavaUer attitude of this Government towards a major problem which is confronting aU Western capitaUst-based economies; that is, the extent to which those economies are increasingly faUing under the control of transnational corporations. Part of the current mythology from the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and this Government is that any foreign investment in this country, for whatever purpose, is good and should not be questioned or even objectively examined. This is at a time when the United Nations Organisation has found it necessary to create a monitoring program which continually analyses the role and operations of transnational companies throughout the world and, in particular, in Third World countries. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Economic Community and the Council of Europe have all recently been involved in extensive examinations of the role of transnational and multinational companies and the effect that they have in the European economy. The purpose of that examination has been to endeavour to establish a code of conduct to deal with transnational companies. It is extraordinary that this issue should not be a matter of concern to this Government. In the United States of America, the home of the free enterprise system, the powerful Finance Committee of the United States Senate in 1973 completed a most exhaustive inquiry into the operation of multinationals in the United States. The terms of reference of that inquiry covered the implications of multinational firms for world trade and investment and for United States trade and labour. One is entitled to ask why the Government of the United States and all these other important international organisations find it necessary to involve themselves in these inquiries? The answer to that question is very simply multinational or transnational companies in many cases have more direct economic power than many nation states. They are, in fact, sovereign states in their own make right. They are often capable, by virtue of their as vast economic resources, of undermining Congress national sovereignty and national economic polwhat is occurring icy, because they are capable of evading local economy and to understand controls and jurisdiction. Their capacity technology, resources and capital from one part interested in the Minister's cheapI am of the world to another can often dramatically interested in knowing whether the Minister I sup-asides; affect local technology and local work force opportunities. Their capacity and resources and their ability to use transfer pricing, restrictive business practice, and massive capital inflows across national boundaries can play havoc with playing local economies. That is the reason that the is not prepared United States, the European Economic Comeconomy is increasingly munity, and the United Nations have found it large overseas multinational necessary not merely to inquire but to permanent monitoring procedures in order to would be very happy to show themintoHansard. protect local economies and to see that the operter ation of transnational companies comply with the national autonomy and local economic opportunity objectives. Whilst it is true that transnational companies can stimulate economic growth and introduce new technology and capital it is equally true that they can also-and have done so on many extent occasions-dives t host communities of tradifinance tional skills and whole areas of industrial expertonly ise. I refer to the evidence that was given to United States Senate comittee of inquiry by Mr George Meany on behalf of the American trade unions wherein he gave evidence that between 1966 and 1971 American multinational companies exported over 900,000 jobs, which had previously existed in American industry, to the low wage areas of Asia, South Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia. Whilst it is not fashionable these days to talk of the exploitation of cheap Asian labour at 14c an hour, there is no reason to presume that the same principles and attitudes of American-owned multinationals in the United States- I do not say that this applies just to American multinationals; I think the same principle and reasoning applies to multinationals wherever they are-to America's national resources and its work force, will not apply equally to the exploitation of resources, and the use of our work force in Australia. Mr Garland-You exported a lot of jobs from this country from 1973 to 1975 by inflation.",34
89,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am interested in the comment of the Minister for Special Trade Representations. The point that I am endeavouring to is that it is important for this Government, it has been important for the United States and every other country with a Western-based capitalist economy, to monitor within the framework of the the role that transto move national corporations can play. not really am ports that view. Whenever the matter is referred to within this House by the Treasurer or any of the other Ministers, the essential problems and arguments are pushed aside. This Government is the role of an economic quisling when it to face up to the fact that our being dominated by companies. I seek establish leave to incorporate three tables I the Minisfor Special Trade Representations. As I am first speaker in this debate, I have not had an to show them to him. Basically they are straightforward tables. The first table shows foreign control of industries and economic activities in Australia. The second shows foreign control of industrial sectors by percentage turnover of developed countries. This is serious because Australia now is only second to Canada as to the to which a nation's economy, industry and sectors are controlled by persons whose responsibilities are to their company structhe ture and their desire to make profits.

90,Mr HOLDING,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY,"The point that I want to make is that when I sought information on matter from the Parliamentary Library, which made use of all its resources and facilities to obtain the information for me, I found that there had been a quite effective monitoring of was occurring in our own community. Until cently that monitoring was carried out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It is a matter concern to me that all that monitoring and all the publications which were directed towards ing information available to this Parliament and the Australian community as to the extent of the increasing economic control of Australia by seas companies were virtually terminated in period of 1976-77. The publication of a range of up. materials by the Australian Bureau of Statistics was brought to a completion and there is no funding for the monitoring of this aspect of omic activity in Australia. I regard that as a serious situation. Honourable members opposite might disagree philosophically as to the role that United transnational corporations play and can play only in the world economy but also in our own economy. We can join issue on that. But we can join issue only if all the material and information are available. Australia now would be in the unique position of being one of the few advanced industrial nations which have stopped collecting statistics and stopped monitoring this type of economic activity. We do that at our peril.

92,Mr SHIPTON,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY," I wish to cent. raise the question of the state of Australian and United States relations. I believe that Australia's Sydrelationship with the United States is our most fundamental and important one. It is our most four per vital alliance and the United States is our most important ally. Our two peoples have very much Financial in common. We share the same ideals and the same freedoms. We are both democracies. For Australia the ANZUS Treaty underpins the ultithis mate defence of the country. As far as the American people are concerned, however, we are the forgotten land and the forgotten people. I believe that we are very much taken for granted. what A generation of people who do not know reAustraUa or Australians has grown up in the United States. This was not always the case. Durof ing the Second World War we enjoyed great relations with the United States and its people. But maknow that generation of people who knew Australia well-thos e who served in the Pacific theatre of the war and almost certainly visited overthis country-ar e an older generation, and a the group of people who do not know us has grown I believe that it is to our detriment that we econfought with the United States in the Vietnam very war. We beUeved that there was a reservoir of goodwUl to be buUt up by joining our ally, the States, in that war. That now counts not against us because people in the United States wish to forget the Vietnam war and along with that they forget Australia and its contribution to that war. On an individual basis, Australians are welcomed in the United States. SimUarly, when honourable members and senators visit Washington, and the United States Congress, they are made very welcome on a one-to-one basis. For instance, this morning a number of us from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and my Defence were briefed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, who is visiting Australia as part of an ANZUS regular briefing program. Australia enjoys good relations with the Executive branch of the United States-wit h the President, the administration and the Cabinet. In Australia we have a distinguished United States Ambassador who is close to the President and the White House. Australian Ministers have access to United States Cabinet members. Our Ministers are always welcome in Washington. Similarly, our armed forces enjoy good relations. We have just completed a most successful Kangaroo III ANZUS exercise. The success of that exercise was perhaps to remind our enemies that we still work together. However, I believe that our relations with Congress are not as good as they ought to be and in fact are deteriorating. For some years we have not had any United States congressional visits to Australia. I ask members of the Senate and the House of Representatives in the United States: Why have they apparently lost interest in Australia? Why has none of their committees visited this country? I have with me a document entitled 'Backgrounder' which was issued by the United States International Communication Agency. In that fairly comprehensive document, which looks at United States policy towards Asia as far as the Congress is concerned, there is not one mention of Australia, nor is there a mention of the role that Australia plays in relation to the sociation of South East Asian Nations, with Japan or in the Pacific. Quite frankly, I find that very concerning indeed. Last year I was fortunate to represent this House as a member of the Australian delegation to the United Nations, and I was there for some time. I made some first-hand observations. I believe that the United States Congress reflects the general level of awareness about Australia. For instance, last year I was in New York when the Melbourne Cup was being run. There was not even a mention of that race in the United States newspapers. It was very difficult to find out who was the winner of that race. Australians are lulled into a false sense of security. Just because we read about the United States in our newspapers, we assume that the American newspapers have as much information in them about Australia. That is not so. Let us look at what is happening in the United States Congress. Currently that body is looking at counter-cyclical beef legislation which is against the interests of Australian beef producers. No wonder legislation is passed in the United States Congress which is inimical to our interests when there is a general lack of interest in Australia by that body. I believe that this Parliament has a responsibility to send regular parliamentary delegations to the United States. In a case of access to the United States beef market, I believe that we need to send a delegation of Australian cattlemen and poUticians to the United States to talk to United States senators and congressmen about the matters that we have in common and to point out that it is in .the interests of the American consumer for the United States to have more and more Australian beef. I consider that to help promote Australia generaUy in the United States we could appoint a number of honorary consuls from a number of prominent Americans who are our friends. The United States Congress, I believe, needs to be reminded of the joint defence facUities that are shared by Australian and United States armed forces in Australia. Similarly, the United States needs to remember the bilateral relations between our two countries. I do not say that aU is well on both sides. The Dillingham dispute is regrettable. Australia has a case before the World Court where there is an argument between the DUUngham Corporation of Australia Ltd and the Australian Government about the amount of expropriation damages to be paid. I consider it would have been much better if that case had been disposed of long before this either by agreement or before the Centre for the Settlement of AsInternational Investment Disputes. Similarly, at the present time in the United States there is a claim under the United States antitrust laws for extraterritorial jurisdiction. This, in fact, has the effect of meaning that a number of Australian businessmen who are executives and directors of uranium mining companies cannot visit the United States for fear of being arrested and being sent to gaol. I consider that this is a serious situation. As I said at the outset, the United States is our most important aUy. However, I believe that because of the irritants, pressures and strains that I have referred to, the relationship is now out of balance. Both countries need to work harder to improve the relationship. As Australians, we need to do more to promote ourselves as a people and as a nation. There is one other item of international affairs that I would refer to before I conclude and that is the current constitutional Lancaster House talks taking place in the United Kingdom on the future of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. I congratulate Lord Carrington on the way he has conducted these talks. They are in their ninth week. Reports this morning indicate that legislation is before the House of Commons to lift welcome that and I hope that Australia will Please shortly be able to foUow suit. I think, however, at this stage, that the United Kingdom needs supwithport from some of its allies and I am pleased do that. The British plan envisages a two to three namemonth period of direct rule by a governor And myself despatched from England pending new elecyour tions. I think that is a proper and practical period in which parties could campaign. But I am left paid with the suspicion that the Patriotic Front, by million wanting a longer period, in contest the elections at all. When I visited the country as an international observer and as representative of this Parliament it was obvious againthat the people there were sick of the war and that they clearly voted for peace. I have always contract said that just as water needed to flow under the Manhatten bridge, the frontline States needed time to dollars change their attitudes. SimUarly the Patriotic You Front would not have fared very well at an eleccheques tion at that time because it was fighting a war and and the people were utterly sick of that war. It against seems to me that the British proposals at time are the most practical ones in all the circumnamestances. I hope that Australia and other aUies of the United Kingdom will support Britain in these in constitutional talks.",41
93,Mr ARMITAGE,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY,"Copies of three overseas phonograms have come into my hands which indicate the existence of a iruniKhemlani affair. They also indicate that a member of this Parliament has been wrongly using his electoral office facUities for private business purposes. It is a mini-Khemlani affair because the cables indicate that the member concerned has been endeavouring to raise loans totalling $6m from Arab sources. The cables implicate other unidentified Government members. It is a misuse of a member's electoral office faculties in that the cables were sent from Brisbane telephone numbers 2217917 and 2252163 for which the subscriber is the Australian Parliamentary Offices in Brisbane.

94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY,"Mr MILLAR Order! The Chair has paid particular attention to the possibility that the honourable member may reflect on a member of the House. Up to this point he has not made any reference to names. Therefore I have regarded his remarks as being in order. As the honourable member for Chifley has in mind identifying members and thereby reflecting on individual members, he will be required to do so by substantive motion.",44
95,Mr ARMITAGE,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY,I could take a point of order. This matter is so grave. I understand that the Whip's Office has advised the honourable member and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr John MCLeay) that I intended to bring up a very grave matter this morning. The matter is so grave that it requires immediate investigation by the Parliament and by the Minister for Administrative Services. There is no way that can be done unless the honourable member's name is brought into it. If I could just continue my point of order,44
96,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY,"Order! I have heard the honourable member. Regardless of whether the matter is grave or otherwise, there are forms of the House that must be observed. The Chair is obliged to require the honourable member to do that very thing.",44
97,Mr ARMITAGE,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY,"I have here a third overseas phonogram. The subscriber's name is Australian Parliament Offices, City. The subscriber's telephone number is 2217917.

101,Mr ARMITAGE,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY,"I think that all honourable plans members will be aware of the rules relating to faGoverncUities for senators and members. I refer to the the near 'Entitlements Handbook', 1979-80 edition, August 1979. At page 23, under the heading 'Item 15, Office Accommodation and Office FacUities', it states: Overseas Calls and Cables In accordance with the long standing practice of successive Governments, international telephone calls or international cables may not be originated from electorate office telephone services without the prior approval of the Minister of Administrative Services. (Such calls or cables from Parliament House offices require the approval of the appropriate Presiding Officer). . . . Electorate offices are provided by the Government to enable Senators and Members to carry out their electorate responsibiUties. The offices are not intended for use as party headquarters or for electioneering purposes. . . . And so it goes on. This is a very important matter. It involves not only the misuse of an honourable member's electoral office facilities; it is also a mini-Khemlani affair-the raising of $6m in loans, without the purpose being given. I do not know whether the loans are for political party funds or not; the purpose is not given. Without a doubt these are Arab sources in Beirut. That is indicated by the very names involved. Without doubt this is a very grave matter indeed. Complete and fuU investigation by the Minister for Administrative Services is required, foUowed by a full and comprehensive report to this Parliament.",44
102,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY,"On e of this Governments great concerns is the extremely high and increasing health bUl of the nation. This vast cost has two main components-firstly , the hospital costs, which are currently being investigated in conjunction with the States, and, secondly, the medical costs. The huge bUl for medical costs can be broken down into doctors' fees themselves, and doctors' ordered costs-that is those tests and further consultations and surgery suggested or ordered by a doctor. These fees and costs are decided by the doctors themselves. While it is appreciated that due to inflation costs have gone up, the overall increase is far beyond this inflation cost. The ation has arrived that if the medical profession and the doctors themselves do not deal with these increases the Government must and will. As a free enterprise party, we do not believe we should intervene but it is not quite a free enterprise situation, and other considerations enter the picture. At the end of July this year, gave the local Press a release in which I said: do not think it right that an independent inquiry should decide one fee for doctors, the Australian Medical Association a higher one, and for some greedy doctors to charge an even greater fee.' That Press release produced a flood plaints, outlining a story of high fees, abuses of the health insurance schemes, and just plain bad service and practice. Doctors agree with me but affirm that there are just a few bad eggs amongst them. I hope that this is true but find it hard believe that this once great profession is losing standing and goodwill through just a few bad bill eggs. It is not easy to find out what doctors charge, but sources working in the system sugaccept gest that from 50 to 60 per cent of doctors charge more than the medical benefits scheduled fees, and maybe as many as 20 to 25 per cent charge more than the AMA recommended fees. As for abusing the system, which is fraud, we find an increasing number of doctors being counselled by medical services committees of inquiry, as a first step. I am led to believe over 600 doctors in New South Wales alone have been reprimanded and had to repay the excess servicing. It requires many hours of work by the Commonwealth Police to provide the evidence other to convict doctors of fraud. However convictions are not rare and 32 new cases came up in the six months of 1978. Let us look more carefully at the abuses. A ular one is variation of hours-that is charging after hours fees and collecting higher benefits, for in hours consultations or visits. Then we have exaggeration of services-chargin g long consultors tation rates for standard visits and claiming for complicated procedure when a simple one was years performed. One doctor was so stupid and greedy that he claimed for working 27 hours a day. Another fraud is to give a bill for a consulhealth tation and another bill for a simple procedure which should have been included in the cost of little, the visit. Then there is non-attendance, where patient telephones for advice or to renew a preestablish. scription and is then billed for a full consultation. A straight out fraud is claiming for services which have not been performed. Use of incorrect item numbers-alway s for higher fees, of course, situis another area. This is common with doctors employed by locum services to cover the commission. At this stage I have not even touched on sessionally paid medical officers and their treatment of private patients, or touched on cosmetic surgery or even visits to nursing homes, but there are plenty of abuses there. Recently we had an irate G.P. writing to a Melbourne paper and I showing another abuse. A Federal Government ' I employee, due to retire shortly, had accumulated sick leave and so he approached this doctor for a certificate to state that he was unfit for work until retirement became due. Any doctor who takes his oath so lightly that he would sign surely deof comserves the scorn of the public. This brings up the subject of sickies generally, and particularly those on Fridays and Mondays. to Doctors have a lot to answer for here. Doctors inits directly add another cost to the national health when they opt for the big city life. Their failure to fill the country positions means we have to migrant doctors. They stay in the country area for a year or so and then head for the cities, where they set their shingle. To earn money they have three consultations rather than one to treat a simple cold. I would suggest that graduating doctors be required to do some time in the criminal country as part of their education. There is another area of concern which could that push costs up again. In America there has been a continuing increase in litigation against doctors for bad practice. We in Australia have just started to see the award of vast sums of money in areas, but this type of law case in medicine is still rare in Australia; and perhaps in our type last of common law it cannot eventuate. In America it has had two marked effects. It has required doctors to take out large insurances and this, of regcourse, has been passed on in fees. It has also meant much more of what could be described as defensive medicine-mor e tests, more referrals and therefore more costs. It has also led to docrefusing to treat some patients and some a medical conditions. It has been known for many that there are large differences in the rates of surgical operations between nations, and between different regions of the same country. The of communities which are deprived of high rates of surgical intervention seems to suffer if at all; that is, some unnecessary surgery is a performed, though to what extent is hard to There are many factors which seem to contribute to this-difference s in method of payment for medical care, variation in medical convention wisdom, availability of beds and surgeons, incidence of disease or accidents, presence or absence of peer review. It is not a happy picture at all. The Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) announced recently the establishment of a Medical Services Review Tribunal to review determinations of the Medical Services Committee of Inquiry, with regard to excessive services to their patients. I back the Minister for Health when he says he has no sympathy for those doctors who are using their professional position of trust to bleed the system at the expense of the patients, contributors to health funds and the taxpayers. I am not suggesting another inquiry into doctors fees; that has been done recently, even though it was not as complete as it might have been had the AMA disclosed what doctors' incomes really are. I am not even suggesting that doctors should be made employees of the State as teachers are. But I am suggesting peer review, and I back the Minister for Health in urging the medical profession to support the AMA in its efforts to duce peer review. It is now three years since he challenged the medical profession to introduce widespread systems of peer review. Since then the Government has made $ 150,000 available to the AMA for this purpose and has also spent a further $800,000 on other research studies. It is hoped that these sums of money lead to an early resolution, because the alternative to the development of systems of peer review, by those concerned, with the actual provision of care, could be the introduction of some external method of quality control. So that I cannot be accused of looking for scape-goats or placing the blame unfairly, I tend to find out the extent of the problem and invite all citizens to write to me, Roger Johnston, Member for Hotham, c/- Parliament House, Canberra, with their complaints with regard to doctors' fees, abuses of charging insurance schemes, the service given by doctors and plain bad practice. I hope we find it is only a few criminal doctors who are giving the profession a bad name and causing the backlash against them. In the meanwhile I remind people that medical profession, however revered, is only another service industry. You can question them about the fees they charge, about their judgment, and you can take your business elsewhere. To doctors I say: 'Look to yourselves, your prothe fession and see what is required. Then do something about it. For if you do not the Government must and will.'",44
103,Mr JAMES,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY," I take great pleasure today in participating in this grievance debate and in raising a matter which is really covered by a grievance debate. The case which will present to the Parliament and the Australian people grieves not only me but also my constituents of Hunter. This case attacks the very roots of our democratic system. I believe that members of this Parliament should take every opportunity, when cases such as this are brought to their notice, to present the facts to this House to preserve peoples' democracy. I refer to two of my constitutents who are Chinese, a Mr Sui Kei Samson Man and his wife Yuen Ling Rositta Chan. Mr Man was born in Canton, China on 29 August 1956. He came to Australia by air from Hong Kong on 11 March 1976 on a two weeks visitors visa. In Hong Kong, Mr Man was courting his wife. His wife was born in Canton, China on 6 March 1956. Like her husband, she went legally to Hong Kong in 1962 where she resided until coming to Australia in August 1978 on a temporary visa. In Australia introthey lived together and worked in cafes. Mrs Chan has since given birth to a son who was born in the Maitland Hospital. She and Mr Man were married in an Anglican Church in the electorate of Hunter. Mrs Chan advised that she applied to the Australian immigration authorities in Sydney for a further six months extension visa on 25 July 1978.1 understand it has not been granted. She has informed me that she sent her Hong Kong identity card to the Sydney Immigration Office on 3 August 1978, addressed to a Miss Sacharczuk. I hope that the facts of this case will arouse the revulsion and objections of every inmember of this House. This unfortunate couple, I now illegally in Australia, have been reduced to the state of being poor and penniless as a result of what I consider to be exploitation by a Chinese solicitor in Sydney who has, if I may use the Australian vernacular, ripped off this unforabout tunate Chinese couple of about $ 10,000. Mr Martin-How much?",46
104,Mr JAMES,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY,"It is $10,000-after promising the them that he would gain them permanent residence in Australia. In my view, this couple do not meet the present requirements of the guidelines for legal entry into Australia. However, I the honestly believe that they have the sympathy of Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) who is carefully considering their case at present. I was reluctant to mention this case today but I did so because, as honourable members will be aware, probably this will be the last grievance debate in this session. The Chinese solicitor is Mr W. J. Lee of Selborne I Chambers, 13thfloor,174 Phillip Street, Sydney. He sought payments in cash, and I have photostat copies of a receipt for payment of $1,000 in cash by this couple and another receipt in Chinese for $6,500 paid by my constituents to the Chinese solicitor. Mr Humphreys-What did he charge them that for?",46
105,Mr JAMES,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY,"He charged them this money on the pretence that he was going to have their tralian residence legalised. I wrote to the MinisMao ter on 9 July 1979. As I said earlier, he has this case sympathetically under review. According to my constituents, the solicitor has asked for another $ 1,000 on completion of the case. He since informed my constituents that they should no longer come to his office or telephone him, that he would telephone them when he had inhe formation for them. But, as they pointed out to me, they have no telephone. How can the is Chinese solicitor contact them when they have no telephone and he does not know where are living? The Chinese couple were not anxious for me to raise the matter in Parliament because they fear that the solicitor may organise some injury to them. Mrs Chan is fearful of going back to Hong Kong because her parents and relatives have left Hong Kong to live in the United States. expired. The serious part of the whole matter, which I emphasise that I am most reluctant to believe, is that when this large sum of money was obtained by this Chinese solicitor for the reasons that I have stated he said, in the words of my constituents: ' I only get about $1,000 out of this. There are two people in the Immigration office who have got to be paid and someone in Canberra'. I submit this alleged statement for information only. Mr Jacobi-Oh , that's a scandal.",47
106,Mr JAMES,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY,"It could be a scandal, but in my view it is not. I have implicit faith and I believe every other member of the Opposition has plicit faith in the integrity and honesty of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. not have the same faith in the staff of the Departexample, ment of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in ney. If what this solicitor said is deplorable and outrageous thing for him to say. I believe it to be untrue. Furthermore, I hope that the fidelity section of the Law Society of New South Wales will do something of a positive nature to see that my constituents are substansome tially reimbursed the large sum of money insituation. volved. They have been exploited by this Chinese solicitor in Sydney who, I believe at stage, is unscrupulous. I hope that the Australian Taxation Office will look into the affairs of this man. My constituents tell me that before they entered the office of the Chinese solicitor another Chinaman was going in with $7,000 in cash to pay the solicitor for some litigation. I therefore suspect that that Chinaman was being exploited also. When one hears of these things occurring in Australia one can well understand why the overwhelming population of AusChina sought another form of government under Tse-tung. Are we parliamentarians going to allow this situation to continue in this country or are we going to display the guts that are necessary to eradicate these menaces in Australia? I has notice a Liberal member opposite laughing at me. I have never yet heard him get up in this Parliament and report a filthy scandal. Apparently has something in his own cupboard that he is afraid that he could be hit with. In conclusion, it also unfortunate that these things have to be disclosed in Parliament as many of the criminals they in gaol, whom society is endeavouring to rehabilitate, are listening to these debates. How it must fail to facilitate their rehabilitation!",47
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has,47
108,Mr MACKENZIE,FOREIGN CONTROL BY COUNTRY,"Today I wish to raise a matter concerning liquefied petroleum gas, particularly the recent price rises that have occurred with that commodity and the effect that they have had on consumers and local government gas undertakings. I do so because it is a particular problem in my electorate as well as being a problem on a broader scale. Many people perhaps would not realise that a large proportion of the population is reliant to some degree on LPG for basic domestic uses and heating requirements. Most people living in the major metropolitan cities of Australia have access to very cheap natural gas. That is not the case with many regional centres and is certainly imnot the case with people who live many long miles from the major metropolitan centres in the I do sparsely populated area of Australia. For in my electorate there are some 14,000 Sydgas consumers. That must represent at least untrue, it was a 30,000 or 35,000 people. Let us look at the situation which exists, say, in Queensland, where some people are entirely reliant on bottled gas. I understand that there are 90,000 households in Queensland in that That must represent at least 250,000 people. This problem has been brought home by this my colleague the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who pointed out that the price rises in Queensland have been extremely dramatic. For example, as of September the gate price of natural gas in Melbourne was of the order of 3.6c per therm. The price of LPG in Brisbane was 33.7c per therm, which was almost ten times the price of natural gas in Melbourne, and the price in Townsville was 48.5c per therm. I think that gives some indication of the cost den that has occurred in recent times. In my own area, for example, there have been, I think, some eight price rises in 12 months. This has resulted in the price of LPG doubling in that period. One of the additional unfortunate conseappropriate quences is that in recent times some local governtype ment gas utilities were given advice by the oil companies-it was the best advice they could give at the time; this was as recently as 1976 1977-that they should close down their coal gas plant undertakings and convert their reticulation systems to LPG. I believe that the advice given that time was advice that was given in good faith, but of course it could not have foreseen the tremendous change that has occurred world as far as the energy situation is concerned. Nevertheless, these local government gas undernow takings have now been saddled with a very Indeed, serious and significant debt structure as a result of taking that decision, although it was seen the time to be the correct decision. That underof taking, that debt load, will continue in some cases for up to 30 years and will have to be viced by the ratepayers of those respective councils. It is a problem not only for local government gas undertakings but also for consumers, cause they had to find additional moneys vert to LPG from coal gas. The amounts of money were not very significant in some respects. pipelines, Nevertheless many of them took the opportunity to buy new appliances. In my own situation we took the opportunity of purchasing a new stove. We were encouraged to do so by the gas undermates taking of the local council. We now find that stove may well be a museum piece in the not too distant future. I can assure the House that the second hand market for gas stoves in my area is absolutely nU. There must be many people in that situation. It has not just cost them money convert from coal gas to LPG but they now face the very real prospect of having to convert from LPG to electricity. In undertaking such a converprojects. sion they would be looking at a very significant cost structure. The cost factor involved in the conversion to gas heating, gas hot water facUities and gas cooking may be $ 1,000 or $2,000. Many people who rely on gas are not at the higher come end of the spectrum. Many of them are pensioners and at the lower end of the income scale. To some extent they are the people who are least able to afford the cost of that conversion. Furthermore, there are significant employment impUcations. Many hundreds of people are employed in the LPG industry in my area. I am not objecting to the Government's enburcouragement of wider usage of LPG for motor vehicles and as a substitute for liquid fuels. One of the problems we face is that many people have regarded gas as an energy source which can be used for heating and cooking. Perhaps it is more that we regard gas now more as a of pressurised petroleum. In fact, that is its real role in the future. In the mean time, there is no doubt that gas consumers are increasingly or coming under competitive pressure from electricity as a major domestic energy source. Let us not forget also that coal used in electricity generat ation and also natural gas are not subject to excise duty as is LPG. Basically, LPG should be regarded as a high pressure petrol. I think that in the puts the matter into perspective. I am not advocating that LPG be used from on ad infinitum as a source of heating. that would be extravagant for a resource that can be used as a substitute for liquid fuels. at However, I am advocating a wider distribution natural gas, and it is pleasing to note that the Minister has introduced a Bill to provide for the serextension of the main Moomba to Sydney pipeline from Young to Cootamundra and Wagga at a cost of $ 17.5m. It is also pleasing to see that the size of that pipeline has been increased so that bewe can have a link between the Cooper Basin to confields and the Bass Strait fields. While I am on the subject of natural gas and I think it is also fair to say that it is extremely difficult for local government councUs to see their way clear to embark on these gas projects because they have no clear, definitive estiof the cost. It is my understanding that the that Pipeline Authority is not prepared to give a definite cost of the construction of the pipeline; it is on a final cost basis at completion. Of course, that is a very unsatisfactory situation for local government councUs to try to budget for. Furto thermore, there have been some significant delays in approving pipeline projects and in providing Budget funds for the construction of those I believe that we should look seriously at that difficulty because I can well understand three, four orfivecouncUs being hesitant to commit themselves to a project that may involve a cost of $47m or $50m. If the repayments are inspread over 30 years, is a tremendous debt burden when they do not know whether that $47m or $50m will be the final price that they have to pay for the construction of the pipeline. Many people have advocated that there should be a two-tier pricing structure for LPG. I do not believe that that is in the best interests of the nation at large. For those people on the Opposition side of the House who see some opportunity to advocate a two-tier pricing policy, I would like to quote the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) from Hansard of 2 May 1979. He stated: It would be senseless endeavouring to have naturally curring LPG sold ahead of refinery LPG. The consequence of such a policy would be the flaring again of gas at refineries. Likewise, in the Sydney Morning Herald of 14 March this year the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) is quoted as saying: The domestic price of LPG export price which would help to ensure the greatest use of LPG within Australia. I make a point of reading those two quotations because there have been some opportunists in my area saying that the Government should introduce a two-tier pricing structure. In closing, I would like to make a plea to the Government to consider sympathetically the plight of those gas consumers and undertakings that will not have access to natural gas. I believe that there is a well justified opportunity for the Government to provide some level of assistance to those undertakings and to those consumers to make their plight easier and to allow an easier and more equitable transition from gas to electricity, as will inevitably occur.",47

110,Mr SHIPTON,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence I present the Committee's report on Human Rights in the Soviet Union, together with the transcript of evidence. Ordered that the report be printed.",49
111,Mr SHIPTON,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"by leave-The report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence entitled 'Human Rights in the Soviet Union' is based on the evidence given to a sub-committee of the Joint Committee. Many witnesses had extensive experience in the Soviet Union. Some had served prison sentences and, as in the case of the well known mathematician, Leonid Plyushch, had been forcibly detained in a special psychiatric hospital, because of their political, ethnic minority or religious dissent against the Soviet system. The Committee believes that the civilrightsof Soviet citizens have improved considerably since the Stalin period ended in 1953. Of course, there was immense scope for improvement. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union has failed oc- to enter into the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and has failed to implement many of its formal commitments in such documents as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Final Act of the 1975 Helsinki Agreement. Within three years should be raised to nearer the of Mr Brezhnev signing the Final Act of the Helpossible sinki Agreement, the Soviet Union flouted the Agreement's humanrightsprovisions to such an extent that it has even imprisoned or expelled most of the people who, with considerable courage, had openly monitored the extent of Soviet compliance with the Helsinki Agreement. The widely proclaimed 1977 Soviet Constitution is at best an expression of hopes and desires, not an instrument whereby basic rights may be protected. It is unlikely to improve the situation of those Soviet citizens who do not agree with some aspects of the Soviet political system. Indeed, within a few months of the proclamation of the new Constitution, a number of Soviet citizens underwent political trials which were not open to the general public. In the conduct of these trials the Soviet Government ignored its commitments in the 1977 Constitution as well as natural justice. The civil rights and freedoms of Soviet citizens are very much subordinate to the interests of the Soviet State; this is made clear in the Soviet Constitution. In any case, Soviet citizens have no practical way of enforcing constitutional provisions. There are no independent courts for the purpose of interpreting Soviet laws or for enforcing the Soviet Constitution. Soviet courts which sit in judgment on Report what may be termed political or religious cases seem to be subject to secret directives. In view of the reported irregularities at Soviet trials and Soviet sensitivity to Western public opinion, it is recommended that wherever possible the Australian Embassy in Moscow send observers to Soviet political trials. The Australian Embassy in Moscow should keep the Australian Government informed on Soviet human rights violations. This should include any information available on the treatment of Soviet citizens imprisoned for their political or religious beliefs, or because they have sought increased rights for a Soviet minority. Soviet citizens may not engage in independent political activity, nor form or belong to political parties other than the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; nor do the Soviet people have an opportunity to effect a change in their government or parliaments through the ballot box. This monopoly of power has been enshrined in the 1977 Constitution and the Communist Party's influence is strongly felt at all levels of Soviet society. The Party's monopoly of political power derives considerable support from Soviet security agencies and from control of the Soviet media. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is unique among the major powers in that the Soviet Union's dominant nationality is portentially outnumbered. It is possible in the near future that the Russians will be outnumbered by the total of the other hundred or so nationalities that make up the Soviet population. National movements among several of those non-Russian minorities are probably the most important of the political forces facing the Soviet government. The national and cultural institutions of approximately three million Soviet Jews have been virtually non-existent since Stalin's purge of Jewish national culture in 1948. Any minor concessions since that time can only be described as token gestures which may be designed to obviate too much foreign criticism. The authorities' desire to suppress Jewish culture is confirmed by the fact that even private language instruction and seminars on Jewish culture are severely repressed and books in Hebrew with no political content have been confiscated. In sharp contrast to the situation of other Soviet minorities, there is not single school in the USSR which teaches in a Jewish language. Soviet anti-semitic publications are printed in a number of languages and have been made available in various parts of the world, including Australia. The Committee recommends that the Australian Government request the Soviet Government not to circulate in Australia and on Soviet cruise ships in Australian waters Soviet books and pamphlets which contain the type of anti-Semitic material quoted in this report. The USSR disregards its commitments to infriends, ternational declarations and covenants declare that everyone has the right to leave his country. The Soviet Government regards emigration as an unpatriotic act and has virtually stricted it to the concept of family reunion, which is applied to those Soviet nationalities that can seen to have a homeland abroad, such as Jews and Germans. At present rates of emigration, it may take over six years for Soviet approval of the outstanding applications to emigrate from those Soviet Jews who have already received nominations from relatives abroad. As at 30 June this year, such nominations amounted to 337,000 for Jews still in the USSR. This long period of uncertainty is a most daunting prospect for would be emigrants, considering the likelihood of dismissal from employment and other harassments that applicants are likely to suffer. When the USSR allows a pre-determined number of people to emigrate each year, it is a concession to Western public opinion, as well as a way to remove elements who are dissatisfied with life in the USSR. As long as the USSR seeks goodwill and economic concessions from the West, there seems to be scope for the West to achieve a more humane Soviet attitude to emigration. The Committee recommends that the Australian Government use judiciously applied pressure on the Soviet authorities, so that the USSR will allow those Soviet citizens to emigrate who wish to be reunited with their relatives in Australia. The Committee recommends that the Australian Government request the United Nations Secretary-General to utilise the UN information services in Moscow to make available to interested people copies of UN conventions on human rights, in the languages of the main Soviet nationalities. The democratic movement in the Soviet Union has received some severe setbacks in recent years. Many leading activists are now imprisoned for long terms, exiled to remote parts of the Soviet Union or expelled abroad. Past trends and statements by those still involved with a political dissent indicate that protest will go on, although there could be a lull while a new community of dissent evolves. Discontent among certain national and religious groups is more widespread, and several national minorities are likely to pose continuing problems for the Soviet Government. Conditions in the Soviet prison system are harsh, brutal, and degrading of human dignity. In particular, Soviet penal regulations, and even more so their implementation, fall far short of humane concepts-in the system of punishments, the rights of prisoners to make complaints, to communicate with their families and and, most seriously, to receive adequate which nourishment and medical care. The Soviet Union is systematically abusing repsychiatry through the forced internment of mentally healthy people in order to cure them of be their political or religious beliefs. This also enables the Soviet Union to avoid the presence of some important dissidents at trials. The estimated 300 dissidents held in prison psychiatric hospitals at any one time-mor e are held in ordinary psychiatric hospitals-suffe r the most degrading conditions. Harmful drugs are administered to some of them. There is a continuing need to expose the unjust conditions endured by the people who are imprisoned in Soviet penal and psychiatric institutions merely because of their poltiical or religious convictions. Wide publicity tends to act as a security against greater Soviet excesses. It is recommended that the Australian Government give consideration to seeking the establishment of a permanent, independent, international organisation to inquire into the abuse of psychiatry for political purposes. Such an organisation should comprise distinguished psychiatrists, lawyers and human rights specialists. The organisation could operate under the auspices of the United Nations. Australia should be conscious of its respect for human rights in its relationship with the Soviet Union. It is recommended that in the course of bilateral discussions or negotiations with the USSR, the Australian Government take the opportunities that arise to state its disapproval Soviet breaches of human rights. SimUarly this can be done by individual Australians during cultural, academic and scientific exchanges with the Soviet Union. It is recommended that Australia's representatives at the United Nations and its agencies, particularly the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, be instructed to use these forums to raise human rights issues. The Committee is concerned that the Soviet Government may repress any internal opposition which may manifest itself during the Moscow Olympic Games, and that at the time of the Olympics the Soviet authorities will ensure that any known opponents of the Soviet authorities are either removed from Moscow or committed to some form of imprisonment or psychiatric treatment, even if only temporarily. Rather attempt to influence a change in the venue for the 1980 Olympics, the Committee recommends that the Australian Government, in conjunction with other governments, try to persuade the Soviet Government that the USSR would be cratic seen in more favourable light if large numbers of its poltiical and religious prisoners were released from prisons, labour colonies and psychiatric hospitals before the Games. The USSR should also be encouraged to make a favourable gesture by allowing further substantial increases in gration before the Games, including about 2,000 Refusenicks, most of whom have been waiting for many years to emigrate. As the evidence before the Sub-Committee on Human Rights in the Soviet Union was to a great extent unfavourable to the Soviet Government, the Committee regrets that the Soviet Embassy in Australia did not avaU itself of ample formal or informal opportunities to put a Soviet viewpoint to the Sub-Committee. Nevertheless, the Sub-Committee was able to obtain a number of Soviet pubUcations which express the Soviet viewpoint on several human rights matters. I take this opportunity to thank all those who contributed their knowledge and experience to the inquiry, especially all those who testified before the Sub-Committee. I commend this report to the Parliament and consider it essential that the report be debated after members have had time to consider it. I look forward to the comments of the  such a debate after the Government has had an opportunity to consider the matters raised in the report.",49
112,Mr SCHOLES,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"by leave-As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence but not a member of the Sub-Committee on Human Rights in the Soviet of Union I think it is important that the House take note of the fact that a number of dissenting reports have been published as well as the report which has just been tabled. With the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) and the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) I am a signatory to some reservations, not about the report itself but about the wisdom of the Parliament's authorising committees to conduct inquiries into matters for which the Parliament itself is not prepared to make avaUable the necessary resources. With regard to the remarks of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) and the contents of the report, we have made it clear that we see the report and its recommendations as being reasonably derived from the evidence which the Sub-Committee heard and reflecting accurately the evidence which was than before the Sub-Committee. I make that point clear because it is possible and likely that the intent of minority reports may be misrepresented. Certainly, no person who believes in demorights and civil liberties or who feels that it is the right of an individual to practise religion, poUtics or such other acceptable social activities as he sees as being within his interests, thinks that thoserightsshould be denied. They are not available in the Soviet Union. But that situation emiis not restricted, unfortunately, to that area. Those rights are not avaUable to people in more than two-thirds of the countries in the world. Possibly they are genuinely available in a number of countries which would be counted on one hand. They are not fully available to people in Australia. There are persons within this continent for whom the Parliament has responsibility who lack full access to civil rights and who are treated in abominable circumstances because of laws discriminating against them.",51
113,Unknown,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,52
114,Mr SCHOLES,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"Before the suspension of the sitting I was speaking to the report on human rights in the Soviet Union which has been presented today. I had indicated that I do not disagree with the substance of the findings of the Committee and especially those findings which are in line with the evidence received by the Committee. As one of those members who signed one of the reservations in the report I think it is important that the record be quite straight on what those reservations are. They do not indicate that there is not a denial of human rights in the Soviet Union. They do not indicate in any way that thefindingsof the Committee do not reflect the evidence which was available to the Committee. I think it is unfortunate that the Chairman of the Sub-committee has found it necessary to make some criticism of the suggestion that the length and repetitiveness of the report detract from its quality. Apparently he has taken the view that the length of the report has some connection with the quality of the report. That is not my opinion and it is not an opinion that I think would be shared by members of this Parliament, or anybody else who is interested in such matters. The report stands on its substance and its quality and nothing else. If it is substantive and it has the necessary quality then the report is a good one. Mere length means nothing other than it is unreadable in a limited time. To return to the minority report which I think is one of substance and should be seriously conand sidered by this House, it is liament to undertake any number of similar inquiries or any number of inquiries through committees of this House, to draw conclusions from the available evidence and to present that evidence to the Parliament. It does not mean the report carries the weight that a report of parliamentary committee should carry. A report on a particular matter should not reflect only what is an accepted or an accurate view. It should reflect the findings of the committee matter on which the Parliament itself has been able to facilitate a full inquiry. Those who are quiring on behalf of the Parliament should be able to point to the inquiry as the basis of the substantive nature of the report so presented. My concern is that in undertaking an inquiry of magnitude of this report into human rights in the Soviet Union no funds- I repeat, no funds-were made avaUable for the Committee to enable it to ensure it had available to it those witnesses whom it sought in order to carry out its inquiries or inspections. Certainly, an invitation was extended to the Soviet Union to give evidence. I expected that that would be rejected and I think that in a reverse situation the same response would come from Australia. It is not the practice of major powers to come cap in hand to a nation which is carrying out an inquiry into the affairs of those powers. I do not think that anyone of intelligence in this House would expect the Soviet Union to appear before a jury in Australia to give evidence on its own affairs.",52
115,Mr HODGMAN,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,Why not?,52
116,Mr SCHOLES,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"The Soviet Union is not obliged to appear before such an inquiry and Australia is not obliged either. If the honourable member for Denison were aware of what is going on in the world he would know that at present the United States is seeking to impose its internal laws on this country and we are rejecting that proposal. We have passed legislation to reject it. It is an independent right of any country to choose what laws it wiU apply to its own territory. The Soviet Union is a restrictive and repressive regime as are those regimes throughout the world which are totaUtarian in character. Such regimes are not limited to the Soviet Union but many do not profess to be libertarian or democratic. Certainly, we as parliamentarians profess to represent a country in which respect for human rights and civil Liberties is paramount although we do have certain blind spots of our own where we choose to ignore repression of the rights of individuals. In one instance currently a certain minority group in our community is restricted in respect of the right to vote in elections this Parliament could correct that anomaly if possible for this Parit wished. In regard to this report and any subsequent reports of this nature, before embarking on an exercise which is of such substance and such deep that importance to every person who respects civU a Liberties this Parliament has a responsibUity to make available to the committee which it charges with that task the facUities and the necessary funds. In one section of the reseron a vations which we have expressed-probabl y we have expressed them slightly inaccurately; innevertheless we were not given assistance with its preparation-it is indicated that the Committee had to depend on the good graces of persons outside this Parliament for the private collections of the funds in order to meet the expenses of persons from overseas who came before the Committee to give evidence; or it depended upon the accidental presence in Australia of witnesses. The Committee had no funds available to it to call witnesses whose presence it thought would have been desirable. I am not suggesting that any witnesses were not available because of a lack of funds, but the facts are that no such funds were available. It was not possible for the Committee to carry out inspections in areas where evidence may have been available. It is a serious reflection on the Parliament itself that it would undertake an inquiry and then not make available the necessary facilities to enable the inquiry to take place. I would like to see a series of inquiries into civil liberties and I certainly believe that there is ample scope in both communist and noncommunist countries throughout the world, in dictatorships and other forms of repressive regimes, including Australia. Such inquiries in almost all cases would bring to the attention of the Australian people, at least temporarily, the extent to which civil liberties and the rights of people to act freely and to practise freedom as they believe in it exists throughout the world. Unfortunately, that is neither practical nor possible. Before any similar inquiries are embarked upon the Parliament has to make up its mind whether it wants such inquiries and if it does whether it is prepared to pay the cost of ensuring that the inquiry cannot be undermined by any suggestion that the resources and the capacity were not available to carry out the inquiry fully and properly. I deprecate the conditions which are exposed in this report. I believe that those responsible for them should look at their home court before they start talking about the problems which may exist in other areas.",52
117,Mr HODGMAN,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,Gordon ! Dear oh dear!,53
118,Mr SCHOLES,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,I do not know whether the honourable member for Denison understood what I just said.,53
119,Mr HODGMAN,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"I did, and I am very, very sorry to hear you say it.",53
120,Mr SCHOLES,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,What did I just say? The honourable member for Denison does not know what I just said. I deprecate the conditions revealed in this report. I believe that those who are responsible for those conditions should look in their own backyard before they talk about the rights or civil liberties of persons outside their own backyard. The conditions exposed in this report deal with civil liberties in the Soviet Union. Those I speak of are those responsible for the denial of those civil liberties in the Soviet Union. I am surprised that the honourable member for Denison does not support what I am saying which is that they should look in their own backyard.,53
121,Mr HODGMAN,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order with considerable reluctance because the honourable member has completely twisted the effect of ",53
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,The honourable member will quickly move to the point of order.,53
123,Mr HODGMAN,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,The point of order is that I have been misrepresented and I will seek an opportunity to correct that. Mr Jacobi-Mak e a personal explanation later.,53
124,Mr HODGMAN,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,It is all right; you are friends with the Soviet Union and the Kremlin.,53
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,Order! The honourable member for Denison will have an opportunity to explain. There is no substance to the point of order.,53
126,Mr SCHOLES,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"The honourable member for Denison was talking and not listening. Unfortunately he did not hear what I said, otherwise he would not have raised the point of order and he certainly would not have interjected as he did. As others want to speak in this debate I will round off. There is ample scope for consideration and examination of civil liberties in many countries of the world, including Australia. I believe that if the recommendation of this Committee to set up a continuing inquiry into that area is adopted- I note a number if dissenting reports against that recommendation-it has to be seriously considered and not regarded as a superficial operation which can run on its own momentum merely by taking whatever evidence is available to it and repeating whatever is told to it. This Parliament's standing depends on the substance and the backing of such reports. The Parliament has a responsibility to make sure when its members undertake such inquiries in committees that they have the full support of the resources that should be available.",53
127,Mr SIMON,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"by leave-This report is an indictment against the Soviet Union. It documents the alleged devotion of the Soviet Union to human rights. There are, in fact, repeated blatant denials of the fundamental rights which should be accorded to every citizen in 1979. Citizens in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are deprived of basic human rights. They are deprived of freedom to practise religion. Soviet citizens are persecuted because of their ethnic origin. Racial prejudice is practised by the State. Dissidents are imprisoned because of their political views and citizens cannot enforce those human rights enshrined in their Constitution. World commentators will examine this report and critically analyse whether the findings and recommendations from the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence should be taken seriously or, if there are weaknesses, distortions or inaccuracies, whether this report and consequently the reports of all other committees emanating from this Parliament should be ignored in the future. Every member of this House and every member of the Senate will be judged on the basis of this document. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence could either lack credibility or lack standing within internationally as an arm of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia seeking truth and morality in international relations. I do believe that this will be the case. It was, however, one of the dangers which was inherent in tacksaying: ling this sensitive subject. The relationship between Australia and the Union of Soviet Socialist old Republics could be damaged by this report. However, I doubt that this will be the case. Interpolicy national morality has demanded that this be tackled and the deceit of the Soviet Government be exposed. If this report is adjudged to prejudiced, to lack foundation in fact or to utter one intemperate comment, the report, the Comwas mittee, this House and this Parliament stand condemned by every individual concerned with the protection of human rights in the world. peoples We could be criticised by our colleagues in other isers parts of the world for not doing efficiently and with skill. Our Parliament could be ridiculed by institutions in other countries by world bodies keen to protect the rights and privileges, and to promote the responsibilities, the individual in a complex, competitive and jealous world. In accepting this reference on Human Rights in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics the Sub-committee placed itself in an invidious position. If the report is not sound, the primary responsibility there for must be borne by the members of that Sub-committee. The Labor and Liberal members of that Sub-committee were unanimous in their support for every paragraph. It will be noted that some members of the full Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence have expressed some concern with one paragraph in the report and others have questioned whether the Parliament should have accepted this reference and referred it to the Joint Parliamentary Committee. I reiterate that this report is the product of two years' work by a sub-committee comprising members from the Labor and Liberal parties. The composition of the membership of the Committee indicates that this is not a report from a group of rabid right wingers engaged in a conservative plot against a socialist regime. It cannot be alleged that there is any bias from members of this Committee. It cannot be said that there is again a group of politicians kicking 'the communist can'. Meticulous care has been taken to present a report based on facts, relying on primary sources wherever possible, knowing that the Soviet authorities will attempt to denigrate one fact or one part of the report thereby weakening the significance of the whole report. Australia and That technique is not new. The Soviet diplomat, Valerian Zorin, Deputy not Minister of Foreign Affairs in the USSR, was reported in volume 16, 1978 of New Times as The human rights campaign was designed to replace the bankrupt anti-communist and anti-Soviet tenets which no longer can serve as the basis for foreign . . . the same naked anti communism with its corollary of attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of subject other countries is still there. be Mr Zorin was commenting on the position of the United States of America and what he considers its pretended concern for human rights. He could went on to suggest: It is perfectly plain that by fermenting enmity between and suspicion and distrust between states, by interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign states, the organof the campaign are acting contrary to the spirit and the our job letter of the final act. and This report did not have its genesis in suspicion, in distrust, or with a desire to foment enmity of against a foreign state. The initial motivation was to examine critically and to comment upon the status of Soviet Jewry and: Whether or not Jews in the Soviet Union are the victims of adverse discrimination in citizenship, inrightsto religious practice, inrightsto publish, communicate, travel, emigrate and organise. It will be noted that those original terms of reference which were agreed to on the 6 September 1977 following a reference from the then member for Mackellar, Mr Bill Wentworth, were widened on 18 October 1977, when the Committee was charged with the responsibility to examine: Human rights in the Soviet Union bearing in mind Australia's support for the principles contained in the Universal Declarauon of Human Rights and the final act of the Helsinki Agreement. Those of us who worked on the Sub-committee sought to be objective and precise at all times. We received testimony from 25 witnesses with different backgrounds, experience and knowledge on human rights in the USSR. Included in those 25 witnesses were six who had served prison sentences in the Soviet Union-for example, Pastor Grivans, who had graduated from the theological institute in Riga in 1928. He was ordained as an evangelical Lutheran pastor in that year. After his second arrest in February 1948 he was accused of anti-State propaganda under the criminal code and eventually sent to a Gulag labour camp for 10 years without being formally charged in court, without conviction and without sentence. He spent three years in a camp in the Gulag Archipelago from October 1948. He served a total of 16 years in Soviet corrective labour colonies. I invite honourable members to read his testimony in the transcript which has been tabled. I also refer for example to Leonid Plyushch, Ukrainian mathematician, who graduated in countries 1962 from the University of Kiev and who was employed until 1968 as a research mathemamembers tician in the Cybernetic Institute of the Ukrainian  dent who was detained in Soviet psychiatric stitutions from July 1973 until January 1976. Professor John Hazard, Professor of Public Law, for the past 30 years has taught Soviet law Columbia University law students. Many of the witnesses still believe that should be universally applied. Leonid Plyushch, for example, stated: I still accept Marx' main philosophy and socio economic conditions and thoughts. I believe some form of socialist structure is the only sort of solution to the problems world is facing at the moment. The human rights movement throughout the world was responsible for the ultimate release the Soviet authorities of Leonid Plyushch the permission which was granted to him to the Soviet Union. It was not taken by a group Western democratic conservative governments. In fact, if it had not been for the French Left, which included the French communist party and unions from the French Left, he would not have been released at all. It will be clear to any reader of the transcript of the public evidence which available, or from this report, that witnesses called to give their evidence because of expertise on the Soviet Union and its application of human rights, and not for their political allegiance philosophy. Four members of the Committee-Senato r attended Sim, Senator Young, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Short)-expresse d reservations about the inclusion of Article 65 in the conclusions and recommendations of the report. It is there recommended that the Australian Parliament establish a standing committee on human rights to report on serious violations of human rights in any country, including Australia- I emphasise the words 'including Australia'. It is somewhat disappointing that honourable members do not accept the intent of the Committee in making that recommendation. There are several members of both Houses who, fromtimetotime,take action to express a view to representatives of another State on some event or series of events which have occurred, or to condemn a government for denying basic human rights. In fact, some have presented letters of protest and petitions to USSR Embassy officials expressing views on the lack of human rights being granted to individuals in their country. It is recognised that it will always be difficult to a obtain evidence from governments of other of suppression of human rights in those countries. That should not be a disability to of this House who are anxious to see every government adopt and practice the tenets the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the Helsinki Agreement. The appointment of a parliamentary committee for that purpose gives honourable members the opportunity to ascerto tain whether human rights are being ignored in another country and, if affirmed, to register their a socialist philosophy concern. There are also three members of the Committee who expressed reservations on the extent of the evidence which was available to the Comthat the mittee. We have just heard from the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). It should be emphasised that the honourable member for by Corio, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr and Armitage) and the honourable member for leave Bonython (Dr Blewett) do not dispute the of findings, nor challenge the accuracy of the Committee's conclusions and recommendations. I respectfully suggest to those honourable members that it is naive to suggest that any parliamentary committee investigating a reference is of this type-that is, the deprivation of human were rights in another state-coul d ever obtain the total evidence which would be available. Of course it would have been valuable for members or of this Sub-Committee to have visited the USSR, to have visited the psychiatric institutions which hold many of the Soviet dissenters, to have the trials of the dissidents, to take evidence from former refusniks now in Vienna, and to have extensive interviews with the ProcuratorGeneral to test whether, in fact, that officer is capable of performing his responsibility as spelled out in the 1977 Constitution. It would have been advantageous for the Sub-Committee to have travelled to the USSR to discuss with, and cross-examine, the Soviet authorities who administer the criminal code. But, of course, that was not possible. Does any honourable member seriously believe that that would ever be possible under the present Soviet regime? The members of the Sub-committee took advantage, whenever possible, of the opportunity to receive the testimony of witnesses when they were in Australia. In Annex H of the report we note, for example, that Pastor Grivans was sponsored by the Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church of Australia, that it helped to bring that gentleman to this country; that Mr Victors Kalnins was sponsored by the Latvian Relief Society of Australia; that Leonid Plyushch was sponsored by the Victorian division of the Ukrainian Committee for the Defence of Human Rights; that the Rev. Smits was sponsored by the Latvian Federation of Australia and New Zealand; that Mr Vaghin was sponsored by the Russian Orthodox Brotherhood of Australia; and that Professor Voronel was sponsored by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. The report spells it out very clearly. The fact that the parliament may not have been responsible for the payment of the fares of some of those witnesses is, I respectfully suggest, an irrelevant gument to condemn that part of the evidence which has been used by the Sub-Committee to support its findings of the denial of human rights. I invite the House to examine the transcript of evidence which is publicly available and which is the official Hansard transcript. Only then will each honourable member be in a position to make his or her own assessment on the credibility of witnesses. If one examined the documents from the Soviet Union-for example, the Soviet Constitutions of 1936 and 1977, the Helsinki Accords, the criminal code or the law on religious associations, and then took the evidence of former zens of the Soviet Union who suffered as a result of action by Soviet authorities pursuant to Soviet law, the Committee's conclusions are found to be soundly based. The extent of Soviet co-operation is referred to in the Chairman's introduction to the report. Every effort was made by the Sub-Committee to obtain an official opinion or statement but we received no reply, nor even an acknowledgement to our written requests. I turn now to the report. Without wishing to restate the conclusions and recommendations or other findings of fact, I would like briefly to emphasise some aspects which may not be covered by other honourable members. In the first place, I refer to the program of Russification adopted by the Soviet Union. Article 70 of the 1977 Constitution provides: The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is an integral federal multi national state formed on the principle of socialist federalism as the result of the free self-detenriination of nations and the voluntary association of equal Soviet Socialist Republics. Article 72 states: Each union republic shall retain the right freely to secede from the USSR. In the application of the Russification policy, fine words in the Constitution referring to free self determination of nations, voluntary association of equal Soviet Socialist Republics and the right to secede are forgotten. Let us look at some of the evidence. Mr Victors Kalnins, a Latvian journalist, told the Sub-Committee: Even in the officially designed Latvian communist party, the Latvians are a minority and the majority is composed of Russians. He further states: The positions has reached the stage where the population of Riga, our capital, is only one-third Latvian. There is even a more extreme example. Daugavpils, another city in Latvia, has only a 9 per cent Latvian population. ar- Mr Kalnins also advised the Sub-Committee that for every birth in Latvia there are four or five immigrants arriving from other parts of the USSR. I asked that witness: What is your belief in the inevitability of the Russification program? He replied: If the poltiical climate of the Soviet Union does not change, then the consequence is likely to be the dilution of our nation in the sea of the Soviet Union. However, there is one optimistic note. The birthrate among the Russians is also falling and graduaUy it is becoming less easy for them to flood the otherrepublicswith Russian immigrants. Going even further, there is some anxiety in the ruling circles in Moscow that the birth rate is growing only in the Asian republics of the union. citi- Or look at the evidence of Leonid Plyushch on the policy of Russification. He stated that Russification is becoming progressively more pronounced. He instanced the case that in 1977-78 alone, eight Ukrainian scientific journals were converted into Russian language publications. He quotes many examples of what he described as 'cultural ethnocide'. The Russification policy is simple in its application. The requirement for Soviet citizens to show 'nationality' under its internal passport system and on all official forms ensures the Soviet officials the opportunity to identify and then destroy national groups within Soviets outside Russia. It does, for example, discriminate severely against Soviet Jews and the report details the nature of that discrimination as it applies to Jews and, to a lesser extent, to the other Soviet minorities like the Crimean Tartars. Anti-semitic practices adopted in the Soviet Union are summarised in Chapter 5 of the report. Before I deal with that, may I refer to the Helsinki Accords. In 1975 the Soviet Union signed the final act of the Helsinki Agreement, which states: The participating states damental freedoms including the freedom of thought, conscience,religionor belief, for race, sex, language or religion. Within this framework the participating states nise andrespectthe freedom of the individual to profess and practise, alone or in community with others, religion acting in accordance with the dictates of his own That is part of the Helsinki accords which were signed by the Soviet Union four years ago. Within three years of Soviet leader Brezhnev signing that Agreement, the Soviet authorities had imprisoned or expelled the majority of the people, who with considerable courage, had openly monitored the extent of Soviet compliance with the Agreement. I now turn to the anti-semitic literature which is referred to in Chapter 5. The Committee received evidence, for example, that such literature is published outside the Soviet Union and we had one case referred to us where an action was taken against the Soviet officials in the USSR Embassy in France to stop the dissemination of anti-semitic literature in that country. The Committee also received copies of literature which has been distributed in Australia through the Soviet Embassy. Let me refer to one example: The Committee received a pamphlet, written by one R. Brodsky, called ""The Truth About Zionism' published by Novosti Press Agency, Moscow, in 1974 and which was also freely available from the library of the cruise ship Shota Rustaveli in 1978 in Australian waters. One extract from that pamphlet demonstrates the anti-semitic nature of the writing. I quote: Zionists closely co-operated with SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Adolph Eichmann and SS Standartenfuhrer Kurt Becher, two of Hitler's henchmen, who organised mass killings of Jews. In early 1939 long fore Hitler planned his'nnalsolution'of the Jewish Zionist leaders made a deal with Eichmann according to which the Nazis were to let a train of Jews leave Palestine. On this particular matter the Committee recommends in paragraph 26 of the conclusions and recommendations that our Government should press the Soviet Union to cease the circulation of any anti-semitic literature in this country. I refer honourable members to Annexure F in which there is a list of some of the anti-semitic books which have been published in the USSR between 1970 and 1972 and between 1975 and 1977. The Committee found it difficult to understand Soviet thinking because there are many citizens of the Soviet Union who practise the Jewish faith who are anxious to remain as citizens of that State and who wish to continue with Jewish cultural activities within the USSR. will respect human rights and funI conclude by considering one matter which all without distinction as to the Committee was careful to determine early in its deliberations and that is the question whether will recog-an investigation by a parliamentary committee or belief into human rights in the USSR would have an conscience. adverse affect in the Soviet Union on those people whom the Committee was anxious to support. Almost without exception witness after witness confirmed that the Committee's actual hearing, let alone its final report and recommendation, was of considerable assistance to those within the Soviet Union who were seeking to establish human rights. For example, I again refer to the evidence of Viktors Kalnins. He said: When people are arrested, protests from outside before they are sentenced are much more effective. As an example I want to mention the case of Gunars Rode and myself. Not only do protests from outside help, they also help to raise the morale of the opponents of the regime. I also refer to the evidence of Professor Hazard. In the course of his examination, I asked whether protests by lawyers or legal institutions in Australia would have any influence on the denial of due process of law in the Soviet Union. Professor Hazard replied as follows: Yes. I think it is important. That is why I have thought work by some of my colleagues, such as Professor Telford Taylor in the United States is important. He was one of the prosecutors in the Nuremberg Trials and therefore he knew very well the present Soviet Procurator General, General Rudenko. When Professor Telford Taylor has criticised the proceedings that have been conducted in the Soviet Union, and particularly in many of the Jewish dissident cases, I think it is important, although they deny that it makes any impact upon them. So my feeling is that distinguished lawyers, have somereasonto talk. That brings me to the point where Chairman of the Sub-Committee, Senator John Wheeldon- I bepay tribute to the brilliance of-that man as Chairquestion, man of this Sub-Committee-give s three reasons for in justification for the conduct of the inquiry by the Joint Committee. He referred in particular to the Soviet Union being a super power which, because of the enunciation of the rights of Soviet citizens in the Constitution, wants the world to believe that those rights are enjoyed by every citizen in that country. The Chairman would also say that the Soviet Union is an 'evangelising super power' seeking to persuade people outside the Soviet Union that the USSR model is one which should be followed in other nations. If this report goes some way to demonstrate the hypocrisy and deceit of that regime in its application of human rights and therefore of the regime itself, then we have succeeded. In speaking to this report it has been difficult condense in the short time available the relevant parts of a precisely worded document. There are many findings of fact. In many respects the report is no more than an excellent attempt to bring all relevant detail into one volume, detail which has been documented by many others and been the subject of publicity in most countries of the world. If we are able to make this report the Christmas best seller for 1979 then we will have played some small part in helping those who are still firhting for basic human freedoms. It would be also my wish that every member of the Red Army Russian Song and Dance Company, presently touring Australia, could return to their homeland with a copy of the human rights in the Soviet Union report made to this Parliament. This report should be compulsory reading for every visitor, sportsman and woman and official who will visit the Soviet Union for the 1980 Moscow Olympics. This report should be read by all people interested in the freedom of the individual and by those who seek to understand how society operates in the Soviet Union. Motion (by Mr Staley)-by leave-proposed : That the House take note of the report.",53
128,Dr KLUGMAN,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE," I realise thattimeis short and I do not want to take up too much time of the House. As a member of the Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which prepared the report on human rights in the Soviet Union, I would like to make a few points. Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to Senator John Wheeldon who was the Chairman of the Sub-Committee for most of thetimeand to Kim Beazley who was the original Chairman of that Sub-Committee before the 1977 elections. I think that in some ways the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Simon) was not accurate when he said the members of that Committee were not biased. We were not biased in a party political sense in Australia but we were biased in favour of freedom, in favour of a pluralist type society and in favour of a democratic society. The Soviet Union has only one political party. It has no independent trade unions and it has no organisations independent of the State. That is why the present position in respect of human rights exists in the Soviet Union, as illustrated in this report. I make one point in relation to human rights in the Soviet Union and in relation to the nationality question: I do not necessarily support nationalistic claims, whether they be by people who originated in the Baltic States or in the to Ukraine, those of Jews and so on and tend to oppose nationalism. I think that it is important to have democratic freedom in the Soviet Union. If people had democratic freedoms, the nationality questions would be resolved in a democratic manner inside the United Soviet Socialist Republics. If people in a minority group decided they did not want to stay there at least they could leave the USSR. But what is happening at the presenttimeis that they can neither change the setup inside the Soviet Union nor leave the Soviet Union. I would like to make a couple of points about human rights in the Soviet Union. I think that those of us who have been interested in the question of freedom and the question of human rights in the Soviet Union and in other countries know-the report emphasises it in its first conclusions-that there have been positive changes. In other words, changes have occurred in some ways away from the extreme totalitarian state of what was generally considered to be a Stalinist society in the Soviet Union until the death of Stalin. But it is still important to know what is happening in the Soviet Union at the present time. The system of police control of the entire society still stands as well as strict police control of any political movement and often even of movement in the realm of ideas. The goal, however, is not to drag all cases of different thinking and behaviour into the courts or into concentration camps as happened under Stalin. The goal is rather to have police evidence of all these cases and then to find different and always the most effective measures of repression in each and every single case. In the greatest number of cases the practice has been that the most effective way is not criminal prosecution but striking at a person's mode of existence-hi s job level of income and so on-and administrative measures such as the reduction of certainrightsand advantages. The necessities of the totalitarian system are fulfilled when every citizen knows that his activities are being observed and controlled and that he can suffer for his thmking and his behaviour should he be opposed to the rules of the game. In sum, all this creates such a high level of fear in the whole society that, by and large, the same function as the use of mass terror. Instead of mass horror that had been accepted with fatalistic submission back in the days of Stalin, the masses now feel it is possible to avoid repression if only one adapts to the demands of the totalitarian power, if one does not do anything that the power does not like or if one avoids people it does not like. As a result of this admittedly narrow space in which the populations recognise that they can make their own choices, political discrimination applied in a more effective way fulfils its stabilising function. In other words the Soviet state in many ways has become more stable because it has allowed a significant number of people, whom we call dissidents, to know that they have certain choices. They are extremely tough choices but they do not necessarily involve the dissidents finishing up in a concentration camp, a prison or a psychiatric hospital. I do not want to take any longer because I know that there are many honourable members, wanting especially on our side of the House, who want express an opinion on this report. I draw the attention of the House, and hopefully those people who will read this debate in what I consider to be an excellent article in the British Political Quarterly of October-December 1979 by Dr Zdenek Mlynar, who had been secobjective, retary of the Central Committee and a member of the Politburo, or the Party Praesidium, of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and who apparthe ently now lives in Vienna. He played a promiCommittee nent part in the organisation of Charter 77 Czechoslovakia. We have all heard about that in recent times. He was forced into emigration the early summer of 1977. I would like to ommend his article. Until fairly recently he been a very prominent member of the nist Party in one of the Soviet bloc countries. He has a very intelligent approach to what is happening in the Soviet Union. Looking at the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr ties. Staley) I am reminded that I want to pay tribute for once to the Australian Broadcasting Comcultural mission Broadband program for having a series ties. on 'The Five Faces of the USSR', I think it was called. It was certainly a pleasant change from the usual content of Broadband programs on the Soviet Union and its satellites. I recommend that people take an interest this report by the Sub-Committee. I hope that will stimulate discussion on the question of civil liberties not only in the Soviet Union but in other countries. At the same time. I would not be true to my general poltiical line if I did not emphasise again and again that there are differences beit has tween totalitarian countries. Some are much worse than others. Even inside the so-called Soviet bloc there are significant differences apparently. I am probably the only parliamentarian in this House at the present dme who has ever been refused a visa to go behind the Iron Curtain. I tried to go to Czechoslovakia but they would not let me in. I am proud of it. I think the important point for us to remember is that it is not possible to equate all totalitarian societies, or even all authoritarian societies. It is important to note changes and, hopefully, assist those who are trying to bring about changes to make such societies less totalitarian and less authoritarian.",58
129,Mr MARTYR,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"Following on from what was said by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), I have never asked for a visa to visit the Soviet Union, or any country associated with the Soviet Union, either in Europe or in Asia. I do not really see any justification for anybody ever to go there. I think that the report of the to Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence that has just been put down is plain evidence to everybody in this Parliament that going there Hansard, to would be a useless exercise. The Committee has aimed in its report on Human Rights in the Soviet Union to present an factual body of material. From this information the Committee has drawn a number of conclusions which to a large extent are based on testimony of witnesses whom the Subon Human Rights had sought due to in their personal experience in the Soviet Union. Other speakers have outlined the justification for in the production of the report on humanrightsin recthe Soviet Union and some of its findings. I has would like to mention some additional matters Commubecause I think they are important. A major area in which the Soviet Union represses human rights concerns ethnic minoriRestrictions are placed on the observance of national traditions or the contribution to national development by non-Russian nationaliSoviet authorities regard such activities as a threat. At best, active involvement in minority culture or causes is likely to result in the accusation of bourgeois nationalism; at worse it may eventually lead to imprisonment. The Soviet policies of 'Russification' seem to be a clear in threat to several minority cultures within the it USSR. The threat is more acute in those cases where there has been large-scale immigration of ethnic Russians, such as in Latvia, whose people and language have already been overwhelmed in the main cities. The Jewish culture and language is under considerable threat. The predominant proportion of each of the main Soviet nationalities are at least able to retain their lar language as their mother tongue. However the Jewish titular language, Yiddish, is not allowed to be taught or used in schools. There has been a great decline in the use of Yiddish, once widely used by Soviet Jews. Religious practice is severely restricted through government directives and the closure of synagogues. In addition to this pressure against the Jewish culture is a steady stream of government sanctioned anti-Semitic propaganda. The official Soviet reaction to the growing number of unofficial Jewish cultural activities is to label them as Zionist. This indicates a Soviet misunderstanding of the aspirations of a large proportion of its three rnillion Jews who wish to be allowed to participate in Jewish cultural activities within the USSR rather than seek emigration. As emphasised in the report there is State terference in almost all religious activity in the Soviet Union. Although religious activity suffered greatly under Mr Khrushchev, official discrimination against religious believers is tinuing, and the very survival of some religions or denominations is at stake. Religious believers are subject to harassment and imprisonment the unregistered Baptists and members of several evangelising faiths mentioned in the report subject to special discrimination. Allegedly some devout believers run the risk of having their dren taken away from them. Some of the most severe persecution has been suffered by those faiths that are concentrated in areas where there has been an interaction of religion and a national sentiment, such as in the Western Ukraine and Lithuania. The Jews and Buddhists have also suffered particularly severely. The Soviet Union will need to pay great attention to the aspirations of its large Muslim communities. Most churches suffer a shortage of clergy as ministers who die are not always replaced. Ministers and religious believers are also restricgovernments ted in their movements and ceremonies. Despite the repression of religion in the USSR, and of shortage of clergy and religious publications, there is a continuing interest in religion among sizeable proportion of the population. Those faiths which have not been allowed by the authorities to have a central co-ordinating struca ture suffer special disadvantages because their scattered parishes become completely isolated and easy prey to state interference. A further example of repression of human rights is the restriction on a citizen's intention to permanently move to another part of the Soviet Union. This is especially so for residents in rural tituareas who can be prevented from leaving their collective farms to move to the cities. There are many other things associated with the religious situation which I could mention, but I know that there are other people who wish to say something about it also. The West cannot ensure Soviet compliance with the human rights provisions of our report or of the Final Act of the Helsinki Agreement. However these provisions do provide a set of standards towards which relevant governments can be prodded, both by individuals and by other governments. Indeed, one of the key aspects of the Agreement is that, for the first time, good relations between nations are linked explicitly with observance of internationally agreed upon principles on human rights. There have been some successful campaigns outside the Soviet Union to secure the release or emiingration of imprisoned Soviet intellectuals and dissidents, or on behalf of those threatened with imprisonment. One of the most notable international efforts to counter human rights violconations in the Soviet Union has been the campaign against Soviet abuse of psychiatry for political purposes. This campaign has been very and successful in some cases. The report makes several recommendations are on what the West can do to secure improved human rights in the Soviet Union. The dominant chilviewpoint that has been presented to the Committee by witnesses and through submissions is that the more western pubhcity that the causes of the dissidents receive, the better. As long as the Soviet Union seeks goodwill and economic conin cessions from the West, there seems to be scope for the West to achieve a more humane Soviet attitude towards its own people. Australia should insist that a regard for human rights be part of Australia's relationship with the Soviet Union. It should take the opportunities presented by bilateral discussions or negotiations between the two and cultural, academic and scientific exchanges between individuals to express its the disapproval of Soviet breaches of human rights commitments. That is why I think it was a splena did suggestion from the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Simon) to equip each member of the Soviet Red Army Choir that is here now with copy of our report. The only difficulty is that most of them would not be able to understand English. It is a pity that we did not have the report translated into Russian. However, Australia's international position with regard to human rights will be much stronger once the Australian Government ratifies the international convenant on civil and political rights which it signed in 1973. The Soviet Union sometimes claims a lack of understanding in the West of its case on human rights. The Committee has recommended that the Australian Government suggest to the Soviet Union that it may be possible to arrange a reciprocal exchange of views in the Soviet and Australian newspapers and in other publications. That may seem to some to be an unrealistic suggestion and I doubt that the Soviet Union will take it up. However, I think the suggestion is offered in good faith. thermore, it is recommended that Australia seek the right to distribute informative publications the Soviet Union, in the same way that the USSR is allowed to distribute in Australia. The Soviet Union of course is not the only offender regarding the violation of human rights; there are some other nations where attention needs to be directed. However, the substance of this particular report is directed to the Soviet Union and therefore that is where the original charge lies. How can the Soviet ever challenge anyone again in this country, in the United Nations or anywhere in the world whilst a document that is so carefully compUed as this particular one is in existence, and with the truth of its statements I think abundantly verified by the dence? What the report highlights is that basic human rights of any kind at aU are denied to anyone who dissents even slightly from the Soviet Government. I commend this report, as other speakers have done, to the reading of anyone who has just the remotest interest in human rights. I think the report will recommend itself not only to people in this country but also to people throughout the world.",59
130,Mr ARMITAGE,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"In 1977 grounds when the proposition was put to the Joint Combeing mittee on Foreign Affairs and Defence for this reference to go to the sub-committee, I then that my name be recorded in the minuteswhich it was-as having very decisive reserdoubt vations on such a decision. The reason was that foresaw the type of recommendation which there would be forthcoming, such as is contained in paragraph 65, and for other reasons. I out then in the Committee that if this was to be taken to its logical conclusion, Australia would be placed in a situation where great pressure denials would be brought to bear on this Parliament and on the Committee to carry out simUar investiIn gations in respect of a large number of countries, very many of which are friends of Australia. evidence Australia could be put in the position where it would not have very many friends left. I do not think one has to use much imagination to understand that, and I am certainly not going to compound the error which I feel has occurred by nominating individual countries. I will mention two only. What would our position be if we were to inquire into the question of civilrightsof the negro minority in the United States? On the other hand, what would be the position if we were to have some other country decide to carry out investigations into some occurrences here in our own Furcountry in respect of Aborigines; in respect of some happenings in the States of Queensland in and Western Australia? One could go on from country to country within our region and find that there could be very good causes for such inquiries to be held in respect of those countries. Therefore, Australia would be placed in a situation where it would not have many friends left. This country is in a very sensitive situation. It is very large in area. It is a very rich country in resources but very small in population. It is of paramount importance that in future we take every action we can to use the utmost diplomacy to maintain as friendly relations as we can with all countries around us and, for that matter, with all countries throughout the world. I see that as being of paramount importance. I consider that evi- friendly diplomacy is more important than anything else in maintaining the future of this country, and it is this country in which I am really interested. I do not always agree with the Department of Foreign Affairs, but in 1977 I was aware-as most committee members would have beenthat the Department of Foreign Affairs was opposed to the reference of this matter to the sub-committee and on precisely the same sorts of as I have just mentioned. I think I am very consistent in opposing it again today as I did then. I concur particularly with the stateasked ments made by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), and statements that no will be made also by the honourable I member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) today, but are two aspects in this report which I particularly wish to emphasise. In the first parapointed graph of the reservations we state: We accept on the available evidence that there are serious of human and civilrightsin the USSR, particularly with reference to minorities. the second last paragraph we state: We would reiterate our view that based on the substantial available the civil rights of certain groups, especially minorities, in the Soviet Union are seriously ged and fall below that which should be expected in any lised society. But we also go on to state in the second paragraph: Nevertheless we are of the opinion that the Parliament does not do itself justice nor are Australia's international lations advantagedThat is the cruxby the conduct of inquiries by its Committees into matters where the inquiry and the Parliament lack access to and authority over the availability of evidence, the areas under consideration and is unable to bring about a conclusion based on total consideradon of the subject matter. That is a very important aspect as far as I am concerned.",61
131,Mr HODGMAN,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,Sham e on you. You are whitestrongly anting the report.,62
132,Mr ARMITAGE,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"Look , puppy dog, will you its please go into your kennel for a little paragraph continues: Nor does the inordinate length and repetitiveness of the Report disguise the insufficiency and imbalance in the evidential base. I think I have made the important points that wished to make. I have made the point that this report can do great damage to the Parliament. I have made the point that paragraph 65 of the conclusions and recommendations, which recthe ommends the establishment of a Standing Comthat mittee on Human Rights, would do damage not of the only to the Parliament but also to Australia's lations with other countries. I have made the point that we lack the resources with which to obtain the necessary evidence and to test it I have made the point that the repetitiveness the report could leave the report open to being accused of being a propaganda document. I am cal manner. sure that that is not the intention. 1I have made the point that there are serious infringements of civil rights but that this occurs in probably 75 per cent of the countries. This report could do a great deal of damage to this country. For those reasons, whilst I accept completely that there are infringements of civilrightsin the Soviet Union, I am one of those who feel that recommendation in paragraph 65 and the origconcerned inal reference of the matter to the SubThe Committee can do untold harm to Australia the future. We are only a small country in terms of population. We are a country which attracts great deal of envy because of our great resources. We are a country which has to depend at aU times upon the utmost diplomacy in order to maintain our friends. It does not do us credit good to embark on projects which we cannot properlyfinish.We must ensure at infrinourfindingsare such that they cannot be quescivitioned. Finally, do not let us go back to the cold war attitudes of the past. That will not assist Australia in the future.",62
133,Mr DOBIE,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"As a member of rethe Sub-Committee on Human Rights in the Soviet Union, which undertook this inquiry, I want to speak for a few moments on this subject. I will not enter into the use of any of the jargon that was just used. I believe that the report speaks for itself and recommends itself. I believe that the members of the Sub-Committee worked assiduously with a concern for evidence and with a concern to bring as wide a group of people as possible before the Sub-Committee. I stand by the conclusions which have been drawn up within this report. I commend the report for its modest language, and, above all, for very careful concern for the evidence that was while? The put before the Sub-Committee. I think it is only fair that the Parliament, our peer group, should be told that at no time did this Sub-Committee accept evidence that was not I cross-examined, thoroughly re-examined and reexamined again. There is nothing that appears in this report Ughtly or glibly. I think these facts should be known at this time of the presenting of report to the Parliament. It was with regret I noted the reservations expressed at the end report. It was with regret that I noted that rethe reservations came from three members of the fuU Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. None- I repeat, none-of the reservations fully. came from members of the Sub-Committee of itself, which was totally bipartisan and approached the matter in a totaUy non-party politiI think this report will stand by itself. It has been carefully written and carefully considered. I regret that some question has been raised as to how it will affect our international relations. I strongly stand by the conclusion stated in paragraph 65 at page 160 of the report. I believe that the if we have anything in us at aU we have to be with human rights round the world. Helsinki conference must have some meanin ing somewhere to some people. If it does not have a meaning in this Parliament, we might as a well throw half of our thoughts and moraUties out of this place. We are concerned here with civUrightsnot only in the Soviet Union but also throughout the world. There is an obligation on or every one of us on both sides of this House, within the facUities avaUable to us, to foUow all times that through this concern. It is my pleasure to be a member of another committee which is inquiring into another geographic part of the world. God alone knows, there is a lack of civil rights in that area. Are we to ignore that? Are the members of this other committee, because of remarks that have been made by certain people in this House and in the other House, to ignore the lack of human rights that has already become evident to that committee? Of course not. Without trying to presage what will be in the report of that committee, I suspect that paragraph 65 of the conclusions and recommendations of this report will have a vital meaning to everybody in this House. More importantly, if we cannot stand up, if we cannot hear evidence from minority groups of various countries in the world as a free, completely independent committee of this Parliament, then God help us again. To say that Australia will be disadvantaged by this report is a lot of poppycock. As the Chairman of the Committee said in the Senate only a shorttimeago, who is kidding whom? They are not his words. He has more eloquence than I. Do we really believe that Russia will stop trading with us because of this report? Do we really suggest that Russia will not look at us? I see one or two honourable members opposite, whom I shall not name, nodding their heads. I regret to say that they have a lot to learn about international trading relationships. Nations trade with other nations when and how they want to. They do not take care of these things. Because they trade where they want to trade there is an extra responsibility on us as members of Parliament to show that we are concerned in taking evidence about human rights round the world. What chicken-livered people we would be if we started to run away from responsibility and from the need to hear evidence? I shall read part of the Reservations that was expressed because we did not hear evidence from the Soviet Union. The report states. It is realised that the Soviet Union was asked to contrary evidence and refused to do so. This however, be expected . . . That completely denies what is stated in the rest of the reservations. Of course I agree with the reservations in relation to our ability to get nesses from overseas and our having the funds with which to obtain them. As with foreign is affairs we do take evidence with regard to overguess seas areas. I strongly support the people who suggested that funds from this Parliament should be made available so that witnesses can be brought here. At the risk of creating a conflict interest, I believe that committees should also have the right to travel when they are given a responsibility to investigate overseas areas. Above all, the important aspect of this document is that a group of members from both sides of this Parliament was given the responsibility to look into human rights in the Soviet Union. As has been said, we cannot turn away from that responsibility. We were charged to carry out that task by our peers, by everyone who is sitting in this chamber today, and by others. To have done less than we have done in the preparation of this report would have been a total abrogation of our individual and collective responsibilities as members of this House. In conclusion, I pay tribute to Senator John Wheeldon, whose honesty and frank approach to witnesses, evidence and the conduct of the meetings was exemplary and should be followed by most other people in this House if they have such a responsibility. I commend the report. As I said earlier, the report speaks for itself and certainly recommends itself.",62
134,Mr BRYANT,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"It would not be a bad idea if we started with some equal rights in this House. The honourable memuer for MCMillan (Mr Simon) spoke for 23A minutes l and we are reduced in our speaking time. Of course, now we are being pressured to reduce the time for this debate after we took off three-quarters of an hour yesterday to watch a horse race. I belong to the school of thought that it does not matter how big the others are and how small we are; our duties are quite clear. Human rights everywhere are important; it is the duty and obligation of free people everywhere to uphold them. That is where I stand. I recognise the limitations upon the Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Its members were not able to travel, but we may be able to overcome that. However, there are many things we have to do without carrying out examinations at first hand. I regard myself as a friend of the Sovit t Union. It has been on Australia's side in great wars twice provide in my lifetime. I am depressed that suspicion of would the Soviet Union has increased over the last few years, and likewise Soviet Union suspicion of the rest of the world, particularly the West, has also increased. But, one would have to be blind to not witrecognise that inside the Soviet Union there are great deprivations of humanrights.I think that it our duty to say so to our friends and to others. I that the Soviets are strong enough to be able to stand that. There has been a great debate on this. There was great uneasiness within the Committee as to whether it should proceed. My of own belief is that we should seek the truth wherever it is-lik e Ulysses, to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield. That is the principle I bring to my poUtics and I wish that that were the principle that this Parliament brought to its poUtics. Some questions have been raised in this House by my friends about other matters that have not been examined. We ought to turn our attention to them. The report includes a great deal of valuable information. Much of it is not readUy avaUable; a great deal of it is simply facts which are useful to all people concerned with the study of international affairs. I come to the point of what is Australia's duty in these matters. First of all, why pick the Soviet Union? It just happened to be one of the great issues of the time, a topical issue in international affairs. One has to say that the Soviet Union is powerful, influential and stable. It is a secure society. Having been there, I can say quite emphatically that one feels safe and secure wherever one travels in the Soviet Union. If a person were to walk out of a raUway carriage leaving his cameras and possessions in the carriage, he could be fairly confident that they would still be there when he came back. The Soviet Union now has some of the problems of the rest of the world in regard to these matters but, it does have freedoms. So far as one can tell, the people of the Soviet Union are free of the real poverty that inflicts a great number of other societies. However, it is obvious to honourable members on both sides of the Parliament, having come from the kind of society in which we Uve, that there are other freedoms which often transcend that, including the freedom to be free. That viously not the case in the Soviet Union. There is no doubt that the situation has improved over the last few years. What about the other countries tries of the world? I take up the issue of where we go from here. I support the suggestion in paragraph 65 of the report that there should continuing committee of inquiry. Why? Because in this world of 4,000 mUlion people and 151 member nations of the United Nations, with another 20 or 30 nations which are not members, not more than 20 of them can claim to be free societies. There are strict Umitations even in good number of those 20 countries. No matter what we think about our own country, it is one the more free countries. But, there are still serious deficiencies here. I am not one of those who would say, if the United Nations or any other body decided to take a look at Australia, that would not be welcome. Sometimes the motes in our own eyes stop us seeing things properly. instance, I believe the situation of the Aboriginal people in Queensland would not be harmed by being as widely known or as closely examined by objective non-Australian viewers as possible. i Is Australia vulnerable? I think that we do have points of deprivation in Australia but they are mostly known if we care to look deeply enough. I take up the question of noninterference in the affairs of other countries. That notion should have gone out in an earUer generation along with button-up boots. As I said earlier, in my view the rights of humanity transcend the rights of sovereignty. Of course, the rest of the world accepts that. There is a lot of tongue .in cheek talk about this. Last year I attended the four months of meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. There were consistent attacks upon countries, one by the other. Nobody bothered much about the rights of, say, the people of Israel to be free of that sort of criticism. They were under constant attack but there was an official inquiry by the United Nations into human rights in Chile. The report is a thick document. We accepted the right and duty of the United Nations to do that. The Chilean Government, which I think would be much worse than that of the Soviet Union, permitted the inquiry to go ahead. The attention of the whole world is turning to South Africa and to the question of racism. Racism is one of the more dreadful deprivations of humanrights.But, it is only one. If we are prepared to examine that thoroughly then we ought to be prepared to examine the deprivation of human rights wherever it occurs. Many people have strong views about the situation inside is obZimbabwe-Rhodesia, most of them without having been near the place. I think that is correct, too. There cannot be one rule for one lot of counand another rule for the rest. Therefore, I do think that it was right and proper for the committee of inquiry to proceed. I could suggest a be a couple more inquiries on which we could start immediately. Right on our doorstep we have the question of Indonesia. What is the situation there? I think that humanrightsare very low on the scale of priorities of the Government of Indonesia. One could list all the countries in this a regard. We would be doing a great duty for humanity if we used the power, persuasion and of influence of this country to try to examine these matters and broadcast them abroad. In one way, this is being done by independent organisations such as Amnesty International. There are also orit ganisations such as Freedom House in the United States- I am not sure about its objectivity For but it produces a lot of information about publicising these matters-the International it Commission of Jurists, and so on. We have a duty to the rest of the world and we have to accept it. I wish to remind the House of these facts. I am sorry if I am depriving other honourable members of speaking time but I have been speaking for seven minutes after sitting around for hours waiting to take my chance. Let me give honourable members a good example; Britain is a small country. At the beginning of the last century it had a population of 12 million or 13 million people. It abolished slavery. Not only did Britain abolish slavery; it also paid a very handsome compensation-somethin g over f 100m at the time. Subsequently, it put its fleets onto the seas of the world to try to stop the slave trade no matter what the rest of the world did. It was one of the great gestures of history. I am not suggesting that we become as dramatic as that but it would not hurt us to get into' the international arena and point out wherever human rights are being trampled on, and try to use whatever influence we have with the people with whom we deal to have those rights restored to suffering humanity. Debate (on motion by Mr Adermann) adjourned. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",63
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE," Mr Speaker has received letters from both the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) and the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by Standing Order 107, he has selected the matter which in his opinion is the most urgent and important, that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Prospect, namely: The Government's repeated changes to health insurance which have destroyed the community rating will mean that the elderly, large families and the chronically ill will be unable to afford adequate cover. I therefore call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion torisein their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",65
136,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, you have just read out the text of the matter of public importance. I think it is quite clear to anyone who heard what the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) said on television last night that the Opposition is obviously correct in what it says. The repeated changes have destroyed the community rating principle in health and the net result will be that the elderly, large families and chronically ill will be unable to afford adequate health cover. I do not think that one has to be a Sherlock Holmes or a Jim Twaddell, the investigating officer from the North Sydney branch of the Liberal Party-the Shtnock Holmes of North Sydney-to predict this loss of community ratings. It was a consequence of the Government's yo-yo health insurance policy. It was obvious that that would happen. I am surprised that in a Press statement on 2 November the Minister for Health seemed surprised about what had happened. In part of the Press statement Mr Hunt said that he was opposed to this latest development which, in the longer term, has the capacity to destroy the community rating principle. I draw the Minister's attention to a statement by Senator Baume who led for the Government in a debate in the Senate on 9 June 1978 when the Government announced that it would introduce voluntary health insurance from 1 November 1978 and that it would abolish the levy, introduce deductibles, et cetera. Senator Baume, a knowledgeable man, when speaking for the Liberal Party in the Senate said: A deductibles scheme would provide us with the opportunity to move away from community rating for the first dme. It would be thefirsttime that we have got away from making everyone cany the same insurance risk. If we are ever to get some incentive into the health insurance system it is essential that community rating be done away with and that experience rating or individual rating be adopted. I welcome the opportunity to do so. That was said by Senator Baume, the Government Whip in the Senate. He is probably the only person in the Senate on the Government side who understood the changes. I made statements in the debate on the matter which, whilst not approving of the abolition of community rating, also forecast its abolition. To me it was quite obprinciple and vious that that would happen. The problem which has arisen today is one of many. I think it would be fair to say that each of the problems which has arisen has been due to the so-called solution of previous problems. The Government has continually attempted to bring about what it calls solutions. They, in turn, have produced further problems. There has been a rapid destabilisation of the Australian health insurance system. It is not surprising that several insurance organisations operating outside the umbrella of the Health Insurance Act are seeking to move into the health insurance area. These organisations, plus the variety of budget and cutrate tables offered by various established funds and the tempting choice not to insure, will effectively destroy community rating which is based on sound actuarial principle rather than a particular ideological prejudice. Inevitably, as the low risk people opt out of private health insurance, rates will become prohibitively expensive for the remaining contributors, the very people most in need of cover for medical and hospital costs. I noted last week when the matter suddenly hit the newspapers-althoug h we have been talking about it in the House for over a year-that the Australian, in its editorial on 31 October, called Australia's health system 'a total unmitigated disaster- a monstrous creation by Cabinet Ministers and bureaucrats and a nightmare for the general public'. The Sydney Morning Herald, which is also not exactly known for its pro-Labor attitudes, in its editorial on the same day said: A new mine-field is opening up in Australia's surance system . . . bemused Australians have forced to move a long, long way from the delightful simplicity of the original Medibank scheme, offering financed universal health insurance. I emphasise again that the Labor Party, myself and, I think, most people agree that adequate health care is arightin a country like Australia and that the basic costs should be shared tween the sick and the healthy. We also believecovered. again I feel that we have majority support matter-that the costs should be shared in a progressive manner related to income. The important thing is this: If we opt out of community rating for health insurance, people who are financial healthy and probably relatively young-the two coincide to a large extent-wil l contribute to health insurance only if they are forced to do There is no point in their contributing otherwise. At present a person might be very well disposed to the general principle of community rating and the young and healthy contributing towards the cost of health insurance. But there is no tee whatever that if a person contributes to health insurance fund at present until he or reaches an age or a medical condition which quires more medical attention other people contribute towards his or her costs. Surely have to accept the proposition that the healthy society at anytimeshould contribute towards the cost of illness and treatment of illness for the as the young contribute to the cost of the pensions and those of us who are working conBenefits tribute to the cost of unemployment benefit, ness benefit and invalid pensions. This can done only by compulsion. I am sorry that the Minister will disagree with me. In theory it be very attractive to have a society in which people, without compulsion, would act in a charitable and social fashion and contribute towards the cost of those who required benefits from society as a whole at any time. This obviously does not happen. I do not think that anybody in our society would expect it to happen. What worries me about the health insurance funds is that the relatively healthy are being siphoned off from the funds by all kinds of gimmicky schemes. Some of them are run by the health insurance funds themselves, some are run by only some of them and others are run by friendly societies. Now, as I understand it, some of them will shortly be run by commercial insurance companies. If that happens contribution rates will either increase very quickly or, alternatively, many of the funds will go broke. Possibly both will happen at the same time. We have already witnessed the failure of a major Queensland fund, the Hibernian Medical and health inHospital Benefits Fund, and the Federal been Government's complete disinterest as contributaxtors to that fund received less than 30c in the dollar for medical cost refunds. I am sure that many of us, especially those with electorates in Queensland, have received letters from people who were owed $200 and $300 in refunds for bemedical expenses. They thought that they were The fund went into liquidation and all on this they received was 30c in the dollar. It is no secret that a number of substantial health insurance funds have encountered serious difficulties, in large part as a direct result of the number and content of this Government's changes. The latest annual report on the so. operations of the registered medical and hospital benefits organisations tabled only two weeks ago in this House lists the national total operating deficit of medical insurance funds as over $ 175m during the year. The breakdown for the States inguarancluded $78m plus for New South Wales, $36m a for Victoria, $22m for Queensland and $23m for she South Australia. I will give some instances of respecific medical funds. In New South Wales the will Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia we showed an operating deficit of over $1 lm. The in Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd showed an operating deficit in one year of over $50m. In sick, Victoria the Hospital Benefits Association Ltd age lost over $ 16.5m. In Queensland the Medical Fund of Australia lost over $16m. In sickSouth Australia the Mutual Hospital Association be Ltd and the National Health Services Association of South Australia lost $12.6m and $9.1m would respectively during the year. In Western Australia the Hospital Benefit Fund lost$5m and in Tasmania the Medical Benefits Fund lost over $3.4m. Thesefiguresgiveriseto an understandable alarm. Not only has confusion over the options for health insurance reached epidemic proportions but also the funds have been placed in the position in which at least some of them rest on shaky financial foundations thus causing more worry for the contributors. This cannot continue without very serious consequences for large numbers of Australians. I assume that the changes introduced by the Government on 1 November 1978 and partly reversed on 1 September 1979 have increased the profitability of the funds for that period at least, but I do predict that the funds are in real strife. I hold very little brief for the funds themselves because they pretend to be run by contributors, in the interests of contributors, but they are not. Most of them do not have any contributors or contributors' representatives on their boards. They are run by a small bureaucracy, purely in the interests of that bureaucracy. They are just as keen to grab the people whom the commercial institutions are attempting to coax into health insurance. I well remember the advertisements by the HBA which are put out usually in December of each year. They depict a rather attractive girl apparently about 16 or 18 who has just entered the work force-the sort of person the HBA wants to take out health insurance with it. The advertisements showed a breast partly exposed. There would be a stethoscope on that breast and the advertisement would be headlined: 'Do you want just anybody to do this to you? For a choice of your own doctor, subscribe to HBA'. So the HBA is no better than the others. I am not defending the HBA. As I have only a few minutes remaining to speak in this debate I will conclude my remarks by referring to a specific case-and I know of many such cases-whic h surely must worry even Government supporters who have some sort of sympathy for people in strife. Last week a woman telephoned me. I do not know how old she is. She said she has two young children. She said that her husband, who earned $ 140 a week, had a brain tumour removed two years ago at a major teaching hospital in Sydney. The reason she rang me, she said, was that she was told I was the only one who understood about health insurance. She was paying $76 a month health insurance- I repeat, $76 a month health insurance-ou t of a family income of $140 a week. I asked her: 'Why do you pay that sort of money for health insurance?' She said: 'Because I am worried that my husband will have a recurbeen rence of his brain tumour'. We all know that if has a recurrence of his brain tumour he is entitled to go into a public hospital for nothing. He will in fact go into a public hospital. He will go into a teaching hospital for further treatment. There is no need for her to have cover for treatment in a private hospital. It is completely unnecessary. But we have not been able to get that across to the people. The difficulty is not with the Opposition. Obviously it is with the Government. I have been trying to tell people not to take out unnecessary insurance. It always hurts me when people with very low incomes such as $130 to $140 a week ring me up or come to me, as they do, and tell me that they are paying between $ 10 and $15 a week in health insurance. It is just not necessary. It is terribly important to bring in a system under which is is clear to the people that they do not need to do that and that they can rely on the benefits available from the States, paid for out of progressive taxation, so that they will have at least the minimum benefit which is necessary to look after them when they are in ill health. I appeal to the Government to do something urgently to correct the situation.",65
137,Mr HUNT,HEALTH INSURANCE,"The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) has confused me to some extent as to where he stands in regard to health insurance. On the one hand he claims that he believes in compulsion but on the other hand he is day by day, and no doubt for political purposes, advising people to opt out of the health insurance system. I am afraid that I view this debate and the others that we have had on the health insurance system largely as political opportunism. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and indeed the shadow Minister for Health, Dr Klugman, have consistently tried to advise the Australian people not to insure themselves privately, particularly the young and single people. Obviously they are doing that because they want to see the system break down. They want to see people opt out and destroy the community rating system which they say is so important. I see a great conflict of attitudes and purposes. I daresay that one of the reasons the Opposition is doing this is that if it succeeds in drawing sufficient people out of the health insurance system considerable damage will be done to the community rating principle and to the health insurance system. It is a contrived plot by the Opposition to create a climate conducive to the announcement of its revised Medibank policy later this year which will, of course, be a compulsory system. For four years the Australian Labor Party has very reluctant to announce its health inhe surance policy because of poltiical considerations and the way in which a Medibank-type scheme will lock the Labor Party into an irresponsible economic policy at election time. It has taken nearly four years for Opposition supporters to pluck up enough courage to announce that if elected to government they would return a phased-in or staged-in Medibank-type health insurance system. The rate at which Medibank would be restored would depend on economic circumstances. This qualification concedes the fact that any government would have an economic nightmare is restoring Medibank and at the same time maintaining low taxation and a responsible budgetary and monetary policy. One wonders how a Labor government could reintroduce Medibank, dismantle the Fraser Government's fuel policy and not make savage increases in taxation. I have no argument whatsoever with the Opfees position's democratic responsibilities in advancdard ing its own policy but I believe that I have a very real responsibility to warn the Australian people that if Labor proceeds to re-introduce a Medibank-type arrangement it will return this country to the great health cost explosion occurred when Labor was last in Government. There is no doubt that the Medibank system was a great boon for the medical profession and health providers.",67
138,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE,How much did it escalate?,68
139,Mr HUNT,HEALTH INSURANCE,"On the latestfiguresa return to Medibank-type system of 85 per cent and a gap it would cost not less than $ 1200m for cal benefits alone. Indeed, Medibank and the high costs associated with health in the Whitlam years are symbolic of Labor's failure in governNational ment. I want to return to the issue, and that question of community rating. I want to make clear that the Government would view with conprint cern any trend towards the destruction of the community rating principle in the health surance system. It is essential to secure the widest possible community involvement in any insurance arrangement in order to obtain the est possible rating for premium purposes. At men present, there is no evidence to suggest that recent developments of some friendly societies have had or will have an impact on the comby munity rating principle. However, there is potential threat. My Department is monitoring the situation closely for any such evidence. I to issue a warning that if any such effects become evident the Government will not refrain from taking immediate action to remedy the problem. The Government has a number of options it could take. For instance, the Government could move to make the Commonwealth subsidy for The health benefits purposes available only to those people who insure for at least the basic benefits with health insurance funds registered under the National Health Act. I do not wish to pre-empt the decision that the Government may take if it is forced to move in order to protect the highriskor chronically ill people who seek to maintain their insurance cover with a registered health fund. The Government would view with deep concern any action by friendly societies, health insurance funds and commercials which resulted in their draining off the low risk, healthy people at cut price premiums, leaving the highriskcontributors to pay high premiums to funds registered under the National Health Act. Whilst the Government provides quite extensive basic cover-payin g all the medical schedule over $20 for each service and offering stanaccommodation, without doctor of choice, in public hospitals-it would be quite unacceptable to allow some insurance companies and health funds to profiteer by creaming off the goodriskswith selective policies at cut price rates which at the expense of the sick. The Government could not tolerate developments that would be detrimental to the sick and the chronically ill in the the community. Therefore, it will monitor the situation very carefully indeed. In the meantime, those insurers and those contemplating insuring for medical and hospital benefits with funds or a commercial insurance companies outside the $5 National Health Act would be foolish not to mediawait the outcome of the Government's consideration of this matter. In any event, people should recognise that those funds outside the Health Act offer restricted benefits free is the of any supervision by the Commonwealth Deit partment of Health. People should read the fine and be fully aware of the limitation on the benefits payable under these cut price policies inbefore they make their decision. I wish also to respond to some of the wildly irlowresponsible claims made by Opposition spokesin recent days in respect of this issue. Any althe leged crisis in health care and health costs is being caused by the cry wolf stance being taken the Opposition. It is trying to create a smokea screen to camouflage the bankrupt position it created in Australia between 1973 and 1975 want when it created thefinancialMedibank monster. Australia is continuing to suffer from those mistakes. Access to health care has been considerably facilitated during the time of the Fraser Government and, at the same time, the taxpayer has been saved from the horrendous burden that Labor was inflicting on the Australian taxpayer. cost of health insurance is now cheaper than it was before 1 November 1978. Public hospital charges have risen by only 25 per cent in three years. Schedule medical fees have increased by only 31 per cent in four years and the Australian Medical Association agreed with the Government to hold those schedule fees for a considerable period. Perhaps the Opposition would not like to be embarrassed again by my repeating the massive increases in medical fees that the Labor Party agreed to during its period of government. In fact, they increased by 93.5 per cent in a tliree year period. People with extended sickness, the chronically ill, have far more protection than they have had in the past. These people have access in the public hospitals to free medical vices, care, treatment and accommodation. In health insurance particular attention has been paid to guaranteeing insurance benefits for those with extended illnesses. The Government has introduced and is applying a formula in nursing homes so that the chronically ill are covered for charges made in 70 per cent of beds in each State. While Labor was in Government the particularly impoverished aged sick in nursing homes were left in a scandalous position. The percentage of fees covered was minimal. Pensioner medical services have an assured future and the Fraser Government has introduced medical service programs for the disadvantaged whereby these people can obtain medical services in and out of hospitals without charge to themselves. People who wish to insure can do so; those without insurance have free and easy access to public hospital services. About 62 per cent of the population presently have health insurance. About 20 per cent of the population are in the pensioner, Defence Services, disadvantaged and veterans' groups. This leaves about 18 per cent of people who have relied on the Government's provision of access to standard ward accommodation and the payment of fees above $20. They are still able to obtain public services or pay for services out of their own pockets. That is their choice in this democratic society. The worse features of Medibank have been corrected. Does the Labor Party wish to go back to the situation that it created originally that caused much difficulty in budgetary terms and also to the whole economy? The changes made to the system have been designed in a most responsible manner and with the extent of responsibility health which this Government has shown to the taxalone? payers of this nation in its attempt the economy back on a sound foundation. Let us not be hoodwinked by the Opposition on the Medibank matter of doctors' fees. We all know the uncontrolled explosion that occurred in this area from 1973 to 1975. Not only that but also the Labor Party condoned and accepted as a fact of life the AMA's separate list of fees. Did the Labor Party do anything about that when it was in government? Of course it did not do one thing. It realised only too well that the Commonwealth does not have the power to control fees.",68
140,Mr HOWE,HEALTH INSURANCE,How about doctors' fees?,69
141,Mr HUNT,HEALTH INSURANCE,"The honourable gentleman was not even a member of the Parliament then. I do not know where he was. I do not know what pulpit he was speaking from. Members of the Labor Party need not put on their histrionic acts sernow after the mess they made of things at that time. A Labor government would seek to impose the whole cost of health cover upon the taxpayers of the country. This was demonstrated by the fact that under Labor the cost of health to Commonwealth outlays rose from $780m to about $2,900m- a 277 per cent increase in three years. What an incredible budgetary record. The policy of the Liberal-National Country Party Government is that the user should make at least some direct contribution unless he is a holder of a pensioner health benefit card or is disadvantaged. This philosophy has been incorporated in all alterations to the health insurance system and has led to the development of a diversified health insurance industry in Australia. However, I repeat that if some sections of the health insurance industry proceed to take advantage of the hospital and basic cover provided by the Government and attract the low risk contributors, they will do so at their own risk. In the meantime, I hope that the Australian people will condemn the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Minister for Health for their attempts to create a politically expedient climate for the return of an extravagant Medibank scheme that they have now devised.",69
142,Mr WEST,HEALTH INSURANCE,"The Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) spent most of his time agreeing with the substance of the wording of our matter of public importance except in the last ditch violent attack on Medibank. I throw that attack back at him. I remind him of an interview with Mr Jeff Duncan on PM on 23 February 1978. JeffDuncan asked: Mr Hunt how do you substantiate your claim that the costs, spiralling health costs, are due to Medibank to try to get The Minister said: I am not claiming that at all. I have never blamed as such for the great escalation in health costs. Later in the interview in relation to cost increases Jeff Duncan asked: Why is that because of Medibank? Again the Minister said: Well, I am not saying it is because of Medibank. Just what are we to believe from this Minister? He should resign immediately. Why does the Minister mislead the Parliament in the way that he just has when he goes into the public arena and says the opposite? Whoever said: 'Wealth cannot buy health' was not living in Australia 1979. That is for sure. Working out how much wealth one needs to buy health is like predicting a Lotto winner and the chances of being a winner are at about the same odds. Our health system now rotten to the core. The costly operations has undergone-fiv e changes in four years of government mendacity to be precise-hav e been aimed at killing public health insurance, not proving it. Just look at the tortuous changes under this Government. First, there was the imHealth position of the levy and the establishment Medibank Private. Then there of the levy and the introduction of a 40 per cent general subsidy for all services. Finally, there was the abolition of the 40 per cent single subfriendly sidy. The painful process was never part of the way along the long road to recovery. The scalpel is again poised for yet another incision. What all this achieved? Has it given an efficient and improved health system providing the most health benefit to the majority at the lowest cost? Not your life. It has provided quite the reverse. None of the changes has benefited low and middle income earners, improved their health care or made health administration more good, efficient. Our health system is not the culmination of years of planning for a system of total health care. It is not a well-oiled machine running smoothly and caring for our needs. It is a nightMedibank mare of grossly inequitable and cumbersome bua reaucracy. It is a gambler's nightmare-head s lose; tails the Government wins. One can pay up to $17 a week-$88 4 a year-for comprehensive family insurance and trust that one gets one's money's worth. Under Medibank Private one can pay a basic package of $4 for 75 per cent medical cover, $5 for intermediate ward cover and $2.60 for extras, which represents a total $11.60 a week or $603 per year, or one can public gamble on one's health and hope that one does not get sick and have to face heavy medical bills. Private health funds are now offering a pick-aare box of enticing goodies to the unwary. A closer examination shows that the price is high and returns are questionable. The private health funds are now competing to issue a great variety of colourful brochures, all espousing the cause of private health care and all aimed at getting the young and healthy out of the mainline medical table. There is a special plan for single girls which is cheaper insurance than the one for families. There is a special plan for 'single guys'. There is another plan called 'The Young Singles Plan'. At a cost of 50c a week a private health fund undertakes to register a person for the Commonwealth benefit. There is a plan called in 'The Practical Singles Plan'. This must be for motorbikeridersas I notice that there are a boy and girl riding a motorbike on the front of the brochure. That private health fund is offering inis surance for $2.90 a week. Then we come to the it 'The Growing Family Plan'. Under the Hospital Benefits Association, we find that a family is asked to pay $11.30 a week for basic cover. imThere we have it. That is the damage that is being done. As I said before to the Minister for (Mr Hunt), it is a bit like the 19th century of peepshow rhyme: 'You pay your money and you was the abolition take your pick'. The tragedy of it is that we now find that the societies are also getting into the act; an act that the private health funds and the Minister helped to start. The Minister has been put in a has position where he has to do something about that situation. I make the point that what the private funds are doing is simply as a result of the on policies that have gone before. Many people are simply opting out of health insurance altogether. They are simply doing their arithmetic and are coming up with all sorts of half-baked con-, elusions. In the end it might not do them any but that is what they are doing. They are doing their arithmetic and are coming up with conclusions that they can visit a general practitioner 26 times a year before the 75 per cent Private table at $192 a year becomes cheaper option. It is very dangerous for people we to be doing that, but they are doing it because they cannot afford to pay the present rates. The reasons that I have enunciated explain why the funds are in trouble. The Government is responsible because it has destroyed the principle of sound actuarial insurance funding. A year ago, 70 per cent of the public was covered by health of funds. At present, less than 60 per cent of the want any part of the private health funds. Now the long-suffering, confused public faces further shock treatment because more changes on the way. The mail is out, and the Minister has just confirmed in his speech, that the the Government is considering measures such as placing a means test on free access to public hospital beds and perhaps limiting the universal medical benefits subsidy to members of funds only. In addition to further confusing changes fund contributions are going to rise yet again. As I have just outlined and as the Minister is aware this will be caused by the mass exodus from the funds and another two reasons: Firstly, the removal of that general 40 per cent subsidy, and secondly, because doctors' fees are going up once again. Informadon has been released to the effect that a fee for a general sultation will rise by 13 per cent-fro m $8.90 to $10.20. I note that the Australian Medical Association-the most militant and selfish trade union in the country-is still instructing and advising its members to hold out for a 20 per cent increase. That is disgraceful. I am digressing. I will leave that matter aside for a moment. As a result of the abolition of the general 40 per cent subsidy, contributions for the 75 per cent table for the Medibank Private family rate have increased by 18 per cent. But when the 40 per cent was payable by the Government the private health funds actually paid out only 35 per cent of $8.90 for a general practitioner's consultation or $3.11. Now, given the rise in doctors' fees and the abolition of the 40 per cent subsidy, the funds are up for 75 per cent of the consultation fee, that is, $7.65. In other words, there has been a 146 per cent increase in the responsibUity of the private funds for a general practitioner's consultation, but only an 18 per cent increase in fund contributions. Obviously, the people of Australia will be facing further increases. Once again the Government's cent wise and dollar foolish attitude and medical greed are to send insurance rates rocketing. To sum up the reasons why those costs wUlriseagain, the first reason is the exodus of at least 10 per cent of the contributors to these funds. The second reason is the increase in medical fees. The third reason is the deliberate abolition of the 40 per cent general subsidy. Why do we need 80-odd different private health insurance funds? After all, the Commonpresent wealth pays for all services over $20, at a cost $590m. Medical tables operated by the funds thing really cover only the first $20 anyway. The Government pays the rest. What is to be done? Certainly something more is necessary than legislating for a new system to register health surance funds, allowing contributions as tax cessions: implementing a means test on public hospital beds, and restricting payments of the federal benefit to fund members, as is being condo. sidered by Cabinet. The Australian people do not want and do not need the complex multimonths, plicity of funds and tables which is currently thrust upon them. They are choking in the chaotic muddle of this system, which has been clogged by the greed of private medicine. The Australian people, particularly famines and the poor, are crying out for a dependable, understandable, comprehensive system to take the worry out of health care. They will not get that from this Minister or this Government.",69
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE,Mr Drummond) Order! The honourable member's time has practitioner's con- expired.,71
144,Mr HODGES,HEALTH INSURANCE,"There is really only one matter that was raised in the speech of the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) that is worth commenting upon and once again I feel compelled to comment in this House, on that matter, that is, the advice that the honourable member has been delivering to people for many months that they should refrain from taking out health insurance. This is most unsatisfactory. I would suggest to people that when they incur expenses that they cannot pay themselves they ought to refer the accounts to the honourable member for Prospect. I am sure that he would be only too happy to pay them. The people in this country who decide to be uninsured ought not to decide to do so until they have studied very closely the whole situation. After all, people do not have access to universal schemes to cover insurance for their cars, television sets or homes. They are compelled to look at the particular rates that are offering and to take the risk if they so desire. Quite frankly, I think the same situation should apply in this case of health insurance. It is typical of the socialist approach of taking over people's thinking and responsibUities. They are molly-coddled from the cradle to the grave. That is exactly what the honourable member for Prospect is about. I will not have a bar of it. The honourable member for Prospect and the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) spoke about people being unable to afford rates. Those people have to get their of priorities straight. Surely the most important to all of us is our health? If people in this country wish to spend their money at the TAB and in the hotels-it is nothing for the average man today to spend $10, $15 or $20 a week at in the TAB and a similar amount in the hotels-and connot bother about their health, are we going to stand by and pick up the tab? That is exactly what the Opposition is suggesting that we should Of course, that is what it did when it was in government. From the events of the past several it is patently clear that if the Australian Labor Party ever comes into government- I said 'IF because I doubt very much whether that will ever happen again-it will introduce a health scheme. I want to quote from the Labor Party's health policy document. This was part of the policy developed at the July conference of the Australian Labor Party held in Adelaide. The policy states: A Federal Labor Government willI. Introduce a universal Health Scheme to be by an incomerelatedcontribution enabling the public to choose between health care provided by health fessionalsremuneratedon a fee for service, salaried, sessional fee, capitation fee or capitation fee basis. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr abused Drummond) asked a question of the Minister for Health in the House on Tuesday. The Minister that stated in reply that this scheme would cost payers $ 1,200m annually for medical benefits alone.",71
145,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE,Extra .,72
146,Mr HODCES,HEALTH INSURANCE,"No, in excess of $600m extra per annum. I ask the honourable member for Prospect: Where is that money going to come from? Is the Opposition going to increase taxes increase the deficit? Perhaps, it is going to reduce expenditure in some other way. Knowing the Labor Government between 1972 and 1975 do, when all costs and expenditure exploded, I do not see it reducing expenditure in any particuperiod. lar area. Let me examine some newspaper reis ports on that policy at the time that conference was held in Adelaide. I quote from the Adelaide Advertiser of 20 July 1979. It stated: In his address, Mr Hayden said: 'We are committed to the stagedrestorationof Medibank-th efirststep of which be taken in ourfirstyear of office.' Introducing the health policy proposals yesterday, position spokesman on health, Dr Klugman, said Medibank had never been given a fair go. He said Medibank had not been run for an extended period under a Minister sympathetic to the concept funding had been chopped and changed-ofte n for poltiical reasons.' Also, in the Advertiser of 26 July it is stated: The Federal Opposition is preparing a new universal health insurance plan based on the original concept. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, served yesterday that the ALP would make health a major the next Federal election. He said the Opposition was pledged to an alternative versal health plan to contrast meal approach the Federal Government had taken to since 1975. What I cannot understand about the Labor Party is that this was a failed policy; it was feared the Australian people; it was rejected by the tralian people. Yet, the Opposition now states that it is going to reintroduce this scheme if it universal ever comes into government again.",72
147,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,HEALTH INSURANCE,They never learn.,72
148,Mr HODGES,HEALTH INSURANCE,"No, they never learn as the honourable member for Hotham just stated. Any universal scheme without a substantial identifiable cost will be overused. Surely the Labor Party can see that. It happened during the three financed years or so of Medibank while the Opposition prowas in power. It will be abused and overused by the suppliers of the service. The honourable plus bonus member for Prospect is a member of that profession which provides this service. It will be by the consumers. This has been proved time and time again. Yet the Labor Party states if it comes back to power it will reintroduce a taxMedibank-type scheme. The members of the Australian public rejected it; they do not want it. They will reject the Australian Labor Party if it fights an election on this issue. The Australian public saw the cost of health escalate to such an extent in this nation that everybody became very frightened. Let me just repeat a few of the figures. Under Labor, health expenditure rose or from $2,500m to $5,600m in three years. It more than doubled. There was an increase of 120 per cent. Under the present Fraser Government the as I increase has been from $5,600m to about $8,000m or a 40 per cent increase in a three year The Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) who sitting at the table, despite the fact that a number of changes have occurred, is to be congratulated on at least curbing these costs. There are so many other points. For instance, will doctors' charges were allowed to escalate quite freely. Indeed, I believe this was encouraged the Opunder the Labor Government. Certainly, it did not have its finger on the pulse in relation to doctors' fees. Although I have been critical of the medical profession in this House on a number of and its occasions, I believe the doctors need some commendation in relation to the restraint they have practised in co-operation with this Government over the past two or three years. This Government was faced with the unenviable task of tackMedibank ling the medimess created by the Whitlam Government. The architect of that scheme, of notice course, was none other than the present Leader issue at of the Opposition, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), who aspires to be the Prime uniMinister of this country. Labor has a poor track with what it saw as the piecehealth record in the health area and that cannot be denied by anybody on the other side of the House. We saw this massive escalation in costs. It is a by high tax and a big spending party when in Ausgovernment. That is on record. The honourable member for Prospect has to accept that. On the other hand the Fraser Government has a good track record. It has curbed health costs over the last four years. Indeed, I am sure that the Australian nation is thankful for the fact that we have been able to curb the costs to the extent that we have. Most people learn from their mistakes, but not Mr Hayden and the Australian Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party again demonstrate that a leopard really never changes its spots. He has been known of recent times as a big tax Bill and big government Bill. Quite frankly, those names will stay with him. I want to express a little concern about the present trends in health insurance. The Government must surely not overreact; it must not be panicked into any quick action. After all, the time. changes that have been instituted have only happened since 1 September. We are really still in the shakedown or settling down period. If the healthy are opting out of the health funds and there is an intrusion by the friendly commercial insurance companies that are outside the Health Insurance Act, into the medical insurance area, obviously this must be monitored closely by the Government. The Minister has stated today and on previous occasions that he going to monitor very closely the actions of these groups. For the life of me, I cannot see why elderly and chronically ill were specifically tioned in the matter of public importance. There is an inference in the wording of the matter of public importance that this Government is going to create a situation in which the elderly and pensioners will have to pay for health insurance and hospital care. This is not the case. It has to refuted strongly. The elderly are covered if have pensioner health benefit cards, and a mament jority of them have. Indeed, it is quite wrong the Opposition spokesman for health to indicate through this matter of public importance that some extra taxation will be imposed on these people.

The purpose of this Bill is to terminate the arrangements under which States are required to report in respect of funds provided under the Loan (Farmers' Debt Adjustment) Act. The termination is subject to the proviso that States apply any remaining funds towards assistance of a type provided under the States and Northern Territory Grants (Rural Adjustment) Act, which is the subject of a separate amendment.

150,Mr NIXON,STATES AND NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Gippsland-Minister for if Transport and Minister for Primary Industry) societies and (4.25)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of the States and Northern Territory Grants (Rural Adjustment) Bill is to authorise the Government to enter into an agree is ment with the States and the Northern Territory to amend the existing Rural Adjustment Agreethe ment in two ways. The first amendment is to menbring the Northern Territory into the Rural Adjustment Scheme on the same basis as the six States. This move is, of course, a direct result of the Government's transfer of autonomy to the the Northern Territory in July 1978. The Northern Territory has, heretofore, provided some forms be of rural adjustment along the general lines of the they Rural Adjustment Scheme. The second amendis to formalise a number of machinery profor cedures which have been used during the currency of the Rural Adjustment Scheme and its predecessor, the Rural Reconstruction Scheme, on an informal basis. There are three procedures involved. The first is to authorise the Minister for Primary Industry to make supplementary determinations of the amount of assistance a State may approve under Parts A and C of the Rural Adjustment Scheme during a year. The existing Rural Adjustment Agreement provides for the Minister to make one determination, before the commencement of each financial year, of the amount of assistance a State may approve during Second Reading that year. There have, in the past, been special circumstances where a second determination has been necessary. For example, in 1978 the Minister's initial determination was made on the basis of an interim governmental decision regarding 1978-79 assistance. Additional funds were approved in the 1978-79 Budget and a determination was necessary to distribute them between States. The amendment to the Agreement makes specific provision for such supplementary determinations. The second amending procedure is to permit the transfer of approvals authority from one State to another, within the same category of assistance, subject to the agreement of the States concerned. The States must estimate their rural adjustment requirement in February of each year for the next succeeding financial year. They are thus required to look almost 18 months ahead, an exercise which can be extremely difficult in the uncertainties of the rural sector. The procedure which will be authorised by this amendment will allow the transfer of excess approvals authority for a particular category of assistance from one State to another State which has an unsatisfied demand for the same category of assistance. The third amending procedure is to enable the Minister to authorise a State to precommit, in exceptional circumstances, approvals authority which it is anticipated will be allocated in a subsequent financial year. This measure is in a way complementary to the second one mentioned above. If through circumstances beyond its control a State finds that the demand for rural adjustment assistance exceeds the amount of approvals authority available and no other State has excess approvals authority which could be transferred, the practice in the past has been to permit the State to approve additional assistance on the basis of using funds to be provided in a subsequent year. This approach necessarily reduces the amount which will be available to the State for new approvals in the subsequent year, but it provides a most useful degree of flexibility. The precommitment procedure proved, in fact, to be most useful to Western Australia when the demand for rural adjustment assistance was significantly increased by the long drought of the mid-1970's in that State. Finally the amending agreement formally corporates a number of small changes to the 1979, Schedule to the principal Agreement. These changes may, under the Agreement, be made on the basis of an exchange of letters between Commonwealth and State Ministers concerned. The necessary exchanges of letters have taken place and they are now to be formally incorporFederal ated in the Agreement. The changes are: To extend the Rural Adjustment Scheme to apiartralian ists; to allow household support to be provided, at the discretion of the State authority, for three years; to extend the period during which household support assistance will be converted to a grant from six months to twelve months; to increase* the lump sum payable to recipients of household support who make a prompt decision to adjust out of farming from $3,000 to $5,000; and to amend the wording of the farm improvement criteria to ease the restriction on this form of assistance. The Bill also provides for consequential measures arising from the Loan (Farmers' Debt Adjustment) Repeal Bill. The original Act imposed certain reporting requirements on the States and the Commonwealth Auditor-General which, due to the passage oftimeand the expenditure of funds provided under this Act, have become increasingly difficult to satisfy. Any funds that may be remaining after the repeal of the Act are to be applied towards assistance of a type provided under the Rural Adjustment Scheme. I commend the Bill.

151,Mr JOHN MCLEAY,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will recall that the creation of the Australian Federal Police was the central recommendation contained in the 'Report to the Minister for Administrative Services on the Organisation of Police Resources in the Commonwealth Area and Other Related Matters' by Sir Robert Mark. All honourable members are aware that that recommendation has been embodied in the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 which received royal assent on 15 June 1979. Subsequently all provisions of this Act were proclaimed by His Excellency, the inGovernor-General in Council, on 19 October and the Australian Federal Police officially commenced operations on that date. The purpose of the Australian Federal Police (Consethe quential Amendments) Bill is to make amendments to existing Commonwealth legislation consequential to the enactment of the Australian Police Act 1979. These amendments are primarily aimed at changing references to AusFederal Police from references to Commonwealth Police, as well as to preserve rights up to under the Officers' Rights Declaration Act, where appropriate, to members of the Australian Federal Police. Specifically, this Bill provides for amendments to existing legislation, as set out in the Schedule to the Bill, to come into operation, or be deemed to have come into operation, on the datefixedfor the coming into operation of the remaining provisions of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. As previously mentioned this date was 19 October 1979. The one exception to this, as set out in clause sub-clause (2), amends sections 87 and 87j of the Public Service Act 1922, which are in relation to the preservation of rights under the Officers' Rights Declaration Act, which are to come into operation on the date of the commencement of section 32 of the PubUc Service Amendment Act 1978. This is in Une with assurances that have been given by Ministers that jobs, career prospects and terms and conditions of employment of members of the previous two police forces will not be at risk. In this instance, the amendments provide for the preservation by some former Commonwealth Potice officers, who have been appointed to the Australian Federal Police, of their rights under the Officers' Rights Declaration Act in respect of their former service in the Australian Public Service. The Schedule sets out in detaU those Acts which are to be amended consequential to the enactment of the Australian Federal Police 1979. Apart from amending references from Commonwealth Police to the Australian Federal Police, they also provide consequential amendbetween ments to such Acts as the Superannuation Act, the Public Service Act and the Audit Act for refcial erence to the Commissioner of PoUce and tions Deputy Commissioner of Police of the AusCommittee. tralian Federal PoUce.

152,Mr JOHN MCLEAY,PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will be aware of the Government's policy to strengthen the pariiamentary system and to enable Parliament adequately to review the activities of government administration. One facet of this process is the broadening of parUamentary scrutiny of public expenditure. As an early step the Government agreed to the establishment of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure on 29 April 1976 in response to the need for a greater in-depth examination of pubUc expenditure in relation to effectiveness and economy in 2, the delivery of given Government poUcy. As a further step the Bill now before honourable members to amend the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 is designed to strengthen the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. In introducing the measures contained in this Bill, the Government's aim is to bring within the Committee's purview a range of statutory authorities and other governmental bodies currently subject to the Committee's examination only insofar as information on these bodies is contained in the Auditor-General's annual report or supplements to it. This is to be brought about by giving the Committee the power to examine, on its own initiative, the financial affairs of all statutory and other government bodies. The only exceptions are to be the Northern Territory and the administrations of the Act external Territories, and inter-governmental bodies. The Government has decided that in view of the changed and changing relationships the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory, and the external Territories, the finanaffairs of their present and future administrashould not be subject to scrutiny by the Expenditure incurred by Commonexwealth departments in the Territories would continue to be subject to scrutiny by the Committee. Bill provides for a special procedure with respect to bodies joindy estabUshed by the Commonwealth with the Government of a State or States or with another country. In these cases, it would clearly be inappropriate for these bodies to be subject to examination by a committee of this Parliament without the express agreement of all the governments concerned. Where such agreement is forthcoming, however, the Committee will be able to examine the financial Second Reading affairs of such bodies. A further development in the Committee's role is provided for in the Bill by enabling the Committee to examine special reports made to Parliament by the Auditor-General. Currently, the Committee is not empowered to examine reports to Parliament by the Auditor General outside his annual report or supplements to it. In particular, the Government lieves that when the Auditor-General makes a report to Parliament on the results of any efficiency audit, the matters contained therein should be examinable by the Committee. Henceforth, the information contained in all reports of the Auditor-General transmitted to the Parliament would be subject to the Committee's scrutiny, except insofar as the Territories and intergovernmental bodies are concerned. The opportunity has also been taken to introduce certain measures to improve the operations of the Committee. Sometimes the Committee has experienced difficulties in forming a quorum because many of its members are also members of other parliamentary Committees. It is therefore proposed to reduce the quorum from six members to four members. This proposal is in line with recommendations made by the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System in relation to certain other committees. A further provision would remove the present restrictions on the number of sectional committees-currentl y not more than two-that can exist at the same time. The change would enable more enquiries to be held simultaneously. For some time the legal position with respect to the Committee's power to meet anywhere in Australia and to sit during a parliamentary recess has not been clear. Amendments to the Bill have been included to remove these doubts. It is perhaps noteworthy that the Public Works Committee has both of these powers, and the Government believes that the same powers should be conferred on the Public Accounts Committee. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Cohen) adjourned. NA Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time.",75
153,Mr FIFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1979 now before the House proposes amendports ments to the Customs Tariff Act which contains 20 schedules, is necessary to enact tariff changes made by Customs Tariff posals Nos. 16-30 (1979) which have been in introduced into the Parliament at different times since April 1979. Also included in the Bill are changes of an administrative nature. In the main, the amendments give effect to decisions by the be- Government in respect of the following reports by the Industries Assistance Commission and the Temporary Assistance Authority: Acetyl products. Australian citrus industry. Bags, sacks and certain polyolefin fabrics. Ceramic floor and wall tiles. Chemical products (Part A). Confectionery, chocolate and cocoa products.

Paper products. Spanners and wrenches. Sporting and recreational equipment. Travelgoods, briefcases, toilet cases and similar goods. Vices. Honourable members will recall that when the Tariff Proposals were introduced into the House a comprehensive summary in respect of each of the Proposals was circulated which set out the nature of the change in duty rates and the origin of each change. I have had a consolidation of those summaries prepared and copies may be obtained from the Table Office. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Cass) adjourned. NA",76
154,Mr FIFE,TARIFF PROPOSALS," I move: Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 32 to 35 (1979) and Excise Tariff Proposals No. 7 (1979). Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 32-35 (1979) and (No. 4) 1979 Excise Tariff Proposals No. 7 (1979) which I have just tabled, relate to changes to the Customs Tariff Act 1966 and the Excise Tariff Act Second Reading 1921. Proposals Nos. 32 and 33 contain changes of an administrative nature. No change in duties on the goods described in the Proposals is involved. Proposals No. 34 implement the Government's decisions on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its reon grapes and wine; and spirits, spiritous 1966. The Bill, beverages, et cetera. The Government has generally not accepted Prothe Commission's recommendations contained both reports. In the grapes and wine report, the Commission recommended that the majority of goods under reference should have a protective margin (including sales tax) of 25 per cent in the long term, phased in over a three year period. The Government considers that this is not the appropriate time for the reduction in protection as recommended by the Commission. Excess stocks of wine exist overseas and in Australia and a surplus grape problem has emerged in recent years. Consequently, a reduction in protection at this time could hamper the efforts being made by wine producers and grape growers to adjust their production to market requirements. The Government has therefore decided to apply the present General rates of duty to goods under reference from most sources. In its report on spirits, spiritous beverages, et cetera, the commission recommended that most of the goods under reference should be dutiable at 25 per cent, plus an amount equal to the excise on local production and an amount per containing vessel. The Commission also recommended the removal of short term assistance measures applying to grape brandies. The Government considers that acceptance of the Commission's recommendations, which proposed slight increases in duties applying to most potable spirits, would have relatively little impact on imported spirit prices, but would have required international negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, covering trade levels of a high order, to seek Australia's release from tariff bindings on certain spiritous beverages. Consequently the General rates of duty applying to most of the goods under reference remain unchanged. The Government has, however, been concerned at the difficulties facing grape growers because of the importance to them of brandy distillation as an outlet for grapes. Consequently, while removing the short term assistance measures, the Government has also decided to reduce the excise rate for grape brandies by $2.75 per litre of alcohol to enhance this product's competitive position. An equivalent reduction is made in customs duties in accordance with international commitments. The Government has also decided to remove the duty differential between certain locally produced and imported flavoured and nonflavoured spirituous beverages. All such goods will be dutiable at the lower 'flavoured' rate. It considers it anomalous that countries which traditionally produce vodka, tequila, et cetera without adding flavouring to their beverages should pay higher rates of duty than those countries which add flavouring. Excise Tariff Proposals No. 7 propose changes to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 complementary to the changes contained in Customs Tariff Proposals No. 34. The changes contained in these Proposals operate from tomorrow. Customs Tariff Proposals No. 35 implement changes to developing country preference rates following a limited review of the Australian system of preferences for developing countries. The changes operate from 12 November 1979 and represent a decrease in duty rates on a range of imports from developing country sources. I have had prepared a comprehensive summary setting out the nature of the duty changes, which is now being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Cass) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1979 Bill presented by Mr Groom, and read a first time. Second Reading",76
155,Mr GROOM,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill gives effect to the Government's decision, announced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his statement of 24 May 1979, to reintroduce a value limit on qualifying homes, including land, for which home savings grants may be made. These new arrangements will ensure that available funds are directed to assisting those people in most need of financial help in purchasing their homes. Other eligibility conditions of the scheme will not be altered by the Bill. Grants will continue to be payable to single people as well as to married people, and for both established and newly constructed homes, whether purchased or constructed through a building contractor or by an owner-builder. Qualifying homes include separate houses, semidetached dwellings, home units and flats; whether in suburban areas, in country towns or on rural properties. The home must be the applicant's first home in Australia, and he or she must own the land or hold tenure in an approved form. Newcomers to Australia also qualify if they had a right of permanent residence here when they acquired their homes. I remind members of the House of the savings provisions in the principal Act. In order to qualify for the maximum grant of $2,000, an applicant must have held acceptable savings of $6,000 or more, and have saved over a period of at least three years ending on the date of the contract to buy or build the home. The maximum grant of $2,000 is payable for homes bought or built since 1 January 1979. Smaller grants are payable, at the rate of $1 for each $3 acceptable savings, on shorter savings periods of one year or two years, or on acceptable savings of less than $6,000. The main forms of acceptable savings are those held with savings banks and building societies, which provide the bulk of the long termfinancefor private housing. The new value limit will apply to people who contracted to buy or build their homes, or who commenced construction of their homes as owner-builders, after 24 May when the new arrangements were announced. The Government decided that it was necessary to re-introduce a value limit so that the limited funds available for payment of grants would be directed to those people in greatest need of assistance. People whose first home is a more expensive one stand less in need of assistance from the Commonwealth, and hence the taxpayer, to achieve home ownership. A value limit on homes, which applied under the first home savings grant scheme and was envisaged in our 1975 pre-election policy statement foreshadowing re-introduction of the scheme, which the former Labor Government had legislated to abolish, is generally regarded as the fairest practicable way of directing assistance. We believe that a value limit on qualifying homes is a more equitable course than the alternatives of paying smaller grants to all first home buyers, regardless of need, or of excluding from eligibility particu' lar groups, such as single people. Industry groups agree. The Australian Bankers Association's research directorate has described the value limit as 'a sensible decision' and the Real Estate Institute of Australia welcomed the measure as 'a simple and effective form of means test'. It is also worth recording that before the decision was announced, the Opposition's spokesman on housing had been critical of the fact that people buying very expensive houses were eligible for a grant. At the time of . the announcement of the value limit earlier this year it was recognised that the limit would need to be reviewed fromtimetotimeto ensure that the amounts remain appropriate. The Bill provides that a grant will not be payable if the value of the home, including the land, the dwelling, and any other improvements to the land, exceeds $40,000. People acquiring homes valued at less than $35,000 will continue to be eligible for the full grant of up to $2,000, subject, of course, to their qualifying savings. Where the value of the home falls between $35,000 and $40,000 the grant will reduce progressively as value increases. The Bill permits variation of these limits by regulation. The value of the relevant interest in the home is to be determined by the Secretary to my Department, having regard to certain matters. The value will be the value of the home when it is erected in its completed state, including the value of any work not completed at the date the value is determined. In most cases, the point in time at which the value is determined will be the person's prescribed date. This date is referred to in the existing legislation and is the date the applicant entered into the contract to buy or build his home, or commenced its construction as an owner-builder. It is the date to which all eligibility requirements relate. Honourable members might appreciate an explanation of clause 4 of the Bill. There are situations where an applicant owns a dwelling jointly with another person, but where the dwelling is for the exclusive use of the applicant and is not occupied by that other person, who may have joined in the title merely to assist in the loan security. That other person may own another home or be otherwise ineligible, and it would be unfair to disqualify the genuine applicant because of this type of joint title situation. The existing legislation enables the interest of the other person to be disregarded where there is a joint ownership in these circumstances. Clause 4 of the Bill extends this provision to joint ownership of shares in a block of home units. In the majority of applications, the value will be the cost set out in the purchase or building contract, excluding the value of any chattels, and excluding also the value of any part of the land or dwelling not used for domestic purposes. For example, where a property is used for primary production, land in excess of one-fifth of a hectare will be excluded from the value. Also, the value of the business area of a shop and dwelling may be excluded. Correspondingly, savings expended on the non-domestic element will be excluded from savings that attract a grant. To ensure that the limit applies uniformly and equitably to all applicants, in cases where the Secretary has reason to believe that the figure shown in the contract or the stated cost is not a reasonable approximation of the value-for example, a home bought from or built by a relative of the applicant at a concessional price, or a home built wholly or partly by the applicant with his own labour and materials-arrangement s will be made for the true value to be assessed by the Commissioner of Taxation. Work done or items supplied outside the main building or purchase contract will be valued and included in the value for the purposes of the limit. The value of land gifted by another person and improvements or fixtures, such as a carport or stove, will also be included. It must be realised that the majority of people who have received grants under the Scheme are young married couples on moderate incomes acquiring modest homes. The intention of the Scheme has always been to assist such people and the new arrangements enable this assistance to continue. First home buyers purchase far less expensive dwellings than families purchasing a subsequent home. Australian famUies have long had a tradition of starting out by purchasing a modest home suited to their current needs and realistically within their reach. Later, when their circumstances permit, some will move to a larger house or to a more expensive location. Figures for home savings grant approvals for 1978-79 show that for Australia as a whole 80 per cent of recipients who purchased a home opportunity. paid less than $40,000. For New South Wales thefigurewas 78 per cent and for Victoria about 72 per cent. Thefiguresshow that the average first home buyer in Australia is a young family purchasing a house costing about $34,000, although this figure obviously varies between ies. DetaUs are available in the interim statement on the operation of the Scheme in 1978-79 which I tabled in this House this morning. Since the Home Savings Grant Schemefirstcommenced in 1964 some 500,000 grants, totaUing nearly $300m have been made to help people buy first home. MrMartyr-$300m?",77
156,Mr GROOM,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,That is right; $300m. This year $75m has been provided-a n increase of $55m over last year. This is substantial evidence Government's continuing commitment to home ownership. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Cass) adjourned. NA,79
157,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"This morning the honourable member for St George (Mr NeU) raised what he claimed was a matter of privUege. tion to an article published in the Australian newspaper of 6 November written by Mr Marcus Einfeld, QC. headed 'Politics and Prejudice' which related to Mr Michael Finnane, the in which spector appointed under the Companies Act to inquire into the company affairs of the right honourable member for New England (Mr privileges Sinclair). The honourable member for St George submitted that the article contained breaches of privilege in respect of the whole House, all members of the House, the institution of Parliaraised ment and certain members of the House. I have read the article. I am unable to conclude that any portion of it is of sufficient relevance or directness to amount to a breach of privUege or contempt of this House. GeneraUy stated a contempt of the House is any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House in the performance of its functions, or which obstructs or impedes any member or officer in the discharge of his duty. Writings reflecting on either House may be of such a nature that they obstruct the House in the performance of its functions by diminishing respect due to it. No passages in the article referred to by the honourable member for St George fall into this class. Parliament and its members by their very nature must expect comment or criticism-it is of the substance of our democratic system. I must add that I would have found the matter was not entitled to precedence about as it had not been raised at the earliest As I stated this morning, I am very concerned at cases which have arisen recently where members have intruded into the proceedings of citthe House under the guise of raising a matter of privUege and so obtained precedence over other business. Such an intrusion into the business of the House without due thought for the forms and practices of the House must be regarded by the Chair as a serious matter. I have three cases in their mind. On the 23 October the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe) raised a matter relating to the alleged refusal of a Department to answer questions submitted to it by a committee. In my opinion this matter lacked the basic requirements to constitute contempt of the House. of the On the 6 November the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) raised as a matter of privilege an apparent discrepancy in answers given before an Estimates committee and the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) at Question Time. In my opinion there was no matter of privUege involved in the matter raised. Now the honourable member for St George has raised the matter I have referred to. In my opinion no contempt of He drew attenthe House is involved. The privUeges of the House are precious rights must be preserved. The collateral obligation to this privUege of freedom of speech in the Parliament and the essential complementary of the House will be challenged unless all members exercise the most stringent responsibUity in relation to them. I reiterate what I said this morning, that when matters of privUege are I will consider them but if I come to the conclusion that there is clearly no basis whatever for the claim of privilege then I will have to report to the House that I believe that the member has misused its forms. The House may wish to consider also the method by which complaints of breach of privilege are raised in this House. I am attracted to new procedures adopted in the United Kingdom House of Commons which would prevent the forms of the House being used to raise spurious complaints. I will have the Commons procedures considered by the Standing Orders Committee for adoption by this House. NA",79
158,Mr SINCLAIR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",80
159,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does the honourable gentleman claim to have been misrepresented?,80
160,Mr SINCLAIR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I do. I did not canvass these matters earlier. They relate to the same article adverted to within the claim for privilege that was canvassed by the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil). I refer to an article by Marcus Einfeld at page 7 of the Australian of Tuesday, 6 November. I did not do so because I felt that those matters may well have been sub judice. There are five matters to which I wish to refer briefly. The first involves a suggestion. I will quote from the article: Some of these criticisms have since been met, though answered, by the launching of prosecutions. There have been no prosecutions launched against me. There have been a number of summonses and it is now necessary for the Crown to establish a prima facie case. In regard to the second matter, I quote Mr Einfeld: If heThat is Mr Finnanehad not given Mr Sinclair and the other directors and their respective lawyers, the unprecedented degree of opportunity to place submissions and propositions before afford them, he would have been pilloried as an enemy of natural justice. There was no unprecedented degree of opportunity given to me, my lawyers, or to the other directors or their lawyers. There was the same degree of opportunity as is required by the law; it was no greater and no less. In respect of the third matter, Mr Einfeld stated: . . . such a person would presumably have made different findings about Ian Sinclair than have been made by Michael Finnane. A reading of the fullreponshows this to be patently absurd. Those conclusions are predicated only on a reading of the report, not on a full reading of the evidence. I would suggest that any conclusions reached in a consideration of the report need to be measured in a consideration of all the evidence submitted to Mr Finnane and not only to that referred to in his report. I now wish to quote Mr Einfeld in relation to the fourth instance. He stated: Mr Finnane'sreporton Mr Sinclair cannot be rejected, criticised or even approached on the basis that Mr Finnane is a member of the Labor Party, any more than . . . an inquiry conducted by a judge into the activities of a politician should berejectedbecause the judge was once a member or supporter of the same or an opposing party. I draw the distinction. Mr Finnane is a continuing member of the Labor Party. A judge who was once a member of a political party is, of course, in an entirely different category. In the fifth instance, it is stated: Mr Finnane's report can only be rejected . . . if Mr Sinclair can produce, as he will-fortunatel y for him and for all of us-no w have the opportunity of doing, yet other material which demonstrates the falsity of Mr Finnane *s conclusions. It is not for me to produce evidence; it is for the Crown to establish evidence. It is for the Crown in the submission of evidence to establish that it has a prima facie case. Mr Einfeld has suggested that in some way it is for me to answer the charges. It is not. It is for the Crown to establish that the charges lie. There are other instances within the article. I have referred the article, through my solicitors, to the Bar Association. Of course, there is also the continuing concern that not matters of this ilk could well be in contempt of court. NA MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS BILL 1979 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 September, on motion by Mr MACKellar: That the Bill be now read a second time.",80
161,Dr CASS,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF," I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to subhim that he did stituting the following words: 'the Bill be withdrawn andre-draftedto(a) establish the Institute as an independent statutory authorityresponsibleto the Parliament; (b) provide the Institute with a more positive responsibility for the maintenance of cultural identities and traditions and encouragement of multiculturalism; (c) elaborate the functions of the Institute to include research into the history and phenomenon of immigration to Australia and issues related to the development of ethnic groups in Australia and their diverse cultures; (d) ensure the possibility of entering into contractural relationships with other community-based organisations engaged in activities in accord with the objectives of the Institute; (e) enable the Institute of Multicultural Affairs to conduct research into and foster community sensitivity for racial groups not the subject of study by the Institute of Aboriginal Studies while including the ambit of multicultural affairs, and (f) define members of the Institute, their method of election, and their duties and powers as members of the Institute.' As conceptualised by the Galbally report, the proposed Institute of Multicultural Affairs was to welcomed by the Opposition in 1978 as a multipurpose resource centre serving the needs of a polyethnic society. As we saw it, the Institute would document the phenomenon of immigration to our country, trace and comment on the growth of ethnic communities, sponsor crosscultural awareness, help preserve the heritage of our ethno-cultural society, promote mutual tolerance and esteem between all groups and investigate cross-cultural experiences, lifestyles and needs. In other words, whilst its main activities were to sponsor research, disseminate information and educate the community, the Institute was not envisaged by us as an academic institution in an ivory tower far removed from everyday problems studying the arts and crafts of our various communities as a sort of public relations exercise. .We envisaged it rather as a communitybased resource centre sensitive to community needs and aspirations. One of its main concerns would have been the welfare of our communities in the broader sense of the word. This meant not only social welfare but also the welfare of groups of people as ethnic communities, the relationships with children growing away from the heritage of their parents, the children's relationships to their parents and the survival of those groups as entities. It is quite clear that the concept of assimilation does not work. Nowhere in the world does assimilation work in that sense. People wish to retain their ethnic identities. We envisaged this Institution as being concerned with the welfare of communities in that sense. We envisaged that it would receive its directions from the communities themselves. But these, it seems, were pipe dreams. The Institute will be entrapped by this legislation. It will be restricted. It will have little or no relationship to the problems that I have talked about. By this legislation it is being carefully removed from the communities it is being set up to serve. Most astonishing of all is perhaps the provision for the appointment of 100 members who have absolutely no role to play. The Council of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs is, in effect, to be the Institute. Honourable members will note that as the Bill stands the Council will be purely a government machine- a creature of the government. Let us look at how the Institute is to be comthe latter in posed. Firstly, clause 10 states: (1) The Institute shall consist of(a) the members of the Council,' and (b) not more than 100 persons appointed by the Minister as members of the Institute. (2) The Minister shall consult with the Council in relation the appointment of persons as members of the Institute. Quite clearly, they are all to be government appointees. There is no doubt about that. I will cover that point in more detail later when I discuss the composition of the Council. In passing, I note that when it comes to the functions of the members of the Institute clause 11 states: Meetings of members of the Institute may be convened by the Council at such intervals and places as it thinks fit. Members of the Institute will have no rights about when and where they will meet. It will be entirely up to the Council. Let us look at the proposed Council. In clause 16 we are told: (1) The Council is responsible for the conduct and control of the affairs of the Institute. (2) All acts and things done in the name of, or on behalf of, the Institute by the Council, or with the authority of uie Council, shall be deemed to have been done by the Institute. In other words, the Council is to be the Institute. When we look at the way the Council will function we see that clause 18, which has a marginal note 'Directions by Minister', states: (1) The Council shall perform its functions and exercise its powers in accordance with such directions as may be given to it fromtimeto time by the Minister in writing. That is not unusual. It continues: (2) Sub-section (1) does not empower the Minister to give directions to the Council with respect to the content of any report to be furnished under section 17. The Minister will give directions but he will not be able to give directions to the Council in terms of the content of its reports. That looks as though we are getting a little freedom at last. But clause 18 continues: (3) In preparing any report to be furnished under section 17, the Council shall have regard to such policies of the Commonwealth Government as are communicated to the Council by the Minister in writing. In my view that sub-clause in essence completely hog ties the Institute and the Council. It is free to submit reports as it Ukes but it has to bear in mind the policies of the Government. That is like the advice given to a whole range of committees that have been set up by Liberal governments in the past. The Vernon Committee, way back in the past, had views about immigration but felt contrained to support the policy of the then Government. It was not allowed to make comments on immigration policy in relation to economic affairs, although I understand that in the substance of its report it stated that it was not able to conclude that immigration in fact gave rise to the economic benefits that were so loudly touted at the time. The Nimmo Committee was set up to look into the shortcomings of the voluntary health insurance system at the time but its guidelines were such that the Committee, for all its investigation, could not report in the terms that anyone who knew anything about it knew that it would have wanted to report. Undoubtedly, the Committee would have said that there should have been a national health insurance system. It could not say that. The closest it could go to saying that was to suggest that a government department should be set up to look after all the voluntary health insurance organisations. That was a clear indication of how it was intimated to the Nimmo Committee that it had to report within the policy of the Government, which was to support the concept of the voluntary health insurance system. The Committee could not say what it really wanted to say. The same restraint is being placed on this Council. Any report furnished by the Council, whether sought by the Minister or initiated by the Council itself, must bear in mind and, one assumes, comply with the policies of the Commonwealth Government. I think that it is almost a completely empty gesture when clause 17 states: The Council shall furnish to the Minister such reports as the Minister requests on matters relating to the functions the Institute, and may furnish to the Minister ports on matters relating to the Council thinks fit. We can see how the subsequent clause makes that clause almost meaningless. Let us now look at the proposed composition of the Council. Clause 20 states: (1) The Council shall consist of(a) a ChairmanAppointed by the Governor General on the ommendation of the Government(b) the Director of the InstituteAppointed by the Governor General on the dihave rection of the Government(c) The Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic AffairsAppointed by the Government(d) Not less than 3 or more than 6 other members. There is no other comment in that sub-clause obviously those other members will be begin appointed by the Governor General on the didemocratic rection of the Government. There is no doubt that this body is to be a mere creature of the Government. It will have nothing to do with ethnic communities. This is paternalistic tokenism of the worse possible kind. That is the reason for our amendment. Let me again read the first part of the Opposition's amendment. We think that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted to 'establish the Institute as an independent statutory authority responsible to the Parliament'. I might add in passing that not even the reports of the Council will go to the Parliament. They will go to the Minister who can sit on them, put them into a pigeonhole or bury them. If one examines that section of the Galbally report which set out the guidelines for the operation of this organisation and compare it with the Bill it will be found that there is a subtle shift in emphasis. The shift is from community based services to a nebulous government directed and government-tied set of functions. Does this shift reflect a run for shelter from the unknown consequences of immigrant participation? Is it a consequence of thoughtlessly following another piece of legislation created by this conservative, frightened Liberal Government, that piece of legislation which deals with the immigrant involvement in Australia in the area of communications-the media? I refer, of course, to the Special Broadcasting Service. Both pieces of legislation are very similar although the functions of the organisations ought to be quite different. The immigrant communities themselves are of increasingly concerned that the SBS is simply such other reanother government department, or subthe functions of the Institute as department if you like. True, broadcasters are appointed who are supposedly representing the communities but of course they are appointed by the Government. One could hazard a guess that the hundred members of this Institute to be appointed by the Government will be the equivalent of the broadcasters for the SBS-the show, the sort of outward appearance to suggest recthat somehow or other the communities themselves are involved, but in real terms they are not. The most obvious model to hand which should been the model for this legislation is the Institute of Aboriginal Studies. The legislation for that Institute ensures that it maintains a responsible yet autonomous role. Such a body would have been an appropriate model for the Institute of Multicultural Affairs. Some have said that the Institute of Aboriginal Studies would be too acaso demic but that is not how it turned out. It did as a seemingly academic institution but its structure has encouraged Aboriginal participation and involvement in crucial community needs. For example, it funds publications the such as the Palm Island reserve news sheet in north Queensland which the Queensland Government has repeatedly attempted to suppress because it voices community grievances. The Institute of Aboriginal Studies sponsors research into land claims before they go to court. So too the Institute of Multicultural Affairs ought to be investigating the community welfare needs of immigrants. It ought to be conducting research into the whole concept of group rights under the law-a n important contemporary transcultural concern. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of the Opposition's amendment covers various aspects of the objects and functions of the Institute. Let me deal with these objects and functions. Clause 5 of the Bill provides that the objects of the Institute are 'to develop among the members of the Australian community an awareness of the diverse cultures within that community'-and that is a good thing-and 'an appreciation of the contributions of those cultures to the enrichment of the community'. I do not know why it should not include 'all' cultures. It should not be only 'those cultures'-that is, particular migrant groups. I do not know whether it includes Aborigines, but it certainly ought to. The word 'all' would have been better. It should read 'an appreciation of the contributions of all cultures to the enrichment of that community'. Another object of the Institute is to promote tolerance, understanding, harmonious relations and mutual esteem. One cannot argue with that objective. Another object is to ensure that we can share with one another the diverse cultures within the legal and political structures of the society, and that is a good thing. Another object is to assist in promoting an environment which affords the members of the different cultural groups and ethnic communities in Australia the opportunity to participate in Australian society and to achieve their own potential. The only trouble with aU that is that it does not say anything in a positive sense about the ethnic communities themselves-thei r cultural identities. Hence paragraph (b) of the Opposition's amendment reads: provide the Institute with a more the maintenance of cultural couragement of multiculturalism; If one looks carefully at those objects as they are listed in the Bill it will be seen that they are really, under another form of words, promoting assimUation. They are not in fact encouraging the maintenance of identity. They are trying to ensure that everybody is tolerant to people who are a bit funny and to make sure that we do not feel odd when those people are around. That is to say, we will put up with them. There will be tolerance, harmonious relations and understanding. But there is nothing about ensuring that the Australian community recognises those groups of people, appreciates their quaUties and helps them to maintain their identity. Maybe this is overcome by the functions of the Institute. I have only dealt with the objects. The Bill provides that a primary function of the Institute is to have a major role in providing advice to the Commonwealth Government. That seems reasonable. Another primary function of the institute is to promote those objects by commissioning and conducting research and studies, which are unspecified. Another function is to furnish reports to the Minister. Why are the reports not to be furnished to the Parliament? Another function is to make information available to members of the Australian community and to particular bodies, organisations or groups within the community. That is a bit of a public relations job but as it could be educational it is therefore acceptable. Another function is to conduct promotional and educational activities. That is specified more carefully. Another function is the establishment of a repository of Uterature and other material relating to the diverse cultures of members of the Australian community. There is no mention of aspects essential to any self respecting institute supposedly involved in multiculturalism such as we mention in paragraph (c) of our amendment which reads: Elaborate the functions of the Institute to include research into the history and phenomenon of immigration to Australia and issues related to the development of ethnic groups in Australia and their diverse cultures; The Institute should be looking at how settlement first started, at what happened to the original communities-Anglo-Saxons , the Irish, the Chinese who came in and the South Sea islanders who are totally ignored. We should be having studies on what happened to those groups. Why after all these years do many of them stUl maintain their identity? They are still Irish-Australians; they are still Scots; they are still Chinese. There is no such animal as an Australian full stop. We cannot forget our ethnic positive responsibility for origin. identities and traditions and enMr Martyr-They are human beings.",80
162,Dr CASS,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"Sure , they are all human. That is one thing they do have in common, they are human. But by virtue of that and the way they have developed overtimewe ought to recognise the fact that in our community we are still different, as the honourable member for Swan and I look different. Bearing in mind the Government's oft stated concern for the involvement of community-based organisations, we find that this legislation is strangely silent. Nowhere can one find any direct involvement by communitybased organisations. One hopes it will happen. I think from comments the Minister has made before he probably has it in mind, but why could it not be stated? Paragraph (d) of the Opposition's amendment reads: Ensure the possibility of entering into contractual relationwe ships with other community-based organisations engaged activities in accord with the objectives of the Institute; We know that a number of these organisations enable exist. For example, in my own area of Melbourne search there is the Clearing House on Migrant Issues, an Studiesorganisation with enormous resources, a lot of expertise in the very areas that this Institute going to look into. I see no reason why it could excludednot be specifically mentioned in the that contractual relationships should be entered into. It would give the Council and the Institute hint on how they should go about performing their functions. The Minister in his speech referred to a conthink tinued separation between the Institute of iginal Affairs and the Institute of Multicultural Affairs. This is a technical distinction between the orginal native born and the later overseas born settlers. A purist might argue that when Aborigines came to Australia a long time ago they came across land and did not have to swim. Such a technical distinction fragments the poUcy and conception of a multicultural Australia. exclusive separation of Aboriginal affairs will perpetuate the black-white syndrome. Furtherpose more, Torres Strait islanders have been sort separated from the Aboriginal Act in will Queensland since 1971 in recognition of their different past history and their different porary circumstances and therefore to meet their different needs. I am not too sure whether the Queensland Act does much for the Torres Strait islanders but at least it is acknowledging they are Australian Aboriginals. Although the Torres Strait islanders are recognised by the Institute of Aboriginal Studies and research has been commissioned on their behalf, in the mind of the community-includin g the Minister-tha Institute is identified primarily with Aboriginal communities. I am not sure that many people recognise that Torres Strait islanders really also covered. But leaving them aside for the present, South Sea islanders hardly ever rate a mention anyif where. Although they often came initially as forced immigrants to Australia they remain Australia's forgotten people. This is a typical example of south-east Australian perspective colouring the establishment and funding of the centres that are supposedly to have a national purpose. We cannot see far enough to see all these facets of the problem. In our view the Minister ought to outline how the Institute of Aboriginal Studies and the Institute of Multicultural Affairs could and should be associated under the umbrella of one diversified society. To this end propose part (e) of the Opposition amendin ment which states that we should redraft the legislation to: the Institute of Multicultural Affairs to conduct reinto and foster community sensitivity for racial groups not the subject of study by the Institute of Aboriginal is That refers to the South Sea islanders; they are legislation while including the lattera That is, the Institute of Aboriginal Studiesin the ambit of multicultural affairs . . . They should have a very close relationship and I the legislation ought to say so. The final Aborsection of our amendment concerns the composition of the Institute. This portion appears vague in the Bill. Clause 10 of the Bill deals with 'Membership of Institute'. It states that the Institute the shall consist of members of the Council and 100 persons appointed by the Minister. As I have pointed out, the members of the Council have no functions at all unless they are called together by The the Council, They have norightsto call a meeting themselves. There is no mention of the purof these 100 people, their function, what of people they shall be, or from where they be selected to become members of the Institute. Given the function of the Council which I contemhave mentioned before and which I will reiterate-it is in essence to conduct and control the affairs of the Institute-the members of the Institute, these 100 people, are quite irrelevant. that They seem to have no function at all. I conclude on this note. To overcome these deficiencies we suggest in the final section of our amendment that the Bill should be redrafted to t define the members of the Institute. These 100 people are not defined at the moment. From where will they come? What sort of people will are they be? What will be the method of their election? We know that obviously they will be picked by the Government. WUl they just be the pets and the stooges of the Government or will they, there is meant to be some relationship with the ethnic communities, really in some way represent the communities? What will be their duties and powers as members of the Institute? As I have pointed out, they have no power whatsoever as Bill is presently drafted. For these reasons the Opposition thinks the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted in the terms we have suggested.",83
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,Is the amendment seconded?,85
164,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. Debate interrupted. NA  Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation. Statements were made in the Grievance Debate today by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) in which he alleged that I had charged to my electorate office telephone three overseas cables. That I do not deny. These telegrams were sent in an endeavour to assist three development programs within Queensland. At no stage was it my intention that the cost of these overseas cables would be borne by the Australian taxpayer. I originated the overseas cables from my electorate expectation that in due course I would receive an appropriate debit advice from the Department of Administrative Services in Brisbane asking me to meet the costs of those cables. This would be consistent with the procedures authorised by paragraph 8-1 of the Remuneration Tribunal document which relates to the use of the telephone services in my private residences. To date I have not received such a debit advice. I can assure the House that on its receipt the charges will be paid by me. I admit to the House that I erred but it was unintentional. I erred by giving my office telephone number rather than my private number. Mr Armitage- Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to make a statement.",85

He did not fully explain the matters which I brought before the House this morning. Leave not granted. Mr Armitage- I think the refusing of leave is very incorrect because the matters now brought up by no means explain the actions by which the honourable member involved other Government members and offered residential status in return for loans.,85
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Order! Having obtained leave from the Chair, the honourable member for Brisbane had the right to make a personal explanation, which he so did. Standing Orders do not allow that personal explanation to be debated. There are forms of the House, of which the honourable member for Chifley would be aware, which he can follow. NA MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS BILL 1979 Second Reading Debate resumed.",85
167,Mr FALCONER,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"The House is debating a Bill to establish the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. Clause 5 of the Bill sets out the objectives of the establishment of the Institute. I think it is worthwhile repeating at this stage just what those objectives are. Clause 5 reads: (a) to develop among the members of the Australian office with the full community(i) an awareness of the diverse cultures within that community that have arisen as a result of the migration of people to Australia; and (U) an appreciation of the contributions of those cultures to the enrichment of that community; (b) to promote tolerance, understanding, harmonious relations and mutual esteem among the different cultural groups and ethnic communities in Australia; (c) to promote a cohesive Australian society by assisting members of the Australian community to share with one another their diverse cultures within the legal and poltiical structures of that society; and (d) to assist in promoting an environment that affords the members of the different cultural groups and ethnic communities in Australia the opportunity to participate fully in Australian society and achieve their own potential. I believe that those objectives are laudable and should be supported by the Australian community. The spokesman on immigration for the Opposition, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass), made a number of criticisms. Whilst I generally take the view that he does try to conduct debates on the matter of immigration and ethnic affairs in a relatively bipartisan manner, I felt that some of his criticisms were nit picking-if I can describe them as suchand really did not get to the substance of the Bill. For example, early in his remarks he made a suggestion that this was a body just to study the arts and crafts of our society. I suggest that it is a rather more substantial body and one which will really seek to look at questions of the real content of ethnic communities in Australia, the contribution that they are making to Australian society, the history of their development and so on. I noted with interest a number of the remarks which he made with respect to the amendment which he moved on behalf of the Opposition. Firstly, the amendment proposes that the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted to establish the Institute as an independent statutory authority responsible to the Parliament. The normal procedure with statutory authorities that this Parliament establishes is that they report to the Parliament in the normal way, through the Minister responsible, in the form of an annual report. The Minister has to provide information and respond to questions in the Parliament on behalf of statutory authorities that are within his general area of portfolio responsibilities. So there is nothing unusual about the way in which this particular statutory authority is being this Parliament. The second part of the amendment suggests that the Institute should have a more positive sponsibility for the maintenance of cultural identities and traditions and the encouragement of multiculturalism. Clause S of the Bill, which sets out the objects of the establishment of the Institute, achieves that aim. I would suggest that what the spokesman for the Opposition is really debating is a question of the balance that one is trying to achieve in the wording in setting out those aims. The balance that the spokesman for the Opposition seems to be seeking to achieve is one that places an emphasis on the independence of the cultural identities and traditions, whereas Bill sets out to make the point, in a rather delibthe erate fashion, that the independent cultural traditions of various ethnic groups have great value, that they are important, and that they must be promoted, and there is an emphasis on ensuring that those conditions contribute to the total Australian community. That is something that we ought to try to achieve. I have discussed the issue of multiculturalism with people in my electorate and with various groups and, as I understand it, the one fear that does seem to be expressed by a number of people is that the concept of multiculturalism implies some sort of separate development of various groups, that we would have separate groups in our society each adhering to a different language and respecting different cultural traditions without really coming to grips with each other, and promoting tolerance and understanding between the various ethnic groups in the Australian community. That fear has been expressed amongst Australian born people and people who have come more recently from other countries. It is not a fear that I share, but I think that we have to make clear in any legislation which we put down seeking to estabUsh an institute of multicultural affairs that one of the principal objectives is to promote that tolerance, that understanding and that respect between various groups and ensure that all groups, from the standpoint of their own cultural traditions, are making a contribution to a unified Australian community- a diverse community; one which profits from diversity; one which has more colour and life because of that cultural diversity; but one which, nonetheless, is more cohesive and unified as a complete Australian community. Therefore, I believe that the wording which the Government has placed in the Bill strikes the right balance and meets the sorts of objections that are likely to be put up by people who have some fear of this concept of established by multiculturalism. The amendment put forward by the Opposition then states that the Bill ought to be re- redrafted in order to elaborate the functions of the Institute to include research into the history and phenomenon of immigration to Australia and issues related to the development of ethnic groups in Australia and their diverse cultures. It further states that the Institute ought to be enabled to conduct research into and foster community sensitivity for racial groups not the subject of study by the Institute of Aboriginal Studies while including the latter in the ambit of multicultural affairs. I am really not quite sure what the Opposition is seeking to achieve by the putting forward those suggestions. Clause 6 of Bill already states the primary functions of the Institute. One of those functions is to promote the objects in clause 5 by commissioning and conducting research and studies; I emphasise the words 'commissioning and conducting research and studies. That is a very open statement; it is a very open brief. The Institute is therefore able to commission and conduct research and studies over a broad range of matters relevant to the responsibUities of the Institute. I am not quite sure why the Opposition would seek, in a sense, to Umit the types of research which the Institute should be encouraging by trying to define that rather more closely. I would have felt that there was greater advantage in ensuring that its brief was as wide as possible in that respect, because from time to time there may arise issues which we cannot anticipate at this stage, to which would require further study and research, and to which the Institute ought to direct its attention. The Opposition's amendment also suggests that the Bill should ensure the possibUity of entering into contractual relationships with other community-based organisations engaged in activities in accord with the objectives of the Institute. As I see it that is also unnecessary because, after all, the Institute is a body corporate, it is a legal entity, it can sue and be sued, and it does have the power to enter into contractual arrangements with other legal entities. So I do not see any difficulty in that respect'. The honourable member for Maribyrnong, as I heard him, also suggested that the Institute should conduct some of its duties in accordance with the policies of the Commonwealth Government. Clause 18(3) of the Bill says that the Institute shall have regard to such policies of the Government as are communicated in writing. I emphasise the words 'shall have regard to'. I think that is a broader provision than was suggested by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. The Institute has to have regard to the policies of the Government, but is not required specifically to follow every item in accordance with the policies of the government of the day. It is relevant and proper that in its activities it should have regard to the policies of the Government because, after all, one thing that we hope will come out of the Institute is a study of the effects and the impact of the policies of the Government on the development of multiculturalism in Australia. I want to deal with a few of the sorts of fears that have come up about this concept of multhat ticulturalism. This is a term which is rather fashionable in Australia at present. I use the myself. But I think we have to be careful not become carried away with the mere our every fashionableness of it. In fact, piece of jargon which was used by the honourable member for Maribyrnong when he referred to a polyethnic society. I have heard that word used on a few occasions. It is interesting how seek to find various words to use in this context. The history of Australian migration has been in sense a history of trying to find words which acceptable and which do not offend people. the early days when migrants were often referred to as 'reffos' it was felt that the term 'new Austies, tralians' was a more appropriate term to use. Once the new Australians had been here for IS, 20 or 2 S years, apparently some of them said they did not quite like the term 'new Australian'. We have tried to find other words. Some people refer to migrants now as 'ethnics' and in some circles that also is greeted with horror. We find that we are searching for words like polyethGovernment nicity, and so on, to describe developments Australian community. We have to be a little bit careful about the in which we take up some of the jargon. What are really talking about is the fact that there in Australia a number of people who have cornt here from more than 100 countries-the e and half million people to be fairly exact-^iuce the Second World War. Forty per cent of .hose people have come from the United Kingdom and the rest from more than 100 countries. They have all made a contribution to the development of the Australian community. In my view they have added to the degree of tolerance within the Australian community. In the course of my lifetime, and I am by means the oldest member of this Parliament 1I have noticed a change in the attitude of Australians to other cultural traditions. Fifteen or twenty years ago we tended to take the attitude that all migrants to Australia ought to become just like us and and should learn to like the footle, the beer, the meat pie, et cetera. I am exaggerating, of course, but that attitude was apparent. At present, an increasing number of Australians are taking to looking at soccer, and there is no doubt that it is a better football game. An increasing number of Australians are enjoying the sorts of diverse experiences which are now available in our country as a result of the great contribution that has been made by many people from many different lands. Honourable members will see it in the variety of restaurants are avaUable, the fashions and architectural designs. In countless ways the great migration term programs which have taken place in Australia to since the Second World War have touched upon day lives. That has been to the advanI noticed another tage of Australia. Regrettably, some instances have also occurred of particular migrant communities having we within their ranks people who have sought to promote old divisions. I will not mention them a because I do not want to specify certain migrant are communities. That has happened to some deIn gree. We need to get across to people the impression that we want them, in their communito make the best contribution they can to the wider Australian community, by bringing in all of those elements which are desirable, by educatthat ing natural born Australians and people who come from other countries in their cultural tradtion, but also we want them to leave behind the enmities from which they have tried to escape in many cases. I think it is to the credit of this that it legislated, for example, to in the prevent recruiting for overseas armies in Australia. I think that is useful not only in itself, but also as a declaration by this Parliament that way we do not want people who are now part of the we Australian community contributing to the mainare tenance of divisions within their home countries. It is with great pleasure that I rise to support this Bill. I believe that the Opposition's amendand ments are quite unnecessary. I believe that the Institute ought to be established in the manner proposed by the Government in this Bill. I am sure that it will make a contribution to the opment of a richer, more diverse but more coherparently ent Australian community.",85
168,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"The whole issue of immigration is one which has some accord politically and, indeed, throughout Australia at the present time. I am not sure this was always the case. I suppose we can now that there is something like a unity ticket evidence. Mr Martyr-What!",88
169,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,It is a lovely bit of terminology. Mr Martyr- I don't like it.,88
170,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,The honourable member may have a Uttle to learn about the information term. Mr Martyr- I have nothing to learn about over unity tickets.,88
171,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"He may have a little to multiculturalism. learn about the setting in which I make that comThat ment. It is very much in character with the to founder of our immigration policy,, the late Arthur Calwell. I think all parliamentarians with any knowledge and experience about these resentations things will concede that he was very forward looking when, as Labor Minister for Immifavor gration, he initiated this program. I recall that former member for Parkes, the late Leslie to Haylen, was sent as an emissary overseas to can charter the first ships to bring the migrants here. The unity ticket now, having had that creative work done way back in the early post-war years, is to give effect to the spirit of immigration make the passage and pathway for our migrant people more easy or reasonable. Mention has been made of the success of program for which governments of both political complexions can take credit. It is an enormous phenomenon of our time that three and a half contend million people from 100 countries have come to our country, as the Minister for Immigration Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKeUar) has said. Forty per cent of those 3.5 mUUon migrants in the postThat war intake are of EngUsh origin. This does detract from the fact that there have been many problems and there are still many problems to ironed out. I think we are achieving social harmight mony. I sincerely hope that this measure will contribute to an even greater attainment respect. All of us speak at citizenship ceremonies make mention of the fact that migrants have come to enrich our lives, that some of our own traditional behaviour patterns have become subjective and that the finer qualities often tend to develemerge dominative. I suppose that is more apthe case in the culinary area than in some other areas. We love migrant food. We go to the Chinese and Hungarian restaurants and do things of that kind. For the sake of succinctness which I will obvithat ously have to develop in view of the time, it say might be convenient for me just to make some in mention of the purposes of this legislation as summarised by the excellent Partiamentary Library digest service. It makes reference to the fact that the Galbally report commissioned by the Government in 1977 was virtually the instigator of this Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. I quote from the digest: The report pointed out the need for skilled research and on experience in other countries to assist in the development of multiculturalism in Australia. The report also recommended that the Commonwealth provide $1.8m a three-year period to establish an Institute of Multicultural Affairs to provide advice and information on puts the position in a nutshell. Now there is be a Council of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. I know that not everybody can see the potential of this. In fact, I have had repof a cynical nature contending that the Government is using this process to curry with the migrant community. I suppose a that if honourable members look at this proposal establish a council of up to 100 members, they easUy see that it could become such a vehicle. In fact, there has been criticism about the old advisory groups that used to meet and the big beanoes that were held in Canberra by large and to numbers of migrant people over the years. The contention has been made that that was also used to give people a few days in Canberra at the the Government's expense. Whether or not that is cynical only the beholders and the initiators of the scheme are in a position to say. It is fair to also that there is an antipathy to the proliferation of boards and things governmental in and the community. We are talking about $1.8m to set this Institute up over a three-year period. is certainly not the end of the section finannot cially by any means. We would be setting up something that would be very hard to stop. It will be have a very enduring characteristic about it. We be talking of hundreds of mUlions of dollars over a period of several decades. So this is in that very significant legislation indeed. Clause 6 of the Bill indicates the primary functions of the Institute. The emphasis is on integration, not assimilation and that is important. That means that we are going to identify and provide for a situation which will facilitate the preservation of the ethnic cultures. As such, that emphasis should be supported. For many years the concept of a multicultural society has been bandied about, but in point of fact very few people know what is entailed in this concept. I do not profess to know myself. I do not suppose we will know what this thing is about until it is in operation. The Institute itself will have the task of determining multiculturalism in Australia, and certainly, to a large extent its own role. The Government takes the view and intends that the Institute adopt a practical educational and action oriented approach. It therefore has the task of analysing and disseminating information on ethnic cultures and backgrounds. The Government hopes that the Institute will come to be regarded as a national resource centre on the cultural background of Australia's migrant people. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) who is the shadow spokesman on these matters has indicated the nature of a complex amendment which he moved at the second reading stage of the Bill. Of course that is already incorporated in Hansard. We intended in the Committee stage to move a number of amendments to give effect to his second reading amendment. To save time.

172,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"I want to get this speech over with by 6 p.m. because I understand that the Minister has an engagement after that time. Jettisoning a number of other things that I wanted to say, I move on to say that, having regard to a few remarks I made a moment ago, there is a need in my view to get a practical footage to this whole thing. The Minifter will recall that some time ago I brought to him a proposal that the Government should support the Wollongong Centre for Multi-Cultural Studies. In the few minutes that remain I want to pursue that and say that the development within the University of Wollongong of a centre for multi-cultural studies was a response to the need for migrant education and the need to provide sufficient opportunity for full multi-cultural integration in the Australian community. A complex research objective has been undertaken at the Wollongong University. The Centre has undertaken research into a number of problems. Histories have already been written of various ethnic people in the Illawarra Region, including the Dutch, German, Italian, Greek and the Aborigines on the far South Coast. Studies have been involved with the effectiveness of television programs as a means of teaching English as a second language. Studies on the experience of migrant women in the work force and on learning problems, especially language difficulties among migrant children, have been carried out. As the Centre develops further it is hoped that there will be an expansion of archival and documentary material such as letters and accounts by individual migrants of their experiences in Australia. In association with that Centre for Multi-Cultural Studies at the University, it is intended that there should be a downtown resource centre where there should be a two-way process-learnin g from migrants and supporting and assisting them as well. In my view Wollongong should be considered as a possible location for the proposed Institute's headquarters. It is a great and successful multisubsti- cultural city. Migrants and Australian born are engaged together in the great steel industries of subsitute Australia, at Broken HU1 Pty Co. Ltd,'Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd and other works. Together substi- the non-indigenous ethnic groups are probably in higher proportion in Wollongong than in any comparable part of Australia. There are many serious problems concerning migrants in that city. These problems are in the area of housing, education and very serious unemployment. In Wollongong there is great fulfilment on the one hand and despair and degradation on the other. It is an atmosphere of multi-cultural reality. I think that is what is needed in respect of this proposed Institute. It is in Wollongong and a few other places like it in Australia that practitioners in ethnic affairs can demonstrate their skUls and capacities. It is in WoUongong that the ethnic communities can make their voices heard. If the proposed Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs is to go to the rarefied atmosphere of Canberra, then important components of its activities should, in my view, go to Wollongong or some other substantial multi-cultural community where the Institute could be encouraged to keep its academic and intellectual feet on the ground. I issue a word of warning to the Minister and to the Government that there can easUy be a tendency to take this whole issue into an area of unreality. I believe that it will be very important to look at what has already been done and to link into those things. There can be no better example than the activities initiated by the WoUongong University. Once again I ask the Minister to consider the possibUity of giving this proposed institute a realistic base such as could be made available in the Wollongong University setting. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr MACKellar) read a third time.",90
173,Unknown,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. WHEAT MARKETING BILL 1979 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time.",91
174,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"Gippsland-Minister for New Transport and Minister for Primary Industry (8.0)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill and six accompanying Bills provide the implementation of wheat marketing and pricing arrangements in respect of the five case, seasons beginning 1 October 1979. As in the case of pastfive-yearwheat industry marketing and stabilization arrangements, complementary legislation is to be enacted each of the States. In fact elements of the rangement rely on State law. I refer in particular to the provisions requiring growers to deliver their wheat to the Australian Wheat Board, the marketing of wheat domestically and the pooling of the proceeds of the sale of wheat for payment to growers. There has been a tiating the elements of the pricing and marketing arrangements for the wheat industry every five years to enable account to be taken of the changed needs and circumstances of the indusreceived try. An enquiry and report by the Industries sistance Commission on the arrangements to apply after the expiry of thefive-yearplan that ended on 30 September 1979 has provided a basis for review of the industry arrangements on this occasion. The IAC report was released licly in July 1978 to enable all sectors of the dustry and the States to consider the formulation of new arrangements. Orderly Marketing of Wheat Traditionally the industry's arrangements have been based on the application of orderly marketing. For the wheat industry that concept entails the delivery of all wheat, other than that retained by the grower for his own use, only to licensed receiver of an statutory authority no other buyers and the distribution of the proprinciples ceeds of the sales of that wheat to growers on equitable basis. The concept also entails the user industries in Australia receiving their needs wheat from the Australian Wheat Board and from no other supplier and paying a price that equitable as between the competing users industry. The orderly marketing of wheat has been challenged before the High Court and the IAC made recommendations for change. The latest High Court case, Uebergang and Others v. Australian Wheat Board, involves, amongst other issues, a chaUenge on the basis of Section 92 of the Constitution to the application Second Reading of the Wheat Industry StabUization Act 1974 of South Wales to interstate transactions. A simUar challenge was rejected by the High Court on 8 September 1978 in what is known as the Clark King case. The fact that there is a further High Court challenge to the same legislation for does not preclude the Commonwealth and State Governments, in reliance upon the Clark King from enacting legislation for the purpose of establishing wheat marketing legislation to apply for the next five years. Whether further Review legislation or a constitutional amendment is desirable would depend upon the outcome of the challenge in the Uebergang case. The orderly by marketing of wheat has been considered by the arStates, the Australian Wheat growers' Federation and the user industries. The proposition has not been accepted that there are significant savings to be made in the receival and storage of wheat by introducing commercial trading between producers and users in the domestic marhistory of renegoketing of wheat. A characteristic of the industry is that grain is harvested in a relatively short period and into silos. Supplies are then drawn from Asstorage throughout the year for the needs of users and for export shipment. The cost of this handling and storage is borne by the industry. WhUst some individual growers would be able to escape these costs by delivering direct to a buyer, pubthis saving would only be avaUable because a inmajority of growers were prepared to support and meet the cost of the infrastructure required to meet the demonstrable needs of the industry. The commercial trading of wheat would enable individual growers to sell to the more lucrative sectors of the market and so reduce the pool return of those growers whose wheat is orderly marketed through the loss to the pool of revenue from these higher priced outlets. The individual a grower would have an option of delivering to the and to orderly marketing system. The fundamental of orderly marketing provide the basis an for continuation of the wheat delivery and marketing arrangements for the new five year period. of However, there are modifications of the payments arrangements for growers and the pricing is procedures for buyers of wheat, to meet the in each present circumstances of the industry. In developing these modifications several key factors have been considered. These include the market for feed wheat that could enable producers and users to trade on a commercial basis. This market facility could provide growers with a cash flow to their enterprises different from that afforded by the Board's receival and payments system. By contrast, the Australian Wheat Board's payments to growers from a season's pool have been spread over a longer period. This lengthening of payments has been caused by the increasing need for the Board to sell wheat internationally on deferred payment terms to meet competition from other major exporting countries. This in turn has led to the need to establish arrangements forfinancingdiscounted payments that are made to those growers whose cash flows have been reduced by drought-affected crops and other factors. Guaranteed Minimum Delivery Price The Industries Assistance Commission considered that the continuation of the stabilisation assistance arrangement for the wheat industry could not be justified on either efficiency or welfare grounds and recommended its discontinuation. The arrangement provided for contributions by growers to a stabilisation fund, from which payments are made when the average export price is less than the stabilisation price for a season. Provision existed for payments from Government revenue, within defined limits, when there are insufficient growers' moneys in the fund. In place of these stabilisation arrangements, the Government has decided that growers should receive a substantial payment when their wheat is received by the Australian Wheat Board. This payment will be made on all wheat delivered to the Australian Wheat Board and it will be set at 95 per cent of the average of the estimated pool return for that season and the two previous seasons, converted to a net basis. The payment will be guaranteed by the Commonwealth. The net pool return is converted to a net basis for the purpose of the guaranteed minimum price calculations by taking the net proceeds of the disposal of the wheat of a season and deducting the costs incurred by the Board in relation to the wheat of that season. Movements in the guaranteed minimum delivguarantee ery price from one season to the next are to subject to a limit of 15 per cent. Any deficiency between the net pool return and the guaranteed minimum delivery price will be met by the Comthat monwealth as a payment from revenue when the particular pool is finalised. The guaranteed mum price arrangements provide the industry with support from the Government that is designed to help it overcome any short run down turn in producers' returns. At the same time the basis for determining the guaranteed minimum price ensures that the support will be inevitably modified with longer run adjustments in market returns whether those adjustments be for a rising or a falling market. The legislation recognises that the guaranteed support will enable the Australian Wheat Board to make afirstpayment to growers on delivery of their wheat at the level of the guaranteed minimum delivery price less the wheatfinancefund levy, the wheat tax and individual growers' freight, handling and storage charges. It is the intention that the guaranteed minimum delivery price for each season be announced before 1 December each year when the bulk of the harvest commences to be delivered. The provision of the guarantee thus enables growers to receive a cash payment when their wheat is delivered that represents a substantial proportion of their final return. This innovation is designed to overcome the delayed pool payments and maintain a cash flow to growers. The payments arrangements in respect of the guaranteed minimum price do not impinge on the ability of the Board to offer cash discounting facilities to growers on payments subsequent to the guaranteed minimum price payment to meet the needs of particular growers. This arrangement evolved during the life of the present scheme and will be a useful adjunct to the payments arrangements when the final pool return is well above the guaranteed delivery price. The modification to the Australian Wheat Board's historical pool payment procedure which I have outlined will be of great value to growers in planning their financial commitments and budgeting the cashflowof their enterprises. Wheat Board Finance Traditionally, the Australian Wheat Board has borrowed from the Rural Credits DepartmentRCD-of the Reserve Bank to obtain funds to make thefirstpayment to growers on delivery of their wheat and to meet the pool's marketing expenses. Under the Reserve Bank Act a statutory twelve months repayment period attaches to RCD loans and the Government has provided a of Wheat Board repayment within be that statutory period. Increases in borrowings from the RCD can add to domestic liquidity in a fiscal year to the extent that they are not repaid in period. It has become necessary to develop newfinancingarrangements to enable the Board minito borrow to meet the changed character of the payment arrangements. These arrangements entail new borrowing rights and obligations for the Wheat Board. The changed provisions also reflect the experience of financing the substantial increase in funds needed by the Wheat Board to pay the higher level of first advance for deliveries from the record 1978-79 season's crop. The provisions recognise the significance of the wheat industry in terms of its ability, through the very size of seasonal cash flow, to influence national liquidity. Thefinancingchanges provided for in the Bill are in fact similar to those already embodied in legislation assented to in July but which had application to the 1978-79 season only. The new financing arrangements embodied in the Bill provide for the Board to borrow from the Rural Credits Department to pay the guaranteed minimum delivery price to growers and meet marketing expenses. This provision reflects a continuation of the past arrangement. The Board will be able to borrow from commercial sources. Should the Government require the Board to borrow commercially within the statutory twelve months period for purposes that RCD moneys would normally have been available, the Commonwealth will meet any borrowing costs that are additional to those that would have occurred had the borrowing been from the RCD. Should, under these arrangements, the Board be unable to borrow from commercial sources for the purposes of payingfirstadvances or meeting marketing expenses within the statutory period, it is the Government's intention that the RCD should provide the necessary finance. Whilst the Government will guarantee repayment of any borrowings by the Board from the RCD it is the Government's intention that the Wheat Board should borrow commercially any money necessary, additional to that available from thefinancefund to be established by this legislation, to refinance any outstanding RCD drawings at the end of the statutory twelve months period. The linking of the guaranteed minimum price with the first payment, the consequent high level of the first payment and the magnitude of the funds required, may have the effect of reducing the Wheat Board's ability to repay its RCD borrowings within the statutory period. To assist the Board to meet its refinancing obligation a wheat finance fund will be established. The fund will be a trust fund of growers' moneys. It will have a ceiling of $100m and will be financed by the transfer of the $80m in the existing wheat prices stabilisation fund together with the proceeds of a levy on wheat marketed under the control of Wheat Board. As with the stabilisation fund, the wheatfinancefund, will be a revolving one, with any excess in the fund being returned to growers on afirst-infirst-outbasis. Thefinancefund will provide a source of funds from which the Board will be able to borrow on a seasonal basis to clear any outstanding debt to the RCD on a season's pool at the end of the statutory twelve months period. Borrowings from the Fund will be made its at a rate of interest determined by the Minister having regard to rates applying to Reserve Bank fixed deposits or Commonwealth securities. The provision for the Board to make commercial borrowings onfinancepayments to growers that was included in earlier legislation is brought forward in this Bill. In fact this provision will be taken into account when the Government will again seek arrangements forfinancingadvances to growers in 1979-80. As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said in his Budget Speech, so as to minimise the addition to liquidity as was the case last year. Any arrangements that are made will not be at extra cost to growers. Domestic Price The arrangements for the pricing of wheat sold on the domestic market recognise the different components of that market, namely, the use of wheat for milling into flour for human consumption and the use of wheat for stock feed and for industrial purposes. The arrangements also recognise that in past five-year plans there have been significant national income transfers between consumers and growers as a result of the arrangements then operating. Accordingly, the present Bill introduces some changes in the basis for setting domestic prices for wheat. Instead of the existing arrangement under which one price is fixed under the legislation for all wheat, regardless of the purpose for which it is used, there is provision for the Wheat Board tofixthe prices of wheats for stock feed and industrial uses. When fixing these prices the Board will have to balance the commercial interests of producers and users and maintain the orderly marketing of wheat produced and used for these purposes. In carrying out this responsibility the Board will be able to appoint an advisory panel comprising representatives of producers, stock feed manufacturers and industrial wheat users. This panel would assess the accuracy, comprehensiveness and relevance of data that should be taken into account in determining prices. It would not recommend price levels. The change in pricing procedures recognises the that the markets for wheat used for stock feed and industrial purposes are different from those of the market for wheat used for human consumption. It is intended that the Board should be able to meet the needs of those different markets. For the 12 months commencing 1 December 1979 the price of wheat for human consumption throughout Australia will be fixed under this Bill and complementary State legislation at $127.78 a tonne, excluding the Tasmanian freight loading. For the following four marketing years the price will be moved each year according to the formula set out in the Schedule to the Bill. That formula adjusts the price in line with movements in export prices and an index of prices paid by farmers while providing, over time, a margin above export prices. Year to year movements in the formula price are to be subject to a limitation of 20 per cent. The new pricing formula replaces the existing arrangements which provide for an annual variation in accordance with cash costs of wheat production. In taking account of the trend in export prices the formula is intended to moderate the national income tranfers between producers and consumers that have occurred in the past. Special Delivery Provisions The role of the Australian Wheat Board as sole seller on the domestic market will tinued. This role rests on the continuation requirement that all wheat delivered off farms received only by the Board. However, the delivgrown ery arrangements will be modified to enable growers with the authority of the Australian Wheat Board to exercise options in the delivery and marketing of wheat. This new element of flexibility is designed to meet the needs of growers. There are growers who are so placed geographically that there is an advantage both them and to the buyer in delivering their wheat direct to the user rather than to the central receival system. There are also growers whose wheat has a special characteristic that is amenable to be handled by the central receival system but which can be taken by a user delivered directly. It is proposed that growers be authorised apply to the Board to be permitted to sell liver their wheat direct to a buyer other than a censed receiver of the Australian Wheat Board. The Board in turn will be authorised to grant permit for delivery by a grower direct to a buyer subject to conditions the Board determines as price, freight allowance and any premiums discounts in relation to the Australian Standard Wheat price. Consistent with the concept of orderly marketing to which I have referred the proceeds of sales of the wheat will be incorporated in the Board's pooling arrangements and the provisions for payments to growers apply as if the wheat had in fact been delivered to the Board's pool. However, provision is to be made for any quality differential agreed by the grower and buyer and for any cartage cost adjustment to be passed back to the grower. In recognition of the fact that the central receival system continues as an alternative delivery option available to the grower, provision will be made for the Board to deduct from the payment to the grower a charge-coverin g capital, depreciation and costs of maintaining capital equipment-relatin g to costs associated with the bulk handling authority relevant to the particular grower. The specific charge will be determined under State legislation. Authority for the issue by the Board of a permit to a grower to deliver or sell wheat other than to the Board's receival system will continue as at present in respect of wheat delivered by a grower to a miller for gristing for the return of the produce of the grist for use on his farm. A similar permit to deliver outside the receival system will also apply to seed wheat and inferior quality wheat including screenings not acceptable for be conreceival by the Board. The arrangements of the proposed continue the principle of wheat be retained by the grower on the farm on which it is remaining outside the control of the Board. In recognition of the structure of ownership of wheat growing and livestock feeding enterprises it is proposed that this principle be extended to exclude from the Board's pricing and delivery arrangements wheat which is transferred from the property on which it is grown to to another farm under the same ownership for the purpose of livestock feeding on that farm. To ensure that such joint enterprise transfers do not become an avenue for the undermining of not the wheat orderly marketing arrangements the Wheat Board will be provided with the power to if control and monitor the movements of such wheat. The modification to the basic delivery provisions which have served the industry over to time are designed to meet the changed needs of or dethe industry by providing growers with a lispecification of their rights to deliver wheat to other than the central receival system. At the a sametimeprotection through controls to be exercised by the Board and through the pooling arto rangements is provided for the orderly marketor ing arrangements of the industry. The arrangements include the insurance that growers who engage in direct delivery transactions contribute to the maintenance of the central receival system, which is an essential part of those orderly marketing arrangements. Tasmanian Freight Loading The principle of the domestic consumer meetthe ing the cost of shipping wheat from the mainland to Tasmania is to be continued. As previously, Bill. moneys to cover this cost will be raised by a loading on the domestic wheat price. However, this loading will apply to wheat only for human consumption because this will be the only administratively determined price under the new arrangements that may not be adjusted within each 12 month period to meet the market. Moneys so raised will be used to meet shipping costs on all wheat shipped from the mainland Tasmania, regardless of the port drawn. As has always applied, the freight to Tasmania fund established by the legislation will cover shipping costs only and not, for example, transport costs within Tasmania. Features Remaining Unchanged The Bill includes a number of features embodied in existing wheat stabilisation legislevy lation. The provisions for delivering quota rangements remain, purely as a contingency measure. Implementation of quotas would necessarily require the agreement of all States. Other main features which remain unchanged under that Bill. are the seven year period for all except the pricing provisions of the Bill which continue to have afiveseason life, the constitution and general powers of the Wheat Board and the power of direction by the Minister. The Bill contains a clause giving retrospective validation to remuneration paid by the Wheat Board to bulk handling authorities under current and previous wheat stabilisation legislation. Such remuneration was paid according to a basis agreed by Federal and State Ministers, as required by the legislation. Ministerial agreetime. ments were on a retrospective basis. Legal advice received was that payments made under retrospective agreements could only be validated enactment of appropriate legislation. Conclusion The wheat marketing and pricing arrangements embodied in the Bill have been deter1979 mined after extensive discussion and consideration of the IAC report and recommendations and after serious and lengthy consideration of views put forward by all interests concerned. arrangements have the support of the industry and all State governments. The provision of the guaranteed minimum deliverly price, in particuvided lar, will give the wheat grower confidence future. Generally, the arrangements will enable the wheat industry to go ahead into the next five. years with some assurance of predictability and security. Such is the importance of the industry to national economy that this can only be to the benefit of Australia as a whole. I commend the Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned.

182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the seven measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",97
183,Mr WILLIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The BUls like now before the House cover a wide variety of intively come tax measures. Their principal effect is to close off various tax avoidance loopholes and increase substantially the income tax burden taxpayers as a whole for thisfinancialyear by reimposing a tax surcharge and denying any come tax indexation. The Opposition strenuously supports the tax avoidance measures but just strenuously opposes the Government's measure to increase substantially income tax across board. The BUls also give effect to various less important alterations to the Income Tax Assessmonth. ment Act. The Opposition does not oppose those changes. The only Bill that we oppose comfinancial pletely is the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill. This is the Bill which imposes the tax surcharge and denies indexation of the tax scale thisfinancialyear. Let me say at the outset that we strongly object to the complete misrepresentation of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) of the impact of this Bill in his second reading speech. He The main feature of the Bill is the removal of the income tax surcharge imposed as a temporary measure for the 1978-79 financial year. That statement simply is not true. This Bill does not remove any surcharge. In fact, it imposes a surcharge of 1.07c in the dollar at all levels of taxable income. Certainly, this surcharge is less than that applying to the previous year, which Second Reading was 1.57c in the dollar, but to describe the Bill as removing the income tax surcharge is totally and completely untrue. What it does is reduce the surcharge by 29 per cent, not remove it as the Treasurer claims, taxes of the Bill, therefore, is that people with a taxable income of between $3,893. and $ 16,608, which includes most people who pay income tax, will pay 33.07c in every dollar over $3,893 instead of the standard rate of 32c in the dollar. Of course, the Government is very sensitive about this and is doing its best to deceive the Australian people as to what is really going on. I am sure, that most honourable members recall the interview of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on radio the morning after the Budget. Quite ineptly and deceptively he attempted to assert that what the Budget did was to cut income taxes. In his second reading speech on the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill the Treasurer just as deceptively attempted to give the same impression to the Parliament and the people. The impact of the surcharge on taxpayers in this country will be quite considerable. Although an amount of 1.07c in the dollar may not sound very much it will mean that taxpayers coUecwUl pay out an additional $600m this year. That is far from being a minor sum. It should be to clearly understood that all Government supon porters who vote for this Bill will be supporting the removal of that amount of additional income infrom taxpayers by way of increased income tax. Certainly Government supporters will claim, as as the Prime Minister' and the Treasurer have already claimed, that taxes are being reduced the thisfinancialyear because pay-as-you-earn deductions will be reduced after the end of this This will certainly be the case because these taxpayers have been paying tax so far this year at the same rate as that which they paid for the last seven months of the previous year. The surcharge for the last seven months of 1978-79 on PA YE deductions was 2.47c in the dollar. Averaged out over 12 months it became 1.5c in ihe dollar, which was the surcharge applicable to all taxpayers in that year. This year the continuance of the surcharge of 2.47c in the dollar for the first five months of thefinancialyear will average out over the whole 12 months to 1.07c in the dollar. That is the surcharge applicable to all taxpayers this year. It is imposed by the legislation now before the House. The supposed tax cuts in December that the Government is so anxious to capitalise on are, in fact, nothing more than a consequence of pay-as-you-earn taxpayers having paid in thefirstfivemonths of the year the full year's surcharge on their income tax for the whole year. The legislation now before the House also creases the level of income tax on taxpayers denying any tax indexation. The concept of tax indexation to which the Government was supstatement posedly committed involves adjusting the tax scale for inflation so that as taxpayers' incomes increase with inflation they do not have their burden-that is the proportion of their income that they pay in tax-increase d automatically. adjusting the tax scale for inflation, the proincreasing portion of income that taxpayers whose incomes increase with inflation will pay in tax will remain unchanged. That at least is the theory. Although the Fraser Government claimed to be committed to full indexation, it has never applied full indexation. It discounted various price rises first two years of office and in 1978-79 it applied what it said was half indexation. In fact, it more like one-third indexation. For the current year there will be no indexation at all. As < onsequence, the proportion of income that y - iyers will pay in tax will increase. cost to taxpayers of being denied ji.i'.wation is not incidental; it is $487m, according to thefiguresgiven by the Treasurer. Thus me total increase in income tax because of the continuance of a substantial surcharge and the non indexation of the tax scales will be, on the figures given by the Treasurer, $1,087m. That the cost of the Government's broken promises. The promise that last year's tax surcharge would be only temporary and would end by 30 June this year and the promise to restore tax indexation. tion this year were both broken in the infamous May mini-Budget. The cost to taxpayers of those btoken promises is being felt right now. As have said, collectively it amounts to a sum of proximately $1,100m. The excuse given by Treasurer for not implementing tax indexation this year is that the Government to reduce the surcharge and implement tax indexation. It decided, therefore, to reduce the surcharge, and to try to convince people that it would be abolished in December, and not implement tax indexation on the basis, so the Treasurer said, the people do not understand it. That is an extraordinarily interesting statement by the Treasurer. If we compare what the Government put forward as its reason for originally supporting tax indexation it does notfitat all. What the Government said originally was that it was essential to have tax indexation because it was necessary to keep governments honest and to stop them increasing taxes by stealth. Therefore, if we abolish tax indexation it follows logically, from the Government's own argument, in that what we are doing is increasing taxes by by stealth and that the Government is not being honest. That clearlyflowsfrom the Treasurer's that people do not understand tax indexation. In a large measure he is right; they do not understand it. But the fact remains that tax what he is doing by not implementing tax indexation is, in the words of himself, the Prime By Minister and other Government spokesmen, taxes by stealth and being dishonest. It is absurd for the Treasurer to claim that it is reasonable to have forgone tax indexation this year because people do not understand it. It simply does not accord at all with the previous tax statements the Government has made about the in its essential need to have tax indexation. The Treasurer also has said that tax indexation was will be restored only when we can get inflation down. What an absolutely ridiculous and absurd a statement that is. Tax indexation has relevance taxonly when there is inflation. If there were no inflation tax indexation would be a totally irreltax evant concept because people would not be movup the tax scale according to the level of inflation; therefore there would be no increase in taxation by stealth at least in respect of the inflation factor although there could be in respect of increases in real income. Essentially, the inflation is argument means that there is no inflation and there is no need to have tax indexation. The Treasurer says: 'If we can get inflation down to almost nothing we will give you back tax indexaBut if we cannot do that, if inflation remains high, there is no way we can have tax indexation'. So when the people really need it, when it I is important and relevant, they will not get it. apWhen it is irrelevant or nearly irrelevant this the Government might decide to give it to them. That is the kind of situation we are in at the could not afford present time. The Treasurer also defended non-indexation by saying that there are now only three marginal rates instead of the previous seven; therefore tax indexation is less important in that context. That again is a totally absurd and nonsensical argument. There is total confusion between marginal rates and average tax rates. It does not matter how many steps there are provided the scale is somewhat progressive. If there is no tax indexation under a progressive income tax scale and people's incomes increase with inflation they will inevitably pay a higher and higher proportion of their income in tax, as indeed was the case for the period from about 1954 to the early 1970s under previous Liberal-Country Party governments when almost without exception people annually moved up the tax scale because of nonindexation of the schedule. There was afiveper cent surcharge in some years and afiveper cent reduction in others but the general movement was up the scale because of non-indexation. If there is a progressive tax scale, irrespective of whether it has three,five,seven or 15 steps, and it is not indexed, there will be an increase in the tax burden simply by the process of inflation and without the Government's doing anything actually to increase tax rates. It is ridiculous in the treme to argue, as the Treasurer does, that because there are now three levels indexation is less relevant. The tax increases which have been imposed in this Budget are very substantial, as is illustrated by what I have already said. The overall figures reveal that the increase in income tax receipts this year, calculated on the Budget assumption that wages will increase by 9 per cent to 9.5 per cent, will be 18.2 per cent. There we have itwages up 9 per cent to 9.5 per cent and taxes up 18 per cent. Quite clearly that indicates a very large increase in the overall tax burden. But this increase in the tax burden is not evenly applied. Low income earners will be made to pay a much higher percentage rise than high income earners. In my speech on the Budget. I incorporated in Hansard tables which illustrate this quite clearly. Let me cite some of those figures. A single taxpayer on $8,000 last year will, with a 9 per cent rise in income this year, have a 16 per cent increase in tax. A single person on $6,000 last year will, with a 9 per cent rise this year, have a 24 per cent increase in tax. A single person on $5,000 last year will have a 38.9 per cent increase in tax. But at the other end of the scale, a single person on $ 100,000 last year will have a increase of 9.6 percent. As you go up the scale, the percentage inbusinesses, creases in tax, as a result of the various measures in this Budget and in the legislation now before the House, go down. Quite clearly that is utterly inequitable. The same situation is true in respect of taxpayers with dependants. Those taxpayers on $8,000 will have an increase of 28 percent but for those on $100,000 the increase will be 9.6 per cent. Quite clearly these measures impose not only a very substantial overall increase in the tax burden but also do it in a thoroughly inequitable way by loading the greatest percentage increases on those who can least afford to pay additional amounts of tax. But that is a matter of small relevance to this Government. The increase in the tax burden on taxpayers in this country under the Fraser Government has been remarkable. The large income tax increase in this financial year, encompassed in the Bills now before the House, makes a mockery of the Government's claim to be a low tax party. In fact, this Government's period in office has been marked by increases in the tax burden which take the overall tax burden to the highest level in the history of our country. Let me prove that with variousfiguresrelating to increasing the income extax burden on Australian taxpayers. First, let me look at individual tax receipts as a share of gross domestic product. In the three years of the Labor Government receipts averaged 12 per cent; that is, the total amount of income tax receipts under the period of the Labor Government as a proportion of the gross domestic product was 12 per cent. In thefirstthree years of the Fraser Government it was 13.1 per cent. It was notably up on thefigurefor the period when the Labor Government was in office. In thisfinancialyear, using the Government's estimates for prices and real growth in gross domestic product, and the revenuefiguresin the Budget, income tax receipts from individuals this year as a share of gross domestic product represent 13.3 per cent. So it is moving up all thetime.This Government clearly is moving into a higher and higher tax impost on the Australian taxpayers. Pay-as-you-earn tax receipts as a proportion of wages and salaries paid for the three years of the Labor Government were at 9.3 per cent. For the first three years of the Fraser Government it was 10.3 per cent. On the same basis of calculation as I mentioned previously, for the year 1979-80 the figure becomes 10.5 per cent. So it is moving up all the time. In looking at total Federal tax receipts, not just income tax but all taxes that the Federal Government raises from people, et cetera, in the three years of the Labor Government receipts represented 22.5 per cent of the gross domestic product. In the first three years of the Fraser Government they represented 23.3 per cent. For 1979-80, again on the same basis of calculation that I used previously, it will be 23.9 per cent. Again it is moving up all the time. I am talking about not just income tax, but all tax receipts. The reasons for that are not only the rapid income tax increase but also due to the enormous amount of revenue being accrued by the Government from the crude oil levy there are very rapid increases in taxes in the non-income tax area as well. In looking at the share of average weekly earnings paid in taxes, to get away from the overall concept and look at the individual level, in 1975-76 22.7 per cent of the average weekly earnings of a single person was paid in income tax. In 1979-80 that figure rose slightly to 22.9 per cent. But a married taxpayer paid 14.2 per cent of his income in tax in 1975-76. In 1979-80 he will pay 18.3 per cent, which is a very substantial increase indeed. Of course it can be argued that thosefigures make no allowance for the changed arrangements in respect of family allowances or health insurance. So one can do the sum again and include in the concept of net tax the amounts paid by the Government by way of child endowment or the family allowances and the additional amounts that taxpayers have to pay now to be covered for health care. I am referring only to medical costs, assuming that the people take advantage of the free hospital services provided by the Government under the new health arrangements. A single taxpayer paid 22.7 per cent of his income in 1975-76 in this concept of net tax. In 1979-80 he will pay 24.4 per cent. In 1975-76, 13.3 per cent of the income of a married taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two children went in net tax. In 1979-80, 17.7 per cent went in net tax. That is a very substantial increase indeed. It is interesting that it is in this area of married taxpayers, the families, the most heavy tax impost is occurring. This sits oddly with the Government's claim that it has done marvellous things for families by way of increasing family allowances. Of course, the reality is that the decision originally to move to family allowances and abolish the tax rebate was a good move which we supported. But it has been destroyed by the fact that the allowance has not been in any way adjusted since that time, so its real value has halved. Therefore, families find that the net tax impost on them is increasing all the time. There we have it. It is absolutely clear and beyond any doubt at all that the Fraser Government has notably increased the burden of income tax, and taxation as a whole, over what it was when Labor was in office. This is despite the fact that its period of office has been marked by massive tax avoidance by high income earners. Therefore, high income earners have had no increase at all in their tax burden. Indeed, it has been greatly reduced with the result that ordinary taxpayers, particularly wage and salary earners who have virtually no means of avoiding tax, have seen a considerable increase in their tax burden. All this makes a mockery of the Liberal claim to be a low tax party, as it has claimed so vociferously to be. The reality is that it is a high tax party; the highest tax party in Australia's history. It is especially so for wage and salary earners. The clear, undeniable facts show that attempts by Government spokesmen to portray the Government parties as generally low tax parties are nothing more than crude attempts to deceive the Australian people. As I have explained previously, this high tax feature of the Fraser Government is an inevitable result of its economic policies and, in particular, its deficit paranoia. Its continuing attempts to reduce the deficit, quite unsuccessfully so far, by increasing taxes simply depressed the Australian economy, thereby causing the deficit to blow out again through the resulting loss of tax revenue and more persons needing to claim unemployment benefit. This effect leads to more tax increases and a further perpetuation of the recessionary cycle. Without a change in basic economic policy we can expect only that the Fraser Government will not only continue as a high tax government but as the ever higher tax government. I turn now to tax avoidance. As I mentioned in opening, we support the tax avoidance measures contained in these Bills. Before making some general points on this matter I wish to draw attention to the main measures included in the legislation. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 4) puts an end to four tax avoidance schemes-Curran-typ e schemes, trading stock schemes, pre-payment schemes and expenditure recoupment schemes. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 5) in part relates to those four types of avoidance schemes by providing that carry forward losses under these schemes will not be allowed. This is an extremely important measure which we strongly support. The Treasurer, in his second reading speech, made the point that $ 1,600m worth of artificial losses were claimed from the operation of these schemes for the year 1977-78, of which approximately $ 1,000m would be able to be carried forward to wipe out tax in future years if nothing were done to prevent it. Hence the provision in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 5). However, we find it curious that the Government has provided in relation to carry forward losses in respect of only those four schemes. We cannot see why the Government could not have provided a more general provision. It seems that as other tax avoidance schemes arise-ther e appears to be no end to them-w e will have to have further legislation in the future to provide this kind of protection; that is, to prevent carry forward of paper losses in respect of these new schemes which will arise. Why cannot we have some sort of general provision which is a prohibition on the carry forward of all paper losses? I would like some honourable members on the Government side to make some comment about this matter in this debate. If it is possible, surely we ought to be introducing such a provision. I do not know why it would not be possible. Regarding the importance of tax avoidance, quite apart from the Government action to resbeen tructure the tax scales inequitably, it is clear that the equity of the tax system is being further stroyed by tax avoidance. This is shown by the figures for taxes paid by pay-as-you-earn taxinternal payers-basicall y wage and salary earners-and by non pay-as-you-earn taxpayers in the last two financial years. Between 1976-77 and 1978-79 pay-as-you-earn taxpayers had their total taxes increased by 21.9 per cent. The total amount tax that they paid went up by that amount, but for non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers-that is, wage and salary earners as a whole-thei taxes paid went down by 4.7 per cent. Obviously that enormous discrepancy is largely accounted for by the tremendous impact of tax avoidance. This shows how enormously effective tax avoidemployees, ance is, despite the Government's action to prebenefits vent it. The Opposition agrees that the Governqualifying ment has taken substantial measures to reduce tax avoidance. But it had no choice. Unless it so it would have had a far greater loss of revenue. It is absurd for the Government to claim continuvests ally that it deserves credit for having done more than any other government to prevent tax avoidance. The fact is that there has never been so tax avoidance activity for governments to put end to. That was shown quite clearly by a stateterminated ment which I have referred to previously by Mr Bruce Pascoe, President of the Taxation institute of Australia. He said in December 1978 that in the previous two years-that is, 1977 and 1978-ta x avoidance became big business in Australia. He said: 'It became a disease which, being allowed to go unchecked, reached epiare demic proportions'. It is in this environment that the Government has had to take action. It allowed avoidance to go virtually unchecked-in  which time a tremendous amount of tax had been avoided and the whole avoidance process had been built up into an industry. It grew into one of the few growth industries under this Government. As the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) said last night, about the only other areas which have increased that we can think of are massage parlours and Chinese restaurants. I would like to make many criticisms of the action taken by the Treasurer in respect of tax avoidance, acknowledging nevertheless that he has done quite a bit in this area. One of the areas in which we feel he has fallen down badly is simply by not acting against various schemes which he knows to be operating, which have put to him time and time again and which he continues to allow to exist. Maybe it has somedething to do with the work load but it still seems odd that he allows this to happen. One area is superannuation schemes. In this House in thefirsthalf of this year I drew this matter to the attention of the Treasurer and gave him some documentation with respect to how such schemes worked. On 12 August this year I issued a Press of release which referred again to the impact of internal superannuation schemes as blatant tax non avoidance devices which this Government was r total continuing to allow to operate. These schemes work basically in this way: A company sets up a superannuation fund for its including directors, who receive only at death, on retirement, or after a period. Only the company contributes to the scheme. Its contributions are tax deductdid ible, allowing it to avoid company tax and division 7 tax on undistributed profits. The fund insomething like 30 per cent of its assets in government securities so that all the fund's income becomes exempt from tax. The other 70 per cent of the fund's assets are lent back to the company at a reasonable rate of interest, the much payment of which is a tax deduction for the an company. The employment of all employees is before they reach retirement age or serve out the qualifying period. Eventually, the directors are the only employees left in the fund and they receive all the assets accumulated in the fund tax free. Of course, this has particularly nasty effects in respect of the company's work force. The employees are led to believe that they part of a superannuation scheme. But the reality is that it is only a device to avoid tax. Many of them finish up with no superannuation because the intention of the scheme was not to give them any superannuation but to avoid taxation. Recently I have had made available to me detailed evidence of how such a scheme worked. This scheme was put forward by afirmknown as Industrial Taxation Services which has its headquarters in Beaumaris in Melbourne. I can make available to the Treasurer, at any time he wants, details of how this particular firm is proposing such internal superannuation schemes to work. For the benefit of honourable members and the public I seek leave of the House to include in Hansard a table which sets out clearly how this scheme would operate in the case of one company for which Industrial Taxation Services did some work. Leave granted. The table read as followsNA Company position before installation; assuming a pre-tax profit of Company profit Company tax @ 46 per cent Maximum 60 per cent company retention . . . 11,732 Undistributed profits taxed @ 50 per cent . . . 3,917 Balanceretainedby the company Total tax payable Totalretainedby the company Company position on installation of superannuation fund and employee benefit planCompany's tax on $36,270 Company borrows from fund Less contributions to employee benefit plan Balanceretainedin the Company Improvement in company's liquidity position year 1 Position year 3 Plus policy cash values Less net cost of interest (2.7 per cent) Position year 5 Plus policy cash values Less accumulated net interest . . . .

184,Mr WILLIS,EFFECT OF PROPOSALS ON COMPANY,"I thank the House. Since I made that Press statement there have been many statements in support of the claim that I made at the time, not the least by such organisations as the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia and Australian Superannuation Plans. All of these organisations have strongly supported the case that I have made that many of these internal superannuation schemes are blatant tax avoidance schemes and that there were clear measures that could be taken by the Government to put restrictions on the use of this form of tax avoidance scheme, but so far nothing has been done. It is deplorable that the Government has seenfitto sit on its heels and allow this ripoffof the system to occur, not only because of the loss of tax revenue, but also because of what it is doing to thousands of employees out in the work force who think that they have superannuation cover but who are just being deluded and defrauded by this process. It is scandalous that the Government allows this situation to continue. Finally, I would like to LIQUIDITY move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Income Tax Assessment Bill $ (No. 4). I move: 36,270 That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to sub36,270 stituting the following words: 16,684 'the Government's taxation pohcies are inequitable, deceptive and ineffective in that they19,386 (1) in direct violation of the Government's election promises, are imposing an increasing income tax burden on the Australian taxpayer, 3,917 (2) have continuallyreducedthe equity of the tax system 20,601 by imposing an increasing proportion of the income 15,669 tax burden on low and middle income earners, (3) are failing to prevent the continuance of a record level of tax avoidance by high income earners and nil (4) have been marked by prevarication, policy reversals 36,270 and concessions to powerful interest groups'. 5,941 Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Martin)-Is the 30,329 amendment seconded? Mr John Brown- I second the amendment 14,660 and reserve my right to speak at a later point in . . 43,980 the debate. 7,144 2,937 48,187 Mr LUSHER (Hume) (9.3)- I am concerned 73,300 about the income tax structure in Australia. 14,741 There is no doubt that there is widespread con9,790 78,251 cern and dissatisfaction with the taxation structure in this country. One of the measures of dissatisfaction is the extent to which tax avoidance has developed as an industry in Australia. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) recently said that the Commissioner of Taxation had identified over 10,000 taxpayers as participants in tax avoidance schemes, compared with about 860 in 1975-76 and 2,200 in 1976-77. In his 1979-80 Budget the Treasurer provided for $683m as being the loss to revenue from tax avoidance. It is important to realise that the 10,000 taxpayers and the $683m both relate to known, identifiable or actioned schemes. The amount of income not declared and the amount of tax avoided is incalculable. It needs to be understood that the problem has its origins in the system itself. Because people dissatisfied with the existing system they will go, and do go, to differing degrees of effort to reduce or eliminate their tax liability. The Government's efforts to counter this increasing level of activity are necessarily slow and result normally in complex and lengthy legislation. This is so because first a scheme or a device has to be identified before a counter to it can be introduced. The principles relating to retrospectivity are such that in virtually all cases the revenue lost before the Government takes action is not recoverable. One of the results is the increasing complexity and size of the Income Tax Assessment Act itself, and another is the amount of time and effort that has to be devoted to tax avoidance by officials, the Government and the Parliament. To make matters worse the avoidance industry continues to throw out the challenge by saying: 'Every time you close a loophole, we'll open another'. It seems that the process is endless and that the elimination of tax avoidance will become an increasingly major consumer of time for officials, government and the Parliament. It is my contention that the basic reason for the problem we face is that we are trying to patch up a bad system. Whilst I commend the Treasurer's efforts in relation to tax avoidance, I cannot see how all the effort in the world will solve the problem. It has often been said that a government cannot enforce a bad law. I think that syndrome dominates taxation in Australia. I wish to commend the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) for the proposals he has brought forward, which have been favourably received, in relation to family income splitting. believe that the honourable member for Sturt decost serves much credit for causing people to think about the system and to seek ways to remove inequities from within it. But I am concerned about his proposal for two reasons and I want put those reasons before putting a possible alternative proposition. My first concern is that the proposal of the honourable member for Sturt builds on the existing system. Even though his proposal would remove inequities, once that ition had been achieved we would still be faced with all the problems that we now face with the system as we know it. In a way the honourable member is moving the same way as the be Treasurer-to patch up a bad system. The second concern I have is that the honourable member's proposal carries the inherent risk of raising community expectation. If for some reason the Government found it could not accept the proposal, those expectations would be dashed. The problem here is that I believe the are honourable member to be right. There can be significant disadvantage to single income families as compared to two-income families. This fact has now been well publicised and those who are disadvantaged are entitled to expect the Government to redress that disadvantage. If the proposal is not implemented, a serious problem exists between those people and the Government. I have a minor concern about the honourable member's proposal and that is that the proposal depends upon tax indexation for its implementation. It seems to me that tax indexation has been clearly demonstrated to be fraught with difficulties in the practical political sense as well as in the fiscal or budgetary sense. I would prefer a tax system that, because of its justice and equity, did not require indexation to maintain its partial acceptability in the community. I believe that the debate on income tax needs to be broadened so that the options are not limited to tax cuts, indexation and the proposal from the honourable member for Sturt. I say this because, with all due respect to the Government, the Treasurer, the honourable member for Sturt and most commentators, these options are really only adjustments at the margin. They involve adjustments to what I have already described as a bad system. Australia needs realistically to consider a fundamental change to its existing taxation system- a change that will give equity and incentive and eliminate the desire for tax avoidance. It is in this spirit that I wish to put forward a proposal that I hope will be taken as a serious and realistic contribution to the taxation debate in Australia. My proposition demonstrates that a system of flat rate tax can be introduced in I Australia at an acceptable cost, if in fact at any at all. I do not intend to deal with the advantages offlatrate tax. I believe the arguments are well known and accepted. The difficulty with flat rate tax has always been seen to be the cost of to implementing what is regarded as a good system. I hope to show that it can be implemented. The proposal argues for a flat 20 per cent rate of tax on incomes. In contrast to the family inposcome splitting proposal of the honourable member for Sturt, this proposition involves taxing the family unit. Because a percentage of the taxpayers who pay less than 20 per cent would disadvantaged by the flat rate proposal it would be necessary to allow those taxpayers to opt for the existing structure. A flat rate tax tem such as proposed here would eliminate the need for tax indexation, would remove rebates and concessional deductions, and would involve no threshold. It would also mean a reversion to non-taxation of pensions. It would also remove almost entirely tax avoidance and tax evasion as well as ensuring that most income is declared. A flat rate tax regime would need to be accompanied by stiff penalties for those abusing the system. As the latest taxation statistics available are for the 1976-77 income year, all figures in this proposal relate to that year. In relative terms, current position should not be substantially different. At an income level of $9,500 the average flat rate of tax is 20.3 per cent. The amount of $9,500 is the critical income level in this posal. Below $9,500 are 64 per cent of the taxpayers, who pay 32 per cent of the tax. The proposal is that those above $9,500 would pay a 20 per centflatrate on every dollar of income and that those below could opt for the existing rate structure if they would be disadvantaged by paying 20 per cent. On the surface the loss to revenue is enormous. On the assumption that all those below $9,500 opted for the existing system, and all those above $9,500 paid 20 per cent, the cost would be almost $2 billion. Obviously such a cost would be unacceptable. The proposal depends largely on the acceptance of taxation of the family unit. A 'family' means husband, wife, children and full time student children. Theflatrate of tax would be applied to the grossed up income derived by all members of a family. A family would be taxed as one entity. The reason for this approach is to remove the necessity for income splitting and it would result in virtually all family partnerships and trusts being taxed as if they were one income. Two income families would not be disadvantaged because they could opt for whichever was the most attractive-th eflatrate tax or the existing scales. The only families that would opt for the existing scales would be those with a combined income of less than $9,500. With the passage of time, and with the effect of inflation, the number of taxpayers with an income below $9,500 would diminish until virtually all taxpayers, on a family unit basis, would receive about $9,500 and paying theflatrate of 20 per cent. Perhaps the question most important to this proposal is: How many would opt for the existing scales? Obviously every individual and every family receiving over $9,500 would be advanlargely taged by the 20 per cent flat rate, and any sysindividual or family receiving below $9,500 would be disadvantaged because the average, theflatrate, below $9,500 falls steadily. As previously mentioned it would only be the genuine below $9,500 income individuals and families who would opt for the existing scales and pay less than 20 per cent. But there are many other categories of people receiving below $9,500 for whom the 20 per cent rate would be more atractive. Firstly there are the income splitters and there are a large number of husbands, wives and children included in the 64 per cent of taxpayers receiving below $9,500. There are working wives whose individual incomes are less than $9,500, the but who, on a family income basis, would benefit from aflatrate. There are part-time workers who earn less than $9,500 but who would benefit from flat rate tax. There are people, such as pro- school leavers, who are not members of the work force for a full year and so earn less than $9,500 but who would be advantaged byflatrate tax. There are pensioners who, pension and income included, earn less than $9,500. With no tax applying to the pension these pensioners would be advantaged by paying 20 per cent tax rather than 32 per cent tax on any income over and above the pension. There would be others who would benefit fromflatrate tax and who would transfer from the existing scales even though their income is less than $9,500. In summary, it is my contention that a large proportion of those receiving below $9,500 would in fact opt to pay tax at the flat 20 per cent rate. I believe that this proportion is most likely to be around half, but in the table I have prepared I include figures for 25 per cent, 50 per cent and 75 per cent of those receiving below $9,500 transferring to the 20 per centflatrate. It will be apparent that the more people who are taxed at 20 per cent the less will be the cost to revenue, because those opting for the old scales will be paying aflatrate of less than 20 per cent. If 50 per cent of those below $9,500 opted to pay the 20 per cent flat rate the superficial cost to revenue would be $1.47 billion. If only 25 per cent transferred it would be $1.73 billion, and if 75 per cent transferred it would be $1.23 billion. As I indicated earlier I believe the most likely result would be about 50 per cent with a superficial cost of about $1.5 billion. There are two principal ways through which the bulk or all of the $1.47 billion revenue forgone would be recovered. Firstly a large amount of presently undeclared income would be declared; and secondly tax avoidance would be eliminated. I believe there is some mutual exclusivity in relation to the two points, but equally the amounts in each do not cancel each other out. It can be argued that the benefit from the combined effect of the two results could well exceed the $1.47 billion forgone. The amount of additional income that would need to be declared and taxed at 20 per cent in order to break even at $ 10.75 billion, which is the amount of tax raised in 1976-77, is $7.3 billion or 15 cent more income than was declared in 1976-77 on the presumption that 50 per cent of those receiving below $9,500 would opt to transfer to the 20 percent rate. If 25 percent transferred ditional income would need to be $8.6 billion or 18 per cent, and if 75 per cent transferred it would be $6.1 billion or 13 per cent of that declared now. It is not unrealistic to assume that this would happen. The Treasurer has stated in his Budget Speech that the amount of tax outstanding from tax avoidance schemes acted on by the Government in 1978-79 is $433m. He also stated that $250m extra had been provided for to cover further tax avoidance. It should be borne in mind that this $683m only allows for known tax avoidance those schemes that have been acted upon. It is not unrealistic to believe that at least a further $1 billion in tax would be raised from what the community at large regarded as a 'fair' system of taxation. One of the principal reasons why some would oppose such aflatrate tax system is that it would provide a windfall benefit for the rich. This needs to be put into perspective. Thefirstthing that needs to be said is that 93 per cent of taxpayers have a taxable income of less than $16,000. Those who receive between $9,500 and $ 16,000, who account for 29 per cent of taxpayers, would benefit from a reduction in their average or flat rate of tax from between 27.6 per cent and 20.3 per cent, depending on income level, down to 20 per cent. For most of these the reduction in would not be large and they could in no way classified asrich.That leaves the 7 per cent taxpayers in Australia who have taxable incomes in excess of $16,000. Depending on how we ask define rich, people receiving over $16,000 and would, at or above that level, fall into that category. These 7 per cent currently pay 16 per cent of the total tax collected from individuals. At the absolute extreme there are 873 people with a taxable income over $100,000. These 873 people would have theirflatrate of tax reduced from 60 per cent to 20 per cent. If we $20,000 as the level above which one becomes rich, less than 3 per cent of taxpayers are in rich category. It strikes me as absurd to deny 93 or 97 per cent of taxpayers a sensible taxation system for no other reason than that 3 or 7 per cent of taxpayers will receive a significant reduction in tax. Although opponents offlatrate tax will always quote individual examples of what the tax benefit would be, they totally overlook the imper mense benefits thatflowfrom such a system to the whole community. The certainty, confidence and incentive that accompanies the fact that tax takes only 20 cents in every dollar earned more the ad- than outweighs the only other suggested protection-indexation . Indexation is only valuable if the income growth does not exceed the inflation growth or indexation adjustment. Flat rate tax is more beneficial. It may also be argued in a negative sense that there is not much equity in the present system under which those taxpayers receiving below $9,500-6 4 per cent-pa y only 32 per cent of the tax while the remaining 36 per cent pay 68 per cent of the tax collected. Theflatrate tax system I envisage would result in the estimated 32 per cent of taxpayers receiving below $9,500 paying 23 per cent of the tax, and receiving over $9,500-a n estimated 68 per cent-payin g 77 per cent of the tax collected. I said earlier that one of the basic difficulties withflatrate tax is the cost of its implementation. Obviously it would be impossible to consider flat rate tax at a time when the Budget deficit was running at $3 billion, $4 billion or $5 billion. That is not now the case. The deficit is now under control relative to recent years. The Government has scope to reduce expenditure and it also has the oil revenues. The combination of these three factors is such that we are now in the ideal climate to introduceflatrate tax, even if it cost $0.5 billion. The benefit to the community would be more than outweighed by any short term cost to the deficit. Any lack of confidence that may follow a larger deficit would be more than offset by tax the boost to confidence and consumer spending be that would accompanyflatrate tax. If, as seems of the to be the case, the Government has a commitment to tax cuts or tax reform next year then I that this proposal be fully examined, costed debated. I do not argue that this proposal is thefinal,only or perfect solution, but Australia may never have a better opportunity to introduce flat rate tax than it has now. If this opportunity is not taken now we may well be saddled with the existing unsatisfactory system into the indeterminate future. Although I have not shown those take two tables to the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), I seek leave to incorporthat ate them in Hansard.

I always felt that he would be a classic member of theflatearth society cause I am sure that that is the measure of his Neanderthal thinking.

I am astounded that an allegedly responsible member of parliament would come in here and suggest that we should revert to aflattax system. Surely the systern that is favoured . . . It by resent is equitable. sense. It is a progressive from of tax under which people pay what they can afford to pay.

I am sure that you would agree when I sugtogest that the only things wrong with the tax system in Australia at the moment are inequity of the rate for those people at the top also put that suggestion to the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson), who is sitting at the table laughing-and the amount of tax that is e v a d e d - I was pleased that at least the honoura b l e m u e m be r for "" u m eb a d the d ? f to su g; . can the party which I rep- f "" L f at *._ , .in every $2,000m will,be evaded„ in the ' .be.justified l ™ "" * "" * $ 'T*™ ™ , , current financial v v b ew h o u s e a the h o l e s that are a v a u a b h C to'smart* accountants and 'smart' lawy e r s . i u s e the w o r d . s m a r t . in the pejorative sense, in inverted commas, because surely it is a very loose assessment of'smart' that people can conbe smart enough to outwit other people who do not have the same opportunities, and thus avail themselves of an inequitable share of the tax burdens. If only people in the total electorate were honest the tax system would work. I am pleased to represent a working class electorate. I am sure that the bulk of the people I represent pay a fair share to the Government's purse, to the nation's purse. Mr Kerin-They have no choice.",107
186,Mr JOHN BROWN,PROPOSAL,"As the honourable member for Werriwa interjects, they have no choice. They do not have the 'skills' or the basic dishonesty to be paying less than they should. We should look at the higher classes of society in Australia, the establishment, the Gold Coast businessmen, with all due apologies to the Minister at the table, the doctors, the solicitors, the countants and the wealthy farmers. Those people not only minimise their tax, they absolutely remove the possibility of their paying any. They are the guilty parties. They are the people who are evading the $2,000m in tax this year. They are the people who are making the people I represent in my electorate, the workers of Australia, pay an inequitable amount. A worker with a tribe of kids is battling to send them to a State or parochial school, battling to pay whatever school fees have to be paid to keep the system going. Workers are paying an inequitable share of the tax burden because other people are avoiding their responsibilities. The Government should be aiming at the people who avoid their responsibilities. There is nothing wrong with the tax system if basic honesty existed within the community. That is what this Government should be trying to do. There are some cosmetic measures in the Bills that we are discussing, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 4) and related Bills, that might do something about curing some of these ills and stopping the proliferation of Curran schemes and other schemes set up by the smart lawyers and smart accountants to allow their clients to not pay their fair share of the tax burden. But the Bills do not go far enough. We on this side of the House suggest that these measures should be made retrospective. The Government, when it discovers an avoidance scheme in operation, should be able to go back to the operative date of commencement of the scheme, not 12 or 18 months later when people have evaded the tax. We suggest to the Minister at the table and to the Government that it should be injecting some form of retrospectivity into these laws. That is the policy that has been propounded by our shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who spoke prior to the honourable member for Hume. We want the Government to catch in the net the people who are not paying their fair share. That is our suggestion. Only a few weeks ago I attended the opening of a new clinical school at the Westmead Hospital in my electorate. I was privileged to hear perhaps the last major speech made by one of the most eminent and respected medical men in Australia, Sir John Lowenthal. He was then Professor of Medicine at Sydney University and Chairman of the Australian National Heart Foundation. Unfortunately, he died shortly afterwards. The basis of his speech to the young doctors entering that clinical school- I well remember the terms he used-wa s that they should acget back to the practice of medicine and forget about the business of medicine. He alluded, in guarded terms, to the number of doctors who have brought disrepute to their profession by their entry into tax evasion schemes. I am not just singling out doctors, but given the fact that in the last week or two they have raised their fees by 23 per cent. I presume that people like me, the working class people, are easy prey for them. People feel that they are being unfairly treated in terms of the tax they pay as against the tax people in the high income level do not pay. I suggest to doctors that they get back to the practice of medicine and forget about the business of medicine. Doctors, even by conforming with reasonable standards of behaviour, could still be the highest earning people in this community. It is very common knowledge that an ordinary general practitioner is now grossing somewhere around $ 100,000 minimum a year, giving them a net return of $40,000 or $50,000. How could those people justifiably suggest in any terms that they should be paying less than their fair share of tax? So I suggest to the honourable member for Hume that he forget about flat rates of tax, the same as he should forget about his membership of the flat earth society. I am sure he is a very senior member of that society. Getting back to the legislation in question, the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill, which is part of this parcel, seeks to declare the new rates of personal income tax payable by individuals and trustees which were announced in the 1979-80 Budget Speech and to provide for the future application of tax indexation.",108
187,Mr LUSHER,PROPOSAL,Can I go?,108
188,Mr JOHN BROWN,PROPOSAL,"You may go. I am sure your presence will not be needed and I am sure that the aggregate intelligence of the House will not be lowered by your absence, it will be increased. The Opposition opposes this Bill because although it removes the income tax surcharge of 1.5 per cent which was imposed by this Government for the 1978-79 taxation year, all it effectively does is to impose a 1.07 per cent surcharge for the 1979-80 financial year instead. This is just another one of the broken promises of this Government. If this Government is remembered for anything it will be for this wonderful litany of broken promises which were espoused by our esteemed Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) in his election speech of 1977. Those promises have been repudiated and dishonoured. They have been almost totally obliterated by succeeding actions. This surcharge is another example of the Government's failure to honour its promises. The Government promised to abolish the surcharge at the end of July this year. It failed to do so. If honourable members can cast their minds back a little further, the Government had the gall, in December 1977, to promise people tax cuts. It not only did not give them tax cuts, it in fact gave them a surcharge. It not only broke a promise, it made another one and broke it. The Opposition also opposes the Bill on the grounds of another of the Government's broken promises-it s failure to introduce tax indexation for 1979-80. Earlier in its period of office the Government claimed that tax indexation was desirable to keep governments honest. I subscribe to that too. But its trail of broken promises, of which I have mentioned only two or three-ther e are many others-hav e proved to the people of Australia that it is a blatantly dishonest government. The Government cannot afford to introduce tax indexation because that would prevent it from implementing its characteristic policy of taxation by stealth. I will not go into taxation by stealth; I will leave that to later speakers. In effect the Government's refusal to implement tax indexation means that while inflation continues the proportion of income tax increases for everyone who pays tax, regardless of his income. This Bill provides that in future indexation can be implemented by an Act declaring that indexation is to apply for a particular year, but the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has given no hint as to when such an Act may be introduced. In fact he has given every indication that tax indexation will not be introduced at all. He spelt this out quite clearly because in his second reading speech he claimed that it was not possible to introduce tax indexation for the 1979-80 financial year because of Budgetary considerations. I foreshadow that in May next year the Treasurer will come in here with a sweetner because that is election year. History reveals that election years have funny effects on Treasurers. Something that was not at all possible in August 1979 may well be possible in May 1980. It may well be that people will remember, if the Government does introduce some form of tax indexation as an election sweetener, where the money came from. People may start thinking about every gallon of petrol that they have bought and how much they have paid for it. Then they will know where their tax indexation is coming from. I would like to know what these budgetary considerations were that precluded the Government from introducing its tax indexation. The Treasurer says that tax indexation will not be introduced because people do not understand it. This is surely an insult to the intelligence of the people of Australia. When we go to an election the people of Australia will certainly indicate their intelligence because if the present poll continues the Government will be sitting over on this side of the House and the real government of Australia-the party that represents the great bulk of the people of Australia-wil l be squatting over there whence it never should have left. The Treasurer also said that tax indexation would be introduced only if wage increases and inflation were low. However, as he himself has admitted, inflation is going toriseto 10 per cent next year as a result of his inflationary Budget. It would appear therefore that tax indexation indeed has been given the kiss of death. Talking about the kiss of death, I notice that the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) has entered the chamber. The Government claims that it is cutting taxation this year and it is true that pay-as-you-earn taxation deductions will be decreased, but taken over the year as a whole, the proportion of income paid in tax by all taxpayers will increase this year. Moreover, this increase is quite inequitable and, as is usual with this Government, the greatest tax burden will fall upon low income earners. For a party that claims it is a low tax party, I think thefiguresreally make a joke of that claim. I just added a fewfigurestogether today that people could readily understand. They show that income tax paid by individuals in Australia in 1975-76 was $9,219m. Strange to relate, in the 1979 Budget, the estimate for taxation paid by individuals is $15,128m, just a nice little increase of 66 per cent in taxation revenue from individuals in a slight matter of three years. Surely that would end forever the claim that this Government, sitting on the treasury bench, is a low tax party. The increase in taxation this financial year for single taxpayers in the lowest income bracket will be 64.6 per cent. By comparison, for those earning around $50,000-funnil y enough, that is the amount paid to Ministers-the increase will be only 11.3 per cent. I wonder whether that is coincidence or a deliberate attempt. Could that possibly be considered progressive or regressive tax? I think the people of Australia will be able to make a judgment on that, because despite the fact that the Treasurer thinks that the people of Australia are not intelligent, believe me, they are. For a taxpayer with dependants, the increase is even more marked. Those earning $6,500 this year are paying an increase in taxes of 155.9 per cent whilst those on $54,500 will have their taxes increased by 11.6 per cent- a nice little 11.6 per cent over last year. In other words, the lower a person's income, the higher his percentage increase in taxation this year. Low income earners are the people least able to afford high rates of taxation, but under this Government they are supporting the wealthy. That surely shows the immorality of this Government ment. The rates of tax applicable for any finanGovernment-believe cial year, in accordance with the Income Tax (Rates) Act, are imposed for that financial by the annual Income Tax (Individuals) Act. That Act in this year imposes the personal inreally come tax rates applicable to individuals and trustees for the 1979-80 financial year, and the Parliament does otherwise, it provides for following financial year and is complementary the Bill we discussed earlier. I notice that two nuns from one schools happen to be sitting in the House, and one of the better provisions in this Bill that I do approve of is that which allows tax deductible gifts of $2 or more to be made after 1 July to the Roman Catholic archdiocesan funds esimplements tablished exclusively for the purpose of providcertain ing religious instruction in government schools Australia. I applaud that move. It is at least of the better ones that the Government has made. It is a very minor one, but one of the better moves. One of the other Bills in this parcel that we debating cognately is the Income Tax Assesscome ment Bill (No. 5) 1979. This gives legislative effect to three Government decisions made May and June of this year. These decisions are the denial of income tax deductions for paper losses created by tax avoidance schemes initiated in a year of income and, because of insufficiency of income in that year to absorb them, carried forward to later years. We do not deny that that is also a reasonable move, but as I expressed earlier, it does not go far enough to catch these people who are evading their taxes. The Opposition believes that these sorts of legislative changes should be made retrospective. The Bill also allows for the easing of some limits on deductions for income equalisation deposits- a little sop for the farmers. We do not deny them that opportunity. They are having a good year and we are pleased about that. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you represent a rural electorate. We are very pleased that the farmers are having a good year. If they can be given some easing in their tax on an averaging basis we are quite happy with that. The Bill also introduces the changing of arrangements for the transition from the 40 per cent phase of the investment allowance to the 20 per cent phase. I am delighted about that because I do not think anybody would deny that the 40 per cent allowance in investment that was given to business has not done the job for which it was introduced. It was alleged to be a scheme to provide employbut I think that everybody-includin g the s that what it has done has been to allow businesses a large tax deduction to year provide new machinery, largely of a labourreducing type, and largely imported. So it has worked in reverse to the scheme it was supposed to implement. It has not provided employuntil ment by virtue of its implementation and, the further, it has not provided employment because to largely it was machinery bought from overseas, so the scheme has been a failure. At least the Government has had the decency to reduce the of the local allowance to 20 per cent. The first of these decisions-the one 1979 implementing the deduction for paper lossesaction against those participating in tax avoidance schemes-the Curran-type in scheme, the horrid scheme which people use to one exploit others; trading stock schemes; prepayment schemes; and expenditure recoupment schemes. Paper losses generated in earlier years by tax avoidance schemes entered into before government remedial action against such are schemes was initiated will not be allowed as intax deductions either in the 1979-80 financial year or in subsequent years, and we are dein lighted with that. Tax avoidance schemes have for a long time now allowed certain people well versed in the taxation laws-the y are the people I was talking about earlier, the smart lawyers, smart accountants, smart doctors-to cheat the Government of the taxation due to it. So successful have these schemes been that the number of people using them has increased markedly in recent years. In the 1975-76 financial year, 861 taxpayers were identified as participants in such schemes whilst by 1977-78, the known number- I stress the known number-ha drisento 10,244. These schemes have been so prevalent that it is estimated that in the 1979-80 financial year the Government lost some $203m of revenue to which it was entitled because of these schemes. That is a very minimal assessment of the figure. I think most people, and probably the officials sitting on the back seats, would believe that the figure is more likely to be in the range of $2,000m. Mr Kerin-The fiscal fiends.",108
189,Mr JOHN BROWN,PROPOSAL,"I would not use that term. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) has suggested that they are fiscal fiends, but I would not use that term. Although the loopholes in the taxation laws which allowed the schemes I mentioned earlier to operate have at last been closed, claims exceeding $ 1,600m have been made on the Australian Taxation Office for the deduction of paper losses from tax avoidance schemes carried out in 1977-78. Obviously the Opposition strongly opposes any form of tax avoidance system, not only because of the loss of revenue to the Government that such schemes entail, but also because it is intolerable that others, honest taxpayers in the community, should go on year after year paying taxes whilst unscrupulous people openly avoid paying tax. We therefore support any move to stamp out the operation of such schemes. To sum up, as I said when I started this little speech, the basic ingredimember ent required in the community is honesty. The working classes of Australia have never yet been caught in a tax evasion scheme. Never does one find the names of butchers, bakers, candlestick makers, fitters and turners, school teachers or trade union officials in the lists of names of those evading tax-onl y the establishment.",111
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSAL, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,111
191,Mr BOURCHIER,PROPOSAL," I must make a few comments on this Bill, particularly in relation to the remarks of the butcher from Parramatta- I am sorry, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown)-wh o was very quick to point out that butchers never avoid taxation. I am pleased to hear that. A couple of points should be drawn from his speech. The honourable member for Parramatta went on to say that this Government has brought in some imposing taxation that it is going to increase tremendously. He failed to mention, of course, how taxation had risen in 1975 and what it would be if we still had the infamous tax scales that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) introduced in 1975. The Australian Labor Party will be terribly shocked to find on 1 December that the take home pay of the very people whom they talk about representing but whom in fact we represent-the people who earn the money-ha s been increased. Their average weekly earnings will be increased considerably. This will be a terrible blow to honourable members opposite because they were not counting on the fact that this Government would cut taxes. The present Government is the only government since 1972 actually to cut taxes. Honourable members opposite will receive some more shocks before next year is out. Mr Kerin-Would you fancy an audience?",111
192,Mr BOURCHIER,PROPOSAL,"Pi n your ears back, as you have done. Do not let your earsflap.If you take your hands away from your ears they will flap. Mr Kerin-Would you fancy an audience?",111
193,Mr BOURCHIER,PROPOSAL,You would take off if you did not stop your ears flapping.,111
194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSAL, Order! The honourable member will address his remarks to the chair.,111
195,Mr BOURCHIER,PROPOSAL,"Than k you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I should, too.",111
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSAL,Order! Members of the Opposition should treat the honourable for Bendigo with a little respect as I understand that Opposition speakers were heard in silence.,111
197,Mr BOURCHIER,PROPOSAL,"That isright. Mr Deputy Speaker, I just wish to place on record a comparison of the taxation deductions after 1 December 1979 and the standard rate of tax of 32 per cent introduced in 1978 with what would be the position if the infamous Hayden scales were still in operation. I will take as an example two or three simple sets of figures because the honourable member for Parramatta and the violinist from Werriwa can understand only simple figures. If I had a blackboard I would draw on it in such a way that even they could understand the figures. As from 1 December 1979, a taxpayer with no dependants and earning $100 a week will pay $9.35 a week tax, whereas under the Hayden scales, if they were still operating, he would be paying $15.45. The honourable member for Parramatta talked about a 60 per cent increase. If the Hayden scheme were still in operation there would be a 60 per cent increase in the tax payable by a person receiving $100 in take home pay. That is not a bad effort! For a person earning $200 a week the rate of tax payable will be $41.85 per week as against $52.10 which would be payable under the Hayden scheme. A taxpayer with a dependent spouse and child and a $100 a week income will be required to pay nothing at all under this Government's taxation scheme after 1 December, Under the Hayden scheme he would have had to pay $4.05. These are the facts.",111
198,Dr EVERINGHAM,PROPOSAL,But Hayden would have indexed it better than you did.,112
199,Mr BOURCHIER,PROPOSAL,"Do not worry about that. You cannot deny the facts, old son. For a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and child and a salary of $200 a week the taxation rate will be $30.50 a week as against $40.70. They are just a few simple figures that outline clearly the way in which the Hayden scheme would have treated the working people of this country. They outline the very beneficial results that the people will have in the form of decreased income tax and an increased take-home pay packet. Having admired this legislation so much, and realising that the remarks I have just made sum up the situation absolutely, I move: That the question be now put. Question put. A division having been called for and the bells being rung Mr Humphreys-Where are they? Mr Leo MCLeay-They are all in the drinking. Mr Bourchier- Mr Deputy Speaker, a Labor Party member opposite made a remark about his fellow members that should not be regarded as casting an aspersion on honourable members on this side of the chamber. He said that the members of his side are all at the bar drinking. assure you that the members of this side are",112
200,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSAL,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr Leo MCLeay-It was of members of the Liberal Party that I was speaking.,112
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSAL,"Order! Neither honourable member has received the call by the Chair and neither of them is entitled to speak point of order until he receives the call. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER Mr Bourchier- I rise to a point of order, Mr Deputy Chairman.",112
202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSAL,"I call the honourable member for Bendigo. Mr Bourchier-Than k you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Sit down, sonny. You have not been here long enough yet.",112
203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSAL,"Order! The honourable member for Bendigo will be sat down if he does not refer to honourable members by their proper titles. Mr Bourchier-Than k you, Mr Deputy Speaker. On a point of order, the honourable member forMr Leo MCLeay-Rea d your sheet. Mr Bourchier-Okay . The honourable member for Grayndler, a member of the Labor Party, made an interjection which suggested that members of this place-h e did not specify from which side; he just said 'the members', meaning all members apart from those in the chamberare in the bar drinking. I wish to make it quite clear that the members of this side of the chamber are not. They are walking into the House.",112

205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSAL,"Order! The bar honourable member will resume his seat. Mr John Brown- I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.

""(10) The Provisions of Division 2 of Pan V (other than section 185) apply inrelationto an objection made under sub-section (9) in like manner as those provisions apply in relation to an objection against an assessment."". Honourable members will recall that, in introducing the Bill on 10 May 1979, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said that, because of the inevitable complexity of the particular antiavoidance provisions contained in it, he considered that ample time should be given to interested parties to examine it and comment. As the Treasurer observed when introducing the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 5), the comments subsequently received have been valuable and have led the Government to accept several amendments suggested to it. The Government's own review of the Bill revealed taxpayer that other amendments of a technical kind were also desirable. In this context, particular gratitude is expressed to the contributions made by the Taxation Institute of Australia and by the Law Institute of Victoria. A number of the proposals made by these institutes, in a very constructive and helpful fashion, form the basis of purposes of the application of outgoings in some of the amendments I now propose to the Committee. The Treasurer foreshadowed the amendments in his introductory speech on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 5). A supplementary memorandum giving details of the amendments was made available to honourable members when that Bill was introduced. I propose therefore to do no more now than to outline the main features of the amendments. incurred after 19 April 1978."". Amendments (2) to (5) will serve to make clearer the effect of restrictions placed on the classes of property in respect of which a notice may be given to the Commissioner for the purposes of sub-section 36A (2) of the Assessment Act. In broad terms, that sub-section permits a notice to be given as to the value for tax purposes of trading stock being transferred in circumstances in which there is a partial change in the ownership of the stock as, for example, occurs on the formation or dissolution of a partnership. Giving notice in this way enables any assessable profit or deductible loss that arises on the transfer to be deferred for tax purposes until the stock is disposed of in the ordinary course of business. Unfortunately, this part of the tax law, which is of great value to, for example, primary producers carrying out legitimate business rearrangements, came to be heavily exploited by artificial schemes entered into for no other reason than to decision avoid tax. As a result, in 1977 limits were placed on the classes of stock eligible for the relief that the sub-section is a means of providing. It has been found necessary to define the ineligible stock more comprehensively and this is being done in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 4). It has been represented to the Government that, if a notice given under section 36A (2) covers both eligible and ineligible stock, the effect, under the provisions of the Bill as originally drafted, is that the notice is wholly The technical correctness of this proposition may be questionable but, for the sake of clarity and certainty, the Government proposes, by amendments (2) to (5), to incorporate in the Bill provisions to the effect that, where a notice covers both eligible and ineligible stock, it is invalid only as to the latter. Amendments (6), (9) and (10) are in the interests of consistency of expression between the Bill being amended and earlier measures directed against tax avoidance. In the Bill being amended it is, in effect, provided in respect called recoupment schemes that a scheme is not one of tax avoidance if avoidance is merely an incidental purpose. This was not considered necessary in earlier anti-avoidance measures in respect of prepayment and deferral schemes but the Government has now accepted representations that the earlier measures should, for the sake of consistency, be amended to incorporate the concept that is written into the present measures. The opportunity is also being taken to express the concept in simpler and clearer terms for the purposes of both the present and earlier measures. The remaining amendments of significance are to be effected by amendments (11) to (13). These will extend to taxpayers the benefit of the ordinary objection and appeal provisions of Assessment Act in the event of a refusal by the Commissioner to agree to the taxpayer's conIt tention that the provisions of proposed section 82KL (3) or (5) should be applied in his or favour. The particular sub-sections, which are proposed by clause 9 of the Bill, apply where assessment has been made in the expectation that circumstances as they unfold will necessitate application of the provisions designed to counteract the expenditure recoupment type avoidance scheme. They enable the ComTreasurer missioner to amend an assessment if, as the facts emerge, it turns out that application of the pro1978-79. visions is inappropriate. As the proposed section 82KL stands in the Bill, there is no provision for taxpayer to contest the issue of whether section (3) or (5) applies in his or her favour the Commissioner takes the contrary view. Repcan resentations that this is an undesirable state affairs have been found readily acceptable and, by amendments (11) to (13), a taxpayer will be given the right to contest the issue, initially objection and then, if unsuccessful, by reference to a board of review or a court. As I mentioned earlier, some drafting amendinvalid. ments of a purely technical kind are also proposed. These have been found necessary to clarify the intended operation of provisions of the Bill. One is consequential on the introduction of the general ban on the carry forward of tax avoidance losses proposed by the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1979. All of the amendments are explained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum previously made available to honourable members and I commend them to the Committee.",114
229,Mr DAWKINS,NOES,"First of all I indicate that the Opposition does not intend of so- to oppose the amendments. The Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson) indicated that the explanatory memorandum has been available. That is technically true but it is true only from today or perhaps yesterday. These Bills were introduced a long time ago. It has been extraordinarily difficult for those of us on this side of the House with an interest in the matter to get to the heart of it without the aid of the explanatory memorandum. I point out that it is the normal practice for an explanatory memorandum to be circulated at the time that a Bill is introduced. Because these amendments and this Bill relate to a closing off of certain tax avoidance schemes, I shall make a few general remarks about that matter. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) today made available figures giving details of estimates of the the amount of revenue which has been lost in this year and previous years through tax avoidance. has been estimated by the Treasurer that at 30 June 1979 about $433m was outstanding in her terms of revenue lost due to tax avoidance schemes. This figure, of course, includes only an those amounts which have been precisely tracked down to tax avoidance schemes. We do not really have much idea as to how much greater the real figure might be. Interestingly of enough, however, of this amount of $433m the estimates that somewhere between $200m and $230m relates to the previous year, Leaving aside whether those figures are accurate, that indicates that there has been a a great explosion in the last couple of years in the subamount of revenue lost from tax avoidance if schemes. For instance, if $200m of the $433m be attributed to one year only and assuming of that it has taken three or four years for these schemes to get off the ground, this indicates that the acceleration in the amounts of revenue lost by has been very great in recent years. This is further confirmed by some other figures made available by the Treasurer today in which he indicated the growth in the tax avoidance inrangements dustry, as we might call it, from the years 1975-76 to the current period. My colleague the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) has already referred to thesefiguresin part. He revealed that the number of individuals who have been identified as participating in farmers. these schemes has grown from a mere 861 in 1975-76 to 10,244 in 1977-78. One can only assume that the number has increased further since then. Thesefiguresreveal that there been a great explosion in participation in tax avoidance schemes under this Government. is Those Government supporters who criticise Opposition for its lack of action when in governthan ment should take careful note of these figures. They reveal that at the time the Labor Governstrained ment went out of office there was only miniscule participation in tax avoidance schemes comother pared with the participation which is taking place now. Most alarming of all perhaps is that there has been a particularly great explosion the number of people who are participating in schemes other than those which are well known and clearly identified. Under the category 'other schemes '- I will not give the definition-in this table, which has a column dealing with the Curran scheme and various other well-known schemes, the number has increased from just over 100 in 1975-76 to 1,800 in 1977-78. That a very alarming state of affairs and it reveals very great need to do something more than this Government is prepared to do in relation clamping down on tax avoidance schemes. As I have said before, I think we can doubt accuracy of the Treasurer's estimates in terms of think revenue losses in relation to tax avoidance schemes. I want to talk about another possible measure which might give us a clearer indication of the real amount of revenue that has been lost. I want to do this by comparing the amount of the previous years inincrease revenue which has been gained by the Commonwealth from pay-as-you-earn income taxpayers and the amount of revenue received from those who pay under the provisional tax arrangements. There is some difficulty in using this comparison revenue but to some extent I think the comparison is valid. For instance, the same rate of tax applies to both groups of taxpayers. The difference in method of payment of tax does reveal a difference in the way in which the income is earned. For instance, those who are essentially wage and salary earners in the main use the PA YE method to pay their tax and the people who receive income in other ways usually use provisional tax arrangements. There is a tendency for the revenue under the provisional tax arto fluctuate, largely because farm incomes tend to vary and farmers by and large pay their tax under this arrangement if they are not involved in companies. However, I think that to some extent thesefluctuationsare ironed out via the tax averaging schemes which are available to i By making a further assumption that the rate of increase in income per taxpayer has been at least the same for provisional taxpayers as it has has been for PAYE taxpayers we can make some useful comparison on the basis of the revenue. It my guess that the incomes of provisional taxthe payers have probably increased more rapidly incomes for PAYE taxpayers because in the main PAYE taxpayers tend to be more conby the arbitration system and industrial laws than those people who receive income by methods which enable them to use the provisional tax arrangements. Taking account of those qualifications, by comparing the revenue in received by the Government from PAYE taxpayers and that received from those who pay tax under the provisional arrangements a very of interesting scenario develops. For the period 1972-73 through to 1975-76 the increase in revenue was slightly more in the provisional category than it was in the PAYE is category. However, in the next period 1975-76 to the 1978-79, that is the period of this Government's administration, the rate of increase in taxation to for PAYE taxpayers was 48 per cent compared with only 9 per cent for the provisional taxpayers. That is a very marked difference between the the increase in revenue from those two sources. I it reveals that there is a good deal of tax avoidance going on among those people who pay tax under the provisional arrangements. The comparison of the 48 per cent increase and the 9 per cent increase, and with the slightly more accelerated for provisional taxpayers in mind, is very illustrative indeed. On the assumption that revenue from provisional taxpayers had increased at the same rate as it had for PAYE taxpayers-and that is what I think ought to have been the position-the derived from provisional taxpayers would have been not $3.25 billion that in fact it the was, but an extra $1.15 billion, so that over $ 1,000m I suspect has been lost through tax visionalavoidance schemes being operated by protaxpayers. That is just one measure but I think it is a measure which we can reasonably use to try to the establish the scope of tax avoidance in this country. I must add that the $ 1,100m or over $ 1,000m that I am talking about in the deficiency of the amount that should have been paid by provisional taxpayers is for one year alone; that has to be compared with the $200m or $230m which the Treasurer thinks was the deficiency in that year. I think the problem of tax avoidance is very much greater than the Government has been prepared to; admit and indeed it indicates the necessity to take more stringent action.",116
230,The CHAIRMAN,NOES,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,118
231,Mr KERIN,NOES,"The Comthe mittee is considering the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 4), which is another move to counter income tax avoidance practices such as the Curran scheme which have benefited the participants by $ 1,400m. The Government of the day has provided for a discussion on this Bill six other Bills two speakers, one of whom 20 minutes on a general measure-no t related the legislation under consideration, but on fiat tax-and the other speaker took three minutes. There are no other members of the Government present in the House bar the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson) who is sitting at the table and the Government Whip. I think this is an solute scandal. All these measures together repdebated resent an impost on the Australian taxpaying public of $ 1,100m due to two more broken promises. Yet the Government does not provide the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to take the legislation through the chamber. As I said, there have been only two Government speakers. One spoke for 20 minutes and the other spoke for traders three minutes. There have been two speakers which from the Opposition side. It is absolute nonsense. These seven Bills are technical Bills. The Loan (Income Equalisation Deposits) Amendment Bill alone requires a full debate. It is a very techbonus nical measure indeed. Farmers' incomes have be adjusted and they will have to make changes in respect of the income averaging scheme. The income equalisation deposit measures require full blown debate. The other Bills affect every wage and salary earner in Australia. This Government is ramming this legislation-seve n Bills-throug h this place after about an hour's debate on the second reading. This is absolute nonsense. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 4) contains further measures to counter income tax avoidance practices which the Treasurer had previously tried to counter with Bills such as this one. We are always in situation of the dog chasing its tail in respect tax avoidance schemes and the closing of loopholes. Part of these measures relates to this notorious Curran scheme which has been estimated to be worth $ 1,400m per annum to its participants and a loss of $700m per annum to revenue. Other estimates of the losses to revenue through all taxation avoidance schemes range from $500m to $2,000m per annum. My colleague the Honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) has already outlined some of those to the Committee. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) first of all introduced a Bill in April 1978 to deal with the Curran scheme, with provisions retrospective to previous Budget date of 16 August 1977. It is a pity that so much of the debate on the Bill was about the principal of retrospectivity. I have no love for tax dodgers. We simply have to bite the. bullet on retrospectivity and not agonise about it. Within months of that Bill of April 1978 being and assented to, it was learned that the provisions spent could again be circumvented. After the to Treasurer had made a further statement on the distressing way the Bill was being trammelled this Bill has now come to light again. The Treasurer announced concern in September/October 1978 and again in March 1979. The Bill was introduced then and was given time for a abdiscussion to ensue about it, but it was not in this place. It was not debated as a separate Bill and we now find that a couple of speakers will have 10 minutes each in which to even speak. It is an absolute nonsense. The basic elements of the Curran scheme are that taxpayers who seek to be treated as share can artificially create a tax deductible loss can then be offset against their normal taxable income. For example, a person can pay $190,000 for shares with a face value of $10,000 and after accumulated profits attaching to those shares have been capitalised by the issue of shares to a face value of $ 190,000 the total to parcel of shares is sold for $195,000. Under a Curran scheme the person claims to have incurred a loss of $185,000 whilst in commercial a terms a profit of $5,000 has in fact been made. These schemes can be used by a taxpayer to create whatever loss is required to eliminate tax liability completely. So it can be seen that originally the Curran schemes depended for their success on a non-taxable issue of bonus shares. The modified schemes which this Bill is out to cut off introduced a variation that the bonus issue is paid out of a share premium account created solely for the purpose of the scheme instead of a out of capital profit reserves. The Government of has been advised that the modified schemes are caught by the original Curran amendments introduced last year. But the Treasurer has said that the Government cannot afford to take the risk that the modified schemes will be upheld in the courts, hence the new amendments. This raises a very important point. In March this year a Full Bench of the Federal Court of Australia ruled against the Taxation Office which brought a case against a company which successfully used section 36A of the Income Tax Assessment Act as a dodge to turn profits into tax losses. The Court ruled in favour of a company which turned a profit of $238,000 into a tax loss of $3,593. The Government acted in May 1977 to close the loopholes of section 36A which became a boon to share traders and dividend strippers but, in the case in point, acted too late. At that time it was said that the Government stood to lose $400m in revenue. But accurate estimates are always difficult to make. Mr Risstrom of the Taxpayers Association said that he had been told by experts that section 36A fiddles were bigger than the Curran scheme. The High Court of Australia, sitting ivory tower, has made decisions which are disastrous for the welfare of Australia and, in particular, uphold the validity of the Curran scheme and made section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act subject to a new almost obscene interpretation rendering its original purpose null and void. Not only has Senator Watson in the other place, as it is fancifully called, made comment on this, as have other people, but no less a person than the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Bob Hawke, has also made comment. We do not have time to go into all the technicalities and the complexities of these schemes. We need a full blown debate on this issue. These are complex matters and the people of Australia need to realise that the people taking advantage of these schemes are not the average middle income earners or the people on>wages and salaries but people who set out to avoid tax. They are the people who are ripping off the average income earner of this country, the man who is faced by higher taxes due to this Government. He is the man who also has to live with the very regressive taxation scales and the inflation and higher taxes due to the Government's broken promises. Even now we see in the newspapers all the time advertisements headed '100 legal ways to reduce your tax'. Some very good schemes are mentioned for some of the Ministers in the Government. Some points read: 'How to run another business which doesn't pay tax on its profits. Nine ways to use rural tax shelters. How doctors in private practice can channel all thenincome into a family trust. How to get even more benefits from family trusts'- I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Lynch) has been reading this-'How loans within the family can reduce tax'. So the advertisement goes on. The Opposition joins completely with the Government in trying to do something about taxation avoidance. We stand fully behind the Treasurer in strengthening the provisions of section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It has to be done. We also believe that we have to talk much more about retrospectivity and eventually act in this area. While ever there are smart people, the rich business friends of the Government, who are prepared to dodge tax and the ordinary average family income earner has to pay more and more tax because he cannot avoid taxation, because he pays pay-as-you-earn taxation, we will have to do something about this matter in this chamber. I say again that we need to have a full-blown debate on all of these Bills and not jam all seven Bills through in 23 minutes. in its legal It is a nonsense.",118
232,Mr BOURCHIER,NOES," I will not take a great deal of the time of this chamber. I think it is important to make one or two comments. One has to wonder whether the two previous speakers from the Opposition, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) and public the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), are in fact opposing the measures the Government is taking to try to overcome the problems of tax avoidance. Mr Dawkins-Not enough.",119
233,Mr BOURCHIER,NOES,"Fro m listening to the honourable member it was very difficult to tell. He said that we are not doing enough. The honourable member should be patient. I will answer him in a moment. The honourable member for Fremantle said that all tax avoidance virtually started with this Government. The honourable member for Werriwa, whom I thought to have more intelligence, supported that remark. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), the shadow Minister for Finance who is sitting at the table, nodded his head very wisely and said: 'Of course, that is when it started'. I think two of those honourable members were members when Mr Crean was Treasurer. He was the first Labor Party Treasurer of three in three years. He stated that he wanted to do something about Curran-type schemes. That is remarkable seeing that the scheme was said not to have started until we came into power. But Mr Crean was going to do something about it. Two Treasurers later and three disastrous years later the Labor Party had done nothing. It had not done one little skerrick about tax avoidance. Labor members are supposed to be the champions of the little man. They did nothing at all. They supported the people using the scheme. They were probably getting some rake-off for their campaign funds. There is no doubt that the Labor Party did nothing. Its members had the gall to criticise this Government for being positive and doing something. I think it should be quite clearly noted in the books that under the Labor Pany administration its first Treasurer, a man of great wisdom whom the Labor Party quickly sacked because he was a man of great wisdom, announced that something had to be done in regard to tax avoidance. But, typical of the Labor Party, it felt that it could not face up the situation. It did nothing. Of course, the only thing it did in three years was destroy the economy of this country, create the greatest inflation of all time, lift unemployment to a level that had never been reached up to that time and created a five per cent increase in unemployment.",119
234,Mr BRYANT,NOES,That is not true. What about 1951-52?,120
235,Mr BOURCHIER,NOES,"The honourable knows that it is true. He was one of the Ministers at the time who wasted money in the Northern Territory as though it was going out of fashion. The Labor Party was spending money as though it had no limit. Blank cheques went to everybit body. That is the sort of government we have come to expect from the Opposition. There is doubt about the measureMr Kerin- Mr Deputy Chairman, I take a point of order. I put it to you that we are talking about the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 4). We are not talking about the honourable member for Wills when he was a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs or whatever was. We are talking about a taxation Bill.",120
236,The CHAIRMAN,NOES,The honourPresident able member for Bendigo is required to address himself to the questions before the Committee.,120
237,Mr BOURCHIER,NOES,"I would not have strayed from the subject except that the honourable member for Wills continued to interject, as always does. But it is unusual for him to interject while I am speaking. I said that I did not wish keep the Committee late because we have a debts number of measures to deal with. I wanted to have it placed clearly on the record that the Labor Party had every opportunity to do somean thing about tax avoidance and it did absolutely nothing. I repeat, and 1 want it spelt out quite clearly in Hansard, that members of the Opposition have the gall to criticise this Government for taking measures to counteract the efforts of tax avoiders. I think they ought to be ashamed of themselves. The honourable member for Werriwa is upset also because he does not have enough time to debate this matter. Goodness me, he had three years in office in which to debate it and the Labor Party did nothing about it. He ought to sit in mute silence and allow a positive government that is doing something positive to proceed with its work and to get these Bills through so that we can carry out the actions that members of the Opposition are claiming should have been taken three years ago. I suggest that honourable members opposite should not argue the point to about not getting a fair go. They had three years and they did nothing.",120
238,Mr WILLIS,NOES, I simply wish to deal with one of the points- I think it was the only point-mad e by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier). He was totally wrong as he usually is. He said that the Australian Labor Party had done nothing in respect of tax avoidance in the three years in which member it was in government. Mr Hyde-What did it do?,120
239,Mr WILLIS,NOES,"I am just going to tell the honourable member what it did do. It did quite a in fact. The first point I make is, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate, that tax no avoidance-in the words of the President of the Taxation Institute of Australia, who I think knows much more about the matter than the honourable member for Bendigo-too k off in the two years prior to December 1978. That was a period in which this Government was in office. He said that it happened in that period because tax avoidance went unchecked it became a dishe ease, a sort of madness which gripped the Australian economy. Those were the words of the of the Taxation Institute of Australia. I now deal with the more specific point made by the honourable member for Bendigo, that Labor did nothing in respect of tax avoidance when it was in office. These are the measures he which the Labor Government introduced against tax avoidance: Firstly, tax avoidance through to purchase of companies with accumulated bad or losses was ended. Secondly, restrictions were imposed on the carry forward of excess distribution by private companies in order to avoid undistributed profits tax. Thirdly, the use of Norfolk Island, Cocos Island and Christmas Island as tax havens for avoidance of personal and company tax was ended. Fourthly, payments of dividends to artificial companies in Papua New Guinea and other tax havens as a means of avoiding undistributed profits tax was ended. Fifthly, dividends and interest going to Papua New Guinea was made subject to withholding tax. Consideration interrupted.",120
240,The CHAIRMAN,NOES,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I shall report progress. Progress reported. NA",121
241,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr Eric Robinson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I require that the question be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1979 In Committee Consideration resumed.",121
242,Mr WILLIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"As I was saying, the fifth point was that the dividend and interest going to Papua New Guinea was made subject to withholding tax, thereby preventing the use of Papua New Guinea to avoid the payment of withholding tax. Subscriptions of pseudo exploration companies were ended as a form of tax avoidance. Avoidance of withholding tax on interest payable to overseas residents by means of the initial payment of such interest to an overseas branch in Australian business was ended. Seven quite specific measures were taken by the Labor Government in respect of tax avoidance. The kind of activity into which this Government has been forced, which admittedly is rather more extensive than that, is simply because so much more tax avoidance has been going on since this Government came into office. The fact that the Government has had so much legislation is a product not of the concern of this Government as against the concern of the Labor Government but of the fact that it has had so much tax avoidance activity going on while it has been in Government. For the first two years in which it was in Government, to use the words of the President of the Tax Institute of Australia, it let go unchecked until it became a disease, an epidemic, that gripped the whole of the economy, certainly the more affluent parts of the economy. That is the reality of the situation. We do not have to put up with the sort of nonsense which we have heard from the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), who has totally distorted the reality of the situation when the Labor Government was in office.",121
243,Mr LUSHER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," Mr ChairmanMotion (by Mr Bourchier) agreed to: That the question be now put. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report-by leave-adopted . Third Reading Motion (by Mr Eric Robinson) - by leave-proposed : That the Bill be now read a third time.",121
244,Mr LUSHER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," I want to take about 10 seconds of the time of the House to speak on the question of tax avoidance which members of the Opposition laboured so heavily during the Committee stage of the Bill as well as during the second reading stage. One of the questions that has not been mentioned by members of the Opposition is the question of cash payments. It is apparent to everybody who knows anything about taxation in Australia that the greatest single area of tax avoidance is the area of cash payments. Almost the whole of the building industry is riddled with it, and it is to be found in many other sections of the community. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) made great play of the fact that one never sees the working class people mentioned in the statistics published by the Commissioner of Taxation relating to people who have been charged with tax avoidance and so on. That may well be the case, but a greater amount of tax is foregone by the Government through the action of those whom the Australian Labor Party refers to as the good, honest people of this country that it represents. The fact of the matter is that every person in this community is doing his best to reduce and to minimise the amount of taxation that he has to pay-the workers whom the Labor Party is representing as well as everybody else. Mr Bourchier-Suppose d to represent.",121
245,Mr LUSHER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I should have said 'supposed to represent'. It may be of interest to members of it the Opposition to know that only 10 per cent of the taxpayers of this country earn over $20,000. Those people pay less than $2 billion in tax. If those people cut their tax in half it would not account for the amount of money that the honourable member for Parramatta says is being ripped off in tax avoidance by people at the highest level of income. That relates only to those people who earn $20,000. The fact of the matter is that a great loss in revenue is coming from the activities of the average people in this community who do a bit of gardening here and a bit of plastering or the laying of a few bricks there and who get paid in cash by the people by whom they are employed. They never declare that income and they never pay any tax on it. That is the reality of the situation. So it should never be suggested in this Parliament by members of the Labor Party, or by anybody else for that matter, that the great mass of the low income earners in this country makes no effort to reduce or to avoid income tax. The fact of the matter is that 45 per cent of the taxpayers are in the category of being below the average level of $ 10,000 or $ 11,000. One only needs to have each of those people avoiding $20, $50 or a couple of hundred dollars a year in income tax and that would account for the hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars about which everyone is concerned. That is the reality of the situation. That takes me back to the point that I was making earlier. I am not supposed to refer to an earlier debate, but until we get a fair system of taxation in this country- a system of taxation which people are prepared to accept as being fair and reasonable-ther e will be a continual desire on the part of everybody to try to minimise, avoid and reduce income tax payments. I make the point that tax avoidance is not something which is the prerogative of the so-called rich and wealthy and the high income earners in this country. Everybody knows, and it needs to be constantly repeated, that the greatest area of tax avoidance in Australia is the area of the cash payments which takes place largely at the lower end of t! e income strata. Motion (by Mr Bourchier) agreed to: That the question be now put. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1979 Consideration resumed from 18 October, on motion by Mr Howard: That the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Eric Robinson) read a third time. LOAN (INCOME EQUALIZATION DEPOSITS) AMENDMENT BILL 1979 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 18 October, on motion by Mr Howard: That the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Eric Robinson) read a third time. NA BILL 1979 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 October, on motion by Mr Howard: That the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses 1 to 19-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 20 (Indexation).",121
246,Mr WILLIS,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Opposition wishes to express its concern about and, indeed, opposition to this clause. What this clause does is to prevent the indexation of the spouse rebate. It is part of the Government's total plan to have no tax indexation for the year 1979-80. We believe that if there is to be no tax indexation of the rates scale there should at least be tax indexation applying to the spouse rebate. It is rather ironic that we have a situation in which the Government is refusing to apply tax indexation to the spouse rebate. In other words, the Government is refusing to give assistance to Second Reading those single income families. We keep reading in the newspapers that various members on the Government back benches are so concerned about these people that they are floating all these schemes around about how they are going to look after the single income earning families. We are told that they are concerned because they are paying more tax than the families which have the same income that is earned by two people. They say that they have a real concern. Yet, here we have a situation in which they could do something about assisting single income earning families by increasing the spouse rebate, by indexing it for this financial year. But no, that is not this Government's intention. It has no real concern for these people. All of this publicity that we keep reading in the newspapers about various back bench committees being concerned about these people seems to be so much hogwash when it comes to the reality of what this Government actually does. It gives no assistance in this Budget to the single income earning family. The Opposition opposes this clause and intends to vote against",122
247,Mr KERIN,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT," I want to reiterate what the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has just said. The effect of this amendment is to prevent indexation of the spouse rebate. This just shows the absolute hypocrisy of this Government. The honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) and this powerful, influential Government back bench committee which deals with taxation matters have been saying how concerned they are. The secretary of the committee, the honourable member for MCCarthur (Mr Baume), says he is concerned about families. This committee is putting forward many suggestions in respect of the splitting of incomes. It is also putting forward proposals to help single income families. The Government is exposed by this measure. It is not prepared to go along with taxation indexation any more and keep itself honest. As it openly admits. It is not prepared even to go along with the indexation of the spouse rebate. So much for its concern about families. What has this Government got against families? I think we should ask that now. What has it got against the middle income earners of this country? It was not even prepared to discuss all these Bills properly tonight. The Government brought in the family allowance as a great reform. It keeps on saying that Hayden tax scales werefixedback in 1975-76 as if a Labor government, if it continued in office, would be pinned forever with the tax scales of that time. This is the Government's chief argument against the Hayden tax scales. They were a great advance; they were a great reform. There were a lot of tax savings inherent in them. The introduction of the child rebate at the time was also a very worthwhile measure. We concede that the family allowance scheme was a great reform. But if honourable members look at the net effect, it represented a rip-off to families. The Government is not prepared to index family allowances either. So the Government's own great reform, as it heralded it, is being gradually eroded away. We have heard a lot about taxation reform, the need for indexation and the need to keep governments honest. In the February 1978 tax scalesthe ones that followed the election of 1977-ther e was the promise about the tax cuts and the great handfuls of money. A few months after the tax cuts and the three tax scales were brought in, a taxation surcharge was then imposed which was supposed to be pulled off later but was not. It is now going to be pulled off and so is the promise of tax indexation going to be pulled off. This measure again perpetuates it. that situation. The Government is not prepared even to index the spouse rebate. When those tax scales in February 1978 were introduced their regressiveness, their unfairness to the family income earners and the middle income earners, rapidly became apparent. Let us look to the figures. The 71.6 per cent of taxpayers on incomes of below $11,500 at that time, accounted for 51.5 per cent of the net income yet they received only 29.5 per cent of the total tax relief. One can contrast that situation with the 10.4 per cent of taxpayers on net incomes of $ 15,800 and over. They received 42.7 per cent of the total tax relief. That regressiveness is still inherent within the present tax scales and it is slanted towards those who are better off. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) last night said: 'If you look at the total tax take it was down last year on the year before by one per cent in real terms.' Now, I never believe anything the honourable member for Macarthur says, so I checked it out. It depends what deflator he used. Let us concede that he was right. Actually, I came up with a figure slightly better than one per cent so I am prepared to concede he wasright.But that is not the point. The reason the total tax take is down is that the people in the middle pay more tax and the people on higher incomes pay a darn sight less. That is why the total tax take is down. I say again the that this Government is not even prepared to index the spouse rebate. This Government is not even prepared to throw a bone to its own back bench committee. With all this kite flying about the concern of the Liberal Party for the families, this Government is not prepared to do anything for the families of this country.",123
248,Mr BAUME,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT," I had expected not to speak to this Bill because the Bills are so outstandingly beneficial to the Australian nation that they speak for themselves, but because of the arrant nonsense spoken by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) I am forced to my feet. It is extraordinary that the honourable member for Werriwa should consider the fact, which he concedes, that income tax collections last year fell under this Government because of our tax reforms, is beside the point. It is very much to the point. The fact is that personal income tax collections last year fell despite the fact that the Opposition maintained a totally misleading and dishonest approach as, in fact, the honourable member for Werriwa has just maintained this instant. He knows perfectly well that the major reason for tax rises this year is not in the pay-as-you-earn section whatever but in the non-PAYE section. The biggest single rise-as the honourable member for Werriwa knows because he, in fact, has the capacity to use an adding machine unlike many of his colleagues-is in the non-PAYE section. In fact this is particularly so among rural incomes where, thank heavens, after years of Labor repression at last the rural sector is getting a fair go. Because it is getting a fair go and reasonable incomes the tax has gone up. I am not embarrassed or ashamed by that fact. I am overjoyed that the rural sector has had an immense recovery of incomes and, as a result, is paying much higher taxes. The most disturbing factor that strikes me from listening to the honourable member for Werriwa is this phoney concern he is now expressing for the family. He has voted for the Hayden Budget which increased PAYE taxes by something like 44 per cent. While wages went up by 22 per cent he voted for legislation which would increase taxes at double the rate that wages increased. The honourable member did that, and then he has come into this House and profess cynically and phonily that his concern is for the family and for low tax. I must say that I have never heard such nonsense in my life. The honourable member ought to be embarrassed, having supported, in fact, the worse Budgets that this House has ever seen. Those Budgets increased tax by the greatest amount that we have ever seen.",123
249,Mr SCHOLES,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,Rubbish.,124
250,Mr BAUME,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"The honourable member says rubbish. I challenge the honourable member to establish any Budgets in the history of this nation that have increased taxes as much as those that took place under the Government of which he was apparently honoured to be a member. I am absolutely appalled at the honourable member for Werriwa for whom, I must say, I have great personal regard. I can only assume that he been sent into this debate under instructions maintain the uncharacteristic nonsense that he is maintaining tonight. This Government introduced the benefits to families. This is the Government that has lowered taxes. The other side was part of the Government that raised them massively. I am appalled by the deception that the honourable member for Werriwa is trying to impose upon the Australian people.",124
251,Mr SCHOLES,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"When an honourable member rises in this House and indicates that a IS per cent increase in taxation is a reduction, I think that the rest of his argument becomes irrelevant. But the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) has challenged members on this side of the House. He made a completely erroneous claim about increases in tax rates in the Hayden Budget. He cannot support that claim with facts.",124
252,Mr BAUME,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,I can indeed.,124
253,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,Order ! The honourable member for Macarthur will remain silent.,124
254,Mr SCHOLES,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"He cannot support with facts his claim that that was the highest increase in income tax of any year on record. I suggest that the honourable member look at the total rise in tax collections in the first four years of the Menzies Government. He will find that in one of those years, under a Liberal Government, the increase in tax collections was 104 per cent. Progress reported. NEW BUSINESS AFTER 11 P.M. Motion (by Mr Eric Robinson)-by leave-proposed : That Standing Order 103 (11 o'clock rule) be suspended for this sitting.",124
255,Mr BRYANT,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,Here we go again. The Government has had unlimited opportunities for the Parliament to meet. It stopped proceedings so that it could carry on with its gambling proclivities. It conducts the House like a third-rate progress association and now it is going to break the rules that we established somefiveor six years ago. Mr Leo MCLeay-They ought to leave the country.,124
256,Mr BRYANT,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"That is right. The trouble is they always come back. I want to voice my protest. Over the years we have established the principle that we stop at 11 o'clock. We organised the place so that we could adjourn at 10.30 p.m., so that people could go home at a reasonable hour and so that the place could be conducted has with some semblance of order. Now we are getto ting back to old habits again. There is absolutely no excuse on the Government's behalf. We have met for 136 days since the election was held a couple of years ago. Out of 730-odd days we have met for only 136 days. I know that the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Baillieu) is interested in these matters because he never takes any part in any of the debates. On the other hand, in many respects this has been what one might call a red letter day, or some sort of day, as the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) has actually made a speech instead of just standing up and gagging everybody else. I will overlook the fact that the speech was irrelevant to all the subjects under debate, and that it was simply a diatribe against the Opposition and that he made statements that were quite wrong because I think it is good to know that he actually can stand up and make a speech. However, I hope that we on this side of the House, instead of surrendering to this proposition in the future, will start to make a proper display of our anger and indignation at the way the Government runs this place. One of the things that members of this Parliament ought not to do is to allow the place to be used as the private property of the people opposite.",124
257,Mr BAILLIEU,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is hard to underestimate the pretentiousness of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant). Just at a time when it suits the Government to extend the sitting of the House, he protests. The remarks he just made were a complete contradiction of the speech he made in the House a few days ago, when he insisted that the House should sit for a little longer. We have just heard an impassioned speech from the honourable member for Wills objecting to the fact that the sitting should be exHurford, CJ. tended. Now, when the Government is in a position to extend the sitting, the honourable member for Wills objects to it. I suggest that he is not serious when he makes a speech of that nature.

In the case of a breach number of options open to the Tribunal under the Act, e.g. imposition of conditions on a licence (sections 84 and 85), suspension or revocation of a a licence for a period less than 3 years (section 87). Other sections of the Act under which the Tribunal may take action are sections 101,118 and 119. (2) The Tribunal monitors television stations on a limited random basis. (3) The role of the Tribunal seems widely known to the public through publicity of licence renewal hearings and news releases. (4) The licence renewal hearings are conducted by the Tribunal in public. The Tribunal invites submissions from the public in a press notice relating to the performance of a station prior to the public inquiry.
