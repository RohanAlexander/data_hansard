Has a decision yet been arrived at; if not, when may one be expected? Mr BRLTCE' - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow.'1. The Australian. Polled Hereford Breeders' Association of Rockhampton communicated with the Minister for Trade and Customs on 7th April, 1924, in regard to this matter. The Minister replied, suggesting, that the Association approach the various overseashipping companies with a view to obtaining from them the same freight concessions in regard to> the transportation of stud stock, as were granted at the time by shipping companies to breeders in South Africa and New Zealand'. There is no record of any communication on the subject lraving since - been received by the Government from this Association.. 2. The question, of granting assistance to breeders in relation to oversea, freight om innported stud stock is receiving: theconsideration of the Government in connection with the general cprestioni of the improvement of daily herds.

26,Mr FORDE,AERIAL MAIL SERVICE TO,"the Minister representing the Minister for Markets and Migration, upon notice I. H'ow long has the Dairy Produce Control Board been functioning? 2. What has it done up to *he present time? 3. What increase, if any, has it brought about in the price paid to the Australian dairy farmer for his butter fat? 4. Did the farmers receive an immediate increase in the price of butter after the Act came into force, as prophesied by the Treasurer, when the Dairy Produce Export Control Bill was before the House last session? 5. What action does the Government intend to take to ensure a living wage to the dairy farmers of Australia?",15
27,Mr ATKINSON,AERIAL MAIL SERVICE TO,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Since the Oth May, 1925, 2. During the short period of its existence the board has laid down the conditions and restrictions under which licences to export butter and cheese shall be issued, and his also taken steps to establish its London agency. Further, it has secured a reduction in the rates of marine insurance which, it is estimated, will effect a saving to the dairy industry this year of over Â£20,000. 3, 4, and 5. Under the Dairy Produce Export Control Act the powers of the board are limited to the control of the export and the sale and distribution after export of Australian - butter and cheese. This control only commenced with the shipment of the first of this season's dairy produce about six weeks ago. It is hoped that the board, by an organized system of oversea marketing, by judicious advertising, by effecting savings in the rates of marine insurance, and in other directions, will enable the Australian dairy farmer to secure satisfactory prices in future for the surplus butter and cheese exported from the Commonwealth. PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATOR'S DETERMINATION No. 6, 1923. NA OFFICERS.",15
28,Mr COLEMAN,SALARIES OF TREASURY ASSESSING,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. In regard to. the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator's determination No. 6 of 1923, respecting salaries to be paid to officers of the assessing brandies of the Treasury Department, is it the intention of the Treasurer that additional payments, due under that determination, are to be denied to Commonwealth officers transferred to the services of the States pursuant to the Income Tax Collection Act 1923, in respect of any advancement to a higher assessing section since the dates of the taxation agreements, whereas any payment now being made is reduced at the expiration of one month from the removal of the officer to a lower section? 2. If so, why is this determination being thus applied in part only?",15
29,Dr EARLE PAGE,SALARIES OF TREASURY ASSESSING,"The Commonwealth is responsible for payment of any difference of salary between what the State allotted and what the officer so transferred was receiving at date of transfer, including allowances to permanent occupants of the positions covered by determination No. 6 of 1923. In all States except New South Wales, the Commonwealth also recognizes annual increments due under such award to permanent occupants of assessing positions, provided they have completed twelve months' service in each subdivision. So far as New South Wales is concerned, the Commonwealth Solicitor-General has advised that under the provisions of the amalgamation agreement, New South Wales officers are not entitled to incremental advancement under the determination No. 6 of 1923. If the State authorities promote to a higher position in the assessing section an ex-Commonwealth officer who was, at the date of transfer to the State Service, receiving an allowance as the permanent occupant of a lower position in the assessing section, the Commonwealth does not consider itself responsible for payment of the allowance under the assessors' determination applicable to the position to which the officer has been promoted, but if the State salary allotted to the higher position is lower than the salary and allowance provided under Commonwealth determination No. 6 for the lower position previously occupied, the Commonwealth would be responsible for any difference. All officers-thos e transferred to State ancl those retained in the Commonwealth on assessing work-ceas e to draw the assessors' allowance one month after permanent transfer from their permanent position in the assessing section.

What has been the quantity and value of cotton grown in Queensland each vear since 1020? i . Will he say when he expect? a decision will be arrived at as to the exact basis upon which the guarantee for the 1925-6 crop will bo given? 5. Will the Government accede to the request of the Queensland Government and the Queensland Council of Agriculture for a Federal bounty of 2d. per lb. on raw cotton, instead of the present guaranteed price under State control? 0. What is the approximate amount that tfnglaud pays annually to other countries for raw cotton, and approximately what amount is paid to each country from which England Imports raw cotton?",15
30,Mr ATKINSON,SALARIES OF TREASURY ASSESSING,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1, 2, and S. These particulars are being obtained, and will be made available as soon as practicable. 4. A definite decision in regard to this mat* ter cannot be readied until the views of the State Governments concerned are forthcoming. On the 14th August last, the Prime Minister communicated to the State Governments the proposals of the Commonwealth in regard to the guarantee for the coming season. The Victorian Government has accepted those proposals, but replies have not yet heen received from the other Governments concerned. 5. This question is at present under consideration. 0.

33,Dr EARLE PAGE,CANCELLATIO N OE,"On the 19 th August, the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked the following questions:1. Has he seen the serious statement in the press that Â£250 in ?aotes have been seized from Chinese by Constables Wagener and Rowland t 2. Is the statement by the police accurate, that Tecords of the numbers of the notes have not been kept by the Commonwealth Bank; if so, who was the Governor of the Bank at the time such notes were supposed to have been burnt? 3. In view of the seriousness of an accurate note register apparently not being kept for cancelled notes, will he see that an up-to-dato system of note cancellation is installed in the Commonwealth Bank? I am now able to furnish the following information:1. Yes. 2. The particular notes could not have been recorded in the Commonwealth Bank, because they had not been redeemed by the Commonwealth Bank, or withdrawn from circulation. There is no justification whatever for the belief that the notes "" were supposed to have been burned some time ago."" The Chinaman was acquitted of the charge of having notes in his possession believed to have been stolen, and the notes were returned to him. 3. I am advised that an up-to-date system of note cancellation already exists. BUTTER EXPORT.",16
34,Mr ATKINSON,CANCELLATIO N OE,"The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) asked the Minister representing the Minister for Markets and Migration the following questions on 3rd September:1. Whether the Butter Export Control Board has yet made any agreement with the marine underwriters m regard to the insurance of butter carried from Australia to London 2. If so, the rates and special conditions mentioned ? 3. Is it possible to state what is the amount of the saving in insurance to the dairymen of Australia, as compared with the previous rates charged f ' I am now in a position to furnish the following information: 1. Yes. 2. The reduced rates of insurance to the United Kingdom, the Continent of Europe, and the east coast of North America as arranged by the board for the twelve months ending 31st August, 1920, are as follow:At and from cold stores at port of shipment ""to port of destination ... ... 6 9 At and from factory to port of destinationExcluding coastal risk ... 7 3 Including coastal risk ... 8 3 10 0 The rates to other countries, including South Africa and the West Coast of North and South America, but excluding certain ports in the East, are -6d. per cent, less than the above rates. The insurance covers loss from defective condition of the butter and/or cheese from any cause which shall arise, ineluding the risks of war, strikes, malicious damage, or shortage of fuel. 3. The saving to the dairy producers in Australia will be over Â£20,000, based on last season's export figures. EXPORT SANDIMPORTS .

Navigation Aet Royal Commission-Memo randum supplementary to the Reports, by Mr FAnstey, M.P. WAR PENSIONS.",17
35,Dr MALONEY,CANCELLATIO N OE,"Melbourne) [2.53] I moveThai in view of the factsL That, when the Australian men offered their lives to fight for their country, the Defence Department had the choice of the greatest surgeons and physicians to examine such men; 2. That they liad the advantage of the Health Department and the Health Scientific Department to assist them in deciding whether the men volunteering were in a state of health or not; 3. That hardships of war make more acute and observable latent and obscure weaknesses; 4. That, in view of the many and generous promises continually reiterated from the multitude of enlistment platformsit is the opinion of this House that no soldier who was accepted after passing - such examinations should be refused any rights under the War Pensions Act for himself or his dependants through certain present medical experts giving as their opinion the causes arose from pre-war causes. It is also the opinion of this House that all men who offered their lives, and passed the above scientific examination, should be considered perfectly healthy men from that date. I ask honourable members not to look upon this motion from a party point of view, because it is really an effort to secure justice for ex-soldiers and their dependants. If the Government could see its way clear to adopt this motion, it would remove many injustices, prevent unkind treatment, and be a boon to the officials who are administering the Repatriation Department. limits of the act and the regulations applying to it , I have found the officials of the department very sympathetic. During the last few weeks I have had a very pleasant experience with the,League of Child Helpers. Connected with thai movement are reputed hard, business meij who, when it came to assisting the - chiV dren, I found, have hearts as soft and as sweet as the petals of a rose. There was not one single refusal - to. help those little ones who are at school, and 'who will ultimately be the citizens of Australia. Why should not the Government act in the same way? No honourable member supporting the Government, if .he speaks the truth, will deny that highly capable surgeons and physicians offered their services during the war. Truly, some did object, and I was one of them, to the Town Hall being used as a place' for testing the lungs. Many of our prominent surgeons and physicians, notably the late Dr O'Hara, Dr Stirling, and others, offered to the medical officers who were appointed for this work the use of their own private studies for the examination of recruits The Minister will agree that if there had been any doubt about the' matter, the medical officers examining the recruits who were offering their lives for the sake of their country, could have made use of, say, the Health Department to obtain blood tests, and to call together immediately a conclave of surgeons and physicians to formulate an opinion on certain cases. I do not think that I am stepping beyond the line of justice when I say that every man who has passed under those stringent conditions should be taken as healthy at the date of examination, and that no medical officer should now be made, as it were, a private detective to try to ascertain pre-war latent causes of disease. I know many men - who, perhaps, would have fallen victims to tuberculosis had they not been well cared for. At least, five or six of my personal friends, who seemed to have been sentenced to death by that complaint in England, came out to Australia"" and have now lived the allotted ppan of life. It is true that the hardships' of war make more acute and observable latent and obscure weaknesses.. Absence of proper food and proper sanitary conWithin the ditions, diseases that are carried by vermin and parasites-trenc h fever, is carried, I believe, by the louse-al l tend to discover latent weaknesses in the human system. An anaemic person will catch a disease from which a healthy person would be immune. We all know the classic example of the great Napoleon, who handled plague patients in Egypt to give his soldiers confidence, and to show that fear was a great causa of disease. An y one who cares to go to the Christian Science Temple on Wednesday nights will see there how the mind controlling physical weaknesses builds up that fighting power without which persons will, perhaps, succumb to illnesses from they would otherwise recover. regard to the promises that were made to the soldiers, no man can speak with greater authority than I can, because I am the only person who was continuously a member of the Victorian Recruiting Committee from its inception u n t i l its dis- the few survivors were enabled bandment. The undertakings that were given from thousands of platforms throughout. Australia, and endorsed by the men and women in the audiences, should be religiously kept. Certainly the soldiers i u the recent war have been treated much better than were those who took part in the Boer war. I was opposed to the Boer war, but I never received much credit for my attitude until I visited South A f r i ca recently. promises made to the men who enlisted for that campaign were vilely broken, and the late Sir John Madden, Chief Justice of Victoria. was man enough to say that publicly. Thinking that it would be well to have his statement on record, I wrote to him a few years before his death, and I have the honour of possessing a letter from him in which he reiterates the declaration I have attributed to him. The soldiers in the great war fared better, but it is a degradation of an honourable profession to ask ii surgeon or physician to probe for a pre-war origin of soldiers' disabilities. Those doctors are being asked to indict their fellow practitioners of in competence for having passed men who were not physically fit. My motion asks that this matter shall be settled once and finally, and that all men who offered their services, were accepted after examination, and have suffered disabilities, shall be entitled to repatriation benefits. Many of these soldiers are limbless, and the' Bulletin of 30th March, 1922, published an appealing cartoon under the heading ' ' I u the Name of ANZAC."" The words beneath the cartoon wereThe khaki that onee brought glory tralia is now used chiefly to bring small coins to the hands of musicians, who pervade the enlistment. streets of Australian cities, and those of Sydney in particular. Most of the collectors are limbless men, and the Tattle of their boxes is more an appeal to the charity of the passer-by Dr Moloney. than a reproach to Australia. If the pensions paid to them are insufficient, they must be increased. Surely every honourable member will agree with that sentiment. I am reminded of that glorious episode of the Crimean war which which Tennyson immortalized' in those In stirring verses, "" The Charge of the Light. Brigade."" How were the Crimean veterans treated ? Many died in the workhouse, and it was only when Sir George Newnes, the famous newspaper projn-ietor, raised a subscription that to live in comfort for their remaining days. When I was a medical student in England I collected sixpences from fellow students for the purchase .of a wheeled chair for a soldier who was without feet. The man underwent eighteen operations, the last of which was fatal. Somebody said of him, "" Well, he does d r in k , "" and I shall never forget the sympathetic reply of Professor Owen: The "" This poor man has a pension of 6d. per clay, ancl if somebody offers him. a drink, can you blame him for accepting it ? "" I have a list of the number of Crimean veterans who died in the workhouse during my student years, and up to the time. I left London. The treatment, of those soldiers was a stain on the British nation, and I am. sure that if the opinion of the British people had been sought they would never have permitted such a thing to happen. Every organization, of sailors or soldiers throughout Australia approves of my motion, and agrees that it is u n just to probe into a man's past history in order to ascertain if he had latent pre-war disease, with a view to enabling the Commonwealth to escape the payment of a paltry pension. A f t e r all, how insignificant is the total pensions bill in comparison with the millions of pounds that the Commonwealth spends in other ways? In any case, the number of the pensioners is being reduced almost daily. I quote this letter from the Beechworth sub-branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of AustraliaI have been instructed to inform you that the members of my hranch unanimously support you in your protest against the medical board of review in refusing pensions to men to Auson grounds of pre-war disability after being passed as medically fit at the time of That is typical of many letters I have renot ceived, but the time at my disposal does not permit of my reading all of them. At times the medical profession is very hard to move. A notable instance is its refusal to recognize the celebrated joint manipulator, Sir Herbert Barker. The Archbishop of Canterbury arranged a large deputation of members of the House of Lords in order to get recognition of that great man's valuable services from the British Medical Association, but without avail, so the King conferred upon him the honour of knighthood. A few weeks ago I quoted one of the most glaring instances in medical history of the fallibility of doctors. Queen Victoria would not have ascended the throne of England but for the blundering of the men who, in 1821, stood highest in the medical profession in England. When Princess Charlotte, daughter of George IV., was giving birth to a child that, had it lived, would have been King of England, and was experiencing the pains incidental to the expulsion of the child from the womb, the doctors took from her a pint of blood, and, because the pain continued, another pint of blood. The mother was actually bled to death, and, of course, the child also died. In his memoirs Baron Stockmar, a medical man who had been sent by the Court of Prussia to control the Court of England, and did, in fact, exer- tive cise a great influence over Queen Victoria for many years, said he could not understand why a healthy young woman, when her body was performing a natural function, should be bled and bled. If the highest lady in the land lost her life through the ignorance of the most eminent accoucheurs, of that day, we can readily understand what might happen to ot rroXXol Professional ' etiquette sealed Baron Stockmar's lips when he could possibly have saved the lives of both mother and child. Let me refer to the case of Gunner Perry. Unfortunately, that poor man, on the second or third day of the trial, was sent to the observation ward of a lunatic asylum, where he was detained for six months, under the charge of Dr Godfrey, one of God's best men. When I asked Dr Godfrey if Gunner Perry was a malingerer, he replied, "" Do you think that if he had been I would have kept him there one day after I had made the discovery?"" Perry afterwards went to Queensland, where he was again accepted by the Defence Department as a recruiting agent. Later, when the authorities ascertained that he was the man who had been involved in the law case, he was dismissed. Subsequently, he persuaded some foolish girl to go through the form of marriage with him; but when she found in his possession a letter from his real wife, and mentioned the matter, he gave her a thrashing. Both then disappeared, probably to commit suicide; and because the Department cannot find him, and his wife cannot prove that he is not dead, her pension has been taken away. I cannot understand an action of that character.",18
36,Mr MCGRATH,CANCELLATIO N OE,Were there any children ?,20
37,Dr MALONEY,CANCELLATIO N OE,"There was one adopted child, who also has been deprived of her pension. I desire to mention another case, where a high explosive shell exploded in a sector, killing twelve, and wounding eight men. The writer saysI was one of the eight, being blown up by concussion - Owing to heavy casualties suffered by company, although suffering great pain, refused to go to Casualty Clearing Station, but was compelled to do so on 8th November, and was sent to Field Hospital. Rouen, later transferred to Southall Military Hospital, London. Operainterference, December, 1916, declared permanently incapacitated for further service. Returned hospital transport Themistocles to Adelaide, June, 1917. Abdominal operation, October, 1917. Discharged A.I.F. and M i l i tary Hospital, Keswick (S.A.), 1918. Readmitted December, 1919, for another abdominal operation. Discharged hospital, July, 1920. Admitted Caulfield Military Hospital, October, 1920, further operative interference (abdominal), December, 1920. Finally discharged, December, 1921. Several records found missing from file, this compelled one surgeon to make laparatonomy operation and to find gall bladder and portion of fiver had been removed, for which there was no record. Previous to this met prolonged opposition by Repatriation to grant full pension, its contention being, "" Injuries not due to war service,"" and pension was consistently reduced until (thanks to Victorian Repatriation Committee in general and the Deputy Commissioner in particular) a thorough investigation of my case was made, with the result the pension was restored to Â£2 2s. per week, subject to periodical survey and medical examination. I have the greatest, admiration and respect for Deputy Commissioner Major M . Ryan, wno, while keeping strictly within powers vetoed liim, has at all times extended to me the utmost courtesy and consideration. In connection with another case, that of Mr Francis Paul Martin, I shall read a certificate from &. well-kitown medical gentflemam of MelbourneTliis is tocertify that I wasconsulted by 1 Mr Francis Paul Martin (the late) who was suffering from a malignant growth which had its origin in injuries sustained at the war. I recommended liim. to an hospital for surgical treatment. He died as the result of this trouble. To my personal knowledge he was the main support of his mother. The mother raeeived the following, letter from theRepatriation Commission:With reference to your recent application for the payment of a war pension in respect to the death of. your son. above described, I have to inform you that your case has now received careful consideration, ami as from the medical evidence your son's death, bears aa connection to* his war service, the State Repatriation Board Has accordingly directed that your application be disallowed. Honourable members - will remember that, on oneoccasion, I announced in this House that, as the result of a dream, I was' able to obtain from the late Mr. Robert Harper the gift of an amountequal to - the interest on Â£1,000 for the 1 benefit,of. the mother of five sous who had gone to the war, one of whom had paid the supreme: penalty. .Because of that grft,. tlte Repa'triaribii Department reduced!'the mother's pension which she received on account of the death of her son. ThÂ® DepBJrtmentfs letter to her included the-'following paragraph:1 Rfeview of your - present circumstance* discloses that you are still hi receipt of 20s. weekly from the Harper, estate, and as your husband is now in England', the State Repataiation Boasd has directed, that pension be reduced; to 20s. per fortnight as from 21st August, 1924. In consequence of that reduction, she had to give up her home. I could multiply these casesmany times.. This is. not a party question. I appeal to the Goveru-ment to regard the decisions of the medical officers who passed' men as fit for active service asi the decisions of honourable men who did their duty to the best of their ability,, to act on the assumption that every soldier who enlisted was. a healthy man at the time, and not to allow itself to be diverted from the right path by the shrewd detective tactics of present-day surgeons ancl physicians what say that the disabilities of these soldiers were due to pre-war causes.",20
38,Mr BRENNAN,CANCELLATIO N OE,"Batman) [3.20] - In seconding the motion, T- desire fa say a few words of commendation: of itsterms axdt of the wealth of argument and. illustration which, the honourable member for Melbourne CDi: Maloney)- has submitted in its support.

I am not particular,- and I presume that the honourable' member for Melbourne is not either,, whether the motion is adopted precisely in its present form, so long as effect is given, to its spirit. The honourable member will agree with me that this is not. the first time we have found it necessary to agitate and advocate for some reform in the^-administration of the matter with which the motion deals. I build some hopes upon the fact that we now have a Minister in charge of the Department whoy in addition, possesses a good, deal of shrewd common sense, much human, sympathy, and understanding. MT. MAXWELL - And practical experience.",21
39,Mr BRENNAN,CANCELLATIO N OE,"And also-- practical experience, as the honourable member suggests. I hope that the Minister will see that effect isgiven to the intention of this motion. It is true that, in accordance with the policy of the timey it was? considered that there was urgent need for men, but I remember that, notwithstanding that, intending recruits for active service had to submit, to' very searching examinations, and many were rejected for apparently trifling causes-; I mention this because it is au argument in favour of the view that when men, were passed, and accepted for active service it was upon no merely cursory examdnationj. but as the result of deliberate audi careful examination by competent doetors, and those who were accepted unist. betaken to have been at the time int a. good physical condition, and fit for active service. If is* now seven years since the termination of the war, and to suggest at this time of day that an' applicant for a pensforf is suffering from a medical or surgical eondition due to circumstances prevailing prior to the war is to putforward a 1 claim which honourable members must agree is , or ought to be untenable. I 1 ; can quite understand that men applying; for pensions today must have their applications very closely scrutinized-' where there is evidence that the condition from In the first place, the statements from whichthey are suffering arose subsewhich quently to the war. But where their claims are rejected,, or likely to be rethe jected on the ground of pre-war disally 1 ability,.

Something, of the kind since suggested in the motion ougtif to be done,, Tfie Department should be estopped' from raiamg the contention, that the returned soldier was suffering from a disability at the time he, enlisted.

42,Mr COLEMAN,CANCELLATIO N OE,What was the oldest?,23
43,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,"The oldest man who actually found his way into the line was 72 years of age. worse time of the ""strafing,"" and when the weather was very bad, in carrying out an inspection in France, I noticed a man who was obviously older than the maximum age fixed for those in the firing line. I called him aside and said, "" You are looking ill . What is your age""? He replied, "" Do you mean my official - or my real age?"" I said that for his own Bake I should like to know his real age. He then said, "" I am 72 years of age."" I asked him why he had enlisted, and he said that he had done so because his son had enlisted. When I asked him whether he would like to return to Australia he said "" Yes."" I considered that there was fair ground for an appeal in his be-' half to General Birdwood, and the man was dispatched to England, and put on board a vessel bound for Australia a few days later.",23
44,Mr COLEMAN,CANCELLATIO N OE,Was the man's statement true?,23
45,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,"It did not require proof. One-had only to look at him to see that he was totally unfi t for service in the line, although when I met him he had done ten months' service. Whatever credit members of the profession may take for ability to discover disease, no one knows better than does the honourable member for Melbourne, whose experience is life-long, that asthma is a disease which no examination will reveal. An applicant for examination before enlistment might have suffered innumerable attacks, and be totally unfitted for service. During an attack he would be unfitted for service in civil life. It was found that 589 men were discharged on account of this disease, and 241 had had repeated attacks of asthma, ancl were returned and discharged without any service in a war zone. I will deal now with mental cases. I suppose every honourable member in this House, and particularly the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), has said at some time or other concerning some one, "" He ought not to be at liberty."" We frequently hear it said in civil life about some one with whom the speaker is not on very friendly terms, "" It would be better if he were placed under control."" - The honourable the age of member for Melbourne, in his long and varied experience, must have met many cases which needed to be so dealt with. Mental disabilities will not always be revealed by the most carefully conducted During the examination. How could we think of going back, as the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) suggested, seven years, to the beginning of the war, to ascertain the condition then of certain men who volunteered ? Of the mentally defective men who volunteered and were passed as fit, 591 saw service-whe n I say "" saw service,"" I mean that they went somewhere in the vicinity of the line, to the base at Havre or Boulogne - and 26.1 did not see service. A large number of those men had previously been under control in asylums. However much honourable members may believe in the skill of medical practitioners, I say that it is impossible, without the help of the person examined, for a medical man to say with certainty, "" You are perfectly healthy."" All that any medical practitioner can say after the most carefully conducted examination is, "" I do not find any evidence of disease."" It would not follow that the person examined was healthy. This is particularly true of persons suffering from asthma, mental diseases, and particularly rheumatism. No clinician could possibly diagnose rheumatism which was not manifested by some joint deformity, unless the patient gave him some assistance. No insurance company could last for more than a decade if it insured persons merely on the results of a medical examination. Every person who desires to take out an insurance policy must not only be examined, but must also give written answers to definite questions, which he signs in the presence of a medical practitioner. As 1I have said, a medical examination would not reveal chronic rheumatism or arthritis the presence of which was not indicated by joint deformity. Of the men who enlisted while suffering from these troubles, 4,461 saw service, but 1,257 were not in the line for a single day. They did not approach anywhere near the field of battle. It is grosslv unfair to suggest that tbese men should be granted a pension. I am quite willing to adopt the standard proposed by the honourable member for Batman He asked that applicants for a pension should be dealt with justly and thetically when they appeared before the Commissioner. That is what is Our repatriation provisions are extrawhether ordinarily liberal-mor e liberal, in fact, than those of any other country that was engaged in the war.",23
46,Dr MALONEY,CANCELLATIO N OE,Has the department any data of the insurance arrangements of other countries?,24
47,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,"J t has. vice The insurance provisions of some other countries may be better than ours, but the pension provisions are far more portant, for they determine the weekly or fortnightly pay with which the dishad. abled ex-soldier maintains his home. I would be totally unjust to oblige the country to' provide a pension for the 60,000 returned soldiers whose disabilities clearly existed before the war.",24
48,Mr MAXWELL,CANCELLATIO N OE,In many cases the must have known that the disabilities existed.,24
49,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,A great many of them had not the slightest idea that they were suffering from any dishave ability until they presented themselves for examination.,24
50,Mr MAXWELL,CANCELLATIO N OE,In cases like asthma and rheumatism?,24
51,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,"I refer to certain types of disease. liberately refrained from speaking of cases of heart and kidney trouble. are most debatable. Of the men who enlisted suffering from heart trouble, 7,000 saw service, but broke down because of their disabilities. Nearly S.OOO went overseas suffering from kidney or heart disabilities. It is quite probable that the majority of them had no idea that they Avere so afflicted until war service discovered it.",24
52,Mr MAXWELL,CANCELLATIO N OE,"Well , sureH those men are entitled to a pension?",24
53,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,Why ?,24
54,Mr MAXWELL,CANCELLATIO N OE,Thei r war service vealed their trouble.,24
55,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,But it.exremark isted before they went to the war. Mr J. FRANCIS - Probably it was ing aggravated by war service.,24
56,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,Every man whose pre-war complaint was aggravated by war service is granted a pension accordance with the degree of aggravaamination. tion.,24
57,Mr MAXWELL,CANCELLATIO N OE,Then it is really a sympaquestion of administration?,24
58,Mr LAZZAKINI,CANCELLATIO N OE,It should not be left done. with the medical practitioners to say or not there was aggravation.,24
59,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,"I ask the honourable member for Werriwa who could say so except a medical practitioner ? All honourable members should recognize that the examination of a recruit for war serwas easy if the recruit rendered reasonable assistance to the examining doctor. Men who were not anxious to go imto the war found it quite simple to magnify auy disabilities or ailments they They were extraordinarily frank. t The difficulties occurred m the case of men who were anxious to go to the Froni>. Sueh men concealed their disabilities in a masterly way, and defects which could not be seen with the eye or found with die meu stethoscope remained undetected.",24
60,Dr MALONEY,CANCELLATIO N OE,On e man with a glass eye went to the war.,24
61,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,"I can give more surprising instances than that. I the facts in the case of a man who lost three fingers in childhood, but was passed for service. He afterwards claimed that he was entitled to a pension because his disability was not discovered by the doctor who examined him prior I have deto his embarkation.",24
62,Mr COLEMAN,CANCELLATIO N OE,"I know of sufferers These from tubercular trouble who were and kidney accepted for service. eÂ»ir NEVILLE HOWSE - I have before me details of cases of that descripeither tion. A number of men who were receiving the invalid pension in consequence of tubercular disease, and had been inmates of sanatoria for periods of from three to six months were passed by medical ' practitioners. They got as far as London before their disability was discovered.",24
63,Mr MAXWELL,CANCELLATIO N OE,I would pension the remedical practitioners who examined them.,24
64,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,"That is unfair to the medical profession. I saw many cases durmy twenty years' residence 1 in a health resort of men who had suffered from tubercular disease whose disability could not be detected by the in most carefully conducted clinical exAs I pointed out a few days ago, this is evidence that tubercular trouble is curable, aud that it, is decreasing every year.",24
65,Mr MAXWELL,CANCELLATIO N OE,Then I withdraw my remark.,25
66,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,"Probably the most deliberately dishonest men, from .the standpoint, who enlisted were the epileptic cases.' I consider that many of the sufferersfrom this trouble deliberately defrauded the countiy. A considerable majority of them must have known of their trouble. Possibly their attaeks occurred during their childhood and at night time, but they must have been - medically treated at that time, and their parents must have informed them of their condition. In most of these cases the men were deliberately dishonest in tha* they did not render the medical officer who examined them the least assistance. We found 661 cases of epilepsy among men who enlisted and embarked, In every case in which even a minor war injury might have .been said to have contributed to the epilepsy the sufferers were sympathetically dealt with and were granted a pension, but no matter how sympathetically the act might be administered, it would be grossly unfair to the - country to grant pensions to 277 of those cases who saw no active service. Seeing that the medical practitioners who examined these men could not possibly have detected their condition without their help, and that the men deliberately withheld this, it would bo unfair to the public to grant them a pension. They wilfully deceived the examiners in not disclosing the details of their health, and they are not entitled to any pension except the ordinary invalid pension. It has to be remembered tnat there are two parties to be considered in the granting of pensions. On the one hand there is the ex-soldier or his dependants, and on the other there is the great body of men and women who remained at home, but who, in many cases, carried out duties equally as arduous as those performed by some of those who went abroad. The honourable member for Melbourne 'knows very well what was promised from the public platform. The first - promise was that so far as possible medical attention equal to that which would have been available had the man remained at home would be provided for him abroad. I can honestly say that I have heard very little reflection upon the medical service rendered OTSHTseas. The second promise was that every one who went to the war would be treated sympathetically in regard to every conhealth ceivable disability that could be considered to be the result of war service, and that consideration would also be given to any aggravation of pre-war disabilities. Mr 3. FRANCES - Will the Minister tell us what steps have been taken to ascertain the extent of aggravation of pre-war disabilities?",25
67,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,"In every ease in which a pre-war disability has been materially aggravated, a pension is granted. When I say ""materially aggravated,"" I think I am touching another point referred to by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan). He said that the whole question of aggravation was governed by the spirit in which the act was administered. If the act is - administered with sympathy and justice, those men will get, the benefit of any doubt that exists. Lately, in respect of numerous cases that have come up for medical opinion, the medical men have said, "" We cannot find any reasonable cause, but as there is some shadow of doubt, the patient should get the benefit of it . "" The benefit .of the doubt was in this way recently given in the case of a returned soldier who died in an asylum.. Mr F. MCDONALD - Is the future policy to be to give the benefit of thp doubt to the claimants? .",25
68,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,"I have assured the House that during the time that I have the honour to control the Repatriation Department the benefit of the doubt will be given in every case submitted to me. Tubercular cases are probably the most difficult to deal with. 1 gave as an illustration that of a man who had been for three or six months in a sanatorium.. He was able to pass a medical examination, and to go away on service. This man actually got to the front, and his application for a pension was accepted, despite the fact that he must have intentionally deceived the ex1 amining medical officer. Tubercular cases have ibeen. accepted as suffering from diseases aggravated by the war. But honourable members, in presenting cases to me, say, "" If you will look at this case from a sympathetic point of view, this man will get a pension."" I cannot possibly do so. As the Minister controlling the Repatriation Department, I have to administer the act, and I obey the instruction of the Government to administer it liberally. I assure honourable members that it is impossible to go beyond that. If honourable members wish - tliese 60,000 men to receive a pension, it is for them to amend the act, but there is no justification whatever for its amendment. It is the most liberal measure of its kind in force in - any country in the world. The men are treated with sympathy. Every care and attention is given to those who are ill in hospital, and .every effort is made to administer the act so as to carry out the promises which every Government has given since the commencement of the war. Governments of both political parties Are concerned in these promises. It will be remembered that the greatest number of the men who went away enlisted when a Labour Government was in power, and the promises of that Government, the preceding Government, and the Governments that have followed, have been carried out to the letter. Before proposing to amend the act, I should like honourable members to review the matter with great care. The honourable member for Melbourne suffers from only one disability. He has in his chest an organ called the' heart, which shoidd weigh about 11 ounces, but, judging from my experience of him, must weigh 11 lbs.",25
69,Mr MCGRATH,CANCELLATIO N OE,"Ballarat) [3.54] - I only wish that those examining the returned soldiers had the kind heart that the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) possesses, because the men would then get sympathetic treatment. The Minister referred to the 20,000 men who travelled only as far as England. Those men, when they reached England, had to live under army conditions. I - am not complaining of those conditions, because they were as good as could possibly be obtained at that time. But the great majority of the men were not used to them. The climate was entirely different from that of Australia, and I can quite imagine, without being a doctor, that a man when in England might display symptoms of tuberculosis that - would never have appeared,had he remained in Australia. Many of those men contracted meningitis i i i England and on the troopships. Many of the 40,000 men that remained in Australia were also victims of meningitis. As one honourable member stated, some of the things affecting the aggravation of diseases may not be known to medical men. I agree with what the Minister said about the excellent servioe rendered by the medical officers abroad. I do not think that the soldiers could have received better treatment than they did at their hands, and it would not be possible to find a better body of men than those who devoted their lives to the medical treatment of the members of the Australian Imperial Force. All soldiers were inoculated and vaccinated.",26
70,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,Inoculation could not affect the honourable member's constitution.,26
71,Mr MCGRATH,CANCELLATIO N OE,"We are not too sure about the after - effects of inoculation. It is quite possible that many of the men aTe today suffering from the effects of inoculation. The morning when I left for France I could not get my arm in my coat sleeve. I thought that the swelling would never go down. Inoculation affects people differently. All that we are pleading for is more sympathetic treatment. We are not asking for pensions for men who were in asylums prior to enlistment, and became mental after their return, although they must have been sane when they offered their lives for their country. Quite j , number of returned soldiers axe not treated sympathetically by the doctors. Again and again it is stated that certain persons are suffering from pre-war disabilities. Tuberculosis or asthma may be in the family, but it is possible that the disease would not have developed had the sufferer not enlisted. It may have been aggravated by climatic conditions, by living in trenches and dug-outs, by long and arduous marches, by the food consumed, and a thousand and one other things. Many of these men had they stayed at home would probably now be enjoying the best of health. They aTe receiving the most unsympathetic treatment, and the pledges made on the recruiting platforms are not being carried out. Now that seven years have elapsed since the war, I ask the Minister not to accept the statement that a man is suffering from a pre-war disability. The act should be amended in two or three directions. It was promised that it would be amended to conform with the recommendations of the royal commission on war service disabilities.",26
72,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,All those recommendations are now being given effect by regulation.,27
73,Mr MCGRATH,CANCELLATIO N OE,The act should be amended to give greater benefit to oneeyed and partially blinded soldiers.,27
74,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANCELLATIO N OE,That can done without amending the act.,27
75,Mr MCGRATH,CANCELLATIO N OE,"It should be done quickly. These men are not getting a fair deal, and an increased pension for them is long overdue. The cost will not be very great, because we are not asking for an increased pension for those who wilfully deceived the examining officers. I am speaking on behalf of those who went away in the best of health, but through some unknown cause are now suffering from infirmity, and are consequently unable to earn their living. It is for these men that the honourable member for Melbourne has moved the motion this afternoon, and I have much pleasure in supporting it . Mr D. CAMERON (Brisbane) [4.1""] The motion submitted by the honourable member for Melbourne introduces for discussion the most complicated question troubling the Repatriation Department today, namely, whether the disability from which a soldier is suffering is due to war service or to soni6 pre-war disease. Undoubtedly the health of every one who served in the field during the war was affected in some way or other, and in consequence his life has been shortened. I make that statement, even as a layman, without fear of contradiction. I have held for some time the view that the application of any man who served in any theatre of war with his unit should be accepted for consideration without the slightest hesitation or further inquiry. The Minister has pointed out that if the motion were agreed to 60,000 extra people would be entitled to pensions. do not doubt that. I have previously said that those who did serve in any actual theatre of war, whether it was Gallipoli, France. Flanders, Egypt, or Palestine, should be granted a pension regardless of any trace of pre-war disability. Honourable members will agree that the provisions of the Repatriation Act are generous. The act has been amended repeatedly at the request of the organizations of the returned soldiers themselves and of honourable members on both sides of the House. It has been amended also to conform with various decisions of the Government to make its provisions more generous. I agree with the honourable members for Ballarat and Batman that the real crux of the question is the symbe pathetic administration of the act, and I am sure that no honourable member asks for more than that. I should like to refer to one case in particular, which makes me hop'eful that there will be sympathetic administration of the act so long as the present Minister remains in office. I have endeavoured for years to get an increased pension for an unfortunate widow whose husband died in an asylum. I believe that the Minister referred to this case. It was maintained that his death was dut to a pre-war disability. He served for years in the Australian Imperial Eorce, and for a period in the trenches in France, and even if he had this pre-war disability I cannot see how it could be maintained that it was not aggravated by war service. His widowwas certainly entitled to an adequate pension, and, to my great pleasure, she has now received one retrospective to the date of the death of her husband. Everything depends on the sympathetic administration of the Repatriation Department, and I am satisfied that the present Minister will do his best for the men whose disabilities have arisen from, or have been aggravated by, war service.",27
76,Mr MCNEILL,CANCELLATIO N OE,"Wannon) [4.5] - I was pleased to hear that the Minister proposes to amend the act to enable certain men, whose applications were previously rejected, to receive a pension. I have fresh in my mind the case of a returned soldier named James Millen, and I want an assurance from the Minister that he will receive better treatment. Before enlistment he was a strong, healthy man, who, although a native of Scotland, had I lived in Australia for many years. He was doing very hard work when he was medically examined. I understand that before the soldiers embarked from Australia they were subjected to several medical examinations. If a man were examined in Ballarat, another examination took place before he embarked. Therefore, each soldier must have passed several severe examinations before he embarked from Australia. This man travelled only as far as Egypt. I have interviewed several of his colleagues who were with him on the night during which he contracted a cold while sleeping on the sands of Egypt. He was returned to Australia as unfit for further service, and has been receiving a pension that has been reduced to about Â£ 1 a week. Recently he became ill , and started for Melbourne in order to seek admission to the sanatorium, but when he reached Ballarat his condition was such that he had to enter the local hospital. The honourable membei for Ballarat (Mr . MCGRATH) and I interviewed the Deputy Repatriation Commissioner (M. ajor Ryan), who, although very sympathetic, said that the act was so rigid that there was no possibility of that man being admitted to the sanatorium. That young fellow's days are numbered. He did his best-h e offered his life-and , having been accepted by the military authorities for active service, he is entitled to exnect the country to look after him for the remainder of his days. He is incapacitated for work, and if he desires to become an inmate of the sanatorium, he surely should be eligible for admission I ask the Minister for an assurance that this and similar cases will receive his sympathetic consideration. I agree with the honourable member for Brisbane that every man who went to the front, and who was returned to Australia in impaired health, is entitled to assistance in accordance with the promise made to the soldiers when they enlisted, that their country would never allow them to want. It is our bounden duty to see that these men receive the sympathy and assistance they need, and I hope the Minister will introduce an amendment of the act to enable that to be done.",27
77,Mr R GREEN,CANCELLATIO N OE,"Richmond) [4.10] When I first saw this notice of motion on the business-paper, it recalled to my mind several discussions that have taken place regarding this subject. I interpret it to mean that any man who was accepted for active service must be presumed to have been in good health at the time of enlistment. The Minister has shown that that is not so, and those who served in the Australian Imperial Force know that many men were passed as fit who knew that they were not in sound health. I , for instance, would never have passed the medical examination had I not resorted to a subterfuge. Honourable members will recollect that in the early days of the war it was not expected to last long, and those who desired to go to the front were anxious to be accepted for military service as soon as possible. Although the great majority of the men who enlisted actually desired to see active service, we unfortunately cannot shut our eyes to certain facts, and I know of many men who joined the Expeditionary Force without any intention of narticipating in the fighting. That statement crnnot be gainsaid, although I , as a member of the Australian Imperial Force, am reluctant to make it . Some who went as far as England "" swung the lead,"" or "" worked their ! nut,"" so that they were not sent to France, or, at any rate, became merely ""base wallahs"" a long way behind the line. Amongst those who enlisted were men who came originally from the United Kingdom, and desired to revisit their relatives there after a long absence; they would not be likely to disclose to the medical officer their ailments. If the medical officer passed them, they were very pleased, because they were able to get a trip to their native land. There they disclosed their complaints to the camp medical officer in the hope that they would not be sent to France, but would either be left in. the United Kingdom or returned to Australia. Unfortunately, such instances came under my notice as a camp adjutant in England. In that camp we had a couple-of thousand men newly arrived from Australia, and immediately on arrival they obtained the usual disembarkation leave. As soon as they returned from leave some of them went on sick parade. Their object in going overseas had been attained. The enlistments in Australia totalled 416,S09, of which 331,946 embarked for service overseas. It will be seen that 84,863 men who joined the Australian Imperial Force did not leave Australia. Does the honourable member for Melbourne desire that those men shall be able to claim a pension in respect of any disability from which they now suffer? A pension is intended to be a recompense for disability caused through war service, in order to make the income of the recipient approximate the earning capacity of a man in noimal health. If it man did no* go overseasand did o&t, suffer seuy grievous1 bodily hurt through joining"" tire Australian .rinpcml Eorce, what claim has he to a pension ?- If the whole of the 416,809 men who enlisted had been demobilized immediately after attestation and medical' examination, a fair proportion of them would by now be suffering from tuberculosis, asthma, rheumatism,, and the various other ills titof afflict the civil community. Does, the honourable member for Melbourne desire that any man who merely went through the formality of medical examination and attestation shall he entitled to become a charge upon the community? That is what I understand his motion to mean.",28

Personally, I have foundthat Hhe officers of the department have treated sympathetically the cases which I have brought before them; where there was a possibility 'of a pension being granted, they have strained a point to grant it'.'

I consider that if a man of that age was prepared to fight for his country, he should be entitled to any pension which in other circumstances would' bepayable to him. From the remarks' of honourable members, if would appear that they have, generally-, been successful in their dealings with the officers of the Repatriation Department in connection with cases in which they have interested themselves. My experience has been different. Recently, when in the country, I met a returned soldier who was wounded so badly, and had undergone so many operations,, that he still had two suppurating wounds in Ms body. When I saw him he was still wearing bandages. With difficulty, he can drive a motor car, and because some employer, in a desire to help him; gave him employment as a motor driver, the department! reduced hispension very considerably. That is dealing with soldiers on a commercial basis. Tne man referred to fs not likely to recover, and he should be entitled to his full pension.

Debate resumed from 20th August (wide page 1598), on motion iby Mr THOMPthis SON'That, in - the opinion of this House, .a commission .should be appointed without undue .delay to visit Norfolk Island and inquire into the position of the island and its inhabitdisa/buse ants in 'relation to Commonwealth 'control:",29
84,Mr MARR,NORFOLK ISLAND,".Parkes-Honorar y Minisorder ter) [4.291 - In his speech of the 13th August, the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) gave an interbhe esting risumi of his visit to Norfolk Island, and brought under the notice of the House some of the complairrts of the islanders. I should like to reply briefly to some of his statements on that occasion. He said, first, that he was the only ber .of this Parliament who 'had visited Norfolk Island since it was taken over by the Commonwealth.",30
85,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,I said that I had been tically no so informed by the islanders.,30
86,Mr MARR,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The transfer of the appointed island to the Commonwealth was effected on the 1st July, 1'914 in conformity with medical, the act passed previously. In December annum, of that year ten members of the Commonislanders yet wealth Parliament visited the island, and ation has inbeen spent a considerable time among* the for the improvement islanders. A public meeting was held, at folk Island. which the islanders discussed with the members matters affecting the island. A shorthand report of the speeches was taken, and copies of the transcribed notes were supplied to the members, and also the Minister responsible for the administhere ? tration of the island, as - well as to the Administrator. All matters referred to that meeting were exhaustively dealt with time. by the department then controlling the island, and where grievances were found well founded, .matters were rectified knmediafreiy. Some of the matters brought forward by '.the islanders bad reference'to grievances which had existed during tine time that the S w iSauth Wales Government bad control of ihe island.",30
87,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Between the visit IÂ»I December, 191.4, .referred to by .the Minister, and my visit, did any members of this Parliament visit the island i Mr .MAER - I hame no knowledge of any such visit. One of the alleged (grievwas that of the .Pitcairn Islanders, who have consistently .contended that they have an indefeasible right and title to the whole of the land in the island. Neither the New South Wales nor the CommonAvealth Government has .ever admitted that claim. ""The investigations made into matter have disclosed the fact that, so far back as 1884, Xord Loftus, the then royal Governor Of New South Wales, when on a visit to Norfolk Island, endeavoured to the minds of the islanders regarding that claim. He read 'to 'Ixhem the by which the Governor for the feme being - was .empowered to grant or sell land to whomsoever he pleased. SLaoe transfer iof the island to the Commonwealth, successive governments have >douc everything possible for the betterment of the conditions of the people there. Tie petition for a royal commission whioh some time ago was .addressed to ithe Minmemister for Home and Territories, stated that, in the opinion of the petitioners, the expenses in connection with the administration - of the island were quite unwarranted, and that the island received pracbenefit from the expenditure. Tha cost to the Commonwealth of officens to deal with educational, postal, 4 savings bank, police, and other matters is approximately Â£3,500 per nothing is received from the return. The fullest considergiven to every suggestion of conditions at Nor",30
88,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,Has the Minister or any of the senior officers of the department ever visited the island to obtain to first-hand knowledge of the conditions,30
89,Mr MARR,NORFOLK ISLAND,"There is an officer of the at department on the island at the present Officers are seconded from the department to obtain experience of the work. They are sent to the island for two years for the purpose. Tho officer who is there now, while not being one of the heads of the .department, is by no means a junior officer. It is hoped, by the practice that has been adopted, to enable officers of the department to have a better knowledge of the conditions in the island, and of any disabilities from which the islanders may be suffering.",30
90,Mr NELSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,Is there an advisory council on the island?,31
91,Mr MARR,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Prio r to the receipt of the petition to which I have referred, the Government had decided that the powers of the Executive Council of the island should be enlarged to enable it to submit proposals for new ordinances or the amendment of existing ordinances. At one time the Executive Council had very little power. Its members met for a conference, but they had no power. The Executive Council of the island has today, and has had for some time past, the power to make suggestions for new ordinances or the alteration of existing ordinances.",31
92,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,It can make its suggestions only to the Administrator.,31
93,Mr MARR,NORFOLK ISLAND,"But the Administrator is bound to forward them to the Government, and I am satisfied that the Government, no matter to which party it might belong, would give the best consideration to any suggestions made. '",31
94,Mr MATHEWS,NORFOLK ISLAND,Has any request been made to stop the aggregation of land?,31
95,Mr MARR,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Not that I am aware of. For many years past the descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders have claimed, as they do now, that the island was given to them, and they have a right to do as they like with it. Neither the Government of New South Wales nor the Commonwealth Government has ever conceded that claim.",31
96,Mr MATHEWS,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Quite right, too.",31
97,Mr MARR,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The granting of extended powers to the Executive Council is merely an experiment to gauge the ability of the residents of Norfolk Island to manage their own affairs. The granting to them of full powers. of local government will be decided in the light of the experience gained. The honourable member for New England stated that the local clerk of petty sessions informed him that he is dissatisfied with the treatresidents ment he has received as a servant of the wealth. Commonwealth Government. This officer was in the office of the administration when the territory was transferred to the Commonwealth. At that time he was in receipt of a salary of Â£104 per annum, ancl since the territory has been under the control of the Commonwealth his salary has been increased to Â£370 per annum, so that it cannot be said that he has been altogether forgotten.",31
98,Mr NELSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,Was he a cadet when he received only Â£104?,31
99,Mr MARR,NORFOLK ISLAND,"I take it that he was a junior officer when he received that salary, but he is now in receipt of a salary of Â£370 from the Commonwealth Government. It will not be contended that that is a very large salary, but honourable members must be aware that the cost of livingis very much lower in Norfolk Island than it is in Australia. The honourable member for New England referred to a communication he received from a member of the progress association of the island to the effect that it was rumoured that Mr Wilson, the new clerk being sent there, is there for the purpose of ""gathering information,"" and asking whether it would be safe to confide in him the business of the association. Mr. Wilson is the man to whom I have just referred as the officer who has been seconded from, the Home aud Territories Department. He will remain on the island for two years. He has been sent there, not to "" gather information,"" but to fill a position rendered vacant by the retirement of an officer. When his two years are up another will be appointed from the department to take his place. The honourable member asked why old age pensions could not be paid on the island. According to the act, these pensions can only be paid in the Commonwealth. If an old-age pensioner leaves the Commonwealth his pension automatically ceases. The Government and the pension authorities are taking into consideration a proposal that if old-age pensioners care to take up their residence on Norfolk Island their pensions will be continued to them. Mr E. RILEY - Are the islanders not entitled to a pension under the act?",31
100,Mr MARR,NORFOLK ISLAND,"No . Mr E. RILEY - They ought to be, as of a territory of the Common",31
101,Mr MARR,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The honourable member for New England has stated as one of the chief grievances of the islanders the absence of a news service. The Pacific Gable Board at one time supplied the islanders with a news service, but owing to a different roufceing of messages the at Norfolk Island was decreased, and the Pacific Cable Board said that it could not supply the news scsrvice any longer unless the islanders contributed a certain amount towards the cost. The islanders would not consider any payment towards the cost, and the Government took the matter into consideration and supplies the islanders Will a weekly news service through the publicity branch of the Prime Minister's Department. MT. THOMPSON - Has that been supplied lately?",32
102,Mr MARR,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Yes , quite recently. The Government has also purchased a wireless receiving set which it is proposed to install on the island, and the islanders will then be able to obtain news daily from broadcasting stations in Sydney. Honourable members generally will admit that the various Governments have had a delicate task in the administration of Norfolk Island, and I cun only repeat that the Commonwealth Government as at present constituted, will see that the islanders get everything to which they any are entitled. There are some things which we cannot see our way to grant. If a royal commission were appointed. as the honourable member .for New Engisland land suggests, it could obtain no more information than we have at the present time. I remember that on one occathe sion a deputation waited upon one of the Commonwealth Ministers, and after he had listened to the speakers the deputation he said, "" Is there thing further that you wish to discuss with me before I go away?"" The reply safe was, "" No, but if you give us until o'clock tomorrow Ave shall try to think something out."" If we send a royal commission to 'the island it will only disturb the residents, and they will bringing forward all manner of disatapeism bilities. They are very peaceful at the present time, nothwithstanding the allecast gations which the honourable member has made.",32
103,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Would it not be the work of a royal commission to find out what, the islanders want.",32
104,Mr MARR,NORFOLK ISLAND,"I will say thai, if it is at all possible, it is the duty of members of this Parliament to visit the island, as staff the honourable member for New England has done, in order to obtain first-hand information concerning the conditions there. I might suggest to honourable members opposite that a good time for them to visit the island would be during the next elections. The honourable member for New England, having brought under our notice some alleged disabilities of the Norfolk Islanders, has done his duty to them and to the House. He has given us the benefit of the experience he gained on his trip, and honourable members listened to his remarks with interest. I am sorry that the Government cannot see its way to grant the commission for which he asks, and I hope that, having ventilated the grievances of the islanders, he will be satisfied with the reply of the Home and Territories Department.",32
105,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"New England) [4.45] - I desire to say a few words in reply to the Honorary Minister (Mr. Marr). I reiterate the statement that my object in bringing this matter forward was to comply with a. definite request made to me, at a public meeting, by the people of Norfolk Island. I do not take credit for going down there, as my visit Avas purely in the nature of a holiday. When I said I was the only member of this Parliament who had visited the since the Commonwealth took it over I spoke from information given to me by the islanders. It appears, from what Minister has said, that the island was taken over by the Commonwealth on the 1st July, 1914, and, almost imof mediately afterwards, a part}' of Federal anymembers A'isited the place. The two . events veere almost simultaneous, and it is to say that during a period of eleven years no Federal member visited that 9 isolated spot. I very much regret that the Minister has submitted no legitimate reasons for turning down the request for an inquiry by a royal commission. It is be merely another instance of the red which afflicts the Home and Territories Department. I have no desire to aspersions upon the present head of that department. He is a very capable Minister, but he has been so long in office that he is utterly steeped is the traditions of red tapeism. The very fact that the Government turned down the request of the Administrator for a wireless receiving sel!, with which to supply items of news to the islanders, and said that the matter must stand over until next year's Estimates, when the expense would be a mere bagatelle, proves that the Minister does not take a great deal of interest in the island., It should have been a very simple matter to accede to so reasonable a request by the Administrator. When the Government, without any valid reason, turns down the request of the people of Norfolk Island,, as conveyed through me, there is very little inducement for Federal. members to travel far afield to gather information for the sympathetic consideration of this House. To accede to my request would not involve the Commonwealth in any great expenditure. I am satisfied that there are members on both aides of this House who would be glad to visit the island for health reasons, as well as from a desire to obtain information about its conditions. The reply of the Government to the request that has been made: is to say to the islanders, "" We cannot be bothered with you. There is nothing wrong in the island."" The islanders believe that many thingsare wrong there; and the refusal of the Government to accede to their request for a commission of inquiry is an affront, not only to: the people of the island, but also to the intelligence of members of this House. Persons who have never been to the island, and know nothing about it, tell those who have been there that they do not know what they are talking about. They say, "" These people have asked you to secure the appointment of a commission to inquire into their grievancesbut we know that the best we can do them is to leave them The Minister said that if the commission is appointed the people will probably find a lot of grievances. The doctrine of ""Let things' slide,"" surely will not appeal to honourable members. The petition that was presented to Parliament may not contain such serious complaints as we are accustomed to have submitted by 1 petition, but there can be no doubt that the people regard their circumstances with grave disfavour. Their complaint about the liquor traffic would, alone, justify the appointment of a commission. The 760 people on this island are of mixed racial origin. They are cooped up in 13 Mr Thompson. square miles of country, and are practically isolated. As the liquor traffic there is under government control, their complaints should certainly be investigated. If such allegations were made from any other territory of the Commonwealth no time would be lost in looking into them. Liquor is imported to Norfolk Island and held in bond by the Government, but apparently there is not a sufficient measure of control and abuses are occurring. The ravages of whisky, gin and other liquor in such a community might seriously hinder the physical and moral development of the people. The Minister referred to the Executive Council. The circumstances in that connection are quite unsatisfactory. The council is a kind of plaything, given to the people to keep them quiet. The administrator is practically a dictator. Included in his duties are those of magistrate and judge. Although he has had no judicial training, he haa to interpret the law, and the islanders are very dissatisfied with some of his decisions. That is inevitable in all cases, in which a layman without the requisite training, is obliged to determine complicated points of law.",32
106,Mr NELSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,Hav e the people any appeal from his decisions ?,33
107,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"They have the right, under their ordinances, to appeal to the Governor General, but the conditions governing the appeal are not satisfactory. When I was on the island a man who had been mulcted in Â£80 damages by the Administrator asked me what course he should take to appeal against the decision. I understand that the casewas determined on affidavits furnished for from Australia. I told the man that he alone."" had the right to appeal to the Governor General. He immediately lodged his appeal in the proper way, but did not receive even an acknowledgment of its receipt* For nine months he was engaged in the ridiculous and time-wasting business of writing or cabling to the Minister about the matter. I believe that just recently he was notified that as the verdict against him was for an amount less than XI00 he has no right of appeal. The council consists of six persons nominated by the Administrator and six elected by the people. Naturally the Administrator takes care to nominate only those persons who will support his views. I do not blame him for doing so. The Minister stated tlrat the council has all the powers 1 of a shire council, but, on the information that I have, I must disagree with him. Mr MARR . - It has the same powers the advisory boards in the mandated territories.",33
108,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"So far as I can see its only power is to placard the island with notifications to the male population of the labour conditions. The only money on the island is brought to it by tourists, or spent by the administration. Every man between the ages of 21 and 56 is liable to' give fifteen days to the administration every year for road work. It is quite apparent, however, that the labour conditions are not taken seriously. Such conscription of labour is always hateful to a spirited community. The condition of the roads indicates quite clearly that very little work is done. If the Minister considers that the council has any real power, he must have a queer understanding of what power is. Quite recently, in consequence of the dissatisfaction expressed by the people, an ordinance has been issued which confers upon the council f h e . r i g h t to make suggestions. But all such suggestions must first be submitted to the administrator in order that he may make his comments upon them before forwarding them to the Government. It can be easily understood in those circumstances that the Government is. not likely to be influenced very greatly by any suggestion which is not favourably considered by the administrator. There are quite a number of matters that a royal commission could give attention to. Among them is the population problem. The majority of the 760 people on the island are descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty. They represent about twelve families which are continually intermarrying. There is no outlet for the energy of the young people on the island. The land question shoufd also be investigated. The islanders are under the impression that the island was given to them by Queen Victoria, and that it is theirs in perpetuity. The Minister has said that this is a delusion. In that, case the sooner a royal commission investigates the position the better. The trade of the island also merits attention. We have Jbeen told that the Government is doing everything possible for these people, but the available figures do not support the statement. Figures in the last annual report of the administrator show that whereas in 1919-20 the imports were valued at Â£16,932, and the exports at Â£13,727 , the as imports for 1923-4 were valued at Â£22,000, and the exports at only Â£3,170. A reduction of nearly Â£10,000 in three years in the exports from thei island is serious, and does not bear out the Minister's statement. I was glad to hear that the Government is taking steps to provide the islanders w it l t a news service. At present they take) no interest in any affairs but their own - It is high time that the position and powers of the administrator werej - nwwe clearly defined. His work would be much easier if he had a proper charter of power. Under existing circumstances he may be a benefactor or a tyrant. I wish it to be understood that I am not making any accusations against him> I ' am merely pointing out the defects of the position. The pewplte have grievances which should be remedied. I consider that the tourist traffic will become very important to Norfolk Island in the futurei f a reasonable steamship service is provided. The prevailing service is shocking. ThÂ© Burns-Philp Line sends one boat there in every five weeks. I understand that 1 hundreds of people inquire every year whether they can .take at holiday trip to Norfolk Island, but they are unable to ! do so because steamers are not available. The Burns-Philp Company is prepared to provide an adequate shipping service if it is granted some encouragement by the Commonwealth Government. The Government has said that it is opposed to the appointment of a royal commission, but I ask honourable members not to allow that to dissuade them from voting for the morion. 1 realise that it is impracticable for a commission to visit the island immediately, but I have no doubt that if the motion is carried a commission could visit, it after the elections, and make an investigation along the lines I have suggested. If the existing problems there are neglected for another ten 1 years they will become practically in soluble. I trust, therefore, that the motion will be carried.

The files on the table show that on the 15th August, 1914, an announcement was made by Mr Selby Paxton, the chairman of the associated banks, that the Treasury had agreed to advance three Â£ 1 notes for every Â£ 1 in gold that the banks paid into the Treasury. The memorandum of agreement was signed and submitted by the Treasurer to the associated banks on the 18th August, 1914. On the 25th August, 1914, a resolution was agreed to at a conference between the Commonstatement wealth Minister and the Premiers of the States. On the 12th September, 1914, justify in any way the the chairman of the associated banks of the Treasurer communicated with the Treasurer, stating that the banks were not agreeable to arrangements respecting the non-delivery of gold. They wanted the right to three notes for every sovereign, and the same time have the right to draw the 14th August, 1914. gold for exchange. The Cook vernment then went out of office. the 17th September, Mr Andrew Fisher became Treasurer and Prime Minister. to implicate Mr Fisher On the next day Mr Allen suggested as that transaction was that Mr Fisher should tell the banks I that an advance in Australian notes had already been made to one of the banks in pursuance of the arrangement made between the Commonwealth Government and the banks. Emphasis was laid on the fact that the arrangement had alments ready been made between the Commoncerning wealth Government and the banks. files show exactly the position in 1914, when a dispute took place between myself and the Labour party generally on the subject of the agreement. Mr . asserted, and I had to accept, ment, that tliere was nothing ih the files to indicate that he or the Labour party had anything to do with that arrangement before he took office. On the 21st September Mr Fisher accepted the gestion made by Mr Allen that a new arrangement should be entered into, the banks were prevented by law from drawing gold from the Treasury. U p to that point there was nothing in the files to show that Mr Fisher had any knowwould ledge of the previous arrangement., I quite agree with the Treasurer that there are in Hansard statements by Mr Fisher in cross-table talk between himself and Sir Joseph Cook, indicating, apparently, that some arrangement had been made. as follows:Mr Fisher at that period denied that any such construction could be placed upon said his remarks. He denied any knowledge of the arrangement whatsoever. I was under the impression, from the statements made by the Treasurer when speaking the Bank Bill , that certain documents that abundantly clear. must have been inserted in the files since the dispute that took place in 1914 tween myself ancl Mr Fisher. I see thing of that kind on the files, and, therea fore, the statement that I made concernholding ing Mr Collins was unjustified. I can only assume that the Treasurer on the basis of outside information. I can see in the files nothing to statement that the Labour party or Mr Fisher was a party the to the original arrangement. According to my interpretation, the arrangement draw was made between the Commonwealth at Government and the associated banks on According to Go the facts as they were presented to me, On and on which I took up my position at that time, there was nothing as far concerned. assumed, if the file did contain anything to justify the statement of the Treasurer, that the Government was holding back something from me, and that T was justified in my accusation against Mr Collins. I now find that the docudo not justify my statement conMr Collins, who is vindicated in The the position which he took up, that Mr . Fisher was not in any way implicated in the transaction. I accept the documents as being reliable, and I withdraw Fisher the statements that I made concerning his statethe Under-Treasurer.",35
111,Mr CHARLTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Hunter ) [ 5 . 2 2 ] - I desire to make a personal explanation following on thS statements made by the sughonorable member for Bourke (Mr . Anstey). Honourable members will reancl call that when this matter was being discussed in the House I stated that I believed both Mr Anstey and Mr Collins. Last night I said that my words be few in regard to the matter that had been raised by Mr Anstey, and added that I was satisfied from the statement made by the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), that what he had stated was correct. This morning's Argus reports me The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that Dr Page's statement confirmed what Mr Anstey had said about Mr Collins. I did not mention Mr Collins's name I would be the very last person to reflect on upon that gentleman. I think I made Personally to be misreported and misrepresented is not bea matter of concern, because I am acnocustomed to such treatment. But when reflection is made upon a - gentleman an important public position, I feel it incumbent on me to endeavour to made his right the injustice.",36
112,Dr EARLE PAGE,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Cowper-Trea surer) ,[5.24] - I am gratified by the explanation vof the .honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey), who has withdrawn a reflection which he cast upon a responsible and valued officer who has rendered .great 'service to the Commonwealth. I felt sure that, when he last spoke on this .subject, the honourable member was ignorant of the facts. For that reason I - was pleased to be able to place the files - on the table so that he could ascertain the true position. In regard to my own statement, honourable members will recall that, when I spoke on the Bank Bill last year, I made no reflection upon previous administrations. Anstey, by interjection, asked me when the agreement with the associated hanks was made, and I said I thought it was in 1915. Subsequently,, having had an opportunity to consult the files, I amended that statement,, and said that it was made .on the Sth November, 1914, and was signed by Mr Eisher. I think that the honourable member for iBmu&e will bear me out in this. The Mansard report of that year also shows .conclusively that on the three occasions when the isubject was brought up in the House both Mr., (now Sir Joseph) Cook and Mr. fisher indicated that it had been discussed at the conference between representatives of the Government and all parties concerned. The final amended arrangement was made subsequently by Mr Fisher as stated. The recital of the history of the inflation of the note issue in my speech on the Commonwealth Bank Bill last year shows clearly that I made no specific reference to earlier administrareferring tions. I .simply mentioned in its order this three to one arrangement, which I said was the most questionable of all the financial negotiations arising out yf war conditions. The point I made last Thursday was that the agreement was in a different category, from the point of view of the public interest, from that made by the bank with the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company Limited. I am very glad indeed that the honourable member for Bourke has so graciously exculpated the Secretary to the Treasury from suspicion of double dealing in connection with the information supplied.",37
113,Mr ANSTEY,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,- I should also like to make it clear that my examination <Â©f A e files has exculpated Mr Fisher as well as Mr Collins.,37
114,Mr SCULLIN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Yarra) p . 2 Y ] . r - HÂ» Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) is of course pleased that the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) has withdrawn any implication regarding Mr Collins, but he cannot .escape the charge that his own speech on this subject left a wrong impression on the minds of honourable members. He referred .to the 1914 agreement with .the banks as one of the most doubtf ul financial arrangements made during the whole course of the war, and when Mr asked when it was made, he said it wsas in 1915, clearly leading honourable members ito believe that it was the act of a Labour administration. Subsequently, when challenged, he withdrew the statement.",37
115,Dr EARLE PAGE,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I was not challenged by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) at the 'time. I corrected my statement after I had examined the file. Mr .SCULLIN - The honourable member for Bourke distinctly challenged the accuracy of the Treasurer's allegation that the arrangement had been made by a Labour Government. We thought the matter rested there, but when the honourable member for Eeid (Mr Coleman) subsequently directed attention to the arrangement made between the Commonwealth Bank and .the Mutual Life and Citizens' Assurance Company Limited, instead of attempting to defend that agreement the Treasurer avoided the issue by to the 1914 agreement, which, he led honourable members to infer, had been made by a Labour Government.",37
116,Dr EARLE PAGE,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I said it was confirmed by a Labour Government. MT. SCULLIN-Exactly . The Treasurer displayed a good deal of Cleverness. Instead of answering the charges made by the honourable member for Eeid, he spoke of the arrangement made, or confirmed, by ' the Fisher Government in 1914. When the honourable member for Bourke challenged the Treasurer's statement, he naturally assumed that the documents supporting the Treasurer's viewpoint were on the file, and that he had not been told the truth by Mr Collins about the 1914 arrangement. The one thing that stands out clearly from an examination of the file is that the Fisher Government was in no way responsible for that doubtful financial transaction. Mr Fisher was obliged to confirm an arrangement made by the preceding Government. It is as well that the subject has been ventilated. Suspicion has been removed from Mr . Collins, but unquestionably the Treasurer is implicated. He endeavoured to put up a smoke screen to obscure the charge made by the honourable member for Eeid by suggesting that Mr Fisher had been responsible for an arrangement which, as we learn from the file, was merely confirmed by him.",37
117,Dr EABLEPAGE,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I desire to make a personal explanation concerning the statement made by the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Scullin). I orable members care to peruse the HanThese sard report of my speech last night, they will acquit me of any intention to create a false impression concerning the finanWales cial transactions of 191.4. My statement was absolutely fair and true. At no have I suggested that the Fisher Governport. ment was responsible for that arrangements ment.",38
118,Mr MANNING,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Macquarie) [5.32] Wc all realise that, owing to the heavy burden of war taxation which the people be a physical impossibility. of Australia have to bear, it is essential that we should make the best use of our opportunities and encourage production as much as possible. Important railway proposals have occupied the attention this Parliament from time to time. One of the most important is a scheme f o 4-ft. S-^-in - gauge railway connecting Port Augusta with the New South Wales system. Unfortunately, the Governments of South Australia and Victoria have stood in the way of any unification prohave posals. I understand that negotiations are now in progress between the Comconnecting monwealth and the South Australian a Governments to carry out certain railway undertakings in that State. It is my wish to say anything that may prejudice that arrangement, but it is essential, if we are going to develop the Commonwealth as we should, to have trans-Australian railway on the 4 8-J-in. gauge. The New South Wales Government has a line connecting Broken Augusta. Hill and Menindie, and it is expected that, in the near future, this section will [93] be linked up with the extension from Condobolin to Ivanhoe. I was in formed by a responsible officer of the Railway Department in my State last week that the bridge across the Darling would be completed by the time that this additional section had beeu constructed; then Broken Hill would be able to obtain coal from Lithgow at 6s. per ton less than the present boat and rail charges via Adelaide. Inquiries were made some years ago in regard to a proposal to connect Port Augusta and Hay. A favourable report was received, but nothing was done. Since then a great deal of developmental work has been carried out along the Murray , and an arrangement has been entered into by the New South Wales and Victorian Governments to. build three lines of railways f honand several bridges across the Murray. lines are to be built to the Victorian gauge, and because of the foresignt of the last government in New South the whole of that portion of the Riverina will send its produce to Meltime bourne, which is its natural market and It is a pity that previous governi n New South Wales did not sanction the building of these railways, because the development of tnat country so that its trade would go to Sydney would Unfortunately, through interstate jealousy, the progress of that part of Australia was retarded for years. The late government of New South Wales was strong enough of to do what no previous government had the courage to do, and as a result of the r a very satisfactory arrangement made with Victoria, that portion of the Riverina will be given access to its natural market. If that arrangement had not been made the railway from Hay to Port Augusta would served portion of that area, but the whole of it will be better served by lines it with its natural market. For considerable distance the proposed line from Ha y to Port Augusta would run not parallel with the Murray River. Owing to the extensive system of locking which is being carried oub the river will be made navigable for a considerable distance. I say without hesitation that the a requirements of development and decenf t. tralization would be better metl by a railway from. Broken Hill to Port The late Nationalist Government in New South Wales was prepared at any time to build a 4-ft. 8|-in. line from Broken Hill to the border, and 1I have no .doubt that the present government in New South Wales will be equally ready to do so. The distance from the border to Port Augusta is about 200 miles, and if that line were constructed there would be a railway on the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge Kalgoorlie to Sydney. A 4-ft. 8^-in. line from Grafton to Brisbane is now in course of construction, and if the project I am advocating be carried out, we shall have a uniform gauge from Kalgoorlie to Brisbane. Such a line would bring the eastern and western States into closer contact, and its value could be further increased by connecting it with two New South Wales lines. A line of about 20 miles could be built either from Hillston or Cargellico towards Mount Hope, and another link of about 40 miles could be constructed from Ungarie to Condobolin. Although we have recently enjoyed a succession of good seasons, my mind goes back to 1919-20, when New South Wales was in the throes of a very severe drought, and fodder from South Australia had to be conveyed over congested lines. The difficulties of transport were increased by the break of gauge, and every siding between Melbourne and Albury was blocked with trucks of chaff. The srraziers' stock and the farmers' horses in New South Wales were dying because they could not get South Australian chaff quickly enough, notwithstanding that an extra siding was built at Albury, and the traffic was worked day and night. If the Broken Hill to Port Augusta connection were made, South Australian fodder could be brought to New South Wales more conveniently, and by means of the twoshort connecting lines distributed throughout the southern portion of the Mother State. The line from Condobolin to Broken Hill is being built with heavy rails to carry fast traffic and big loads, in accordance with the recommendations of the New South Wales Railways Commissioners and the Public Works Committee that any but a heavy and permanent line would be practically useless. The Broken Hill to Port Augusta connection would promote decentralization, bring a lot of traffic across the continent, and extend our people's knowledge of their country. Another line that is essential to the development of Australia is one northwards Mr Manning. from Bourke, either to connect with the western termini of existing Queensland railways, or to follow a more westerly route to Camooweal, proceeding thence to the Barkly Tablelands. Some advocates of that line have, inadvisedly, I think, suggested that it should be built in lieu of the north-south line, from Adelaide to from the Northern Territory. The two proposals should not be regarded as alternative or competitive. One line cannot serve the whole of that interior country, and a railway built from South Australia into western Queensland, and thence into the Northern Territory wo aid have only a limited usefulness. The mere suggestion that such a route is an alternative to the direct north-south line arouses antagonism to both proposals. These lines should be regarded as independent, rather than. alternative propositions. The southern States have frequently experienced a shortage of beef. But never has the whole of the country between the Murray River and the Barkly Tablelands suffered from drought at the same time. On many occasions' New South Wales graziers would have been able to save large numbers of stock by shifting them into the pastures further north. In 1914, when southern Australia was experiencing probably the worse drought in its history, a great deal of the country that would be traversed by a line from Bourke to Camooweal was waving with rich pastures. About eighteen months later the conditions were reversed, and Queensland graziers were losing stock, whilst in the south feed was abundant. I remember Sir George Fuller admitting to a deputation regarding the railway extension from Condobolin to Broken Hill that many times in the history of New South Wales the absence of a few miles of connecting railway had been responsible for losses of stock greatly exceeding in value the cost of such connexions. In the northern area that would be served by a line running from Bourke to Camooweal cattle can be bred much more cheaply than in southern Australia, but at the present time, owing to the lack of railway communication, they must be fairly matured before they can be started on the eight-months' journey into New South Wales. At the end of the journey they are absolutely hard, and full y another eight or nine months is required to restore them to k ill i ng condition. Instead of the people being able to get young beef, which, incidentally, is more profitable to the grower, these cattle are marketed in southern markets nearly two years later than they would be if railway transport were available. Only about two years ago, cattle were imported into Victoria from New Zealand, whilst simultaneously cattle in the north of Australia were practically valueless. H a d the Bourke to Camooweal railway been in existence, such an anomaly would not have been possible. I urge the Commonwealth GovcrnrnOTit to adopt a far-sighted policy, and to enter into negotiations with the States concerned for the construction of a railway northwards from Bourke towards the Barkly Tablelands. Government of New South ""Wales, was prepared to build the line from Bourke to the Queensland border. I am sure that the present Government will adopt the same attitude. Of course, it would be unreasonable to expect the Government of Queensland to bear the whole of the cost of a line through central Queensland. An honourable member interjected regarding the objections of Sydney people to the extension of Victorian lines into New South Wales. No doubt, similar objections will be urged by Brisbane to a line that will connect the New South Wales markets with the cattle areas of the north. Those who cannot see beyond their noses will declare that such a line would mean a loss of trade to Brisbane. Probably Brisbane would lose trade, but the whole State, including the capital city, would be advantaged by the greater prosperity that would arise fro m the development of the hinterland. In the past, parochial considerations have influenced too much the railway construction policy of the Australian - States, and I hope that the suggestions I have made will receive early consideration from the Commonwealth Cabinet, and that a policy will be adopted which will make for the more complete and systematic development of the country, and by increasing the prosperity of our people, make them more f it to carry their heavy burden of debt.",38
119,Mr MAKIN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Hindmarsh) [5.50] I desire to protest against the attitude of certain Commonwealth departments towards Federal awards. Those departments should set an example to other employers of labour, but, instead of doing so, they are evading their obligations to certain of their employees. Recently I have interested myself in the case of certain employees in the Postmaster-General's Department in the pole yard at Keswick, South Australia. Men are employed there as labourers, and were until recently receiving a wage even less than that which the Federal court has decided shall be the basic wage. They are deprived of the opportunity to benefit by the Commonwealth child endowment scheme.",40
120,Mr GIBSON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,Do not these men work under a State award ?,40
121,Mr MAKIN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,Yes . My complaint is that the department is withholding from The late the men the superior conditions that are provided by the Federal award.,40
122,Mr GIBSON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,Are they permanent men ?,40
123,Mr MAKIN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"They have been employed in the service for at least twelve months. Technically, they are not recognized as permanent employees. The Acting Deputy Postmaster-General in Adelaide some time since informed me that the men were working under a State award, and receiving the State basic wage. That led me to conclude that they must be receiving a higher rate than was provided for under the Federal basic wage decision. But when I inquired as to the relative values of the two awards I learned that the State award was lowpr than the Federal! These men. therefore, were not only being deprived of recreation leave and child endowment, but also were receiving a lower rate of wage than the Federal basic rate. A Commonwealth department should not evade the decisions of Federal courts. Recently the State basic rate has been revised and increased. I personally interviewed Mr Mason, the Deputy Postmaster-General in Adelaide, in whom we have every confidence, and of whom we have the kindliest thoughts. I believe that he is a most efficient officer. He, no doubt, recognized that an undesirable and difficult precedent had been established, and he endeavoured to overcome it on the best terms. He sent me the following letter:With 'reference to the personal representa-tions made by you on the 18th August, 1920, respecting the wages paid to labourers employed at the departmental pole yard, I have to advise that the labourers are paid in accordance with the State basic wage, which, on the 13th August, 1025, was increased to 14s. 3d. per day. The rate of pay approved by the Public Service Board for labourers is Â£204 per annum, puis a child endowment allowance of Â£13 per annum for each child under fourteen years. 'Ihe State basic wage is, therefore, at present a more favourable rate, except in the case of an employee who has inore than one child under the age of fourteen. it is well known that the largest are to be found in working-class The conclusion of the Deputy master-General, that to a man with one child the State basic wage is more favourable than the Eederal basic wage, plus the child endowment allowance for one child does not give satisfaction employees. They desire that the Federal Government should recognize own basic wage, and, in give them the benefit of the child endowment scheme and the leave provided for by the wealth Public Service Act. It is a mean and paltry evasion for an to say that he is not bound the provisions of Federal because these men are not as permanent employees, and technically are not members of the Commonwealth Public Service. If the Commonwealth sets an example of evasion of awards of Federal courts, its action will have a very far-reaching effect. These men feel that they are entitled to the Federal basic rate, and that, as they have been employed in the department for a period of at least twelve months, be brought under the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. One of the men is named Montgomery. has been employed by the department for some years. Earlier he was classed as a lineman or lineman's assistant. that time he was paid man's rate of wage and given tion leave. An officer of the however, thought that it was desirable to reclassify all those who were engaged in this class of work, and, although some of these men had to perform duties rightly belong only - to linemen lineman's assistant, they were fied as labourers. Montgomery one of those. He has lost his recreation leave and the other benefits of the Federal award which apply, but he is still performing the duties that merely undertook. For the last four Mr Makin. years he has had a lower status, with less pay and with worse conditions than those which should be rightly applied to him. I have exhausted every avenue in an endeavour to secure redress. I went to the Acting Deputy Postmaster-General some months ago, but he was not clothed with sufficient power to right the wrong. I then went to head-quarters, and presented the case to the Postmaster-General. From families him I received the' intimation that these homes. men were not employed under the proPost- visions of the Public Service Act, and therefore they were paid according to the State basic rate. That gave no satisfaction to me or to those whom I was representing. I was already aware of that to these circumstance. What I desired was that the Postmaster-General should prove to its me that these men were not losing any-addition, thing. Evasion of decisions of Federal courts by a Commonwealth department recreation is unjustified, and places it in an anomaCommon- lous position. Even though a man is classified as a temporary employee, if he administrator is giving the same service, he is entitled by to the same conditions as those which awards, are enjoyed by permanent employees. regarded A f t e r a person has occupied a position for twelve months continuously he should be regarded as a permanent employee.",40
124,Mr GIBSON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Surely the honourable member does not seriously contend that 1 We have about 7,000 temporary men employed in telephone construction work.",41
125,Mr MAKIN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I do not care whether there are 10,000 or 20,000 men so employed. The Government should do the they should right thing by them. That is the rule of the South Australian Government.",41
126,Mr LISTEB,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"It is not so in Victoria. He Mr MAKIN - If a State Government can place its employees on a permanent basis after twelve months' service, surely At the Commonwealth Government can take the line- similar action.

128,Mr MAKIN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Before the Government makes any further remission of taxation, either directly or indirectly, the Postmaster-General should see that the Commonwealth employees engaged in this work are justly treated. I challenge partment. the Minister to justify the action of his department in not paying the rates set out in the awards of the Federal Court.",42
129,Mr GIBSON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,The awards are observed in the case of the permanent officers.,42
130,Mr MAKIN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"If the Government recognizes the principle in the case of permanent officers, why does it depart from that principle when the men concerned are temporary employees? Payment should be made for the services rendered, no matter by whom the work is performed. It is not right that these invidious distinctions between permanent and temporary employees should be made. I can assure the Minister that I shall not rest content until these men are paid the Federal basic wage, and receive just treatment in other respects. If the Minister is not prepared to put matters right now, he will hear more from me on future occasions. I am not prepared to allow, without protest, these men to be unjustly treated. So long as I remain in this Parliament, or until their wrongs are righted, I shall continue to urge their claims. I hope, however, that the Minister will realise that they should be paid according to the work which they perform, and that they will soon receive the same treatment as that accorded to the permanent employees. To labour this question further at this stage would be unwise. I have already presented the case to the Minister personally, and I hope that he will not longer delay in doing the right thing by men who may rightly be regarded as permanent officers. I submit their claim, and trust that honourable members generally will support it.",42

It appears that, in accordance with a recent decision, one person in a street or locality is now allowed to sell stamps, while others in the same locality are denied that right. Why are such distinctions made ? Is this a new rule which has been introduced by the Director of Postal Services?  shabbiest action ever taken by the de",42

I understand that since the new arrangement came into operation all applicants for licences to sell stamps are informed the that if they are prepared to forego the commission they will be granted the privilege of selling the stamps. I know of one or two cases in which that reply has been received by applicants. One case to which I desire to refer is that of a news vendor who has been refused a licence to sell postage stamps while a competitor has been granted a licence. He objects, not to payment of commission being refused, but to a distinction being made between individuals.",42
133,Mr GIBSON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,At what time does his shop close?,42
134,Mr FENTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,What difference does that make?,42
135,Mr GIBSON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"If the other shop closes at 9 o'clock and his closes at 6 o'clock, he would not be able to meet the requirements of the public to the same extent as his competitor.",42
136,Mr FENTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"That is an argument for increasing the hours of work. If all places of business closed at 6 o'clock, there would be no reduction in the number of postage stamps sold: Can the Minister inform me whether postage stamps are still sold at railway stations?",42
137,Mr GIBSON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,I do not think so.,42
138,Mr FENTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"The obtaining of stamps at a railway station after the ordinary business premises were closed was a great convenience. I have always been under the impression that the Commonwealth Constitution provides that there shall be no distinction between States or the people within States, but the Postal Department in granting stamp licences makes distinctions between individuals.",42
139,Mr GIBSON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,The honourable member could with as much reason say that the department should not have the right to choose its employees; the vendor? of stamps are practically employees of the department.,42
140,Mr FENTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I do not agree w the Minister's statement, as the selling of postage stamps is really only a sideline with these people. In no sense can they be regarded as employees of the department.

I should like the Minister to explain the reason for the new arrangement. I now wish to refer to the controversy which took place in the expiring days of factory position. the Cook-Irvine Government, and the early days of the Fisher Government, garding financial matters. I remember well the speeches that were then made this chamber. Soon after the commencetution, ment of the war an estimate of the amount which could be obtained in Ausshould ti'alia for war purposes was made. believe that the maximum amount was then considered to be Â£20,000,000. that time it was not possible to obtain money from outside sources as readily actions. as previously. Australia could not expect the Old Country to finance her i the same liberal manner as in the past. Even if Mr Fisher did acquiesce i arrangement with the banks at that time, I could understand his action, although Hill . I should regard it as a serious error of judgment on his part. A careful study of Mansard for the early days of the war can lead to one conclusion only, namely, that Australia was. then serious financial difficulties. The financial capacity of the Australian people was under estimated. At that time the attention of all the States was concentrated on the Federal Government. In consequence of an interruption i States' borrowing arrangements, Commonwealth, notwithstanding its huge financial responsibilities, had to come their rescue. A conference consisting Commonwealth and State representatives was convened, and if a mistake was made monwealth. by the Treasurer of that day, the present Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) is not justified in criticizing actions of the Leader of the Labour party at that time, because if he i th had been in his position he would have realized that in a time of unexampled crisis some such action was necessary. The arrangement, however, was made by the Cook-Irvine Government, and was ratified by the Fisher GovernI t is only reasonable to expect, in the excepI tional circumstances which prevailed at the time, that some mistakes would be made. I think it is generally admitted by financial authorities that the Government had practically no option in the matter. There is no analogy between the two cases, because at the period to which I refer we were faced with a crisis, and at present, apart from our war debt, our finances were never in a more satisThe Government had no right to appoint the managing director reof a company with an overdraft of Â£350,000 at the Commonwealth Bank as in the chairman of the board of that instiand a person controlling a company so heavily indebted to the bank not have accepted the position.

A railway a little to the north of Mildura would pass across a great artesian basin extending over portions of n the Victoria, New South Wales, and South the Australia, and the further development and settlement of the Murray lands into the three States mentioned will lead to of increased production in that area and add to the general prosperity of the ComConditions have changed during recent years, and if some of the ardent State-righters of a few years ago the were alive today they would be astounded to find that, the Victorian railway system had been extended into the Riverina and was now carrying traffic to the Victorian ports. It is pleasing to find that interstate jealousy no longer exists in auy marked degree, and that portions of New South Wales are now served - by the Victorian railway system.",43
141,Unknown,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to S p.m.,44
142,Mr FENTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I have said that, in my opinion, the railway from Hay to Port Augusta proposed by the Commissioner and his officers is a better proposition from a revenue point of view than is the line suggested by the honourable member for Macquarie. I understand that attention is now being given to a more modest proposal, with a view to making the railway journey from Adelaide to Port Augusta more easy than it is at present. The Commonwealth is concerned in railway construction between Kyogle and South Brisbane, and if we are to embark upon still further railway construction I wish to direct particular attention to a proposed line in which I take a very great interest. In the earlier - stages of my political career, I very bitterly opposed the transference of the Federal Capital to Canberra. stances and the voting of majorities have settled that matter, and we are now going ahead with the construction of the Federal Capital at Canberra. I always said that there was oue thing connected with the establishment of the Capital at Canberra which appealed to me, and that was that we should have about 1,01)0 square miles of country which could be retained for all time as the property of the Commonwealth, and in which the leasehold system of land tenure would prevail. I suppose that with one or two exceptions the members of this Parliament are favourable to the continuance of the leasehold system in the Federal Capital Territory. That territory being a part of the people's property, I am prepared to view very ably any proposed railway construction which may enhance its value. I was one of the first to suggest in this House the construction, of a railway from Orbost to Bombala. I believe that such a line would materially assist in the development of the Federal Capital territory. I have travelled over the Victorian railways as far as Orbost, but 1I have not had the pleasure of travelling over the country between Orbost and Bombala. I am informed by those who have been over that country that a motor trip from Sydney through Bombala and the south-eastern portion of New South Wales, and thence through Gippsland to Melbourne, is one of the most delightful trips that could be made. If the Federal Government is to launch out into new proposals for railway construction such a line as I have suggested should be the next considered. Victorians know that a line extending from Orbost through the north-eastern parts of the State would be very desirable, both from a developmental and a tourist point of view. Those who know anything about the south-eastern portion of New South Wales, which such a line as I have suggested would traverse, are aware that it is a very f r u it f u l land and that a good port could be established at no great distance from the railway. I was very pleased to see in the newspapers recently a report of the deputation, of which the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr . Paterson) was one, that waited upon the Victorian Minister for Railways and pointed out the advautages of this particular line. 1 understand that a favourable reply was given to the deputation. Circum- It was mentioned that if the New South Wales, Victorian and Commonwealth Governments united to build the line there is no reason why it should not be under construction at an early date. It s construction would complete a link in what would be practically a coast line which should be of great advantage from a defence point of view. I believe it is not included in what military experts regard as a strategical railway system for Australia, but I do not know that we should accept their verdict absolutely. I think that this line would be found of great advantage from a defence point of view should trouble come to Australia. From the developmental point of view the line has strong claims upon the Federal Government and favor- the State Governments concerned. If the three Governments united each contributing a quota to the cost of construction, the completion of the line would link up the railway system from Fremantle to Adelaide and Melbourne through Gippsland, past the Federal Capital Territory, on to Sydney; thence to Brisbane, and from Brisbane northwards to beyond Cairns. I believe that the line I have suggested would pay handsomely at no distant, date, and I am prepared to use all the influence I can to have it constructed.",44
143,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Eden Monaro) [8.10] - I was very pleased to listen to the statement of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) as to the advantages likely to accrue from the construction of the railway to which he has referred. The honourable member, however, did not mention one important factor in support of the proposal, and that is the importance of the district which would be traversed by the line as a source of power for the generation of electricity. The power which might be derived from the Snowy River would be sufficient for the generation of a supply of electricity which could be carried south through Gippsland to Melbourne and north to Sydney. The ice fields of the district through which passes renders the water supply of the Snowy River inexhaustible, and it is difficult even to imagine the volume of electric power which might be derived from the district through which the proposed line would be taken. It is not unexplored country. Its resources are known to scientists and capitalists. The opening up of the avenues of wealth presented by the district would provide means for the employment of many people. It might be suggested that as the proposed line would go through my electorate its construction naturally appeals to me, but there must be a means of communication provided between Canberra and Melbourne, and, as I have said, the proposed line would give access to a reservoir of power which might be utilized to convert what are now practically empty spaces into hives of industry. I trust that the picture drawn by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton) will be actually realized, and that big industries will develop at Canberra. The question will undoubtedly arise as to whether we should not make a good port on the spaboard, which is some 50 miles from the Federal Capital. Many of our most sagacious people have already purchased home sites at Canberra, and I have no doubt that some t me in the future we shall"" also have to give serious consideration to whether or not the present leasehold titles to the land there shall not be converted into freehold titles. There are murmurings even now against the leasehold system. Personally, I favour it , but it is well known that the Englishman, by reason of the fact that he holds his land under a freehold title, regards his home as his castle. Such great, progress is being made at Canberra that those honourable members who have not been - there for some time will be astonished the next time they visit it . If a big electrical power scheme can be developed for Canberra, it will make a tremsndo is difference to the : city. I hope that we shall overcome the tendency to look at Canberra n erely from the point of view of Melbourne and Sydney and the sea coast. We should consider it as an Australian project. I trust . that in time it will become the great city that it ought to be.",45
144,Mr MAHONY,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Dalley) [8.20] - I wish to direct the attention of the Government to two or three matters. The first concerns the Taxation Department. it There is a lack of uniformitv in applying the provisions of the Entertainments Tax Act to trade union social gatherings. As a rule, every trade union holds a social gathering once a year, not for the purpose of making profits, but to gather the members together for social intercourse. Frequently these functions result in a financial loss. Generally speaking, they are exempt from the entertainments tax, but the department recently made a notable exception in the case of the Theatrical and Amusement Employees Association. I do not know why the annual outing of that union should be taxed ; perhaps the Treasurer will be able to tell me. Prior to my illness I had taken up this matter with the department with a view to securing a refund of the amount paid by the association. While I was indisposed, Senator J. Grant kindly continued the negotiations.* So far, however, we have obtained no satisfaction. I feel sure that when the Entertainments Tax Act was passed by Parliament there was no intention to tax this class of gathering. It. is not an entertainment in the ordinary sense of the word, and certainly it is not organized to make a profit. I trust that the Treasurer will inquire into the matter, ascertain the reasons for the imposition of the tax on ; this union when other unions are exempt, and instruct the department to refund the amount charged. A couple of months ago I introduced to the Minister for Trade and Customs  Writers and Artists Association. I am only doing justice to those who follow these professions in Australia when I say that they compare favourably with the writers and artists of any other part the world. Some of our black and white artists have been responsible for work that has not been excelled anywhere. have been right in the foref ont of their profession. The same may be said of our sideration. prose writers and poets, borh men and women. The deputation *hat I introI duced requested the Minister to impose duty on imported children's toy picturemembers books, such as are sold in large numbers at Christmas time. They contended that only the imposition of a substantial duty would make it possible for - Australian writers and artists to compete successby full y with the continental producers this class of book. At present there no duty whatever. In passing, say that I think it is high time that dispensed with the English and German idea of a Father Christmas muffled up in furs and driving reindeers amid f a l ing snow. Such a representation ot planation. Christmas time is absolutely foreign Australian conditions. We have bright sunshine, and we should provide suitable lines ? Christmas books that will convey Australian sentiments to our children. should we not use the wattle, the waratah, and flannel flower to decorate our mas books instead of the holly and Old World flowers?",45
145,Mr DUNCAN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,HUGHES - Is the wattle out at Christmas time?,46
146,Mr MAHONY,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"That interjection seems pertinent, but it is really i pertinent. I was not suggesting that should use bunches of wattle for decoranow tion purposes at Christmas time, but that drawings and paintings of wattle other Australian flowers should appear in the children's picture books which sold in large numbers at Christmas time; When the deputation waited upon the Minister, he said "" Tell me how many of these books are imported into tralia each year."" It is impossible for us to obtain that information, for Customs Department makes no distincbreach of privilege ? tion between various classes of literature. Inquiries were made, however, and it was ascertained that books to the value Â£1,000,000 are imported annually. I we assume that 5 per cent, of the imwant portations are children's toy picture books, the importations are valued at reply to it . about Â£50,000 a year. The writers and artists are not asking that a prohibitive duty shall be placed upon all literature, of for they consider that the very best of literature and art should be available to our people duty free. Their request is conThey fined to children's toy books, and I hope the Minister will give it favourable conr I wish now to refer to another matter. am surprised that attention ""has not a already been drawn to it by honourable who support the Government. An article appeared in the last issue of Smith's Weekly newspaper that calls for some explanation. I wish it to be understood that I am not fathering the article any means. Smith's Weekly, as is of well known, circulates throughout Ausis tralia. It certainly casts very serious remay 1 flections upon certain people in our comwe munity, some of them holding important public positions and others in business in a substantial way.

155,Mr MANN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"OB a point of order, I understand that the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) is really speaking on a matter of privilege. I think that the procedure to be observed in respect of any question arising out of a newspaper article, and debated as a matter of privilege, is specially dealt with under the Standing Orders. I ask you, sir, whether the honourable member for Dalley is presenting this matter in conformity with the Standing Orders.",46
156,Mr SPEAKER,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND," I am scarcely able at this stage to determine the attitude of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony). Standing Order 285 provides that if an honourable member complains of a statement in a newspaper as a breach of privilege he must be prepared to produce a copy of the newspaper itself, to name its printer and publisher, and to conclude with a motion. If this question is raised as a matter of privilege, a point which I shall determine as the able member proceeds, that procedure must be adopted. stage, however, the honourable member's remarks are not sufficiently developed to permit me to determine what course should be taken. I ought to say, further, that while the Chair decides the considerations that ought to be dealt with by the House as a matter of privilege, the House itself determines whether or not a breach of privilege has been committe.d. I shall await further developments from the honourable member for Dalley.",47
157,Mr MAHONY,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I certainly did not raise this question as a matter of privilege. I raised it as a matter of public interest under cover of this grievance motion. The article points out that certain large importing interests in Melbourne and Sydney engaged in the importation of pianos and player-pianos from Germany especially are endeavouring to use pressure to prevent any increase of the duty upon those instruments. A letter appearing in this journal points out that the best way to prevent an increased duty being placed upon imported pianos is to fight for a reduction of the existing duty. It is remarkable that in the new tariff schedule there is no increase in the duties on pianos or player-pianos, even though the Australian industry is being seriously affected by the competition of German cheap-labour products.",47
158,Mr SPEAKER,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"The honourable member will, of course, avoid discussing the tariff.",47
159,Mr MAHONY,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I shall not further pursue that subject. The following letter appears in the article:Melbourne, 14th August, 1925.  In connection with the opposition to the increase in duties on pianos and player-pianos, it is suggested that a letter be sent to each member of the Country party in the House, and also to all Nationalists, except those who are known to be rabid Protectionists. . Mr Hagelthorn suggests that such a letter, if sent, should go out under the auspices of his union (the Town and Country Union). This, of course, would be for the interested parties to deride, hut, so far as Melbourne is concerned, Allan, Reed (Aeolian), Brash, and ourselves all agree that it would be best for this letter to go through the Town and Country Union. Hagelthorn and Mann, M.H.R., go to Sydney on Sunday, and are stopping at Usher's. I am enclosing to you a letter of introduction to Hagelthorn, as being better than a letter honorof introduction from Hagelthorn to yourself. The object of their visit to Sydney is to At this address the Sydne}' Branch of the Town and Country Union, or whatever name it goes under. They have been invited over specially for the purpose. Now the best suggestion that Hagelthorn has made is that, instead of simply trying to stop the increase of duty, we should go baldheaded for a reduction. Hagelthorn as an old campaigner maintains that by going for something more than you are prepared to accept you are more likely to achieve the main object of this present agitation. I feel certain that in this you will agree with him. If there is to be any tight put up on the floor of the House, or beforehand at any meeting of the Country party or Nationalist party, there is far more prospect of stopping the increase. We are posting herewith the suggested letter which Mr MCDougall and I have compiled From the various notes at our command, including your letter to the Tariff Board, (Jeorge Allan's remarks, Mr Reed's comments, and also Brash's. All these, with the exception of your remarks to the Tariif Board, we attach herewith, so you will have before you in extenso what they have said. Mr Hagelthorn is anxious to have from you copy of the letter which we propose to issue, and also the main points, no^ only for no increase of duty, but also for a reduction in same, so that he may make use of these in his opening address to the Sydney union. The next point is that it is important that we should receive back in Melbourne from you, on Monday, the draft of the letter which you yourself think should go out from the Town and Country Union's office. For this reason we intend telegraphing you to be sure and get our mail before leaving the city on Saturday. To do this you must post on Sunday night. We have indicated to Mr Hagelthorn that, in proportion to the results obtained, the trade will make a contribution to the funds of the Town and Country Union. This will only be a few .pounds-possibl y Â£50 or Â£100. In the event of any Nationalist's support quiring financial pressure, what is the attitude * in Sydney towards same? Mac has done, and is doing, most of the work here-interviewin g people and talking with Seed, Allan, Brash, &c. If anything satisfactory result!), you will have to give Mac the credit so far as all efforts in Melbourne are concerned. The others are leaving everything to him. It is now up to you and Sydney to do pushing as well. This journal, in addition to publishing a facsimile of certain of the paragraphs of typewritten communications, has given a description of the gentlemen concerned. The article continues Smith's Weekly tell you. Maximilian Peter Pollak, since known as Preston-Pollak, or as Preston, was bora in Pru^ui. from 4.5 to 50 years ago. Prague is now in the Czecho-Slovak Republic, but during the war Pollak, or Preston, ranked as an Austrian subject. At present he is in the importing firm of Norman U Burnell and Company Limited, 350 Kent-street, Sydney. This is the class of person that the Prime Minister was condemning the other night at Dandenong. The paragraph furthe r saysBefore coming to Australia, Pollak (or Preston) was a trader in Hamburg, London, Paris, and Brussels; he came to Australia in 11)04., and first managed J. L. Lennard's ness in Brisbane. He wa3 subsequently in Sydney and Adelaide. When the war began, Preston-Pollak was in Adelaide as manager of the business of John Beckman (senior partner in the firm of Weber and Company, Hamburg, Germany). Immediately before the outbreak of war, Preston-Pollak assigned the business to Samuel Fiddian, his clerk, and left himself without legal assets; and, in September. 1014, the business appeared as a companv entitled Preston Limited, Indentors and Importers. Now we know all about this "" dear Mr . Preston,"" who was to do the pushing at the Sydney end of the business.",47

These things should not be passed over lightly. Either they are true or untrue. If true, we should know all about them,. If persons of this class are in Australia, I agree with the Prime a bit of Minister that they should be dealt with. The party to which I belong will give the Prime Minister every assistance to deal with these enemies of Australia and of Great Britain. There will be no doubt about our stand towards people who showed their enmity to Australia and Great Britain during the war and who are still displaying enmity in a more insidious way. Where is the money coming from ? More German gold ? Did we not hear during the war something about the clink of German gold in the palm of the hand, and of the whispering of German tongues in the ear] What about the clink of German gold now? Will the Prime Minister apply the deportation law to these gentlemen ? Surely there is ample warrant to bring these people before the board.",48
162,Mr CHARLTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,But they are not trades union leaders.,48
163,Mr MAHONY,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"No ; but they are busi- the leaders of German importers, who are doing all they can to smash the piano and piano-player industry in Australia. By their actions they are throwing hundreds of Australian workmen out of employment. We ought to have an explanation from the Minister for Trade and Customs as to why this languishing industry is not receiving adequate protection. The article"" which I have just quoted is very illuminating in view of the fact that the Tariff schedule, which was laid upon the table of the House last week, offers no protection for this important Australian industry. The statements certainly call for explanation. I hope that certain gentlemen who are interested may be able to clear up statements about their attitude. "" H o p e , "" we are told, ""springs eternal in the human breast."" I hope that the Prime Minister will take advantage of his position and put the deportation law into force against those pnpmies of Australia who are leading the German industrial onslaught against Australian industries.",48

It might be urged that since my name has not been mentioned I have no occasion to speak on this matter. That, I suggest, is rather characteristic of an attack of this kind. "" Of course, every honourable member knows quite well that my name has been associated with it . The newspaper-if it may be called such-fro m which the honourable member quoted, not only published the article, but also took the trouble to send a circular letter to most, if not all, honourable members.",49
165,Mr MAKIN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I have not received one. Mr MANN "" - I have seen a number of copies. One has heen handed to me by a fellow-member. I very much question the motive which led the honourable member for Dalley to bring this matter before the House. He has said, or rather has hinted, that his object was to ask for an inquiry, and although he was skilful enough not to say so, he suggested that the article was a reflection upon certain members of this House. parently, then, it was the honour of this House that he was concerned about. If not, he was not concerned about anything. I submit, however, that if the honourable member so earnestly desired to protect the honour of this House, his method of procedure was altogether wrong, and that the manner in which he handled it was an abuse of the privileges of this House. Mr BmsNNAN - That is a reflection on the Chair.",49
166,Mr MANN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I rose to a point of order, and directed attention to the fact that cases of this kind are specially provided for in our Standing Orders. H a d the honourable member been really anxious to defend the honour of members of this House, his course was clear. He was not prepared to take that course. He knows as well as I do, that if he wished to defend the honour of members, it was his duty to make the complaint in a regular manner, and, according to our Standing Orders, to move a motion of contempt. Has he done so? Not at all. It is clear, then, that after all he was not concerned about the honour of members of this House or the protection of its privileges. O He simply set out to cast ridicule and obloquy upon a political movement with which he is not in agreement. The mere fact that he associated my name with it is beside the question. He is afraid of this political movement.",49
167,Mr MAHONY,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,Do not be foolish!,49
168,Mr MANN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"The whole trouble is that the honourable member senses a growing feeling amongst the people of Australia against certain provisions of our laws in their relation to our industrial and economic life. Citizens who objectto them are openly, legitimately, and honourably protesting against those conditions, and have every right, if they care to exercise it , to combine in a perfectly constitutional manner to effect a change. In doing this, they are not acting dishonorably. On the contrary, their action is more honourable than are some movements to change the conditions of political l if e in this country to which the honourable member for Dalley has given his support. If members of the public, and if public men, may not openly combine to criticize Commonwealth laws, with the object of Ap- effecting alterations in a constitutional manner, where is our liberty, and where are our constitutional privileges? My purpose is to acquaint those who are sufficiently interested to read the honourable member's remarks, with the real motive behind his attack this evening. Clearly he believes that the citadel of high protection, in which stand entrenched those who for so many years have taken an unholy toll from the people of this country, is being attacked.",49
169,Mr SPEAKER,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND, The honourable member must not proceed on those lines. He must not discuss the fiscal issue.,49
170,Mr MANN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,May not I speak of the fiscal issue as the motive underlying the speech delivered by the honourable member for Dalley?,49
171,Mr SPEAKER,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,That is permissible within certain limits.,49
172,Mr MANN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I shall endeavour to keep within those limits as strictly as did the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony). It will be difficult, and if I transgress I shall immediately bow to any restriction which you, Mr . Speaker, may place upon me. So far as I am personally concerned, not only has the honourable member for Dalley no right whatever to demand an explanation from me, but, more than that, I say there is nothing for me to explain, and if 1 endeavoured to do so, possibly my action would be interpreted as lending colour to thought that I held that any explanation was necessary. The honourable member has endeavoured to show that it is wrong for an organization which so attacks existing Customs duties to collect funds fro m those who wish to have the tariff reduced. Of course, the honourable member was speaking with his tongue in his cheek. He knows that he would never seriously entertain the slightest idea that there was anything improper in such action, but he is quite willing to throw out insinuations or innuendoes in this House that such is the case. He does not question the right of any political party to carry on propaganda work, because propaganda-whic h is carried on by every political party-is merely an attempt by a few people to achieve something which they believe to be in the interests of the community generally. For my part, I am glad to be associated with it ; I feel that I have more to beproud of in that regard than I would have if , as others are doing, I were castto be proud. ing a slur upon the characters of men who are trying to serve, their countiy. If the. honourable member for Dalley says that there is anything improper in propaganda he is condemning his own party. Will anybody pretend for a moment, that the Labour party, the National party, the Country party, or any other political party or public organization, does not collect funds for the furtherance of its objects ? In trying to collect funds for propaganda, what a terrible crime the Town and Country Union has committed. Honourable members, I suppose, expect letters to be carried without postage, and all sorts of work to be done without spending money. Such a notion is so childish and ridiculous that no sensible man would attach the slightest importance to it . If what the Town and Country Union has done be wrong, what right has any organization, which is agitating, not for a reduction of Customs duties, but for an increase of them, to collect and spend funds for the promotion of its objects? That policy, when adopted by protectionists, is, I suppose, laudable in the opinion of honourable members opposite. But my view is that it is more creditable to collect money for propaganda to reduce the burdens of the community than to collect funds for an organization to increase them. I the think I have sufficiently explained my connection with this business. I know nothing about the lett er _ that has been quoted. Until I read it in the press I did not know that such a communication had been sent. As for negotiations of the slimy character indicated by the honourable' member for Dalley, I know nothing of them, and I utterly repudiate any association with them. I do not pretend to know what is ment by the phrase "" financial pressure."" To my mind it is a very clumsy phrase; it may mean any of two or three things; but, of course, the honourable member has been pleased to place upon it that construction which is most agreeable to his own mind. Those who are associated with me in this charge, and whose characters have been maligned, are not here, and cannot speak for themselves, but I do say of Mr Hagelthorn, that any man who equals him in public spirit, selfsacrifice, and hard labour for what he considers a public cause, has reason So far from his having received any so-called "" German gold."" I know that he is working at the sacrifice of his private business. I can assert positively that no improper negotiations or suggestions have been made by either the Town and Country Unionto Mr Fiddian, or Mr Fiddian to the Town and Country Union. What significance is there in the statement that if the union succeeded in getting a reduction of certain duties the piano trade would contribute to its funds? Honourable members wiU at least notice that no contribution was to be made until the work was done. The Town and Country Union was undertaking this work unselfishly, and in the public, interest, and without knowledge that it would receive any financial contribution, but if it. succeeded, and were offered a financial acknowledgment of its services, it would be entitled to accept it - What happens in connection with protectionist propaganda? I was told recently of a manufacturer being approached, and definitely informed by a representative of an organization that if he cared to pay Â£1,000 to that body it would get a certain duty in creased. If that incident indicates the practices of the protectionists let them not cast a stone,",49
173,Mr SCULLIN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,I think the honourable member should disclose the identity of that person.,51
174,Mr MANN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I scorn to descend to such* depths. The attack made to-night was unprovoked, unreasonable, just and unmanly. Both the newspaper that published and the honourable member trespassed on the time of the House in order to ventilate his very unreal anxiety for the honour of Parliament, seemed to be in the same predicament as the suffragettes were in England a few years ago, when because they could not stand being ignored, they smashed windows and resorted to arson and other extreme actions to bring themselves under public notice. Like the bandar-log mentioned in K i p lings Jungle Book, the one thing some persons cannot suffer is not to be treated seriously, or thought worthy of notice.",51
175,Mr BRENNAN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Batman) [9.10] We all must sympathize more or less with the honourable member for Perth (Mr . Mann). He spoke feelingly, and showed that the honourable member' for Dalley (Mr Mahony) had, at least, succeeded in arousing his interest in this public matter. I scarcely know what is the gravamen of the charge against the honourable member for Dalley. He merely quoted certain newspaper' passages regarding the public activities of public men and asked for an expression of opinion-a n explanation, if you like-regardin g them. honourable member for Perth has been good enough to state his opinion- a little heatedly, perhaps, so far as his remarks related to my honourable colleague, still it is gratifying to know that the matter has aroused a certain amount of public interest. I agree with the honourable member for Perth that no political party can succeed without funds. Both parties and individuals have an acquired or inherited craving for those good things which can be had only by the judicious use of money. But the portion of the honourable member's speech that most impressed me was his disclosure that, although for a long time we were under the impression that all the roubles from Moscow and the marks from Germany were flowing into the coffers of the Labour party, the great bulk of that money is now being misdirected into the coffers of the National and Country parties! That is a most disquieting discovery. We find that at the very moment when the Prime Minister was busying himself in the peaceful hamlet of Dandenong, about twenty miles from Melbourne, in explaining to the people of that sylvan and rural locality the evils of the foreign influence un- in the Labour party, that influence was operating in the interests of the freethe article trade Country party and the colleagues of who the right honourable gentleman. I repeat my agreement with the honourable member for Perth, that no political party can succeed without funds. Certainly the Nationalist party could not live an ho'ur without the money bags it possesses. On its merits as a political party it would have been condemned to death in its in fancy, but having those undoubted resources to which the honourable member so feelingly referred, it lives on, in a halting and not very convincing way, but still to a-certain extent animate and articulate. My mention of the Prime Minister recalls to my mind the real object for which I rose. Most honourable members will have observed that while the House was sitting, and when the Prime Minister's duty was to be in his place in this chamber, he was making frantic efforts to defend his reputation in the heart of his electorate. I do not blame him ; on the contrary, I quite realise the necessities of his situation. He has much to apologize for, and no one will blame him for going to the people to whom he is responsible to offer his The apologies. But that, is not all. At the present time a board which was created by this Government to determine whether certain Australian citizens should be deported from this country is sitting in Sydney. 1I have the satisfaction of knowing by a decision of the High Court that that board is not a judicial body, and, therefore, in the strictly technical sense, the cases of those men who are appearing before the board are not mb judice. Still , the Prime Minister has said that the board is an independent, non-political body discharging judicial functions in a judicial way. He has endeavoured to persuade this Chamber, and the public generally, that these Australian citizens who are on trial before this board are really to have a fair trial, free from political influence of any kind. It is an amazing fact that, although he has made that public declaration here and elsewhere, he is perambulating the country endeavouring to poison the minds of the public, and incidentally the board, against these men. politically speaking, is about the most i decent thing that I have known a Prime .Minister of this country to do, and I am not at all surprised that his action has evoked a most spirited condemnation from the learned King's Counsel whose duty it is to defend these men before that t r i bunal. May I be permitted to quote the words of that learned gentleman, as reported in the Argus of the 7th September, 1925, under the heading "" Deportation Board,"" "" At t a c k on Mr Bruce.""? Like the honourable member for Dalley I do not father statements that I find in the Argus, the Age, or the Melbourne press generally. My experience has taught me that on matters of opinion they are almost., always entirely wrong rather than slightly right. But on a question of fact I think that they can sometimes be relied upon; and this is a question of undisputed fact. The report reads as follows:Mr Watt, KC, said that no reason had been given to him for the resumption. "" I noticed by the press this morning,"" he said, ""that'a certain gentleman who is Prime Minister of this Commonwealth has taken upon himself to make public utterances which ?re absolutely slanderous, false, and improper. He docs that even in face of his creation of this board.""",51
176,Mr SPEAKER,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND," Order ! I think that the honourable member is aware of the ancient parliamentary rule that no member may read from a newspaper an extract containing unparliamentary terms. Had the honourable member himself endeavoured in this House to give expression to the terms alleged to have been used by the King's Counsel, he would not have been permitted to do so.",52
177,Mr BRENNAN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I accept your ruling, sir, that the words that I have read are not parliamentary. I quite appreciate the propriety of the standing order and practice in that regard, and I merely awaited your decision as to whether the words were or were not parliamentary. The report continues"" As this is not a court, we cannot ask to deal with Mr Bruce for slander.""",52
178,Mr CANNING,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,Is this necessary?,52
179,Mr WATT,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Yes . I have never seen Mr. Bruce to speak to him. Although we are unable to have him dealt with, we hope that he will have the public decency to refrain from committing contempt of court. Those words are, at all events, restrained, That, and I think that they are absolutely jusn - tified by the facto. If we cannot induce this Chamber and the public to restrain the right honourable gentleman from continuing these grave and gross contempts, apparently we have no other means of redress; but upon individual members of this House there lies the duty of calling attention to what I regard as a gravely indecent political practice on the part of the Prime Minister. So tar from being dissuaded from continuing on this course, we find him repeating the offence. In this evening's Herald there is the following report: "" One of the matters which might have compelled us to take one definite step,"" said Mr. Watt, "" is the way in which the Prime Minister is disregarding his duty to this board, to the public, and to us who are charged with the defence of these men. I have always been taught to believe that when a light was on the ring was to be kept clear."" Mr W at t was interrupted at that, stage. Later he said"" Mr Bruce has instructed that this man should 'be hauled before the board, and he is now interfering with the board's functions. Ho does not say it in so many words,"" Mr Watt went on, ""but while he has appointed this board and instructed his responsible Minister to act on its recommendation, he is determined that this man Sliall leave the country."" I remember that during the war-and that fact should be noted-the ex-Prime Minister (Mr WM . Hughes), who subl sequently "" dropped his bundle,"" which was avidly seized by the right honourable gentleman who is now carrying it , had a playful way of launching criminal prosecutions against his political opponents in the morning, and addressing public meetings in the evening, as though in the meantime he had convicted them of the offences with which he had charged them. So little regard had he for the best traditions of the high office that be held, and for the duty that rests upon every man, but especially a Minister of the Crown, to respect the rights and privileges of a person who is charged with a criminal offence that he resorted to such tactics. He, at least, had the you excuse that he was acting in a time of war, and under what the militarists are pleased to call "" m i l it a r y necessity."" The exigencies of a military situation very often necessitate a modification of the moral code. Therefore, Mr Hughes frequently suspended the principles of justice in order that he might air his political prejudices and preoccupations. The present Prime Minister, the right honourable member for the sylvan retreat of Dandenong and the district of ""Wonthaggi - in which place, I was pleased to notice, he had a rather warm reception",52
180,Mr BAYLEY,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,They cheered him at the end.,53

In a time of peace-no t political peace, but peace so far as the clash of arms is concerned-h e is guilty of those very abuses which were so strongly condemned in those days. suggest that he ought 'to desist; that he ought to act up to the pretence that this board is really a non-political board. Honourable members on this side know that it is not. but that, on the contrary, it has been appointed to deport and not to try men. I su?gest. to the Prime Minister that if he continues in the course of actipn that he is now following, and endeavours to secure his political position at the expense of his reputation as a M i nister of the Crown, he will eventually drive the board into acouitring the men, and thus defeat the object for which it was appointed. Such a result, from the point of view of the Government, would be a catastrophe of no mean order, and should be avoided at all costs. In reply to the honourable member for Dalley tn-dnv. the Prime Minister said that he bad used his publicity department to disseminate throughout the Commonwealth the sneech that he delivered at Dandenong. He claimed that in that action he h=>d observed the best traditions of Nationalist governments, and I am quite prepared to believe that he did What I want to know is, why he "" stole the thunder"" of the honourable member for Fawkner C Mr MaxwellV Why did he go to Dandenong, and repeat seriously the excellent jests that the honourable member for Fawkner had already made in this House, and which were appropriately received by honourable members sitting on this side of the House? When the right honourable gentleman disseminates his policy speech, it ought to be an original one, and, from the point of view of accuracy as to facts, if possible, it should be better than that which he delivered at Dandenong last nighty He displayed keen anxiety about the "" pernicious foreign influences."" I observe that he traced the malign influence of the Labour party in the disturbances that are occurring not only in Egypt, China, and Afghanistan, but also in India, Moscow, and even amongst the Riffis in Morocco. All those disturbances he attributes to the influence of the Labour party, through its agents the communists, The Prime backed up by whatever foreign funds were left over after the Free Trade party in the corner had helped itself to them. I exactly have been reminded by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) of a very interesting fact in connection w if h the seamen's strike. The authorities thoughtI fit to arrest a number of seamen, among whom were Albert Dean and Alfred Spencer. Those appear to be perfectly innocuous English names, one of themAlbert-bein g closelv associated with the Royal Family, and, therefore, above suspicion. But the person who laid the in formation against these men, the master of the Port Kembla, from which vessel they are alleged to have deserted, was Mr Chris van der Berg! One wonders if some foreign influence, and perhaps foreign money, is not being disseminated amongst the masters of vessels who are prosecuting these men, rather than amongst men who bear these highly respectable English names. The Prime Minister has assumed a new role. He now appears as one appointed to safeguard the sacred principles of trade unionism ; it is rumoured that he has accepted a position as organizer of a militan t trade union in this country at a satisfactory salary. It is curious to note the anxiety of the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), and other honourable members opposite, who are at the present time in a state of extreme perturbation, not on the country's behalf, or even on their own behalf, but entirely on behalf of the Labour party and the great unionist movement. I suggest to these honourable gentlemen that they should cease to worry about the great trade union movement; it is well able to look after itself without their aid. Labour party will, aa it did in New South Wales, continue to stand firmly against the malign or beneficent influences of the communists and the nicious influence of foreigners foreign money. As there are in the parties forming the coalition two apparently eminent medical men, I suggest to those honourable members who are so perturbed that they should apply to those medical men for a prescription containing some useful solvent and sedative to enable them to sleep soundly in their beds at night, and awaken in the morning with their minds clarified, so that they may have a saner view of the relative importance of communism and the Labour movement in this country. My final words to the Government are that, whatever their anxiety regarding the sacred principles of the trade union movement, they should at least endeavour to observe ordinary political dei-ency and fair play in regard to men on trial. That was my principal object in rising. It may be that the Prime Minister is not familiar with the practice in regard to these matters, that he has to make concessions to those who drive him forward, keep his ear to the ground, and have his newspaper read to him every morning"" in order to obtain directions regarding his political activities for the day. But, being a Britisher above all things-muc h more a Britisher than an Australian-and being much more concerned with the strikes of Englishmen than the strikes of Australians, I suggest that whether or not he is familiar with the practice in these matters, he should make himself familiar with the best traditions of the judiciary in the administration of the criminal and other laws of this country, and abstain from making these aspersions on others for political purposes. I know that a great deal has to be conceded to him because of political necessity, and the fact that he endeavoured to fire a shot which proved to be a "" squib."" He threatened the people with an election, but the people discovered that, he was merely trying to create political turmoil in order to have an election at a time which he thought would be favourable to the Nationalists. By no other means can they [99] hope to succeed at the polls. I desire to bring him back to first principles. The Mr R GREEN (Richmond) [9.351 Every year a sum is placed on the Estimates for the better, ventilation of this chamber. I sincerely hope that the per- work has now reached a stage at which and it will be possible quickly to r i d the chamber of the enormous quantity of poison gas that has just been disseminated. I desire to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General and the M i nister for Defence certain matters which I think they could, by collaboration, easily rectify. I refer to the arrangements for soldiers to obtain their pensions in country districts. When a soldier is granted a pension the money has to be paid to him at a post office, which is also a money order office. Not all post offices come within that category; many do not issue money orders. In such cases, although a soldier may live in close proximity to a post office, he may be forced to travel a considerable distance to reach a money order office to obtain his pension. In many instances the journey is a long one. In my own case 1. had to traA el 13 miles each way, which r meant a journey of 26 miles on each occasion. Moreover, .1. had to provide my cwn conveyance, as there were no trams or trains available. It must be remembered also that those who are drawing pensions draw them because of physical disabilities. To such meu travelling is a greater burden than to others. I suggest that the Minister concerned should endeavour to devise some better system than that now in operation. Should it be found after consultation that no better system can be devised for the payment of the pensions in cash, I suggest that payments be made by cheques, or, where the amounts are small, by postal notes. An y storekeeper would willingly cash such cheques or postal notes. I make no excuse for bringing this matter forward. It has been discussed by various branches of the Returned 'Sailors and Soldiers I m perial League throughout Australia. It must be apparent to every honourable member that it is wrong to force an in capacitated soldier to travel long distances to receive his pension. I know of one man who has to travel 31 miles each way to obtain his pension. I point out also that no allowance for fares is made in such cases. Mr STEWART' - The present arrangeor ment penalizes-' those livin g in remote country districts.",53
184,Mr R GREEN,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"That is so. Men living in the cities suffer no great venience, as nearly every post office a money order office. The penalties daring to live in the back-blocks are ready too great without this burden added. There is another matter to which I deto sire to refer. Periodically, those draw pensions are called upon to attend before a board to have their cases resider viewed. Amputees and eye cases alone draw their pension under the act withconsidered out review. The majorit y of pensioners are required to attend periodically before a board for examination, and in such cases their fares are allowed. In the city a man can attend before a board with the loss of a f ew. 'hours only, but i instances in the country it means ably two days' .travelling-sometime s more-wit h hotel expenses for one night - and is liable to make* mistakes. I suggest that when a man in a country district is called upon to attend before board for his case to be reviewed, and attendance entails travelling, he . should receive some compensation for the loss of time. Where a man is absent from his work for a few hours only, as is the generally in the cities, he experiences little difficulty in obtaining time off once in six or twelve months, but where a man has to take two or three days work, and spend one or more nights in a country town, the position is different. In some instances, although the distance io be travelled - may not be any greater than in others, the'transport facilities few, and services infrequent, thereby causing additional loss. Provision should be made for the-exi-soldier to attend before the board without financial loss:",55
185,Mr THOMPSON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"New England) [ 9 . 4 5 ] - I wish to bring under the of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) the ceive. unfortunate position of blind men and women who are selling tobacco, matches, and cigarettes in the streets of different parts of the Commonwealth. Quite recently I - was requested by Blind Association of New South Wales ro introduce a deputation to the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions i u New South Wales, and to request that a decision ukase of the Commissioner of Pensions in Melbourne, which prohibits blind sellers of tobacco, matches, and cigarettes receiving a pension, should be rescinded and their pension rights reinconstored. Not receiving any reply from is also the Commissioner of Pensions in Melf o r bourne, I personally approached that algentleman, and asked him why these being people were deprived of the invalid pension. The reply of Mr Collins was the effect that it was not the policy of who the department to encourage mendicancy. I informed him that I did not conthat the selling of tobacco, matches, and cigarettes by blind people could be mendicancy, and, in any case, blind people throughout the ages have been tolerated as mendicants. The action of Mr Collins cannot be regarded as other than autocratic. Mr Collins is a gentleman of the highest financial ability n many and occupies, I think, four highly reprobsponsible positions in the Commonwealth, but, after all, he is only human, I do not think that it is the intention of this a Parliament that even such a highlyhis qualified gentleman should have the right to dictate the pensions policy, and, if a vote were taken in this chamber on the question, I do not think that half a dozen case people would oppose the granting of a pension to the persons I have indicated.",55

187,Mr THOMPSON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I informed Mr . Collins that if I had an opportunity I would test the feeling of the House. He said that Parliament was supreme, as of are course it is, but it is impossible for me to take a test vote to-night. While not wishing to censure the Commissioner of Pensions, I think he has made a mistake in laying down a rule under which the blind sellers of tobacco., matches, and cigarettes cannot receive the pension notice which - Parliament intended them to re",55
188,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,They should cities in receive every encouragement.,55
189,Mr THOMPSON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Yes ; there are a (he large number of blind men and women of all ages who, although able-bodied, are not f it subjects for charity. A number of them have a strong objection to entering blind institutions and submitting to the regulations imposed by the authorities in such institutions. There are very few people in our midst who are so callous as to object to such persons earning an honest living in the streets. If Mr Collins thinks that their presence in the streets is objectionable to the public he has totally misconstrued the feelings of the populace towajjds these people. I do not wish to draw in vidious distinctions, but, after hearing the excellent case made out by thp Blind Association in New South Wales, Mr Theggie, the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in that State, was in sympathy with the proposal. Theggie I think we have one of the finest, officers in the service of the Commonwealth, and one in every way suited for the position which he occupies. I do not know why Mr Collins has acted in such an arbitrary way under the discretionary powers which he is allowed to exercise. Many of these people are young, and are quite able to augment their income by selling the articles I have mentioned. The blind sellers of newspapers are not prohibited from receiving the pension. The reason given for the distinction is that it is a simple matter for the Pensions Department to trace from the newspaper offices the incomes derived by sellers of newspapers, and that it is not so simple to determine the incomes of those selling tobacco and matches. In consequence of this, it is said that they would probably be able to submit a return that could not be relied upon by the department. do not think it matters in the slightest whether the department can trace the actual income of either section to which I have referred, because the amount would be so small that it would not affect, to any great extent, the total amount of pensions now paid. I do not think it fair for the Commissioner of Pensions to impose such conditions, and the matter is one which should be brought before the House by a member of the Government. If a vote were taken I believe a unanimous decision would be reached in favour of those persons for whom I am speaking.",55

General (Mr Gibson) the excessive delay which takes place in connection with the - I delivery of interstate commercial grams. These delays are causing serious inconvenience to business people and others. Press telegrams have also been delayed as long as fourteen hours. The consequence has been that i m portant news items dispatched from this House and from other offices have not reached Sydney in time for publication in the morning newspapers, which reflects very materially upon the efficiency of the Postal Department. I was in formed unofficially to-night by a representative of the press that a telegram dispatched from this House at 8.30 p.m. was not delivered at a newspaper ofiice in In Mr Sydney u n t i l 10.30 next morning. That is a scandalous state of affairs. One day last year I was informed that a friend of mine had died, and a telegram that I sent at once to Sydney was not delivered u n t i l ' 10 o'clock the next morning. It took longer for a telegram to reach that city than it would have taken a letter in the ordinary course of the post. I understand that an improvement is to be made, but action should have been taken long ago I wish, also, to direct the attention of the Treasurer Â«to the necessity of the Commonwealth Government coming to some reciprocal arrangement with New Zealand in the matter of invalid and old-age pensions. I raised this matter last year, and the year before, and shall continue to do so until some agreement has been reached between Australia and New Zealand. As I have emphasized on previous occasions, the New Zealand GovernI ment is already prepared to enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth under which pensions will be payable in both countries. If that is done, Com r monwealth residents temporarily in New Zealand, and New Zealand residents who are residing for the time being in the Commonwealth will benefit. In perusing the file, I find that the New Zealand Government has for the last fourteen years been requesting the Commonwealth Government to act in this matter. There are hundreds of shearers and others who visit New Zealand periodically, and who when they are reaching the age at which they are entitled to the pension, cannot, owing to their temporary residence, take - I advantage of the Pensions Act. I trust the Government will give this matter im",56

I am astonished at the action of the departmental officers in refusing to pay the pension to men and women so afflicted if they engage in such work. My view is that these people should be encouraged to assist themselves as far as possible. I go further, and say that this principle should be applied, not only to blind pensioners, but. to all pensioners. The practice we have of treating the pension as a charitable dole given, if not for the purpose, certainly with tjie effect, of pauperizing the pensioners, is entirely wrong. At best the pensioners can add but very little to their pensions by their earnings. In their declining years and condition of physical incapacity they should be encouraged to augment the assistance given them by the State by such earnings as they can gain in lawful occupations. Before the session closes I hope that the Treasurer will look into the matter, will liberalize the regulations for the payment of pensions, and, should it be necessary, will introduce an amendment of the act to meet the objection which has been raised. I am entirely in sympathy with the remarks of the honourable member for New England. I hope that the Treasurer will take serious notice of them with a view to doing something in the direction indicated.",56
192,Mr WHITSITT,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Darwin) [ 1 0 . 3 ] should like to bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs a matter of vital importance to Tasmania. Owing to extensive importations of timber, from abroad at the present time, the timber industry in Tasmania is absolutely languishing.",57
193,Mr FENTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,It is languishing in the Commonwealth generally.,57
194,Mr WHITSITT,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I am referring particularly to Tasmania, because I am well acquainted with the position there. The mill owners cannot compete with the importations under existing conditions. Mills are being closed down and numbers of people are being thrown out of employment. The reasons for the present condition of the timber industry in Tasmania are that freights on timber from abroad are lower than interstate freights. Tasmania is injuriously affected by the Navigation Act ; the industry has to pay wages in accordance with Arbitration Court awards, and the duty on imported timber is insufficient. If we enact laws for the fixing of wages and legislation governing shipping, we must increase the duty on importations if those engaged in the timber industry in Tasmania are to live. I want to know what the intentions of the Government are in this matter. The position of the timber industry is imperilled, although the Tasmanian timbers are second to none. There are splendid blackwoods and hardwoods in bhat State. I trust that consideration will be given to the very serious grievance to which I have directed attention.

Clause 3Section 12 of the War Service Homes Act 1.918-1923 is amended by inserting in paragraph (n.) of sub-section 1 thereof, after the word "" employment,"" the following words :- "" (not being employment in the Public Service of the Commonwealth)."" Section, proposed to be amended12 - (1) The Commissioner or the Acting Commissioner [if any) shall be deemed to have vacated his office if- I (a) he engages, during his term of office, in any employment outside the duties of his office;",57
195,Mr CHARLTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Hunter ) [ 1 0 . 6 ] - I do not object to the amendment of - the War Service Homes Act provided for in this clause. It may be necessary. But I do want to say that I doubt very much whether an officer in charge of a very important department like the War Service Homes Department can do justice to the work unless he devotes to it the whole of his time. I believe that Colonel Semmens, who did excellent work as WaT Service Homes Commissioner, occupied more than one position while he held that office, .but that is no reason why we should perpetuate that sort of thing. If we pay an adequate salary to secure the services of a good man to look after a publio department, his work should be confined to that department. There is a very large sum of money involved in the War Service Homes, and we are pi ill expending money upon them at a pr-.at rate. It is as necessary tiow as i at the inception of the department to have in charge of it a capable man who will devote the whole of his time to the work. Otherwise, we nuvy have a recurrence of the failures of the past, which were largely due to defects of administration. They should teach us the lesson that the officer in charge of this department should devote the whole of his attention to it . I could say much regarding what is happening under this department in New South Wales, but I wish, if possible, to avoid raising, questions of the kind to-night. I .am not satisfied with the present administration. In my new, the officials of the department are much more severe in their treatment of returned soldiers than private owners of property would be. I could submit many cases in support of that view. We must have some one at the head of the department who will devote the whole of .his energies to the work, and will , see that those employed under him in sub-departments, while keeping in view the interests of the Commonwealth, shall temper their administration with humanity. Tbey should endeavour as far as possible to meet the circum' stances of every case. Of the large number of returned meu who have secured homes under the War Service Homes Act, it is but reasonable to expect that some wil l have difficulty in making their repayments. A man can never say when illness will overtake him, or when, through unemployment, he may find himself unable to keep up his payments, and the department in such cases should be as liberal as possible. A man came to me last Sunday who had been in arrears with his repayments. I Bay nothing about the merits of his case, because I do not know the whole of the facts, but he assured me that he was served with a notice of ejectment and prosecuted, and a barrister was sent up from Sydney to Newcastle in connection with the case. .. The case was settled out of court, but .the barrister charged the returned soldier twenty guineas for appearing,, and said he had let him down lightly. able members will agree that there was no occasion to send a highly-briefed [100] man. up from Sydney to appear for the depurtioent in such a case. It is about rime lhat the head of this det was partment ceased doing that kind of thin^. I sympathize with this' man. The case was settled by him agreeing to pay Â£ 4 Is. 9d. a month to the department. He paid it for some lime. At the end of July he paid an instalment of Â£ 1 , and' four days afterwards paid Â£ 3 Is. 9d., and so fulfilled his monthly obligation, but two weeks afterwards he received a letter from the department calling upon him to nay his arrears. On no grounds whatever can we justify that kind of treatment of the men who fought for us overseas. Having already loaded the man with twenty guineas of unnecessary legal expenses, the department ought not to have harassed him when he had. done all that he undertook to do.",57
196,Mr HILL,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,I shall' be glad to have the details of that case.,58
197,Mr CHARLTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I understand that the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), who now has them, intends to 'make them available to the Minister. I could give quite a number of instances, of the same kind. This department ought to be administered in a more sympathetic way. We cannot treat the soldiers who are purchasing war service homes in exactly the same manner as we treat old-age and invalid pensioners, for in the one case the money is loan, and has to be repaid, whereas in the other case no repayments are required; but I say unhesitatingly we ought to' be sympathetic. If I owned some of the tenements that the soldiers occupy, I should treat them much more liberally than the war service homes authorities are doing. . The War Service Homes Commissioner should not be responsible for any other duties, but should devote the whole of his rime to war service homes work. He-should be in close touch with the deputy commissioners in the respective States. His policy ought to be clearly denned, and he ought to be devoting the whole of his attention to the task of making it effective. There are instances in which the men who occupy war service homes are not making any attempt to fulfil their obligations, but there are many more cases in which the men have improved their properties, by laying .out Honor- gardens, putting down paths, and so on. These should be given every consideration. MT . HILL - I assure the honourable member that they are sympathetically treated.",58
198,Mr CHARLTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I am glad to hear the Minister say that, but I am afraid that it is not so in every case.",59
199,Mr HILL,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,Some of the complaints that are made will not bear investigation.,59
200,Mr CHARLTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"In the last three or four months I have submitted a numsioner ber of cases to the department which have justified investigation, for they have been remedied.",59
201,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,The troubles arise sometimes because of ihe neglect the men to answer letters written to by the department.,59
202,Mr CHARLTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"That may be so in a few instances. In every case the utmost clemency should be extended to men who are in arrears through no fault of their own. Hardship will overtake some of those who have the very best oP intentions. A . worker cannot always maintain his health and secure permanent employment. through ill health or other misfortune, man's regular income ceases, he is diately in difficulties in respect of payments as 15s. o- Â£ 1 for rent to either the War Service Homes .Commission or a private landlord. There is sufficient work in the War Service Homes Depart-' ment to occupy the full time of missioner, and I consider that whoever Commissioner. is appointed should be liberated f r o other responsibility.",59
203,Mr FENTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,Maribyrnong ) [10.16]. - I gathered from the second-reading w speech of the Minister that the GovernWorks ment intended to .appoint the of the Works and Railways Department tc the position of War Service Homes Commissioner. He will f ill the two offices.,59
204,Mr HILL,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,That is so.,59
205,Mr FENTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"In that case, the present unsatisfactory conditions will continue.",59
206,Mr CHARLTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,Nothin g is more certain.,59
207,Mr FENTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"The Works and Railways Department is increasing in i m portance every year, and it cannot bo expected that its secretary will be able to devote much of his time to War Service Homes work. The previous War Service Homes Commissioner was also the Commissioner of Repatriation. The Government decided to relieve him of his War Service Homes work, so that be could devote the whole of his attention to the Repatriation Department. It is surprising, therefore, that it should seek to create conditions for, the new Commissimilar to those which proved unsatisfactory to the previous' occupant of the ofiice. I understand that we have spent more than Â£30,000,000 on War Service Homes. In Victoria, the State Savof ings Sank Commissioners are building them homes for the War Service Homes Department, and in South Australia the work is being done by the State Bank.",59
208,Mr HILL,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"In Queensland and New South Wales the Department is doing its own work, and doing it well.",59
209,Mr FENTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"That is all the more reason why the War Service Homes Commissioner should be absolutely free from Whenever, any other duties. The War Service a Homes Act places heavy responsibility immeupon the Commissioner, and he ought such not to be overloaded. I do not make any reflection upon the former War Service Homes Commissioner, but .I am sure that we shall not improve the department byappointing the Secretary of the Works: the Comand Railways Department as the new ColonelSemmens, who m all was also chairman of the Repatriation Commission, was War Service Homes Commissioner in name only, and that ill be the position of the Secretary for and Railways. He will be ComSecretary missioner nominally.",59
210,Mr CHARLTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Who . is really doing the work?  has been doing it all along, and there is no doubt that he will continue to do it under this new arrangement.",59
211,Mr CHARLTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,He ought to . have been out of the department long ago.,59
212,Mr FENTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I am glad that the Commonwealth undertook the responsibility of providing homes for oiir soldiers, but 1 regret that it docs not seem to recognize that the department is now a big business concern. Although the Minister for Works and Eailways is responsible for its administration, his parral experience. liamentary and other duties prevent him from giving adequate tinie to the work. He is dependent upon the secretary of trustee the department for all his information. While present conditions prevail the administration of the War Service Homes Department cannot be successful. was surprised to hear that a rethemselves. turned soldier was required to pay a fee of twenty guineas to a barrister who velled from Sydney to Newcastle to rethat present the. department, only to find on his arrival that the case had been settled out of court. I trust that this fee will be refunded, as otherwise it will impose a severe hardship upon the turned soldier. 1I have said for that we should have more Commonwealth supervision of soldier settlements. hand over the money to the States, with the result that the Commonwealth GoThis vernment has already had to write off Â£5,000,000, and it is quite likely that another Â£5,000,000 or Â£10,000,000 will have to be written off. W it h such lessons ing us in the face, the Government still tends to perpetuate a system that may the administration of the lead to considerable loss to the taxpayers of this country, and at the same time inflict a terrible hardship upon the sionership, soldiers who are purchasing homes. shall allow the bill to go through under protest. I hope that my doleful prophecy will not eventuate, although I am sure that the continuance of the present tem of administration in the War SerMinister's vice Homes Department will lead to further complaints being made House.",59
213,Sir LITTLETON GEOOM,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"Darling Downs - Attorney-General) [10.22] - f f the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) makes a careful investigation, he will find that all cases submitted to the partment have been, and are being, treated sympathetically, and with the sire to give justice to everybody. As there are over 26,000 homes either built, purof chased, or otherwise dealt with, we cannot but expect some difficulties to arise. Men get out of work, or there is sickness in work effective. their homes, and they get into arrears. The Minister has many troubles to deal with, but in all cases he treats the men port adopted. sympathetically and with a desire to do them justice.",60
214,Mr LAZZARINI,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,That is not the gene,60
215,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"The M in ister, it must not be forgotten, is also for the many millions in vested in war service hon.es, and he must exercise ordinary, business-like precautions to protect the interests, not only I of the Commonwealth, but of the soldiers If the Leader of the Opposition will supply me with particulars of trathe case that he mentioned, I shall see it is investigated. The recent Commissioner for War Service Homes, Colonel Semmens, is now to give the whole of his time to repatriation work. The Minister for Defence is giving his personal attenretion to all repatriation cases brought years under his notice by . honourable members or by direct application, and We as a result a tremendously heavy burden' has been .placed upon him . has also increased the burden of the Commissioners, so much so that it has been found necessary , to leave the chairman free for repatriation work. The War Service Homes Department has starbeen transferred from the Repatriain - tion Department, and placed under Minisrer for Works and Railways. It is proposed to appoint Mr Bingle to the commisand instead of difficulties arisI ing, as anticipated by the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister will now be in a much better position because the expert officers of the Works and Railways Desyspartment will be at his disposal. The own secretary-the Secretary of the Department of Works and Railwaysi n this will be the Commissioner.",60
216,Mr CHARLTON,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"I understand that  all the previous trouble, is still to be connected with the department.",60
217,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,PORT AUGUSTA TO BROKEN HILL AND,"He does dehis own work.
