2,Mr REITH,BUSINESS," Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence.",13
3,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Indulgence is granted.,13
4,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"Mr Speaker, the circumstances facing the House this morning are as follows: the departmental and parliamentary staff worked until around 2 o'clock this mornfor ing, I am told. Mr Crean-This is incompetence!",13
5,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Order! Mr Crean-Well, it is! M . - REITH-They resumed work at 5 a.m.",13
6,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Order! It is too early for a walk. Mr Crean-Oh, you have to be joking.",13
7,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"Mr Speaker, let me start again and say, 'Good morning to members of the opposition and to all members of the House.' We do appreciate that people would prefer to be at home. But, in the management of the business of the Senate, upon the completion of the Senate's consideration, the various information had to be provided to the House of Representatives by transmission. The paperwork associated with that was worked on until 2 a.m. by the Senate's parliaLeader mentary staff, by and large, including departto mentd staff, who resumed this morning at 5 o'clock. They have worked through. I am told that the material has now been provided to the House of Representatives staff and that the completion of their aspects of the paperwork is not far off. They will give me a determined timetable in the next half hour or thereabouts. As soon as they give me that timetable, I will return to the House and give you as much information as I will have. Mr Speaker, the proposal that we will put to the House in a moment-Â·Mr Sercombe--You could not run a chook raffle.",13
8,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"It is disappointing that people are making derogatory remarks about parliamentary staff who have spent the whole night preparing the paperwork so that we can get away-after the Labor Party has spent hours and hours wasting time in the Senate, as a policy of obstruction, to delay and to drag out the passage of this important legislation. Mr Speaker, this morning I will not be party political in my comments, because I do not trust the other side not to seek indulgence and say the same. It would be a pity if we took up the time that we now have available an adjournment debate with such provocative responses and comments. As soon as I have a definitive timetable from the parliamentary staff-in the next 15 minutes, 20 minutes or half an hour-I will return to the House and give all members of the House the timetable. In respect of the management of the debate for the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, we expect that contributions from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) will be up to 15 minutes each; fifteen minutes for the next two speakers; and 10 minutes for the third speakers on either side. There may be one Independent also. You can calculate how long that is. That will then complete matters. Thank you.",13
9,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,I thank the minister. I call the member for Hotham-on indulgence.,13
10,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS," Mr Speaker, the of the House (Mr Reith) was prepared allow me the indulgence-he invited me. This is a government that blames everyone but themselves. This is a government that cannot lead and a government that now cannot govern. This is a government that tries to blame the staff when the government itself has had carriage of the time. This is a government that was prepared to have us sit all night in expectation of material coming across, and it has not even got it today. This is a shambles of a government. The Leader of the House came in here and tried to blame the parliamentary staff when he was telling me all week that this material would be in here in two hours. Then, in the eleventh hour, he says, 'It will be between six and 10.' When yesterday I invited him to consider whether we should be back this morning, he said, 'No, we will be back here tonight. We will keep you here tonight.' Then he comes here today, having called us in at 9 a.m., and they are still not ready. This is no ordinary issue. This is one of three key issues that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) nominated. This is an issue that he has turned into a shambles. He should be leaving this parliament this weekend with all of us feeling proud about a bill we could go out and defend, but they have a bill that they cannot even govern around; a bill that will add to uncertainty. The uncertainty deepens because we have not even got it to debate. This is simply about competence. We know that they cannot lead. We know the Prime Minister cannot walk the extra mile because the National Party will not let him. But now we have got a government that simply cannot get its act in order. This is the government that was voted in with such a majority and now is just a rabble. The national parliament is having this extraordinary sitting on a Saturday and it cannot even govern. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order, Mr Speaker, is that you have granted indulgence to the Manager of Opposition Business to make some comment about the management of House affairs. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that it is not an indulgence to make petty, juvenile, stupid remarks about the work of the parliamentary staff who worked the whole night until 2 o'clock and started again at 5 o'clock this morning simply because the Senate's timetable did not provide reasonable opportunity for things to get across here. Those are the circumstances, Mr Speaker. I am not going to be provoked into the same silly attempt at political point scoring that we now have from the Manager of Opposition Business or from his sidekick, who could not keep an agreement for more than half an hour last night. But at least this morning he does not have the dishevelled look he had last night.",13
11,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,I thank the minister. In the interests of fairnessMr Crean interjecting,14
12,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Order! You have not got the call. Mr Crean interjecting,14
13,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"But you still have not got the call. I am addressing the point of order, the which I think is in conformity with standing orders. We will be taking a great deal of cognisance today of standing orders if this hubbub continues. I take the comments by the Leader of the House to heart. This is not the time for emotive political point scoring. In the interests of fairness and equity, I planned to provide the honourable member for Hotham with equal time on the minister's indulgence. The honourable member for Hotham is flagrantly misusing that time at the moment. I will call the honourable member for Hotham to conclude his remarks in the certain knowledge that he has about one minute and 20 seconds to go.",14
14,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"Mr Speaker, we are not critical of the parliamentary staff; we have the greatest of admiration for them. Our criticism is of you, Minister: your inability to get anything right and, in particular, your inability to run anything properly in this chamber. Why don't you have question time today? Why don't you come into the place and explain your staff's role in the mercenaries on the wharf-the dogs of the wharf? Your office is in it up to its neck. You have stood there and said, 'I know nothing'-a Chinese wall between Peter Reith and his staff; his staff who are into it up to their necks. We have had a disgraceful performance today by the government in their inability to bring the native title legislation back into the House. They attacked and tried to blame the parliamentary staff for it, but it all comes back to your inability to run this place. We will use the time wisely. We will use the adjournment procedures. But you should be in here explaining the role of your office in, and the knowledge of the Prime Minister and the knowledge of the former minister for transport of, this disgraceful episode to conscript mercenaries to break the backs of the Australian workers on the waterfront. This is a government that will stoop to nothing. This is a government that will slip into the gutter to achieve any end. We should be bringing these issues on.",14
15,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,The honourable member for Hotham will resume his seat. Your time has expired. The indulgence is withdrawn. Mr Reith-I foreshadow that I will shortly move the adjournment. NA,15
16,Mr SPEAKER,VALEDICTORY,"One of the disadvantages of being Speaker is that when it comes to valedictories you traditionally follow everybody else. Because of time constraints on Thursday afternoon, I considered it appropriate to severely curtail the remarks that I had planned to make. Fortunately, one of the advantages of being Speaker is that if you seek indulgence you know it must be for a very good reason and so you invariably grant it to yourself, as I have done on this particular occasion. I have done so because I want to personally express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to the many people whose efforts ensure that this unique institution operates so smoothly and efficiently, and that it provides, as it is meant to do, a focal point for democracy and the democratic processes within Australia. Firstly, I want to acknowledge the massive effort of all of the parliamentary staff, Senate, DPRS, House of Representatives and ministerial-and I did note Senator Minchin in the chamber earlier-who have been involved in the processing of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, soon to be considered by the House. Well done, and I thank you for your extraordinary efforts. I want to particularly thank Deputy Speaker Gary Nehl and Second Deputy Speaker Harry Jenkins for their assistance and support throughout the year. Together with the members of the Speaker's Panel they have performed what I can only describe as sterling service. Their contribution to the day-today conduct of the business of this chamber and the Main Committee is a very significant and, at times, a very difficult and challenging one. My special thanks to the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Ian Harris. The good ship Department of the House of Representatives may have a new hand on the tiller but, in the tradition of the previous captain, it continues to steer a straight and steady course. Ian is very ably supported by the Deputy Clerk, Bernard Wright, Clerks Assistant Ian Cochran and Jim Pender, and assistant secretaries Peter Gibson and Robyn MCClelland, who have all shouldered a particularly heavy workload this year. My sincere thanks to Table Office directors Don Piper and Peter Mason, Chamber Research Office Director Robyn Webber and staff members of their various offices, not forgetting, of course, Laraine Brennan and Elizabeth Robertson. Jeannie Hall, who leaves us after 2V2 years of outstanding service in the daunting role of Parliamentary Liaison Officer, is now qualified for any job in the diplomatic corps anywhere in the world. Jeannie, we admire and respect you for the magnificent way you have carried out your duties, and our best wishes for the future go with you. To the team in the Sergeant-At-Arms office-David Elder, Dalma Dixon, Neville Gathercole, Marcus, Jeannie, Annette-and the messengerial and security attendants who look after us so efficiently, thank you for all of your efforts throughout the year. Thanks also to Anne Hazelton, - chard Coventry and the parliamentary relations office staff for the professional service they provide not only to our members who travel overseas but also to members from other parliaments who come to visit us. Unfortunately, Anne is not 100 per cent at the moment and is in hospital. We are thinking of you, Anne. Get well soon. To the staff of the House of Representatives Transport Office, who have seen significant changes take place in their role and responsibilities over the past few months, thank you for the high standards of service you always provide for us. Our very best wishes to Narelle Frost, who leaves her permanent position with the department today but who we hope to see back on a sessional basis in 1998. To the hard workers in finance, members' entitlements and human resources, information systems and planning, registry, stores and members' prmtmg, the AUSPIC photographers and all the other staff of the Department of the House of Representatives, my personal thanks to each and everyone of you for being such valuable members of our team. I also want to take this opportunity to Michael Bolton of the Joint House Department and John Templeton of the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, and the officers and the staff of their departments, who play such a vital role in the dayto-day operations of this place. A special mention to the committee staff, who provide such outstanding assistance and advice to the chairmen and members of our parliamentary committees and who contribute so much to some of the most constructive and useful work undertaken in this parliament. Thanks to all the other people who look after us in so many ways: Hansard, SAVO, PISO, the gurus of the User Support Centre Help Desk, the Comcar drivers, the guides, the nurses, the physiotherapists, the caterers from the Hyatt and the AFS, the ever patient switchboard operators, the staff of the fitness centre, which some of us underutilise, the swimming pool, the Parliament Shop, Joint House marketing, Aussie's, Lizzie's, Audrey's Florist, Qantas, Westpac, the post office, the people who mow the lawns and tend the magnificent gardens and those who keep our offices and the other areas of the building and span. The list goes on and on. Even though I have a list in front of me, I know I have probably forgotten some group or some person I should have mentioned. If I have, I am very sorry because you are important and your contribution is important. So, on behalf of all members, thank you to you all for providing us with care and attention of the very highest order. Finally, to the staff of the Speaker's Office-Hugh Logue, Pauline Osmond, Denise Jeffs, Marie Donnelly and Carol Nichols-thanks, team. A special thank you to Phil Bergin, whose dedicated and loyal service to the parliament over many years and whose contribution in gus role as my senior adviser was greatly appreciated. And not forgetting John Penwill and Jan Thompson, who keep the home fires burning back in the electorate office. Once again, the festive season is almost upon us. To all members and staff, may you enjoy a well earned break over Christmas. Take care and have a safe and happy holiday. thank We look forward to a great and stimulating 1998. NA Motion (by Mr Reith) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Waterfront: Defence Personnel",15
17,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"At about 5.30 yesterday afternoon, just late enough to avoid most of the press coverage last night, the Department of Defence put out a press release from the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, Vice Admiral Chris Barrie, announcing that not one, not 18, but 29 serving personnel involved in the defence forcesMr Leo MCLeay-How many?",16
18,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Twenty-nine serving personnel involved in the defence forces had now been identified as being involved with the Fynwest Dubai industrial mercenaries operation. But it gets worse. The press release says they have identified 29 'so far'. It goes on to point out that investigations are continuing to ascertain whether any other ADF personnel have been involved. This is becomspic ing an outrageous circus. It would be high farce if this were not a serious matter, not just of industrial relations but of the very fabric and nature of the Australian society that we want to build for the future, of the sort of workplace we want our children to go into as they walk into the 21st century. This is the sort of workplace that this government is sponsoring. A few days ago minister after minister got up and said, 'I know nothing about it.' The Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) said, 'I don't think there is anyone there.' Then he came back a day later and said, 'Well, there is actually one there.' The questions remain: why was that officer of the defence forces in Dubai? Who ordered him there? Under what instructions? What has he been doing? The minister has ducked every opportunity to answer those questions. And then he added that there were 18 of them on the plane out of Melbourne to Dubai the other day, on Wednesday I think it was. In the last few days we have seen a desperate attempt at cover-up on the part of this government, complicated by plausible denial, where they distance themselves at arm's length from what goes on. They know precisely what is happening but want no personal knowledge. So the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) can stand here, as he has done day after day, and say, 'I don't know anything about it.' Then, when he is asked what his department and his personal staff know, he says, 'I won't ask them what they know. I am not going to put them through a Spanish inquisition.' What sort of Spanish inquisition is this? This is accountability of a minister of the Crown to the parliament. It is one of the most outrageous misrepresentations and misuses of the military forces of this nation. But the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business will not ask his own personal staff what they know. The reason is plain. He has built himself this little Chinese wall in his office, this wall, but he needs that asbestos suit on because the fire wall is breaking down. By the time we get back here next year, he will want a thick asbestos suit to survive the fire that is going to come through that wall in his office. One of the interesting things about the 29 people so far identified-and there are more; and if the government has not identified them, we have and that will come out in the fullness of time as well-is the advice they have been given if they have trouble getting their passports. A lot of these people did not have passports, and the advice they have been given if they did not have a passport was, 'Contact the Minister for Foreign Affairs.'",16
19,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT,Government members interjecting,17
20,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"The dills on the other side say, 'Well, wouldn't you do that?' I have to tell you the average person who has a problem with their passport does not ring up the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. That is not normally the first place you contact, and everyone out there who is listening to this debate knows that. What were these people told? 'Get in touch with Alexander Downer's office. If you cannot get your passport they will fix it for you.' Not only has the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business been avoiding his obligations to be accountable to this parliament, but the Minister for Defence has done everything he can since earlier this week to plead ignorance and stay away from this as far as he can. You would have thought, given the seriousness of this and the fact that army regulations have clearly been broken in the way in which this has happened, that the Minister for Defence might have taken some personal interest in it and done something about it. On the contrary! During this week one statement has been issued by the Minister for Defence's office, and it was put together in such a rush it is not even dated and there is not even a name on it. In fact it is attributed at the bottom to 'a spokesman for the Minister for Defence'. There is no name, no contact numbers, no nothing-the only thing to come out of the minister's office this week on this serious matter. He will not do an fire interview on radio. He will not talk to journalists, nor will anyone on his staff, and you have to ask yourself why. The only other statement that has come out is the one I mentioned yesterday that came from the Department of Defence. They have shoved it across to Russell and said to the senior people in the military, 'Get us out of this. Put out some press release but do not come near us because we do not want to know.' This is a government that is consciously involved in ensuring that this exercise goes ahead but does not want to accept any of the responsibility for it. Your fingerprints are all over it, and you will be held accountable for it. Â«(Time expired). Industrial Relations Native Title",17
21,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"O'Connor) (9.22 a.m.)Isn't it amazing how the Labor Party can rewrite history? I flew in aeroplanes piloted by the air force during the pilots' strike. Whenever I could get on one of those foreign planes they imported to the country overnight I listened to American accents, French accents, and you name it. How did all those pilots get into this country and work permits? They did not have to ring up the foreign affairs department; They rang up Peter Abels. He had a rubber stamp: 'Let them in.' You broke a strike with foreign workers. You broke a strike with the army and the military people, and you have got no excuse at all. 'Hypocrite' is your title. But thank you for giving the opportunity of drawing the attention of the House to the matters that are going on. This morning on the ABC news, a Mr Ed Wensing, apparently an expert in title, assured the people of Canberra that their titles are secure because the land was freehold before it was leasehold. I want Mr Wensing to ring up the people of Bremer Bay in my electorate and to tell them they are having a bad dream and that it is not happening, because these people in Bremer Bay got land under exactly the same terms but in fact they got a fee simple title. And the fact is-not the theory-that they are presently involved in the National Native Title Tribunal processes of mediation over that land. Let me admit that they are not going to lose that land; they just do not know whether they can build a house on it until some Aboriginal people tell them yes or no. In fact, it is also worthy of note that in the town of Exmouth, where people also live and have backyards, the land was previously owned by the Commonwealth in freehold. Of course, it was subleased to the American servicemen for their residences. When the Americans went back, the Commonwealth sold that land to the Western Australian government. It went back to the Crown, as we say, but there was a condition: the Commonwealth said, 'You have to sell these houses to individual people in freehold' and the state government did. Those blocks of land are now under native title claim registered by the National Native Title Tribunal. I want to read to you part of that application. It says: The application includes all land and waters the boundary of the application, excluding any with respect to which freehold title (other than Crown freehold)whatever that might bewas granted either prior to 1 January 1994which is a very significant date, of course; that is all to do with the Native Title Actand as future act validated by the Native Title Act. In other words, the claimants are saying, 'We don't want freehold, but we want to be able to claim all freehold granted since 1994 and all crown freehold.' Justice French has registered the title. I have just discovered that he has not bothered to tell the people of Exmouth, which I find outrageous. When we look at the amendment the Labor Party put up at the eleventh hour the other day, it is very interesting because it says: For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to subsection (2), it is expressly declared that native title is extinguished on land that is freehold land. Then we get to subsection 2, and it goes on to tell us that: The non-extinguishment principle applies to freehold land in the following cases . . . One of those cases is 2(b). It says: . . . where a grant of land registered as freehold title is made by the Crown in any capacity to the Crown, or to a statutory authority of the Crown, in any capacity ... I have the best of legal advice to tell me that that includes every state housing lot that has been on-sold to the tenant, because all those sales are done on the basis of a sort of lease purchase. The actual title transfers with the last payment, and the reality is that those last payments are well off. The land, of course, consequent to that suggestion, would be subject to native title claim now and when the title actually issued.",17
22,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT,What does that mean? They will not lose their land and you know that.,18
23,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"We have had all your assertions before. I confront you with the facts; I confront you with title deeds, not theory. I know; I have written down here what the High Court said. I also know that these people in Bremer Bay are not having a bad dream. They are in native title things within now. The excuses you have tried to give are land the very excuses that mean that every block of land, particularly granted in Tuggeranong, is subject to title. (Time expired) Waterfront: Defence Personnel",18
24,Mr MCMULLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Canberra) (9.27 a.m.)It is very important for those of us in the opposition to have this opportunity to establish clearly the government's involvement in this Dubai mercenary operation. We were significantly helped by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) pleading guilty on behalf of the government, and we are very grateful for that. It was the only coherent remark he made in his own contribution. I want to go to what we know and what is emerging. We know that the government created the political climate for'this to take place; the government created the legal framework for this to take place; the government conducted the test run for this to take place at Cairns. We know those three things. That is a matter of public knowledge. We now know that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) is ducking and diving to avoid having to comment upon the extent to which his staff were involved in this particular project. He has been in here, and he has the chance again today. We would stand aside to give him the call so that he could come in and explain the extent to which his staff have been involved in this operation. He has had several opportunities and several invitations. But he has gagged us every time we have tried to propose it. He has avoided answering the question every time, so we know that he is ducking and diving to avoid having to explain the extent of his involvement. We know that the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) keeps stumbling into explain a bit more about his involvement. When he thinks he is showing how little he is involved, he is showing how much. The shadow minister has outlined his involvement up until now, and what we know of it, very well. What did we also find? We found out, from the comments of the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and the extent to which the evidence is emerging, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) was actively involved. It is true that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a long standing practice of facilitating visas and passports for Australians going overseas, particularly in large groups. That is a good thing. However, it appears that the way it was conducted on this occasion was quite out of keeping with the norm. Certainly if it is true-as has been alleged, significantly, by those who have been involved-that people were advised to ring the minister's office if they had a problem then that is significantly beyond any of the normal arrangements that you would expect, even for a very senior business delegation. Now we have extra evidence emerging. People who claim to have been involved and appear to be well informed have the view that there were briefings and recruitment for this project conducted on the premises of Department of Defence organisations-on government property which is the responsibility of the Minister for Defence. There were agencies of the Department of Defence meeting therenot covertly. They opened the mess and invited the people in. They had a briefing, a big discussion about this project, and then the recruiters, the recruited and people from the defence forces involved in this project all had a drink together afterwards. The hand of the government is getting further and further involved in this. We know there is more, but we have to have better evidence before we come forward and make the assertion. We certainly have substantial confirmation that there are serious allegations still to emerge. Let us say there is nothing more. What is it that we have",19
25,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,What we want is more productivity on the waterfront.,19
26,Mr MCMULLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you very much, Plead guilty again! The member for Robertson should just get up and say, 'Yes, we think this is a good idea.' Then he should go to all the workers in his electorate and say, 'Yes, I think the idea that the government should use your taxes to organise people to come in and do your jobs is a good idea.' These people are going about their lawful employment. There is no strike on the waterfront. Nobody is breaking the law. They know that the government to whom they pay their taxes is using their money to organise people to come in and do their jobs. That is what they are entitled to have a grievance about. These people are not the enemy; they are law-abiding Australians who pay their taxes and carry out their responsibilities, and they have done so for a long time. They are entitled to have the support of their government, not the opposition of their government. They may have committed the sin of not voting for this government, but they pay their taxes to it, they are citizens of Australia and the government is responsible to them and should not conspire against them or use the resources of government against Australian working people. (Time expired) Waterfront: Defence Personnel Native Title",19
27,Mr BROUGH,ADJOURNMENT,"Longman) (9.32 a.m.)The member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) has just proved his total ignorance of the way the military works. Having spent 8Vz years in the Army, I know that it is not unusual for outside agencies to be invited into the mess to talk to soldiers, NCOs and officers. The fact that private companies wish to employ members of our Defence Force on the waterfront or in any other job just shows how good our defence forces are. Their commitment and discipline are exactly what Australia needs. You people show your hypocrisy and just how afraid you are of the so-called workers on the waterfront in Australia, who have such an appalling record. Let us get on to Wik. This is the second Saturday in 60 years on which this parliament has sat; we have a very important issue to deal with. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) got up and talked about the fact that this government cannot manage this issue. There is only one reason we are here today: in 1993 the Labor Keating government got it wrong. If they had got it right at that time, we now had land management which gave certainty, we would not be here. Your legislation was thrown out of the High Court because it was deficient.",20

30,Mr BROUGH,ADJOURNMENT,The member for Banks shows his ignorance yet again.,20
31,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"Upheld seven-nil, Mr Deputy Speaker, not thrown out.",20
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Do you want a warning? Do you want your marching orders?,20
33,Mr BROUGH,ADJOURNMENT,"He probably wants to be named so he can go home early. He has not had a really active or constructive part to play in this debate. All he has done is filibuster and show confected indignation. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this issue has been unbelievable. A piece of legislation in 1993 has had the Racial Discrimination Act placed against it b-cause Senator Harradine went to lunch. Who did he speak to over lunch? That is the issue we have to talk about. He came back from lunch and now the whole bill is being put against the RDA. The fact is that he had lunch with the former ALP leader in the Senate. The ALP got Wik wrong-that is an indisputable fact-just as they got the financial management of this country wrong and plunged us into $9 billion worth of deep debt, for which our children will continue to pay the price. The ALP also got unemployment wrong, they got interest rates wrong and they got small business wrong. Now they come in here on a Saturday morning, bleating because they want to get aircraft home, bleating because they want to go on their overseas holidays, when the fact is that this issue must be dealt with in the interests of Australia. I also want to raise the issue of the responsibility of the media. I am not accustomed to bringing newspapers in here, but this morning we see in the Canberra Times an article by Ross Peake about Wik talks which says there will be a double dissolution election on the issue of race. The Age leads with an article if headed 'Early race poll' by Laura Tingle, and the Sun-Herald has the headline 'Poll on race and tax'. There is one thing that I do not think the opposition and the government can dispute: this is about a rule book for land management in Australia. Those opposite laid down a rule book that everyone was to abide by but, unfortunately, even though they had the best interests of the nation in mind, they did not get it quite right. I am sure they did not get it quite right not because they wanted to confect the position we are in but because they simply did not understand the way the High Court would rule. I do not think many Australians did. The fact is that we are now trying to fix that error. We are trying to put a rule book in place which is fair to Aboriginals and to every other Australian. There are Aboriginal people in my electorate-the member for Banks would not understand this-who are trying to build community centres but who, because of this pathetic ruling in place now, because of this unworkable land title situation, have been unable to do so. We are trying to rectify that and create some certainty. Those opposite do not seem to appreciate that. If the media and the opposition want to debate this issue but do not want to see it dragged into the mire of race, which we have already seen this country pulled into over the last 12 months, I plead with them to stop making comments like 'race election' and talk about what this is about: certainty of land tenure. You do not have to agree with us on it. But talk about the issues and don't get this rubbish about race. (Time expired) Waterfront: Defence Personnel",20
34,Mr CREAN,ADJOURNMENT,"This is a government of division. It is a government that should have been about reconciliation on native title, but it has now turned it into a race election issue. It is also dividing the community by attacking workers' rights and conditions. The previous speaker, the member for Longman (Mr Brough), talked about frontpage headlines of newspapers. Look at one of yesterday's: 'The coalition backs troops on the wharf'. How un-Australian is it to bring in people to reduce workers' conditions, to train them in the Middle East as mercenaries, to do it undercover and to have the government come in here and try to pretend it has no knowledge of it? Mr Kilfoyle, one of the people involved in organising this, is on the record as saying, 'We are recruiting these mercenaries for an overseas consortium to train people overseas for jobs that we have here in Australia.' The previous speaker, who is scurrying out, challenged us by saying, 'Why shouldn't they be able to work?' . Mr Brough interJecting",21
35,Mr CREAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Well, come back in and listen to this, because you challenged why they could not go and work for companies. I ask members how this sounds in terms of the instructions that were issued for these people: When you return from our Middle East training exercise you will be required to conduct three weeks of instructional training of a second element at a site in New South Wales. This will entail you being locked in for the period of training, which will be conducted over three shifts, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You will be accommodated on stretchers in a hangar-type building. All food will be provided and refreshments made available. The foregoing is considered necessary to obviate regular movement in and out of the site of large groups of people, which could draw attention from the locals. This is a clandestine operation. This is recruiting people who are currently serving officers in the Army, 29 of whom the chief of the Army has said are in Dubai at the moment. If, as you say, this is open and above board, why do they have to hide them in a hangar? Why into do they have to train them in Dubai? Why do they have to take their meals in so people cannot see them? Is this what you mean by working conditions in Australia? Is this the sort of Australia you want to see, where exArmy people are pitted against workers in a desperate bid by the government to prove its strength on the waterfront? We have here complicity on the part of the government; they will not come into the House and own up. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has distanced himself. The Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) has fallen in; he has admitted that ex-Army people have been involved. We have the situation where the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, who has been bagged around the country because they reckon he is too soft on the IR Act, now has to show his strength. He has to shore up those numbers on the front bench in his desperate bid for the leadership against the other Peter-PI and P2; this is part of the competition between themand so he wants to engineer disruption on the waterfront. This is a minister who could not even win the Cairns dispute, and now he has to resort to the mercenaries; now he has to resort to thugs being brought in on the waterfront. If the government says it does not know about this, will it condemn it? It has failed both counts to do so in question time over the last couple of days. Minister Reith is coming back into the House; I challenge him to actually get up and speak in this debate. He says he knows nothing, but the question is what did his staff know? What did his office know? How were they able to get to Mr Wells so quickly? How were they able to get him to put out a series of so-called denials? But they did not get to Mr Kilfoyle. Mr Wells said that they were being used for some overseas operation. Mr Kilfoyle let the cat out of the bag-he said they were going to be used in Australia. This is un-Australian. This should be condemned by this government. The government has got an obligation to come into this place and own up to what it has been involved in. We cannot condone a community that will continue to be divided. The government wants to divide on race; it wants to divide on working conditions. (Time expired). Debate interrupted. NA",21

40,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"It is worth quoting what Michael Warby said about journalists; I note there are some in the gallery now, and they should bear this in mind: Journalists are not the moral guardians of either public debate or the community and should not act as such: indeed they can only act as moral guardians by betraying their role as reporters of the community to itself. They should frame that and put it on their wall because of some of the headlines we have seen today, and also some of the debate that we have seen over the last few weeks has been conducted by journalists, many of whom are wet behind the ears and have never seen anything about life at all, who are trying to tell the people of Australia that this is about race. It is not about race, and by doing this we are doing a disservice to the Australian people. We are doing a disservice to the Aborigines in Australia, because the more we talk about race and the more it is promoted by journalists who do not know what they are talking about the greater the disservice to the people of Australia, and I mean the Aboriginal people as well as part of that. But I want to talk about a matter in my electorate involving a constituent, a blind gentleman, who came to see me some months ago. His name is Mr Lewington and he came to see me about a gold pass. Mr Lewington lives close to the border of the Brisbane City Council and the Pine Rivers Shire Council but he does live in Pine Rivers Shire. Because of Mr Lewington's infirmity-he is, as I said, an elderly blind gentlemen-he asked me if I could do anything about getting him a gold pass so that he could travel on Brisbane City Council buses. He travels on Brisbane City Council buses into the city regularly. He does, in fact, carry out community and charity work in the city. His approach was a genuine one and I made some inquiries of the Pine Rivers Shire Council, which referred me to the Brisbane City Council. As a result, I wrote to the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Councillor Jim Soorley, on 4 September 1997. I explained the situation to Councillor Soorley. I said to him that although Mr Lewington does not reside in the Brisbane City Council area, and thereby technically is ineligible for a gold pass, he does use the council's buses regularly since they are near his home. I asked if there was anything that Mr Soorley could do or if there were any suggestions Mr Soorley could provide to enable a gold pass to be issued to Mr Lewington. This is the letter I got back from the senior civic official in Australia, the mayor of the largest council in Australia: Dear Mr Smith, I am writing in response to your query regarding the provisions of Gold Passes for travel on buses. Please be advised that I am unable to be of assistance on this occasion. As you would be aware under the Howard/Fischer Federal Government, funding to local government has been slashed. That is the first deliberate misrepresentation. The funding has not been slashed; it has been increased. He continues: I am sure that when Cheryl Kernot becomes the member for Dickson we will see far greater advocacy for the funding of the many services that are being devolved to the local government level. He finishes: I trust you will continue to 'enjoy it while you have got it'. That is the response from the senior civic official in Australia. That is the sort of rubbish we get-at the expense of an elderly blind gentleman who came to see me in good faith. I approached the Lord Mayor of Brisbane in good faith. That sort of stuff demonstrates the total ignorance of that man. He is out of touch with the community and is using the infirmity of an elderly blind gentleman who came and approached me in good faith about a gold pass. I am sure the ratepayers in Brisbane will hear about this and will remember that at the next election. Question resolved in the negative.

41,Mr HOWARD,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT," Mr Speaker, I suggest it would suit the convenience of the House to consider the amendments in two groups: firstly those amendments which the government proposes be disagreed to, which are listed on schedule 1, the white sheet circulated to honourable members; and then the amendments which the government proposes be agreed to, which are listed on schedule 2, the green sheet.

In the time that is available, I want to briefly retrace the history of this legislation. I want to remind the Australian parliament and the Australia people of the good faith in which the government has conducted itself from the very beginning on this issue. I want to remind the Australian people that when the Wik decision was brought down in December of last year it was very apparent that legislation was needed to remove much of the uncertainty that had been created. From the very beginning it was obvious to the government, and it was obvious to any fair-minded observer of this whole area of legislation, that a native title approach and a native title act based upon an assumption found to be erroneous by the judgment of the High Comt of Australia in the Wik case could only exist on vacant crown land-a belief that was affirmed by the former Prime Minister and by the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). It was, in fact, the basis of the belief under which the community operated from the passage of the Native Title Act until the bringing down of the Wik decision. It was therefore very obvious that the situatiop could not be left unattended to and the government set out on a process of consultation, a process of negotiation, a prcÂ·;;ess of listening in good faith to the d!fferent views of varying sections of the community. Over a period of some four or five months those negotiations ensued. Those negotiations involved numerous meetings with representatives of the farming communities of Australia and representatives of the mining industry, and on two occasions the premiers and chief ministers of the states and territories of Australia, and consultation with leaders of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community of Australia. At all stages, my government has sought to negotiate in good faith with all sections of the Australian community. The legislation that was finally presented to the parliament was not an ambit claim. The legislation that was presented to the Australian parliament was an honest compromise based on the results of those discussions. The proposition with which 27; 28we have been assailed ever since the legislation was presented is that in some way that was the beginning of the process, that in some way, 'Let us start with your bill. We will chop it away and we will water it down and then why don't you behave like reasonable men and women and accept a compromise.' The reality is that to have invited us to have compromised on the legislation would have been asking us to compromise on a position that already represented a compromise on an agreement between the varying views of different parties. Anybody who has honestly followed the path of this debate will know the very considerable and vigorous debate inside the government parties themselves and between me and a number of the non-Labor premiers of Australia regarding the substance of this legislation. To suggest that this bill was in any wayan ambit claim for the nonindigenous interests of Australia is to completely distort and to dishonestly label what the government has endeavoured to do. At no stage has the government sought to tilt the balance unreasonably against any section of the Australian community. What the government has sought to do, what the government has done and what the government will maintain over the next few months is that this bill represents a fair, decent and honest balance in avery, very difficult situation. Those who argue otherwise are ignoring both the substance of the debate and are also ignoring a very balanced and long range view in respect of a very difficult and complicated issue. I would remind the parliament, as I would remind the Australian people over the weeks and months ahead whenever this matter is discussed, that we inherited from the Keating government an absolutely unworkable Native Title Act. We inherited from the Keating government a Native Title Act that was based on a completely erroneous assertion and affirmation. And that particular circumstance has, in fact, been confirmed by none other than the Leader of the Opposition. Here we have this ridiculous situation that we are being criticised by the opposition for trying to fix up something. that he himself admits was put through on an erroneous assumption! The whole assumption of the Keating government's native title legislation was that you could only have a native title claim on vacant crown land, yet he now admits that that was wrong. To suggest that the legislation does not, in the wake of that, require substantial amendment is to defy all reason and to defy all logic. But that, of course, is what the Labor Party throughout this debate have attempted to do. They have branded as scaremongering tactics propositions of the government which in a few days time they were to embrace. Remember the great reaction of the Leader of the Opposition concerning freehold? He said it was scaremongering of us to confirm that freehold extinguished native title, and yet a week later he proposes an amendment to that effect. Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition's party left us with this native title mess and it has fallen to us to attend to it and to repair The bill as amended by the Senate in a number of very important respects prevents the implementation of the substance of the 10-point plan. I made it very clear on behalf of the government that we would accept any amendments that promoted the goals of our legislation, we would accept any amendments on the periphery of the legislation, but under no circumstances would we accept amendments which went to the heart and substance of the key elements of the legislation. In three or four important respects the legislation which the Senate has chosen to amend is completely unacceptable to my government and the government will be rejecting those amendments when the vote takes place in the House this morning. The first of the Senate amendments that the government rejects is the proposal concerning the threshold test. The second of the proposals concerns the statutory negotiation process for mining and development projects. The current NTA negotiation procedures are unworkable, resulting in delays and in some cases indefinite deferral of many development projects all over Australia. The third of the proposals which we reject is the proposal to subject the Native Title Act to the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act.",44

43,Mr HOWARD,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"It is very interesting that the members of the Labor Party interject on that proposition because a committee dominated by their own members in 1993 rejected the same move in relation to the existing Native Title Act. What the Senate will do by the injection of this particular provision will be to create a double jeopardy situation in relation to every area of land that is contested so far as native title is concerned. You want a situation where 79 per cent of the land mass of Australia in theory could involve native title claims where you could, in fact, place people in double jeopardy.",46
44,Mr MELHAM,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"Rubbish, and you know it.",46
45,Mr HOWARD,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"The member for Banks says it is rubbish, but your own members four years ago supported what I am saying. That is what happened four years ago and you it. know it. You know that the Senate committee agreed with us four years ago. Finally, Mr Speaker, the Senate has rejected the six-year sunset clause. Those amendments are, in the eyes of the government, completely unacceptable and I make it plain that we will vote against them. We regard the amendments as having substantially altered the thrust and the intent of the legislation that we put forward. It will create greater uncertainty, it will cause more delay, it will promote more litigation, it will not advance the cause of reconciliation and, by interfering with and delaying the government's legislation, the Labor Party is telling the Australian people they want the Wik debate to go on. The Australian people will know that the government wants to bring it to an honourable conclusion and it has been completely frustrated in those attempts by the behaviour of the Labor Party and by the behaviour of the Democrats and by the behaviour of Senator Harradine. Mr Speaker, let us make it very plain to all of the Australian people who over the weeks and months ahead will continue to take a keen interest in this debate that on the one hand you have the Liberal and National parties who inherited the problem-they did not create it, because we pointed out many of the flaws in the legislation when it was passed in 1993. We inherited the problem, we did not create it, and just as you gave us a budget deficit that we were not responsible for and then set about trying to stop us from repairing that budget deficit, the same applies in relation toÂ· this legislation. We were given a problem. The Native Title Act was unworkable from the start and at every point since our election in March 1996 the Labor Party has set out to prevent us producing a fair and honourable solution to an extremely difficult problem. Mr Crean-Rubbish!",46
46,Mr SPEAKER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,I warn the member for Hotham.,47
47,Mr HOWARD,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"We made it very plain to the pastoral community of Australia that we were not going to accede to their ambit claim. Their ambit claim was to provide for blanket extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases. Anybody who imagines that the legislation that we have presented represents a full satisfaction of the desires and aspirations of the pastoral community of Australia knows how completely wrong that proposition is. Nor does our legislation give complete and full satisfaction to the mining industry of Australia. It certainly does not give full satisfaction to any other section of the Australian community. That is exactly what the situation should be in terms of an honourable, decent and worthy compromise. In a compromise you do not surrender to one interest, you try and strike fair balance. That is what my government has endeavoured to do. We have not surrendered to all the blandishments of the indigenous community; we have not surrendered to the blandishments of the farmers; and we have not surrendered to the blandishments of the mining industry. We have tried to provide a framework and a pathway which will guarantee certainty, which will deliver workability, which strikes a fair and decent balance in an extraordinarily difficult situation. The Labor Party is saying to the Australian people that it wants this debate to go on forever. The Labor Party is saying to the Australian people, 'Never mind the damage done to the process of reconciliation; never mind the damage done to the mining industry; never mind the damage done to the pastoral industry; never mind the delay; never mind the endless litigation and the endless court cases. As far as we are concerned, this debate can go on indefinitely.' That may suit the convenience of the Labor Party. It may believe that there is some short-term electoral advantage in it, but it is clearly against the national interest. At the end of the day, it is the national interest that must be asserted over a sectional or a political interest. Any of those on the front-bench of the Labor Party who think that the Australian people will not wake up to the fact that you are putting your political interest ahead of the national interest are very much mistaken. Your political interest is not the national interest. The national interest demands that a fair and decent compromise be accepted. The only fair and decent compromise on offer has been the government's amending legislation. The only fair and decent compromise on offer has been the balance that we have struck in our legislation. It has been unacceptably amended in the areas that I have indicated in the previous part of my speech. Those amendments strike at the very heart of the basis of the government's amending bill, and that is why those amendments are quite unacceptable to the government.",47
48,Mr BEAZLEY,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"The opposition opposes the amenpment to the Senate amenda ments put forward by the government. We are dealing here with another Howard government mess. We are dealing with the product of malevolence and incompetence. There is only one thing worse than dealing with malevolence from a government, and that is dealing with malevolence and incompetence. The government had 90 per cent of its bill passed through the Senate. Let us remember what we are dealing with here-the government had 90 per cent of its bill passed through the Senate. It had six of its 10 points in full and it had the other four points in part. Though we disagree with many aspects of it, the Labor Party was prepared to support the government in the Senate. In the vote yesterday in the Senate we were prepared to support it. What you had out of that were very big winners. It is always the case that when you are weak in the face of pressure from your supporters, you inevitably end up shooting your supporters in the foot. Let me go through this. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said to his backbenchers probably the worse thing I have heard a Prime Minister say on a matter of public policy of great importance to the Australian people. He said that he had a covenant with the pastoralists and the miners. He does not have a covenant with the pastoralists and the miners-he has a covenant with the Australian people. The Australian people are the big losers, but there are other big losers. Let me go through the big losers as a result of the Prime Minister's decision. Firstly, what does this 90 per cent victory for the government in the Senate, which we have accepted, mean? It means that thousands of invalidly issued titles and licences between 1994 and 1996 are validated. This is what your rejection means, that those 1994 to 1996 titles have not been validated. They have not been validated. That was all through yesterday. Let me point this out to you: the Prime Minister accused us of wanting an election on this, when every person in this country knows what is in his heart on this-this he feels is his way back; this is how he gets the National Party back on board with him. The only person wanting it is him. But let us assume that the processes go through as the Prime Minister wants those processes to go through. Let us assume that that happens. It is at least 12 to 15 months away from a conclusion. It is at least 12 to 15 months from a conclusion, if everything goes right for the Prime Minister. So those with invalidly issued title, which, courtesy of yourselves, the world is now alert to, have 12 to 15 months to wait for a solution-courtesy of you. That is the first point that needs understanding. What I want to do, despite the best efforts of various members of the Liberal Party who are lawyers, who are going around stirring up trouble on this, is to urge the Aboriginal people of Australia, having been alerted to the fact that there is invalidly issued title, take advantage of that by injuncting the processes around the country; to leave it alone and wait for a fair settlement of this. I urge them to do that, because that is an opportunity now available to them, courtesy of this government. The second big losers-when you act with malevolence you always shoot your supporters in the foot-are the pastoralists. What have the pastoralists got out of this? They have got world best practice statutory title out of this, reinforcing the High Court's decision that ensures that pastoral title prevails over potentially conflicting native title for the fullest possible range of pastoral activities. That is what the pastoralists got, that is what you rejected. And who are the third set of losers? They are the miners and the Aboriginals on the threshold tests-that spaghetti can of claims, those cross claims, that multiplicity of claims, all of which would have been knocked out by the threshold test that was passed by the Senate last night. You have turned that aside for the next 15 months, you geniuses. You have turned it aside so we are not able to get a conclusion. We are not able to get a conclusion to these issues now in Western Australia where we have got a mass of conflicting claims which would have been resolved by that. Now why would these three things have been resolved? They would have been resolved by one of the things you lost, and to which you most object. They would have been resolved by one thing the Senate passed last night, which you do not like-the retention of a decision by the High Court that effectively extended a right to negotiate in relation to pastoral leases, where there is the possibility of native title. Now what does that actually mean? Do the pastoralists lose anything by that? Of course they do not; they do not have it now. All that could possibly happen, of course, if there is a successful right to negotiate, is that the infrastructure for pastoralists in that area might actually improve. But what do they gain? Because of that being in there, there is a chance-we think it is just a chance, but there is a chance-that not to this bill might conform to the just terms requirements and the beneficial requirements associated under our constitution. It might just conform with them in a way that validates the whole bill. Let me tell you that your own advice-and you know it-is that without those beneficial elements in it, it certainly obviates the Racial Discrimination Act. Further to that, it probably obviates the just terms requirements that are in the constitution. You geniuses! You have given the pastoralists, and we have supported you in the end, world best practice title on their leases and then you have ripped it off them. Instead of it going through, you have ripped it off them, by not putting in place that beneficial element of it that gave the Aboriginals the right to negotiate. When you wish malevolence on people and you happen to be idiots, when you have malevolence and you also happen to be fools, you always at the end of the day end up shooting yourselves in the foot. And your baying and throwing here today merely proves the point.",47
49,Unknown,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,Government members interjecting,49
50,Mr SPEAKER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,Order!,49
51,Mr BEAZLEY,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"Don't worry about it, Mr Speaker. I am dealing with a pack of school children; I am educating them. You must expect that in those circumstances there will be a bit of a reaction. What you have done by rejecting that Senate compromise is to destroy their situation. Actually, if you were malevolent and cunning, what you would have done is this: you would have accepted this and then you would have moved the parts you do not like in a second bill next year. There is plenty of time between now and 29 October to get yourselves your double dissolution issue that you so desperately require. What you would have got, if you were not so stupid, is the invalid title validated. You would have got the pastoralists position protected. That is what you would have got. You would have got a threshold test which we would have got on with and which would have resolved some problems. But, no, a brilliant Howard government mess in the making is what we have here. What this cries out for is a bit of statesmanIs ship. What this cries out for is you sitting down and developing a bit of common sense, putting the three parties together, getting somebody like Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke into hold the ring with the three parties as far as this is concerned, and get an agreement from them. That is what you might well have done. But, stupidly, you chose not to do that. So let me tell you what will happen when we win the next election. I will sit down with the Aboriginal people, the pastoralists and the miners and get a solution. They will not leave until there is one. That is what we will be doing, because we will need to be doing it. If you ever got your bill through, the' first thing that would happen is what your own legal advisers have told you would happen-and you do not even dare tell your backbench this; you clothe yourselves in secrecy even with your own backbench. Your own legal advisers have told you that your bill, in its pure form, will be subject to successful challenge. And where are we after all of that? Where we are after all of that in 15 months time, in 18 months time, is right back to the drawing board. You had a small window of opportunity here and you slammed it shut-a small window of opportunity for the pastoralists, a small window of opportunity for the miners and a small window of opportunity for the Aboriginal people. What the Prime Minister has got up here today is to do is make replete his misleading possessions. Firstly, he got up here and said that somehow or other the previous government had attempted to wipe out native title on pastoral leases. Yes, we assumed it had gone; yes we did, as we have pointed out on the basis of those judgements. But the High Court changed that in the deliberations that they reached and therefore we are in a situation where we have to handle it sensibly again. That is the first point. The second point is he has repeated his canard here. On the one hand he said there is a threat to threshold land-he has been saying that all this week-then, in the same breath, he gets up and says 79 per cent of the country is claimable. What is the other 21 per cent? it freehold? A revelation to the other side, it is freehold! What we have here is an issue that can be dealt with at two levels. The first is the area of practicality. You have here a solution for those with potentially invalid title, for the pastoralists in a difficult situation and for the miners and the Aboriginals who need the sort of threshold test that gets rid of that spaghetti can of claims. And you have spumed it. You have turned that aside. The second thing that you have done here today by trying to bring this into the electoral context, as you are, is that you have put our reputation internationally and domestically on the line. That is the second thing that you have done. You are absolutely right, Prime Minister, about one thing: when the next election comes around it will not simply be about Wik, there is no doubt about that. It will be about, and we will be running on, the insecurity that you have introduced to the lives of workers with your industrial relations changes and the failure of your industry policy. It will be about your treachery to the elderly people of this country and the things that you have done with nursing homes. It will be about your attacks on the living conditions of Australians who need access to child care and who need decent health care, which you are reducing by your slice of the salami. It will be dealing with all those issues, don't you worry about that. We will be going through all of them. Evidently it will be all about your efforts to shift the burden of tax to middle income Australians through goods and services taxes. There will be plenty of that. But there will be a view out there that what the issue is about is the way we handle race relations in this country. That will be the judgment, that will be the way in which this country and that election outcome are judged. Let me tell you that it does put an extra incentive into us to win that election. Only a vote for Labor will keep the reputation of this country as a decent, tolerant society with a proper vision about where this nation is headed. In the end, on that reputation rests our security and prosperity and the historical judgment on this generation of Australian people.",49
52,Mr TIM FISCHER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"Once again, on a Saturday four years on, the House is considering native title and the coalition government's Wik amendment bill which has been substantially amended, weakened and made unworkable by the Senate in the course of its deliberations over the last fortnight. You, the opposition, had years to fix this matter. You did not. The sooner the people have a say and sway on this the better. Let me make a threshold point, and I do so'with all sincerity: the many wrongs visited upon indigenous people over the decades cannot be righted by one piece of legislation, but the wrongs can actually be worsened by one badly amended piece of legislation by the Labor Party and others seeking to put on the statute books a patchy set of proposals which do not even represent a fair interpretation of the postscript signed by the Wik majority four judges at the end of their judgment given in December 1996. I want to remind the House of this. There was a postscript of that judgment. It was signed by four judges-no matter that the Chief Justice was in a minority of the three. In that postscript the High Court said that all things considered, all things taken into account, the rights of the pastoralists-be they Aboriginal or otherwise-prevail over the native title' claimants. And it is within that envelope that the government seeks to provide a fair process, a set of proposals, a lO-point plan which stacks up for jobs, for security, for certainty and for native title, across a large part of mainland Australia. Let me deal with some of the common myths and present some of the facts necessary as part of this debate. Firstly, on the matter of freehold, High Court judges have said several times that in their view freehold is-to quote the member-in effect, 'safe'. But they said it as part of an obiter dicta, not in relation to a specific judgment of the High Court on the question. I join the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in believing that I feel freehold has extinguished native title. It is for that reason that we put amendments into the legislation to confirm that freehold extinguished native title. But I also have a bit of paper, which lam reminded of, which says the High Court said a couple of years ago that leasehold, if properly issued, extinguished native title-before they went on to the Wik judgment to overturn that particular thing. So you can understand that there is a good deal of caution on this point across Australia. I do not make too much of it, but I do highlight to the House that there is one way to sort this aspect out: to put through our amendments which absolutely confirm freehold. Secondly, on the matter of leasehold, sadly many in capital cities think there is huge expanse of non-utilised pastoral leasehold out there blocking Aboriginal people from proper access to those parts of Australia which they regard as being of spiritual attachment. I recognise that they have deep-seated beliefs in that regard. That is not the truth. Justice Kirby got point so wrong in his part of the jUdgment when he said, 'This leasehold business, you cannot compare it to the densely populated parts closer to Sydney and Melbourne with regard to the utilisation of the land.' He did not realise that there are leasehOlds with fence to fence farming; there are leaseholds with multimillion dollar irrigation developments in the electorate of Gwydir and elsewhere; there are leaseholds of all types in this country-a huge diversity of leaseholds. It is in that regard that we seek to strike the right balance. We are, in fact, simply confirming with schedule 4 a very, very cautious set of exclusive possession leases. You decided to oppose schedule 4. You decided to oppose the confirmation of Queensland GHPLs and the like. We seek to confirm them. Indeed, there are many in the National Party and the Liberal Party who actually feel that our schedule 4 list was too cautious. I must say that I believe we got the balance right-it is a cautious list, but it is a fair list which relates to exclusive possession. Thirdly, on the matter of help for people who are, by any definition, not in an adequate circumstance in regard to housing, education and health, a great deal more needs to be done. The budget provides for $1.4 billion recurrent expenditure which is going to be increased by this government. We will spend $400 million more in our first few years in government than Labor did in its last four years of government on housing, education and health. It is totally unsatisfactory-I think all members would probably agree with this-to have the horrific living conditions, the lack of adequate water, the lack of adequate sewerage, the lack of adequate housing and educational opportunity for far too many people throughout country Australia, including this Aboriginal people. We are doing something about this. We are providing under the budget some $1.6 billion on indigenous specific programs to rectify that. And, what is more, we have to do a whole lot better as a country at all levels of governance-local, state and federal-to deliver the services mandated and to make these settlements in isolated areas a this whole lot better, more livable-a healthier circumstance for all the people who might choose to live and work there. I am reminded of Fred Chaney's statement that all you want in this regard is for the various levels of government to deliver the services adequately which they are mandated to deliver. It is about time that was achieved, and I feel very strongly about that. Fourthly, we have the indigenous land fund. I just want to ask the House: are we taking away the indigenous land fund? We are not. We are providing $1.3 billion by 2004. This was initiated by youMr O'Keefe-You voted against it.",50
53,Mr TIM FISCHER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"Yes, I voted against it. I am now in effect voting for it because I accept that there is a circumstance attaching to this indigenous land fund. It is in fact a deal which Noel Pearson signed up for which the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, attested to on the ABC AM program. It says we will accept this indigenous land fund, in essence as a deal with regard to leasehold for evermore-no matter that deal has now been breached. Let me explain to the public that that deal will allow an annual draw down of $45 million a year in perpetuity for Aboriginal people to purchase and manage land. If they want to focus their efforts, they could buy the entire western division of New South Wales over a period of decades, and not so many. They could buy the entire pastoral leasehold blocks of South Australia in the electorate of Grey; in fact, it is up to them. We are going to provide $45 million a year with regard to this. I want to say to the House that the coalition legislation stacks up. I want to say that this will become more apparent as people focus on the real outcomes. I found a refreshing attitude in the city of churches, Adelaide, yesterday for a couple of functions, and then in Albury for a national trucking show later on yesterday. When you have a chance to explain people realise what the government is on about. I just want to make two additional points. I notice that the European Parliamentarian Hugh Kerr is writing to the papers again today. I would just remind him that I in fact did refer to some EU member countries when I said that I will listen to the Europeans when the Sami people, who have ll{) native title rights in Finland, Sweden or Norway-they have no rights whatsoever--can make some decent claims, and when the gypsies can make some decent claims for three-quarters of France, Germany, the Czech Republic or Slovakia or even Hungary. I stand by that statement. I notice that the ambassador of the European Union sent me a letter yesterday with a statement by the chairman of the European Parliamentary delegation disassociating the delegation from Hugh Kerr's statement and saying that Hugh Kerr's views did not represent the view of the delegation. So, I will have a forthright debate with the Europeans. But I want to close on another matter. Let me reveal to the House that there is a second letter from Father Peter Wales of Charleville, an Anglican priest. He refers toa couple who live 40 kilometres west of Charleville. Mr Laurie Ferguson-Make him a bishop.",51
54,Mr TIM FISCHER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"No, I suspect he is now going to remain at Charleville for a very long time. I do not see him getting to bishop's court for a while. He refers to this couple, 40 kilometres west of Charleville, who, 10 years ago, bought land which they thought was the equivalent of freehold, and paid a price on that expectation. What is their circumstance today? Now just listen to this. They do not have one claim; they have four claims against their property. Each of those claims is claiming exclusive possession to the exclusion of all other Aborigines and all other people. Only our approach will provide the sorting out of those conflicting claims. Further, each of these four claims also demands exclusive rights to all water resources, flora, fauna and underground deposits. Mr Speaker, as Father Peter Wales points out, this is not a question of giving pastoralists rights at the expense of Aboriginals. It is a question of recognising that, however regrettable the past, sometimes what has been done cannot be undone. People in the city are happy to accept the extinguishment of native title on their properties. Why does it suddenly become racist, a denial of human rights, when people in the country who already live in conditions of hardship and uncertainty ask for the same thing? That sums up a great deal. There is a great deal in Father Peter Wales's letter which I think is worthy of consideration by the House. The four claimants, the four conflicting Aboriginal claims on this particular property west of Charleville, are all being government funded. The defence of the poor couple involved has not yet attracted one dollar of government funding. That is another element that the Prime Minister has undertaken to rectify in absolute terms in the commitments he gave at Longreach. If you want to dwell on leadership, I will tell you where I saw leadership. I was responsible in part for putting the idea forward to go to Longreach. There the Prime Minister stood some very tough ground, with colleagues of all persuasions showing a good deal of underwhelming enthusiasm, I can recall. We stood up in that circumstance and delivered the lO-point plan and a message. Last week there was a very interesting article which described how the Leader of the Opposition had been rolled over on the matter of Wik and native title. Cheryl Kemot and Daryl Melham came through the doors-powerful Daryl. Daryl, I did not realise",52
55,Mr HOWARD,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"Look, he is smiling.",52
56,Mr TIM FISCHER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"No wonder he has a smug smile. This man, the Leader of the Opposition, started out on this debate on the side of a sensible solution, a sensible prodevelopment solution, but you have ended up going exactly the opposite way. I stand in full support of a lO-point plan that will deliver for future generations of Australians, which will deliver an effective land title system and not a defective land title system. I am prepared to take that message to each and every part of Australia. Perhaps the sooner the people have sway on this rather than the Senate the better for all our sakes.",52
57,Mr GARETH EVANS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"Holt-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (10.33 a.m.)There are some defining moments in the life of any government or parliament, and this is one of them. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the government had a choice in approaching this debate, and it was a very stark choice. They could do what they have obviously now chosen to do and reject the Senate amendments, to start the double dissolution clock ticking, to put this legislation back a 12to IS-month limbo, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) so eloquently put it-that 12to IS-month parliamentary and electoral and parliamentary-again processputting in grave doubt and at grave risk and prejudice the interests of those with whom this government claims to have a covenant. They could, even more alarmingly and even more critically, through this choice, have in fact made the choice of setting the country on a divisive and confrontational path, of setting loose those forces of fear and prejudice on one side, of hurt and humiliation on the other side, that are an absolutely inevitable part of any election which makes native title, for which read 'race', a central theme. The other choice-and it was a very real choice that the Prime Minister and the government had-was to not go down that path but rather to stop and take a very deep breath, to think about the implications of what they were doing, to recognise that the bill put before this parliament was simply never going to be approved in the form in which it was introduced because it was too unfair, it was too indecent and it was simply too legally suspect. It was a choice which would have accepted the reality of the amendments now decided by the Senate and the absolute unlikelihood of the Senate adopting any more accommodating path. It could have acknowledged that the government has in fact retained the substance of most of the points that it sought to achieve with its plan. It could have acknowledged that what remains is workable and on balance in fact improves the 1993 legislation. It is a course that could have recognised, accepted and acknowledged all these things and then moved on, and spared the nation the cost and trauma of a race based election. This is the course that a responsible Prime Minister and a genuine national leader would have taken. But that is not the course that this Prime Minister and this government is taking because the Prime Minister is not a responsible Prime Minister or a genuine national leader. He cannot bring himself to do what he should do because he is a weak leader, bound and gagged by his National Party coalition into partner and by the more extreme elements of his own front-bench. He is determined now to make the country pay the price for that weakness. The opposition has absolutely no doubt about what choice should and could have been made. We should have accepted, we should now accept, the Senate's amendments and move on. We do not say that with any spirit of enthusiasm or delight with the product of the Senate debate. This is not the bill that I wanted or the opposition wanted. This is not the bill that we worked day and night for weeks to achieve. Let me indicate some of things that we did not get in this debate, because this is going to be an issue that needs to be understood in the days and weeks ahead. We did not get on the validation issue the gazettal and compensation regime that would have put beyondÂ·doubt the capacity of people to be compensated for the validation that is about to occur. We did not get the complete removal of the so-called confirmation of extinguishment provisions that was necessary to preserve fairness and decency and legal effectiveness in that area. We did not get the alternative pastoral coexistence regime that we argued so vigorously for and that would have delivered fairness to pastoralists as well as a bit of decency to the indigenous people whose interests are so much at prejudice by this. We did not get the provisions to ensure the improvement and the effective application of heritage legislation in this Native Title Act. We did not get a right to negotiate on the intertidal zone, and we did not get the removal of the sunset provision on compensation. We did not get the changes we were asking for and we thought were eminently reasonable to the oversight arrangements for the representative bodies, getting a better balance between the role of the minister, who has an inevitable conflict of interest in these matters, and ATSIC, which is an entirely appropriate and responsible party to be exercising that oversight. We did not get the proposals we argued for for a fast-tracking mechanism to enable a little bit of decency and a little balance back in the legislation so far as indigenous people were concerned. We did not get guaranteed access by indigenous people to the National Native Title Tribunal, the only one whose reliability and integrity can be absolutely relied upon-as well as its competence-when it comes to the administration of these matters. We did not get, furthermore, a whole raft of procedural and machinery changes to improve not only the fairness but also the practical workability of the legislation. These are all the things that the opposition, with the help sometimes, indeed most often, of the Democrats and the Greens, tried to get but did not get and which would have done much to make the legislation better than it is. By contrast, let me tell you what we did get and what the government objects to us getting, and what this current debate is now about. The first thing we got, and we are delighted and proud that we got it, was the application of the Racial Discrimination Act to all the provisions of this bill. But let me tell you, to put the debate in its proper context and avoid the canards and the disgraceful statements that are going to be made about this, it was a provision with a qualification. It was a provision which said the Racial Discrimination Act applies with the exception of its application to the validation provisions. We had put in that qualification because we knew there would be a degree of legal uncertainty if the Racial Discrimination Act were to be applied to those particularly difficult transitional provisions, about which we had a quite a deal of heartache in deciding to approve them but did so in the interests of the very pastoralists that the leader of the opposition spoke about, whose interests have now been ignored. So let us have no more canards or distortions about the effect of the RDA. It is there to state and to make a point of principle. It is there to give a safety net to the indigenous people in relation to some of the more outrageous potential applications of some of the more outrageous parts of the bill, but it will not work to generate more uncertainty about some of the central features of the bill on bit of which this government has hung its hat and says it is so concerned. We also got some modification of the reach of the government's extinguishment provisions. We got some retention, of course, of the mining regime in so far as the right to negotiate in relation to exploration is concerned, something that a great many sectors of the mining industry, not least the petroleum miners and the diamond miners, were very anxious to get. We, of course, won the very big issue of principle and practicality which is the retention of the right to negotiate on pastoral leases. We did get some improvements in the access regime in the interim period. We did get a small claims compensation process. We did get the sunset clause knocked off, as it should have been, and we did get some improvements in the threshold test. Let me say something about that threshold test because that is another issue in which the government is clearly going to go to the campaign barriers with a heap of misrepresentations and mistruths. The truth of the matter is that we did not add to the threshold some loose, vague and open-ended 'spiritual association' test of the kind that might be satisfied' in some loose, vague and very uncertain way as is now being said by the scuttlebutt merchants around the place: that if some Aunty Nellie in Redfern says she has an annual dream about Arnhem Land that will be enough to give her a native title claim. That is absolutely nonsense. What we put in the legislation is very explicit language of the common law test as advanced in the Mabo case by Justice Brennan, where he said: Where a clan or group has continued to acknowledge the laws and (so far as practicable) observe the customs based on the traditions of that clan or group in question, whereby their traditional tion with the land has been substantially maintained. So you have got to have a maintenance of custom, a maintenance of tradition, in a way that enables someone to say that the traditional connection with the land has been maintained-an absolutely fair addition to the repertoire. And when you put together all those things, when you put together all those issues, you find that we lost more than two-thirds of the 359 amendments that we moved. Of the 36 major issues that were separately debated, we had wins of one kind or another, most of them pretty small, on 10 of those 36 points; we lost on the other 26. So that should be considered if you are making any kind of calculation of who was the winner and who was the loser. . The whole point of the government's position is that they are not rejecting the Senate amendments because they have to reject them; they are rejecting the Senate amendments because they want to. Whichever way you calculate it, the government has had a win in this legislation in the Senate as to the overwhelming content of the bill that it put before the parliament. On six of the 10 points-Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and lO-it had absolutely clear-cut wins. On another four of them-5, 6, 7 and 9-the victory was more equivocal; the results were mixed. This is not only a bill the government can live with but a bill with which the government should be very happy. But it is not happy. And why is it not happy? For two reasons: first, because it does not satisfy the crazies and the rednecks in its own coalition and, secondly, because it does not satisfy the Prime Minister's own deep and irreversible conviction that political capital is to be made over a fight about race. That is what he is on about. I sometimes tell a story which is relevant to this about a conversation I onceÂ· had with a former Secretary of State, James Baker. I was in Washington at the time that he was seeking the Republican nomination, before the last presidential election, and I saw a photograph in the paper of him shaking hands with Ollie connecNorth-Iran Contragate Ollie North-and I rang him up and I said, 'Jim, I know you have got to win the support of the fundamentalist crazies, I know that is part of winning a Republican nomination, but don't you think, mate, you might have gone too far in this instance?' After a little pause on the other end of the telephone, he drawled, 'Well, Gareth, in politics you sometimes just have to rise above principle.' It is one thing to rise above principle with a tacky political handshake; it is another thing to do it by taking a course of wrong headed cynical opportunism calculated to put under stress the whole soul and spirit and honour of this nation. That is what the Prime Minister is doing. Let us make no mistake: this is the inevitable consequence of an election triggered and fought on racial issues. There are demons being deliberately unleashed here by the other side of politics. The tragedy is that it is happening deliberately and it is directed personally by the Prime Minister, by the leader of this country. I am not thinking, I am not saying, that the Prime Minister personally hates or despises black people. I do not think that is true either of the great majority of the coalition parties. But what I do think, and what I do say, is that on this issue the Prime Minister just does not get it. He just does not understand the intensity of the feeling that people have on this issue. He does not understand the resonance of this issue, how it is in a completely different class from issues about industrial relations or tax or about unfair dismissals or even about health and education. He does not seem to understand the demons of hurt and humiliation and fear and prejudice that are being unleashed by this particular proposal and by the course which he is adopting. And he does not ever seem to understand, as the Leader of the Opposition said, how this kind of response on this kind of issue simply does resonate around the world at the expense of Australia's credibility and reputation. The truth of the matter is that the Prime Minister has a long, long history of showing that he does not get it-a long, long history of utter insensitivity on these issues. It started in his public life, I think, back in 1975 when he opposed the enactment of the Racial Discrimination Act. Throughout the 1980s it continued with his overt hostility, his intense hostility, to any application of a sanctions regime against the ugly apartheid regime in South Africa. In 1988 it continued with the anti-Asian immigration debate which he triggered and nurtured. In 1993 it should be remembered-I think it has been largely forgotten-that it was him, the Prime Minister, John Howard, who led the party room charge against the Mabo legislation and who persuaded the coalition party room to adopt that process of utter non-cooperation with the then government in the passing of this legislation which did produce some of the problems that we are confronted with in the practical operation of this legislation. And since 1996, since the election, even before the Native Title Bill, we had, by his inaction and by his weasel words in relation to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), the Prime Minister making this a far bigger problem than it would otherwise have been for this country, internally and externally. We had the Prime Minister single-handedly destroying the painstaking reconciliation process to which so many decent Australians have been committing themselves heart and soul for so long. And, most grotesquely, and most unforgivably, we have had the refusal by this man to apologise to the stolen children for what this country did to them. This is a man who may not mean to be malicious and insensitive and divisive and destructive but who just cannot help himself, it seems, on these issues. The reason he cannot help himself is that on race he just doesn't get it. The Prime Minister on this matter has made a horribly wrong choice and by his actions he has set this whole country on a horribly wrong course. I make this pledge, as the Leader of the Opposition has done: it is a course which we in the opposition will resist while there is a breath of life in our political body.",53
58,Mr WILLIAMS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"The Native Title Amendment Bill, which I first introduced into this House in September 1997, is designed to bring certainty, workability and fairness back into Australia's system of land management. As Justice Kirby said in the Wik case, 'Certainty and predictability have conventionally been accorded high importance' in land law. In this area 'the avoidance of unnecessary doubt and confusion is a proper objective' in the interests of all Australians. The government's bill incorporates the 10point plan of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The 10-point plan, while not endorsed without qualification by any of the various stakeholders, offers benefits to them all. It is a package. It is a package for all Australians. The removal of any part effectively means that there is no package. It seriously compromises the government's objective of offering a just and certain solution to a complex social, legal and political issue. Native title is an issue that demands a proper measured and national response. Justice Kirby also said in the Wik case: The outcome of that case not only left the position of the actual parties uncertain. It also left unclear the rights of all Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians in respect of land covered by pastoral and other leasehold land. This was left to be elucidated on a case by case basis unless earlier resolved by valid legislation. The government believes that a case by case solution to this issue is not an option. It would take years to resolve. In the past, Justice French, the President of. the National Native Title Tribunal, has questioned whether the nation could afford such a process. The solution is a matter for legislation by this parliament. The government's Native Title Amendment Bill does provide a just and constitutionally valid legislative solution. What has emerged from the Senate is not a solution for anybody. It is certainly not a solution for all Australians. The government was elected with a mandate to overcome serious problems associated with the workability of the Native Title Act. These problems have emerged in its almost four years of operation. Many flowed directly from three major High Court decisions post Mabo. Those decisions were, of course, in the Brandy case, the Waanyi case and the Wik case. Brandy cast doubt on the constitutional validity of the current system from making and determining native title and compensation claIms. Waanyi emasculated the registration test, and Wik undermined a core promise of the Native Title Act; that is, that native title could not coexist on leasehold land. The government bill addressed the Brandy problem by restructuring the claims process. Ironically, the Senate amendments reintroduce a potential Brandy problem in relation to the small claims process for compensation claims. The decision in Waanyi has effectively meant that the registrar has had no option but to accept any claim that was fairly arguable. Statements made by the opposition parties in the Senate highlight that there are many arguable propositions relating to the existence, nature and scope of native title still to be by creative legal minds. Under the existing registration test, extravagant and overlapping claims are being registered. Claimants are then able to exercise the significant benefits of the statutory right to negotiate. The claims are clogging the tribunal's mediation and future act processes. As the minister with responsibility for the tribunal and the Federal Court, I am concerned at the increasing resources that are having to be committed to these bodies. There are about 700 claims. All parties recognise that the registration test operates as the only effective filter on claims. Indigenous leaders have publicly stated that only those with a real prospect of success should be registered. The bar must be set at a level that screens out illegitimate claims. Claims that are vexatious or an abuse of process discredit the system. Unfortunately, the amendments agreed to by the Senate offer little improvement to the post-Waanyi position. The Senate test allows a claim to be registered where the registrar is satisfied that an assertion of traditional connection with the relevant land can prima facie be made out. This would not filter out unsustainable claims. The present unsatisfactory situation will continue. The High Court's Wik decision, which was handed down almost 12 months ago, more than doubled the amount of land claimable under the current act. The various conditions applicable to dealings in land that affect native title must be complied with if acts over that land are clearly to be valid. The difficulties associated with this are obvious. No-one yet knows where native title exists, who holds it or what it amounts to in any case. As a title sourced in traditional laws and customs, it will vary from place to place. In the Wik case, Justice Toohey acknowledged that it may spread across the spectrum from exclusive possession to a right to enter land for ceremonial purposes. So no-one can be really sure whether a particular act will affect native title. The act is predicated on the assumption that native title could not coexist with leasehold and other crown tenures. The freehold test is inappropriate for coexisting tenures. In such put cases, native title rights cannot amount to exclusive possession, yet native title holders are given statutory rights equivalent to those of a freeholder. The best example of the inappropriateness of the freehold test is in relation to the right to negotiate. This is a statutory right not enjoyed by other land holders. The opposition has r-peatedly said that it is not a veto. But when it is enjoyed by groups who have not had to satisfy a meaningful registration test, imd where there are multiple groups, it operates as a real deterrent to investment. It is costly and time consuming. This right has the potential to apply to mining, including exploration activity throughout Australia. The government had workable solutions, which allowed states and territories to establish regimes for dealing with mining on pastoral land, but the Senate rejected those sensible proposals and left us with the full-blown right to negotiate over huge areas of Australia. There are other fundamental problems with the Senate amendments. Let me draw attention to some of them. The right to negotiate is still applied to compulsory acquisitions for the provision of government type infrastructure. The Senate also rejected the government's proposal to remove the right to negotiate in towns and cities. The combined result of these is that the important infrastructure work in built-up areas will be delayed while the right to negotiate is applied to native title claimants. It is a right significantly greater than the rights enjoyed by adjacent freeholders and leaseholders. This is an anomaly that the government tried to address by ensuring that all parties enjoyed equal rights. The Native Title Act has since 1993 provided that nothing in the act affects the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. Under Senate amendments, the act would, in general terms, be made subject to the Racial Discrimination Act. This introduces new wide-ranging uncertainty. The Labor dominated Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee concluded in 1993 that the formula would be a recipe for legal uncertainty. That committee recommended that it not be adopted. Nothing has changed in the meantime. It is an abdication by the Senate of its responsibility to provide clear legislative guidance for those who have to work under Commonwealth legislation. The act provides conditions and requirements for acts which affect native title. A failure to comply with the conditions means that an act is invalid. Equally, though, the act has provided that compliance with the Native Title Act conditions guarantees validity. This would not be the case under the Senate formula. The Senate amendment would mean that acts which have satisfied every Native Title Act condition may be open to challenge, despite the fact that a Commonwealth law declares that they are valid. The Senate formulation would encourage challenges; it would encourage litigation in relation to virtually every provision of the Native Title Act. The lesson is get the legislation right, make it certain and do not leave it to the courts. As Attorney-General, I am very conscious of the need for this parliament to pass legislation that is clear and effective in its operation. The parliament has a duty to get it right. The Senate amendments to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 which have removed essential elements of the lO-point plan fail this objective. Were the bill to be passed in its amended form, we would be breaching our compact to provide a balanced, just and certain solution to all those who have a stake in this significant issue. This cannot be acceptable to indigenous Australians, to miners, to pastoralists or indeed to any current or future generation. The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 as returned to this House does incorporate many aspects of the original la-point plan. This is clear from the large number of Senate amendments which the government is prepared to accept. However, as I have already made clear, the government has developed a wholly integrated legislative package to resolve the uncertainties raised by recent High Court decisions and the unworkability of the existing Native Title Act. It is not an easy decision which the government makes here today, but governments are often put in a position of coming up with a fair, reasoned and balanced response to difficult problems. The government's bill offered the certainty required. The bill as amended by the Senate, as I have already indicated, is no longer in a form that can provide certainty. This House must lay the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 as passed by the Senate aside.",56
59,Mr MELHAM,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"On 23 December 1996 Justice Gummow in the High Court of Australia delivered the judgment in the Wik case on behalf of the court. At that time. I was present in court. I was the only member of the national parliament or any state or territory parliament that was present in the court when that judgment was delivered. The 237-page judgment cost $20. I paid for it and read it before I did a press conference at 3 p.m. On that day I described that judgment as a win-win judgment-a win for all parties; a win for all Australians. One has only to go to the postscript of Justice Toohey at page 83 to see that he says: If inconsistency is held to exist between the rights and interests conferred by native title and the rights conferred under the statutory grants, those rights and interests must yield to that extent to the of the grantees. In other words, every title in this country validly issued is safe. It prevails over native title. Native title yields in all those instances. We know that freehold is safe because we have had a number of High Court judgments, including the Western Australian challenge to our Native Title Act. Our Native Title Act of 1993, apart from one section, was upheld seven-nil by the High Court. The basis of our Native Title Act in 1993 was respect for the Racial Discrimination Act. The basis on which we brought the legislation into the parliament was twofold. We regarded it as a special measure under section 8(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act, and so we were utilising the external affairs power. We also regarded it as a beneficial power under the race power that the act as a whole was beneficial for indigenous Australians but, at the same time, gave certainty to every other title in this country. At the same time, it guaranteed no veto over development. It was a balanced act. It was an act that was a compromise. What we were doing was codifying, setting up an alternative to the common law so that every title was secure. The High Court found in Western Australia and the Commonwealth that our act was a beneficial act, and so our act was consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. What it also found was that it did not need to go to the special measures section. But there are parts of that judgment that show that the particular provisions of section 7(1) that we put in in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act were vague, and that the intent of the parliament was not all that clear. That is contained in Western Australia v. Commonwealth at page 483 to 484, and that is why we have moved the amendment that was successfully accepted by the Senate-that this act is intended to be read and construed subject to the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. This government says that this legislation, when amended, will still be beneficial for indigenous Australians, so it should meet that test. But we on this side know it does not meet that test and so does the Prime Minister right (Mr Howard). But that was his covenant to the Australian people. That was his mandate-that his amendments to the Native Title Act would respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. That was the question I asked him on 6 May last year, and he repeated ad nauseam to miners, to pastoralists and to the community that his amendments would respect the Racial Discrimination Act. At the first test he squibbed it; his amendments do not respect the Racial Discrimination Act, and he knows it. His amendments open up bucketfuls of extinguishment for the states and territoriesthat is what this act is. This act, unamended is bucketfuls of extinguishment, whereas the Racial Discrimination Act protects us all. It protects indigenous Australians, it protects new Australians. This government's advice relies merely on the race power. Its advice relies on the fact that you can legislate to the detriment of the Aboriginal race. That is an admission that this amendment bill is a racist bill. When the Prime Minister says he is going to bring the pendulum back to the middle that means he is taking away indigenous rights. That means his amendment bill is discriminatory against Aboriginal people. That is why they will not accept the override of the Racial Discrimination Act. But if their amended bill is truly beneficial, then it will survive a challenge, as did our bill in the High Court which was upheld, seven-nil, as being, overall, beneficial to indigenous people. But they are not prepared to do it. Why is the Racial Discrimination Act so important? I will tell you why, Mr SPEAKER because it protects indigenous people against the states and territories. Our obligation under the 1967 referendum-the power we were given, the purpose and intent of that referendum, the intentionÂ· of the 90 per cent of people who voted for that referendum change-was to give this parliament the power to legislate to protect Aboriginal people; to legislate for their benefit. On 1 January this year the cabinet papers will be released under the Archives Act, under the 30-year rule, and those cabinet papers will show that the submissions to the cabinet were that this is a beneficial change to the constitution. Nowhere, in the constitutional debate in the parliament, in the House of Representatives, in the Senate, in the yes case that was put to the people, in what was argued before the people and in what was endorsed before the people, was there one word that this constitutional change would be used against indigenous Australians. That is what is so pernicious as this Prime Minister knows. We can go to the Hansards of April 1975 through to June. Who was it that had carriage of the Racial Discrimination Bill on behalf of the opposition? It was the then member for Bennelong. How inappropriate is the seat he holds, named after an Aboriginal person, and he is here shredding their rights. What does the High Court say in Western Australia v. Commonwealth at page 439? This is why the Racial Discrimination Act provision, from the opposition's point of view, is not negotiable. This is what it says: But the Racial Discrimination Act is superimposed on the common law and it enhances the enjoyment of those human rights (earlier mentioned) which affect native title so that Aboriginal holders are secure in the possession and enjoyment of native title to the same extent as the holders of other forms of title are secure in the possession and enjoyment of those titles. What does Justice Brennan say as far as that is concerned in his judgment in the Wik decision? He says: ... the power of State and Territory legislatures is now confined by the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 ... a State or Territory law made or executive act done since that Act came into force cannot effect an extinguishment of native title law or executive act would not effect the extinguishment of a title acquired otherwise than as native title. Native title is protected by the Racial Discrimination Act. That is why the one vote in the Senate that really counted was the vote on this amendment. Fortunately, Senator Harradine was eventually persuaded, because native title can be wiped out without the protection of the Racial Discrimination Act. Mr Koowarta had his title done over by Bjelke-Petersen in 1982, but the High Court upheld the Racial Discrimination Act in 1982. Mabo No. I-discriminatory legislation again-was introduced by a conservative state government and overturned in the High Court in 1988. It was the Racial Discrimination Act that protected native title. That was what the High Court said in Mabo and in Wik, and that is why this government will not accept this amendment. That is not negotiable as far as the opposition is concerned. As far as the right to negotiate is concerned, you talk about certainty and workability. Shred that and you will have a bill that will be successfully challenged in the High Court because the right to negotiate has time frames which are defined. We only have the power to legislate for the benefit of indigenous people. We do not have the power to legislate for the benefit of pastoralists. What are pastoralists giving up in this amendment bill? What are miners giving up? You talk about compromise, but the miners and pastoralists and farmers do not give up one single thing in your amendment bill. You give pastoralists what they thought they had, and the taxpayer funds it. You are acquiring t1:Â·; property rights of indigenous Australians at the expense of taxpayers and of indigenous Australians. And Justice MCHugh tells you in Waanyi that the community will quickly lose confidence in the courts of justice if the perception arises that the courts are ready to ignore the legal rights of individuals whenever intervening governments or litigants urge that public or private convenience requires such rights to be bypassed. (Time expired)",58
60,Mr ANDREN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"For if the much of the past two days I have watched the Senate debating in committee the 700 or 800 amendments moved and approved or rejected on this Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. I was amazed at the goodwill that permeated the 55 hours or thereabouts of that debate and the passionate but calm and considere,d contributions from all senators. The Senate can teach this place a lesson about many of its ways, particularly in regard to the spirit and goodwill of its debate. Its very representational make-up is particularly significant when considering the many hours of research, consultation and debate that individual sen ators put into this particular bill. I would suggest they put many more hours in than most of us are required to put into such an iss\-e, given the way that the voting will eventually tum out. Apart from the significant absence of Aboriginal representation in this parliament, the Senate does cover the broad cross-section of Australia: city and country, Liberal, Labor, National, Democrat, Green and Independent. That fact alone means that the Senate's final amendment bill before this House today is probably as close as we will ever get to consensus on this issue. To reject this amended bill and support the motion before this House this morning is to court division, hatred and a dysfunctional society for years ahead. The native title amendment bill in its original 10-point plan form was a denial of native title. It would have provided a recognition of a Clayton's native title only. The government says its key losses in these Senate amendments are the right to negotiate sections which have been restored to this bill. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) says the right to negotiate is akin to a native veto because, he says, Wik said the rights of pastoralists would prevail so there is no need for negotiation. I think I understand that was the thrust of the argument. The rights of pastoralists will prevail. There are. is nothing in this amended bill that says otherwise, so the right to negotiate remains just that: the right to negotiate. Aborigines do not want freehold but access, with the right to negotiate. That is not a veto. Ambit claims such as those alluded to by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) will be thrown out, but, sure as night follows day, we are going to have a plethora of ambit claims if we do not do something about it now. Without the right to negotiate you cannot have native title-except in name only. The Prime Minister speaks of his covenant with the miner and the pastoralist. What about the third part of that troika, the Aborigine? Where is the covenant with him? The amendment providing for the overriding guidance of the Racial Discrimination Act is the key to this amended bill. As Senator Harradine late in the day so rightly recognised, the RDA will be a sobering backdrop to any consultation and negotiation or any future act arising from this bill and will obviate rather than encourage litigation. Without the overriding monitoring of the Racial Discrimination Act, miners would in fact face more uncertainty and delay, through legal proceedings like the injunctions sought by native title claimants seeking to protect their rights. While mentioning mining, I was interested to hear on the adjournment debate last night the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) praisingrightly in many respects-the economic performance of the government. I think he said, 'The country is awash with good figures.' One of those figures was a 27 per cent-correct me if I am wrong; I wrote my speech this morning, not expecting there would be an opportunity for an Independent speaker-increase in capital expenditure in the mining industry. So much for the uncertainty over native title. As I have suggested, I have real problems with the validation of pre-existing rights based acts, as do the Democrats and the Greens. It neatly meets the political imperatives of the ALP and the coalition in Queensland, but it is a moral sell-out.",60
61,Mr TUCKEY,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,That shows what a dope you,61
62,Mr ANDREN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"Your member used the figures. Its woolly language of offer, commitment, arrangement and undertaking are terms so shot full of holes as to be legally meaningless-I almost expected to see 'nudge, nudge, wink, wink' in there. This is one area that will have lawyers rubbing their hands in anticipation. The Queensland National Party is driving this agenda. Their disgraceful scaremongering of recent days, rightfully repudiated by the Cattlemens Union and the United Graziers Association, will set back reconciliation as much as the inflammatory comments of some other members. I know a significant number on the government benches fear the consequences of the government's stance on this issue, which is driven by the political imperatives of the Queensland bush. The National Farmers Federation says these amendments have washed away their line in the sand with guilt. They have got native title restricted to the high water mark. Do they want terra nullius restored? Some in the Aboriginal community have graciously accepted these amendments, saying that they are about as close to true native. title rights as they will ever achieve. Compensation is not part of their concept. Native title is much more than any commercial gain. That is where we, as 'whities', have completely missed the plot. Last weekend I opened the new Hill End History Hill Tourist Mine, literally dug by hand from beneath the ground by Malcolm Drinkwater and his wife Daphne. They have built an interactive mining museum, a poppet head, steam stampers and a restaurant. With their own hands they have moved huge logs into position. It is a marvellous effort. Daphne's father, Bill, a Koori elder, was there, along with many friends. Both Eastwood and Mudgee Rotary Clubs, city and country, awarded a special recognition to the Drinkwaters. I gave Daphne two flags, one Australian, one Aboriginal. The latter was to show that Hill End will always be Wiradjuri country. Both flags can fly side by side and both claims to that land, one commercial with a deep emotional tie of 25 years standing, the other spiritual of many thousands of years standing, can coexist. Much mention was made in the Senate debate of the compensation provisions in this bill and the $1 billion land fund. But talking about compensation for native title shows how badly we have missed the point. If compensation was the aim of native title claims, then the supporters of native title would be asking for compensation alone. That demonstrably is not the case. This amended bill is far from perfect. Senator Boswell said, 'We have not come up with a satisfactory conclusion for anyone.' Senator Harradine said, 'Did anyone believe we would?' But it does contain enough for me to support it. It provides the framework for the coexistence of title identified in the Wik judgment. Sure, there will be litigation and test cases such as that proposed to test the Cobb, M. R. western division leases in my own state, but this is an inevitable consequence of establishing the validity of native title claims. This generation will have to be patient for a while as we establish these principles, but it can be done with goodwill and a tlUly conciliatory acceptance that genuine native title is the key to restoring our acceptance of the validity of the Aboriginal culture and recognising that without that title or belonging our indigenous fellow Australians are condemned to tiptoe around the fringes of this society as outcasts in a predominantly white society. I implore the Prime Minister not to push this bill any harder. Senator Minchin admitted that seven out of 10 points got up. Seventy per cent is a good mark, in my mind. I believe that this bill in its amended form will be very acceptable to the majority of my electorate and to most fair-minded Australians. If you try to push the pendulum any further on the alleged grounds of seeking more certainty, there is one thing that is certain: you will fuel the flames of bigotry and hatred in this country because you have misunderstood the very nature of native title-that it poses no risk at all to anyone who truly understands what a spiritual connection to the land really is. I saw that spiritual link in the tear-filled eyes of Daphne Drinkwater in Hill End last Saturday. I urge members to reject this motion and support the amended bill as presented to this House. Question put: That the amendments be disagreed to. The House divided. [11.20 a.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE)' Ayes 82 Noes 43 Majority 39 NA Abbott, A. J. Anderson, J. D. Andrew, J. N.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Essendon Airport (Question No. 1728) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 15 May 1997: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1044 (Hansard, 14 May 1997, page 3557), concerning the ability of a 747 aircraft to land safely at Essendon Airport, is it a fact that federal aviation regulations specify a landing length for a 747 - IOOB and 200B aircraft of (a) 1881m, weighted at 255 826kg, (b) 1942m, weighted at 265 352kg and (c) 2 109m, weighted at 285 763kg. (2) Do the figures in part (1) relate to dry weather and are they likely to be longer in wet weather conditions. (3) Are the runways at Essendon airport 1585m and 1921m. (4) If so, how can a 747 aircraft land at don Airport safely. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has provided the following advice: (1) The landing lengths quoted by the Honourable Member appear to be the 'landing field lengths' of the aircraft with 30Â° flap. The US Department of Transport (DOT) Specifications define the 'landing field length' as 1.67 times the landing distance found from tests of the aircraft. For a B747-200B aircraft as quoted by the Honourable Member, of 285 763kg, with 30Â° flap, the 'landing distance' would be 1163m. (2) The figures in part (1) of the question do relate to dry runways. In most operations the Members NA Mr John Forsyth (Chair) Capt John Faulkner Mr Norman Correy Mr Graham Maguire Mr David Lowy Mr Kevin Gale NA landing distance required for a jet-engined aircraft on a wet runway is 15% longer than on a dry runway. For the B747-200B aircraft, of 285 763kg, with 30Â° flap, the landing distance would be 1337m. (3) Yes. (4) The Honourable Member is aware that 747 aircraft operations are not permitted at Essendon. However, as advised in the former Minister's previous response, if such an aircraft inadvertently carried out a landing, there is sufficient runway length to effect a landing. Department of Transport and Regional Development: Boards, Councils, Committees and Advisory Bodies (Question No. 1944) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister for Essen- Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 24 June 1997: (1) What boards, councils, committees, and advisory bodies fall within the Minister's ministerial responsibilities. (2) For each body referred to in part (1), (a) who are the members and (b) when does the term of each appointee expire. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2)(a) and (b) The following boards, councils, committees, and advisory bodies fall within my ministerial responsibilities. The list does not include Commonwealth/State bodies, industry/community consultative bodies and international bodies to which I may appoint representatives.

(2) For each body referred to in part (1), (a) are the members and (b) when does the term of each appointee expire. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Please see the answer to Question No. 1936, Hansard 22 September 1997 (page 8066). Plan Safe Inquiry Report (Question No. 2018)  Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: Further to the statement to the House (Hansard, 5 December 1996, page 7869) concerning the recommendations of the Planesafe report, (a) how many special integrated audits of small passenger carrying operators in both the charter and low capacity regular public transport airline sectors have been conducted, (b) what have been the specific results in each audit carried out and (c) what unannounced surveillance of charter operators has been carried out and what have been the findings of the surveillance in each case. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) 12 special integrated audits of small passenger carrying operators and their maintenance Appointment Expires organisations were conducted in calendar year 1996. This calendar year, four such audits have been conducted to date. (b) A summary of the overall results of the 12 special integrated audits was published in the Safety Systems Assessment of Passenger Carrying Operations Report. A copy of the report has been forwarded to the honourable member. (c) The only type of inspection CASA carried out without giving notice to the operator is ""ramp who check"". There were 98 ramp checks carried out on domestic charter operators in the period 5 December 1996--26 June 1997. Information on the findings for each of these is not readily available. Public Asset Sales: Taxation (Question No. 2227) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: (1) Has the Government altered depreciation arrangements applicable to taxation on public asset sales; if so, what will be the impact of the decision on Australian Taxation Office revenue in 1997-98. (2) When will the new taxation regime be introduced. (3) Will he make exceptions to the new taxation regime for State governments which have already given notice of their intention to privatise State owned assets. (4) Will the new taxation regime make future private sector investment in public infrastructure easier. Mr Costello-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) On 4 August 1997 the Government announced it would legislate to only allow the purchasers of exempt entities, or of assets owned by exempt entities, to claim depreciation based on the higher of notional written down value and a pre-existing audited book value recorded in the exempt entity's audited annual accounts. The changes are revenue protection measures by the Commonwealth, and were required to maintain the forward estimates of company tax revenue at their existing level. (2) The legislation will be introduced at the earliest opportunity and will apply to contracts entered into from 4 August 1997. (3) The Government is aware that some State governments have given notice of their intention to privatise State owned assets. These new arrangements will apply equally to all contracts entered into from 4 August 1997 without exception, and therefore will not discriminate between State governments in any way. (4) In making the announcement the Government has recognised the need to provide certainty, ease of administration and consistency of treatment in respect of exempt entity assets that become depreciable for taxation purposes. In this sense the new regime will make future public sector investment easier. However the announced changes are not intended to influence the attractiveness of private sector investment in public infrastructure. They are revenue protection measures. (Question No. 2229) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: Period Electronic Returns (a) 1993-94 94% issued within 14 days (b) 1994-95 95% issued within 14 days (c) 1995-96 96% issued within 14 days (3) The following table shows the average time Moonee Ponds Tax Office: Period Electronic Returns 1 July '97-26 Oct '97 98% issued within 14 days (4) In the period 1 July to 26 October 1997, the ATO finalised 81 % of taxpayer error amendments errors within 8 weeks. The ATO is perfonning within its stated performance standard. If a delay was to occur, the ATO would take the necessary steps to ensure the (1) What is the average time taken by the Australian Taxation Office to process 1996-97 tax returns for individuals. (2) What was the average time taken to process tax returns for individuals in (a) 1993-94, (b) 199495 and (c) 1995-96. (3) What is the average time taken for processing tax returns for individuals at the Moonee Ponds, Vic., taxation office. (4) What is the average waiting time for taxpayers who require amendments to their taxation returns and what are the reasons for the delay. (5) How many staff will be made redundant at the Moonee Ponds taxation office in the next 12 months. (6) What impact will staff redundancies at Moonee Ponds have on waiting times for taxpayers who require amendments to their returns. Mr Costello-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) In the period 1 July 1997 to 26 October 1997, the Australian Taxation Office (A TO) issued 99% Treasury of electronically lodged returns within 14 days and 99% of paper returns within 56 days. (2) The average time taken to process tax returns for individuals is shown in the following table. Paper Returns 97% issued within 56 days 93% issued within 56 days 91 % issued within 56 days taken for processing individual tax returns in the Paper Returns 99% issued within 56 days taxpayer was informed about the delay and a reply date will be negotiated with the taxpayer, in compliance with the Taxpayer Charter. (5) The redundancy process in the region is not yet finalised and actual numbers for Moonee Ponds have not yet been determined. (6) The ATO expects to continue to process any future amendments that are lodged at the Moonee Ponds Office within the service standards provided in the Taxpayers' Charter. Customs: Importation of Drugs (Question No. 2242) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: What percentage of, and how many, containers entering Australia are searched for narcotic drugs. Mr Truss-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: All cargo imported into Australia is subject to Customs controls. Customs does not randomly search cargo. Customs does not search containers per se, but rather consignments to individual importers. Each consignment is reported and screened for community protection risk. Those consignments which are identified as a high risk during the screening process are then subject to a physical search. During 1996, all 1 003 886 sea consignments were screened by Customs either electronically or manually to determine the level of risk. Of these, 8382 were identified by Customs as representing a risk in terms of narcotics, other prohibited goods, and potential revenue evasion. Customs is often judged by the number of containers, and/or the percentage of consignments which are physically searched. In reality, ALL consignments are screened and the examinations conducted are directed at high risk consignments using a range of detection equipment such as xray, particle analysers and drug detector dogs. Australian Made Campaigns (Question No. 2248) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: (1) Further to my question No. 2211 (Hansard, 20 October 1997, page 9292), has it taken Purchasing Australia more than a year to produce its draft code of practice on what constitutes an Australian made product; if so, why. (2) Is the draft code widely available; if not, (a) why not and (b) how many copies had been printed by 22 September 1997. (3) Does the draft code make reference to the manner in which the Australian made campaign will be marketed; if not, why not. (4) How many times did he meet with Australian made licensees or their representatives between 2 March 1996 and 22 September 1997. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The former Department of Administrative Services did not have responsibility for the development of the Code of Practice but did cooperate with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) in its development. (2) The draft code is not widely available. (a) The Code of Practice is still in draft form, with final detail still awaiting the resolution of wider country of origin labelling issues. (b) There are 15 members of the Working Group and each has received a copy of the Code of Practice. While the draft code is not a public document, I understand that it is available on request from ACCI. (3) The draft Code of Practice does not specify the manner in which the logo campaign will be conducted. This is an implementation detail which will be determined by the body established to manage new arrangements for the logo. (4) I do not have access to the former Minister's records, so therefore I can not provide you with an answer to this question. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: Wetland Areas (Question No. 2252) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: Further to the answer to question No. 575 (Hansard, 7 November 1996, page 6911) concerning the incidence of bird strikes at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, how many bird strikes were reported to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation during 1996. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 101 bird strikes were reported to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) during 1996. Of these occurrences, five resulted in minor damage to aircraft. The incidence is much lower than in 1995, when 278 bird strikes were reported to BASI. The Federal Airports Corporation has been taking measures as part of its Bird Hazard Management Program to reduce the risk of bird damage to aircraft. The program includes measures to discourage birds from staying on airport land and measures to identify and remove or control sources of attraction to birds. Australian Made Logo (Question No. 2270) Mrs West asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: (1) How many businesses have continued to use the Australian made logo since the demise of the Advance Australia Foundation. (2) How many products bear the logo. (3) Will the logo be maintained; if so, when will new contractual conditions come into force. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable Member's question is as follows: (1) I am advised that 2,830 companies were licensees at the time the Advance Australia Foundation went into liquidation in July 1996. The liquidators, KPMG Chartered Accountants, and the former Department of Administrative Services have both written to each of these licensees and advised them that they may continue to use the Australian Made logo. It is up to individual licensees to whether or not they continue to use the logo. (2) I am advised that, according to the records of the Advance Australia Foundation, there were over 10,000 products eligible to display the logo. (3) It is the Government's intention to introduce new arrangements for the Australian Made logo and these are expected soon after resolution of the wider country of origin labelling issues. Essendon Airport: Advertising Revenue (Question No. 2291) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 29 September 1997: (1) What proportion of Essendon Airport revenue in 1995-96 was earned from advertising billboards positioned at the western end of the airport. (2) What tenure do the advertising billboards have at the airport. (3) Does the Federal Airports Corporation have plans to secure additional advertising billboards at Essendon Airport prior to its privatisation. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has advised that the information sought cannot be provided as it is Commercial-in-Confidence between itself and the concessionaire. This is especially so now that Essendon Airport is part of the phase 2 sales process and the requirements of due diligence prevent the FAC from disclosing such information. Customs: Direct Inspection Responsibilities (Question No. 2307) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 1 October 1997: How many staff of the Australian Customs Service with direct inspection responsibilities were employed on December (a) 1996, (b) 1995, (c) 1994 and (d) 1993. Mr Truss-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Customs Service's Border Management Division (Border Operations Branch and Passenger Processing Branch) has overall responsibility for balancing the facilitation of legitimate movement of people,Â· goods, vessels and aircraft decide with the detection and deterrence of unlawful activity at the border. . Border Operations Branch officers identify cargo and mail for inspection including, where relevant, physical examination. The processes involved can includescreening manifest information against intelligence holdings and risk indicators, development of targets, review of documentation, checks on parties to the transaction, and physical search aided by Drug Detector Dogs and technologies such as Ionscan and X-ray. Passenger Processing Branch officers undertake the processing of passengers at Australia's international airports. The processes involved in establishing risk at international airports include: examination of travel and associated documentations, interview with drug team officers, use of Drug Detector Dogs and other detection equipment, and baggage examination The functions undertaken by officers in both these branches cover a range of activities performed in teams and it is not practical to identify specific staff having a ""direct"" inspection responsibility. The table below sets out staff employed nationally in Customs and Border Management Division as at 31 December of each of the years 1993 to 1996 are as follows: Staff Numbers at 31 December Year 1993 1994 1995 1996 The above table is at a particular point in time in the Australian Customs Service. A better indication over a five year period commencing in 1993/94.

Mr Williams-The Minister for Justice has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The following information is provided by State and Territory Buyback Coordinators. All jurisdictions have advised that the figures are estimated costs only at this stage and that final costs will not be known for some time due to ongoing action. For example, jurisdictions are still processing licence applications for Category C and D firearms, many will continue to run information or publicity activities until the end of the year, and all have only recently begun administering loss of business compensation claims by dealers.

(c) $320,323 (d) $1,110,373 (e) $82,953 Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: Aircraft Take Offs (Question No. 2353) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 October 1997: (1) What is the basis upon which runway 25 at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is used for westerly take offs. (2) During what periods of the day are easterly take offs programmed. (3) Are westerly take offs precluded from runway 25 by the level of air traffic; if so, at what level. (4) Do weather conditions preclude the safe operation of westerly take offs from runway 25; if so,. what weather conditions. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) When westerly winds exceed 20 knots the vast majority of aircraft departing from the Airport will take off from runway 25. In addition, take-offs on runway 25 may also occur when the downwind on the runway is 5 knots or less and the forecast hourly movement rates, for a minimum of 2 hours, do not exceed a maximum of 26 departures (with arrivals on runways 34L and 34R) and/or total movements do not exceed 54. (2) There are no set periods of the day that easterly take offs are programmed. (3) Yes. See response to (1). (4) Yes. When the crosswind component on the runway exceeds 20 knots and/or the downwind component exceeds 5 knots. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: Fourth Runway (Question No. 2355) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 October 1997: (1) Has he or his Department received representations from (a) Qantas or (b) Ansett Airlines advocating the construction of a fourth runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (KSA); if so, what. (2) Will the Government construct a second Sydney airport instead of a fourth runway at KSA. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) Yes. Employment of Foreign Nurses (Question No. 2356) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 20 October 1997: (1) Has he given permission to the WA Health Department to employ 480 foreign nurses in Western Australian hospitals; if so, did his Department consult with the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to discuss the skill shortage; if so; what are the details. (2) Did he ask his Department to consult with community representatives, hospitals, nurses and appropriate unions about possible alternatives to his plan to import foreign nurses. (3) Before approving the importation of foreign nurses, was consideration given to (a) establishing programs to attract Australians back to the nursing profession, (b) setting up special or fast-track training programs for unemployed Australians with the right potential, who want a career in nursing and (c) tying the number of overseas nurses to a pro-rata scheme which ensured qualified Australians were given priority and unemployed Australians with the right potential were provided training opportunities. (4) Were agreements entered into between the Commonwealth and WA Governments before the foreign nurses plan was approved; if so, what. (5) Has he held discussions with Victorian authorities regarding a similar proposal; if so, what agreements will the Commonwealth require before approving a plan. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A Labour Agreement was concluded between the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA), the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETYA) and the Health Department of WA on 20 October 1997 to recruit 580 nurses over the next three years. The Labour Agreement provides for the issuance of 520 temporary visas and 60 permanent visas. The Health Department of WA has identified a critical shortage of qualified and experienced in midwifery, mental health, accident and emergency, operating room and critical care nursing in rural and remote areas. The shortage is a result of both a difficulty of retention of nurses and demand in growth areas (for example, the new Joondalup health campus is expected to recruit up to 400 nurses over the next 12 months). The Health Department of WA has encountered significant difficulties in recruiting sufficient numbers of suitably qualified nurses within Australia. The submission from the Health Department of WA seeking a Labour Agreement included evidence of recent labour market testing for nurses in WA and outlined employment and training strategies to address factor identified as contributing to the shortage. The Labour Agreement provides for a marketing strategy to attract and retain nurses, employment and training (including retraining) opportunities to nurses (including recent graduates), on-going recruitment campaigns, a suite of employment and training strategies. Labour Agreements are also subject to formal monitoring requirements and DEETY A will monitor labour market developments. (2 The recruitment of specialist overseas trained nurses is a short-term strategy to address the acute shortage of nurses in WA. The Health Department of WA has advised that peak nursing groups, public and private hospitals and nursing homes and appropriate unions have collaborated on a number of medium to long-term strategies to improve the supply of the nursing workforce in WA. (3) The Health Department of WA advises that the initiatives formally encompassed in the Labour Agreement were considered prior to the conclusion of the Agreement. Their specific advice is: (a) Yes. The Health Department of WA is pursuing a number of initiatives including reregistration programs conducted through the health services; distance learning re-registration packages for rural nurses; and marketing nursing as a worthy profession to nurses who are currently registered but not working. (b) Yes. The Health Department of WA, in conjunction with Universities and T AFE Colleges, is pursuing a number of strategies including the setting up of alternative training programs. (c) Yes. Under the Labour Agreement, participating health services must give priority to Australian qualified nurses. The Health Department of WA, in conjunction with the Universities and T AFE Colleges, will continue to market nursing as a career choice. (4) No. The Labour Agreement was concluded on 20 October 1997 following an extended period of consultation between DIMA, DEETYA and the nurses Health Department of WA. (5) Informal discussions were held with Victorian authorities in respect of a similar shortage of specialist nurses, however, a Labour Agreement did not eventuate. Normal temporary residence sponsorship arrangements would be utilised where necessary. Such sponsorships require the support of the State Health authorities. Centrelink Launch (Question No. 2372) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 20 October 1997: (1) Were Members and Senators approached by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister to gauge their interest in local office launches of Centrelink following the Prime Minister's launch of Centrelink on 24 September 1997; if so, which Members and Senators were approached. (2) Did the original launch date coincide with a sitting of Parliament; if so, were the dates for the opening of Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency offices altered to suit the convenience of Liberal and National Party Members of Parliament; if so, were Labor Members of Parliament approached by the Parliamentary Secretary and offered the same courtesy. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) All regional Centrelink offices were invited to conduct local functions to either coincide with the Prime Minister's launch on 24 September or subsequently in association with Government Members and Senators on mutually convenient dates. (2) Yes. The dates for local launches of Centrelink offices were arranged on dates mutually convenient to these offices and 'the Members and Senators involved. Special Education Programs: Teachers (Question No. 2411) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 23 October 1997: (1) How many teachers were employed in the delivery of the (a) Special Intervention Program (SIP) in 1995-96 and (b) Training for Employment Program (TEP) in 1996-97. (2) Are arrangements in place or planned for teachers of the SIP to remain employed after the program expires; if so, what are the details. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (b) This information is not collected by the Commonwealth. A number of different training providers are contracted by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETYA) including T AFE institutions, community-based and private training agencies and industry bodies. These providers in turn employ teachers as required on full time, part time and sessional bases. In addition, individual places may be purchased by DEETY A, for clients on, for example, established TAFE courses where a teacher is already employed. (2) Arrangements for the provision of training to unemployed job seekers will change when the employment services market is introduced in May 1998. Under the new arrangements, rather than using places on standard courses purchased by the Commonwealth, providers will be able to use their funds to obtain appropriate assistance for individual NA Operator Charterer tination NA 1996 Air China China All Nippon Air- All Nippon AirJapan ways ways World Tours job seekers. The extent to which this will involve the purchase of courses from training organisations and therefore the employment of teachers is not known. Charter Operations (Question No. 2416) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 23 October 1997: What are the details in relation to each application to operate a program of charters into or out of Australia during 1996 and 1997, including (a) the name of the operator, (b) the name of the charterer, (c) the country of (i) origin or (ii) destination, (d) the points of arrival or destination in other countries, (e) the points of arrival or destination in Australia, (f) the number of flights, (g) the type of aircraft used, (h) the number of passengers expected to be carried, (i) the amount of freight expected to be carried and (j) whether the charter was approved; if not, why was approval denied. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Details of passenger and freight charter programs operated in 1996 and 1997 are contained in the attached tables. These tables provide information on charter applications which cover four or more flights. During this period no formal application which was in accordance with the Department's information requirements was denied approval. No information is provided on the amount of freight carried on charter flights as the Department of Transport and Regional Development does not tabulate this information.

Attachment A Criteria for Establishing a Customer Service Centre A number of factors are taken into account when evaluating whether. to open a customer service centre in a new area. These can be summarised as follows: The volume of services claimed by residents in the immediate area and, where appropriate, the catchment area that the proposed customer service centre would serve, and the nature and level of the different types of billing by doctors in those areas. The likely impact of a cash payment facility on the availability of direct billing. The proximity of the proposed customer service centre to other customer service centres and the impact that it might have on the workloads of other customer service centres. Transport arrangements in the area. The minimum staffing of an office required to be able to satisfy the security needs of an office. The minimum cash service workload required to maintain the minimum staffing requirements, ie 150 cash services per day. Costs to the HIC of paying claims in cash compared with other forms of payment. Pressure on the HIC for continued improvements in efficiency. The costs of establishing and maintaining the centre and the overall financial position of the HIC in being able to expand its payments outlets. The competing claims of other locations for a customer service centre and the priority to be given these claims. Notes on Consideration of Criteria The weight given to each of these criteria will be different depending on whether we are talking about a proposed customer service centre in a metropolitan/suburban setting or in a country location. For example, transport arrangements in an area are more likely to determine where to locate an office within a suburban sprawl than assist in establishing the need for a customer service centre. The proximity or distance from a centre only has validity as a criterion where the economic and service viability of a centre is otherwise sustainable. The primary data to assess the need for a centre is the pattern of services billed from a particular area. DirectÂ· billing has tered in its popularity and growth. This is the form of billing that best achieves the Government's access objectives for the Medicare program. It decreases the need for cash and cheque services and renders analysis of customer service centre needs on the basis of the size of the population somewhat meaningless. For example, a small population with a low level of direct billing to demonstrate a greater need for a cash reimbursement facility than a large population with a high level of direct billing. If the HIC is operating a new centre it needs to ensure that there will be a sufficient cash service workload to keep the staff fully employed. For security reasons there needs to be a minimum of two persons on the prymises at all times. Thus the minimum staffing of a centre is two (2) full time and (1) one part-time person. To sustain this level of staffing requires a minimum of 150 cash services per day. This is only the first element in the analysis of whether to open a customer service centre. The HIC has to have overall regard for its approved level of funding and the overall impact that added cash services would have on its financial position. Because of the differential costs of processing direct bill, cash or cheque claims, if a customer service centre cannot sustain the minimum cash service load or cause a shift in the mix of services away from direct billing, then the financial impact to the HIC is greater than the costs of merely establishing and maintaining the customer service centre. At the end of the exercise, there is the need, as well, to look at the competing interests of other localities and to decide priorities. Gun Buyback Scheme (Question No. 2456) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 30 October 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the surrender of 5000 Owen gun magazines in Queensland under the gun buyback scheme by Mr M. Warwick, a Victorian gun dealer, in return for $300 000. (2) If so, did Mr Warwick purchase the magazines from his Department through Aussales; if so, was Mr Warwick sold 68 000 magazines; if not, how many. (3) Was there a requirement placed on Mr Warwick that the weaponry was only to be resold overseas and not on the Australian market. (4) Were the magazines classed as scrap by his never fal- Department at the time of sale. (5) Were the magazines sold to Mr Warwick for $0.06 each; if not, what was the sale price. (6) Was other surplus Defence weaponry or equipment sold to Mr Warwick; if so, what. (7) Have other Owen gun magazines been sold by Aussales in the last two years; if so, (a) to whom, (b) what was the unit price and (c) how may be better able many were sold. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Questions about individual transactions under the gun buyback scheme should be directed to the of the centre Attorney-General's department. (2) Prior to 1992, the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) disposed of stock no longer required by Defence. Questions about individual disposals by DAS before that time should be directed to the Department of Finance and Administration. I am advised that no Owen guns or magazines have been disposed of by sale since 1992. (3) (4) and (5) These questions should be redirected to the Department of Finance and Administration. (6) Materiel Management Agency (MMA) records reflect that Mr Warwick was sold only one 4.2 Inch Towed Mortar (rendered innocuous), serial No. 4684 on 7 September 1994. Any further details regarding sales should be redirected to the Department of Finance and Administration. (7) In 1992 all Army weapon sale programs were taken over and managed through the Department of Defence (MMA). No Owen guns or magazines have been disposed of by sale since 1992. Australian Customs: Heroin Seizures (Question No. 2459) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 30 October 1997: (1) Has the Australian Customs Service (ACS) seized a larger than usual amount of heroin in 1997: if so, does this indicate a higher level of performance on behalf of the ACS or an increased level of heroin production internationally leading to (a) an increased quantity of heroin coming into the country, (b) increased availability of the drug on the street and (c) increased purity. (2) Is he able to say whether the increase in illegal heroin importation into Australia is driven by an increased demand for the drug in this country and is part of an international trend of increased demand for heroin. (3) Has his attention been drawn to the 1995-96 Australian Illicit Drug Report published by the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence which states that only 10 per cent of heroin entering Australia is being seized. (4) Has his attention been drawn to comments by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr M. Palmer, that the ACS only seizes 10 per cent of the 2000 to 3000kg of heroin imported into Australia each year. (5) Has his attention also been drawn to comments by the most senior police officer with the  Manager of Operations, that only 10 per cent or less of the total amount of heroin coming into the country is being detected. (6) If so, is he able to say whet,her the amount of heroin detected and seized by the ACS over the past 12 months (a) still represents only 10 per cent of the total amount of heroin imported into the country or (b) represents a (i) greater or (ii) lesser percentage of the overall amount of heroin coming into the country; if so, what percentage. Mr Truss-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Australian Customs Service seized 239kg of heroin up to '30 November 1997, compared with 97.7kg over the whole of 1996. The Minister is strongly of the belief that the increase is the outcome of improvements in the Australian Customs service. However, it is impossible to quantify this improvement or to attribute all increases in seizures to increases in performance. (2) No. (3) Yes, my attention has been drawn to the Australian lllicit Drug Report 1995-96 which states that only 10 per cent of heroin entering Australia is seized. (4) Yes, my attention has been drawn to the comments of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr M Palmer, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Monday 27 October 1997. (5) Yes, my attention has been drawn to the  Operations, National Crime Authority, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday 27 October 1997. (6) I am unable to estimate the total amount of heroin imported into Australia and I am therefore unable to comment on the reliability of the estimate the in the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence Report, nor on the comments of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or the General Manager Operations, National Crime Authority. Although various attempts have been made, it is not possible to estimate with any accuracy the volume of heroin entering Australia. Family Reunion Visas: Restrictions (Question No. 2460) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice on 30 October 1997: (1) Did he say in the House on 22 October 1997 that the Government has not in any way used capping measures or restricted growth in the Family Reunion category of visas. ' (2) Has his attention been drawn to a statement from an Australian embassy official that the imposition of visa caps and priority processing by the Government has resulted in further delays in processing of Concessional Family applications. (3) Are capping measures being used; if not, have de facto quotas been put in place in the Family reunion category for (a) Concessional Family and (b) Dependent Family applications. (4) Are spouses of Australian. citizens and residents being delayed for more than a year from entering Australia under this process. (5) Has the number of persons entering under the Concessional Family category been reduced by increases in the points pass mark. (6) Have immigration numbers been reduced at the expense of applicants seeking family reunion. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My comment that ""the Government has not in any way used capping measures or restricted growth in that category"" followed on from an interjection from the Member for CalweII who said: People cannot bring their spouses to Australia. That is the result. That is your idea of balance. and from my comment that: ..... there has been a significant reduction in the spouse and fiance category in particular. My comment might have been misconstrued given that the Spouse and Fiance categories are separate subclasses of the Migration Program. The facts are that: - the Government cannot use capping measures in the Spouse category. The planning level for spouses which I announced in May 1997 was consistent with the estimated demand in that category and has, in fact, since been adjusted downwards to reflect a lower than expected uptake of the place- available. - the Government has introduced a package of measures to address concerns about the integrity of the spouse/fiance caseload including: * enhanced bona fides testing; * the introduction of Ii two year probationary visa regime for off-shore cases; * the one year cohabitation requirement for de facto spouses; and * limitations on serial sponsorship. - these measures are designed to ensure that only genuine applicants are able to access Australia's migration arrangements. - the Government did cap and queue the Fiance category in 1996-97, using the power in section 85 of the Migration Act. Eligible persons who were queued will have obtained a visa in 1997-98. The Fiance category is not capped at the present time. Depending on levels of demand and whether additional Program places become available within the Family Stream, it may be necessary to cap the Fiance category later in the program year. (2) I am not aware of the statement to which the Honourable Member refers. The former Concessional Family category has been re-named the Skilled-Australian Linked category and is now grouped in the Skilled Stream of the Migration Program reflecting the fact that applicants are points tested and that the category is now genuinely a skilled category. It allows for Australian citizens or residents to sponsor their brothers sisters, nephews, nieces, non-dependent children or working aged parents subject to their meeting a points test which takes into account their skills, qualifications, English language proficiency and age. The Prioritisation Direction that I have tabled in the House does not apply to this category. The category is not currently capped for 1997-98 and I expect that the planning level of 8,000 will be reached towards the end of the Program year. (3) There are several aspects to this question. As previously stated, the category formerly known as Concessional Family is now known (from 1 July 1997) as the Skilled-Australian Linked (SAL) category and is part of the Skilled Stream. This reflects the fact that the category is points tested and that the primary focus of the selection criteria is on the applicant's employability; - the SAL category is not capped at present though it is possible that it may' be capped towards the end .of the program year; - the 1997-98 planning level for the SAL category is 8,000 places. This category has been at roughly similar levels since 1992-93. There are no quotas as such in management of the Migration Program. The process is as follows: - the Government determines the overall size and composition of the Migration Program in the Budget context; - the Program is announced with planning levels against different categories; - planning levels can be and are adjusted during the course of the program year to reflect shifts in demand; . - where it becomes apparent that the level of visa grants may exceed the planning level in a particular category, the Minister may then (using the provisions of section 85 of the Migration Act) cap the category to ensure that program outcomes are consistent with the Government's decisions on the program; - section 87 of the Migration Act exempts spouses and dependent children from capping. This approach to migration program management is logical and transparent albeit somewhat inflexible. The capping powers in the Act were put in place by the Labor Government for the purpose of ensuring that the government of the day had appropriate mechanisms to manage the Migration Program. It is assumed that in referring to ""Dependent Family applications"", the Honourable Member is referring to the current Family Stream which includes: "" spouses - fiances - dependent children - parents - preferential family relatives - interdependents Of the above categories, only one (parents) is currently capped. The caps on the off-shore and onshore parent categories were reached in September and October respectively. Some other categories in the Family Stream (ie Fiance, Preferential Family relatives and Interdependents) may be capped later in the program year depending on levels of demand. (4) Capping provisions do not affect processing time frames for spouse applications as there is no power under the Migration Act to cap visa grants in the spouse subclass. Processing times vary from case to case and from office to office. There are number of factors which contribute to this, includhave ing processing office workloads, case specific issues which arise during processing, bona fides concerns and the priority group to which a case is assigned. Under the priority processing arrangements which I have introduced to better manage the Family Stream, applications in a higher priority group are processed ahead of lower priority cases, regardless of the date of application. Some spouse applications take longer than 12 months to finalise. However, the majority of cases are completed in a shorter time frame. For the period April to September 1997, processing times for visa grants in the off-shore spouse category were: - 25% of spouse visas granted within 12 weeks of lodgement - 50% of spouse visas granted within 22 weeks of lodgement - 75% of spouse visas granted within 37 weeks of lodgement (5) The increase in the pass mark in subclass 105, Skilled-Australian Linked, (formerly Concessional Family), on 1 November 1996 has not lead to any decrease in the number of persons entering Australia under this category for 1997-98. In 1996-97 some 7,350 people were visaed under the Concessional Family category. The 1997-98 planning level for the new Skilled-Australian Linked class, (which replaced the Concessional Family - la-s - n 1 July 1997), is 8,000 places. Current mdicatIOns are that these places will all be take- duri-g the c-urse of the program year, despIte the Increase m the pass mark necessitating higher skill and English language standards than previously applied to this subclass. (6) The Government has reduced the overall size of the Migration Program and has shifted the balance of the Program to the Skilled Stream. This reflects the Government's view that the program it inherited in March 1996 had been allowed to' get out of balance and out of control and that as a consequence, the general community's long standing support for planned migration was being diminished: - the Family Stream in 1995-96 grew to 69% of the overall program compared to 58% in 199495; - in addition to the Family Stream being run on a demand driven basis, there was abundant evidence that there was considerable abuse of Australia's migration provisions and that this was running largely unchecked. The Government has taken appropriate measures to tighten up the Family Stream and to give more emphasis to the Skilled Stream which has clear a economic benefits for Australia. These measures been necessary to restore community confidence that the Migration Program is being run in the national interest balancing the economic, social and international obligations and interests of the Migration Program. Notwithstanding this shift in emphasis, the Government's commitment to the Family Stream remains very substantial. In 1997-98, the planned Family Stream still represents around 47 % of the overall program of 68,000 places. In addition, many Australian citizens and residents will sponsor relatives under the SAL category of the Skilled Stream which has a planning level of 8,000 places. These changes have been made openly, announced publicly and have been preceded by widespread consultation with all stakeholders in the Australian community. Private Health Insurance: Complaints (Question No. 2465) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 17 November 1997: (1) Is it a fact that the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commission examined more than 1200 complaints in 1995-96, most concerning the two largest private health funds, MBF and Medibank Private. (2) Did the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner recommend that the 48 private health funds active in Australia should offer individual policy documents making their medical cover clear; if so, does he support the recommendation; if he does not support the recommendation, why not. (3) Is the number of complaints received by the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commission a concern; if not, why not. (4) Are some private health funds being less than open about the level of policy coverage offered to members; if so, can he say why. (5) What steps has he taken to make private health funds more open and accountable to their members.",81
64,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,I DII,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Annual Report of the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner for 1996-97 notes that she received 1211 complaints in that year. As would be expected from their market share, the highest number of complaints concerned Medibank Private (29%) and MBF (16%). (2) Yes. Yes, while noting that provision of information does add to costs. (3) It would be foolish to expect that there would not be complaints in an industry of this kind. I have no basis to believe that the overall level of complaints are excessive. Of course any complaints are of concern in themselves and should be dealt with appropriately. (4) Some health funds could, no doubt, improve their communication with members. Most fund members rely on health fund brochures for information about health fund products. It is a condition health fund registration that funds must include all tables of benefits or products in a single brochure on a State by State basis. (5) It is a condition of health fund registration that funds notify their members of any rule changes that may have a detrimental effect on members. (Question No. 2477) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 17 November 1997: (1) Is he responsible under the War Precautions Act Repeal Act 1920 for protecting the use of the word ""ANZAC"". (2) Has he authorised any companies to exploit the name ""ANZAC"" for commercial purposes; if so, (a) which companies and (b) for what purposes. (3) What criteria apply to applications to use the name ""ANZAC"" for commercial purposes. (4) What consultations occur with ex-service organisations about the applications referred to in part (3). Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No permission has been given to any company to ""exploit"" the word ""ANZAC"" for commercial purposes. However, permission has been given for the word ""ANZAC"" to be used in connection with certain biscuit products that are made to a traditional ""ANZAC biscuit"" recipe, provided that the company does not advertise or otherwise exploit the product by evoking ANZAC traditions or military symbols. Following representations from the NSW Branch of the Returned & Services League of Australia, permission was also given for a Rugby League test match between Australia and New Zealand to be called the ANZAC Day Test (because it was played on ANZAC Day) and for advertising and marketing of souvenir products to bear that title. (3) I have maintained the policy of successive Ministers that the word ""ANZAC"" may be approved for commercial use if it is associated with the address of the business (e.g. the business is located on a street that includes ""ANZAC"" in its name), or in association with ANZAC biscuit products, or in relation to an event occurring on ANZAC Day. In relation to the first two matters the approval is always conditional on the grantee observing a requirement that there be no exploitation of the word ""ANZAC"" in the use of any symbols or traditions associated with ANZAC or things of a military of nature in any advertising, letterhead etc. (4) The RSL is normally consulted on applications when it is considered that granting approval would be of concern to veterans. It has in the past given its general agreement for use of the word ""ANZAC"" in relation to ANZAC biscuit products. Sydney Airport Community Forum ""ANZAC"" (SACF) (Question No. 2517) Mr Mossfield asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 18 November 1997: (1) Is participation in the Sydney Airport Community Forum (SACF) limited to community representatives and members of parliament from the inner areas of the City of Sydney. (2) Does the SACF provide advice to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development on the abatement of aircraft noise and related environmental problems at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and a second major airport for Sydney. (3) Is it a fact that a second airport will affect residents of Western Sydney. (4) Will he ensure that Western Sydney residents are represented on the SACF; if not, what consultative process will he introduce to enable Western Sydney residents to be treated as equitably as inner city residents.",86
65,Mr HOWARD,I DII,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The membership of the Sydney Airport Community Forum (SACF) is drawn from F\1deral and State electorates, local councils and the community in those areas most affected by aircraft noise. It also includes representation from industry. (2) The Government established SACF intending that it be the principal channel for expression of community views on the operation of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. (3) The environmental implications of a second Sydney airport on the Badgerys Creek site will be outlined in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. (4) SACF is not designed to be the community forum for Western Sydney residents to express their views on the development of a second airport for Sydney. Western Sydney residents will have ample opportunity to express their views on the proposed development. An extensive community consultation program will be undertaken during exhibition of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. All comments received from the community during the exhibition period will be taken into account in the preparation of the Final Environmental Impact Statement. No decision on the development of the second Sydney airport will be taken until the Environmental Impact Statement process has been completed. Year (at 30 June) 1997 1996 1995 1994 (I) Excludes day hospital facilities Aged Care Hostels (Question No. 2545) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 20 November 1997: Has the period that an aged care hostel resident can be absent from the hostel within a financial year been changed; if so, (a) what change has been made and (b) has it been implemented retrospectively. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The number of days in a financial year for which an aged care hostel resident can be absent on social leave, while still being eligible for a residential care subsidy, was increased from 28 to 52 when the Aged Care Act commenced on 1 October 1997. Absences of less than five days do now count towards this 52 day provision. Unlimited absence on hospital leave is still available. The changes mean the same rules now apply to nursing home and hostel residents. They were not implemented retrospectively. . Public Hospitals: Queensland (Question No. 2562) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 26 November 1997: How many beds were available in Queensland public hospitals on 1 May (a) 1997, (b) 1996, (c) 1995 and (d) 1994.",87
66,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,I DII,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Available beds numbers in recognised public hospitals under the Medicare Agreements are supplied .to the Commonwealth by the State and Territory health authorities. The following table shows bed numbers supplied by the Queensland Department of Health: Available recognised public hospital beds(l) in Queensland Not available 9914 9769 9958 Number of beds is, of course, not an appropriate appropriate, indicators include total bed days in Year (at 30 June) 1997 1996 1995 1994 measure of access to public hospital care.
